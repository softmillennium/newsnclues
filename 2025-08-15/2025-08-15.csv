            The Pentagon clarified on Thursday that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth thinks women should have the right to vote, despite his sharing of CNN reporting which featured religious leaders he supports saying they would back the repealing of the 19th Amendment.
    


            “Of course, the secretary thinks that women should have the right to vote,” Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson told reporters on Thursday.
    


            Hegseth reposted video of a CNN segment with Douglas Wilson, a self-described Christian nationalist pastor, who supports repealing the 19th Amendment, which gives women the right to vote. Wilson's fellow pastors told CNN's Pamela Brown they also support the idea, saying votes should be made as households and that the men of the household would be the ones actually casting the vote.
    


            “I would support that,” Jared Longshore, executive pastor of Christ Church, told CNN of repealing the 19th Amendment. “And I'd support it on the basis that the atomization that comes from our current system is not good for humans.”
    


            Hegseth shared the video on social media with the message, “All of Christ for All of Life.”
    


            “The secretary is a proud member of a church that is affiliated with the congregation of reformed evangelical churches, which was founded by Pastor Doug Wilson,” Kingsley Wilson told reporters on Thursday. “The secretary very much appreciates many of Mr. Wilson's writings and teachings.”
    


            Hegseth — a member of a church in Tennessee which is part of Wilson's Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches — is the most high-profile of Wilson's followers in the Trump administration. Among the assertions in the governing documents for the CREC is that is “neither lawful nor honorable for women to be mustered for combat service,” and that is “the duty of men—not women—to protect their homelands and nations.”
    


            While Hegseth has made multiple comments in the past saying women should not serve in combat roles in the military, he has since backtracked on those claims, saying he respects all women who serve and is primarily concerned with standards.
    


            Hegseth has also begun holding Christian prayer services at the Pentagon, the first of which featured his pastor from Tennessee from the Pilgrim Hill Reformed Fellowship, Brooks Potteiger.
    


            In his opening prayer at the service, Potteiger thanked God for President Donald Trump and other leaders who have been “sovereignly appointed,” and “the way that you have used him to bring stability and moral clarity to our lands.”
    


            Pastor Douglas Wilson told CNN it was “very encouraging” to see Hegseth own “what he believes,” including purging diversity, equity and inclusion programs and so-called “woke” policies from the Defense Department.
    


            “It's not organizationally tied to us, but it's the kind of thing we love to see,” he told CNN of Hegseth's prayer services.
    


            Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon press secretary, declined to say on Thursday what other specific ideas in the video — which included Douglas Wilson's desire to make the United States “a Christian nation,” his support for making gay sex a crime, and his doubling down on claims that there was “genuine affection” between slaves and their owners — Hegseth did or did not support.
    


            “He (Hegseth) appreciates many of (Wilson's) writings and teachings. I'm not going to litigate every single aspect of what he may or may not believe in a certain video,” Wilson told reporters.

            Hot Stocks 





            Wednesday evening on the MAGA cable channel OAN, as Defense Department spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson gushed to host Matt Gaetz about an alleged year-over-year increase in female military recruits, four images of women soldiers in combat fatigues were displayed on-screen.
    


            All four images were AI fakes.
    


            The images appear to have been generated using Elon Musk's Grok﻿, as small watermarks in the bottom corners indicate.
    


            “These numbers are fantastic,” Wilson told Gaetz as the AI images scrolled on-screen. “Under the previous administration, we had about 16,000 female recruits last year; now we've got upwards of 24,000,” she continued. “It is a testament to Secretary Hegseth and President Trump's leadership.” (The Pentagon has not officially released detailed data on female recruitment, but it told Fox News those same figures.)
    


            A DOD spokesperson said the images were not provided by them, so CNN on Thursday asked OAN whether its staff generated the photos and if the network has any policy regarding AI-generated content.
    


            “The images violated company policies, which have been re-enforced with all staff,” an OAN spokesperson told CNN. “An on-air correction has been put in place. Management has taken additional actions to ensure the issue is appropriately addressed.”
    


            During Thursday evening's broadcast, Gaetz apologized for using the AI-generated images.
    


            “We made a mistake,” Gaetz said. “We used AI-generated images of female service members as part of our B-roll package, and we shouldn't have. The DOD didn't give us these images; Grok did. And we'll use better judgment going forward.”
    


            OAN, short for One America News, launched in 2013, and during Trump's first administration, it quickly morphed into a conspiracy-heavy, MAGA-boosting outlet.
    


            The little-watched cable channel has become best-known for promoting Trump's 2020 election lies, and it has settled multiple defamation lawsuits resulting from those on-air claims. Last year, the network settled a lawsuit from voting technology company Smartmatic alleging the channel boosted the election lies in order to “increase viewership and revenue.”
    


            The network also settled a defamation suit from a Dominion Voting Systems executive, but it still faces a separate defamation lawsuit from the company.
    


            OAN's viewership and revenue have dwindled since DirecTV dropped it in 2022. However, earlier this year, it received a PR boost when Kari Lake, Trump's pick to run a hollowed-out Voice of America, claimed that OAN will provide “newsfeed services” to VOA and other US-funded international broadcasters.
    


This story has been updated with comments from OAN and Gaetz.

By Timofey Bordachev, Program Director of the Valdai Club

The meeting between the presidents of Russia and the United States in Alaska is not an end point, but the beginning of a long journey. It will not resolve the turbulence that has gripped humanity – but it matters to everyone.

In international politics, there have been few moments when meetings between the leaders of major powers have decided questions of universal importance. This is partly because situations requiring attention at such a level are rare. We are living through one now: since the start of Russia's military operation against Ukraine, Washington has declared its aim to be the “strategic defeat” of Russia, while Moscow has challenged the West's monopoly over world affairs.

Another reason is practical. Leaders of the world's most powerful states do not waste time on problems that can be solved by subordinates. And history shows that even when top-level meetings do occur, they rarely change the overall course of international politics.

It is no surprise, then, that the Alaska meeting has been compared to famous encounters from the past – notably the 1807 meeting between the Russian and French emperors on a raft in the Neman River. That summit did not prevent Napoleon from attacking Russia five years later – an act that ultimately brought about his own downfall.

Later, at the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Russia was the only power represented by its ruler on a regular basis. Tsar Alexander I insisted on presenting his personal vision for Europe's political structure. It failed to win over the other great powers, who, as Henry Kissinger once noted, preferred to discuss interests rather than ideals.

History is full of high-level talks that preceded war rather than preventing it. European monarchs would meet, fail to agree, and then march their armies. Once the fighting ended, their envoys would sit down to negotiate. Everyone understood that “eternal peace” was usually just a pause before the next conflict.

The 2021 Geneva summit between Russia and the US may well be remembered in this way – as a meeting that took place on the eve of confrontation. Both sides left convinced their disputes could not be resolved at the time. In its aftermath, Kiev was armed, sanctions were readied, and Moscow accelerated military-technical preparations.

Russia's own history offers parallels. The most famous “summit” of ancient Rus was the 971 meeting between Prince Svyatoslav and Byzantine Emperor John Tzimiskes, following a peace treaty. According to historian Nikolay Karamzin, they “parted as friends” – but that did not stop the Byzantines from unleashing the Pechenegs against Svyatoslav on his journey home.

In Asia, traditions were different. The status of Chinese and Japanese emperors did not permit meetings with equals; such encounters were legally and culturally impossible.

When the modern European “world order” was created – most famously in the 1648 Peace of Westphalia – it was not through grand encounters of rulers but through years of negotiations among hundreds of envoys. By then, after 30 years of war, all sides were too exhausted to continue fighting. That exhaustion made it possible to agree on a comprehensive set of rules for relations between states.

Seen in this historical light, top-level summits are exceedingly rare, and those that produce fundamental change are rarer still. The tradition of two leaders speaking on behalf of the entire global system is a product of the Cold War, when Moscow and Washington alone had the ability to destroy or save the world.

Even if Roman and Chinese emperors had met in the third century, it would not have transformed the fate of the world. The great empires of antiquity could not conquer the planet in a single war with each other. Russia – as the USSR before it – and the United States can. In the last three years, they have often stood on the brink of a path from which there would be no return. This is why Alaska matters, even if it does not yield a breakthrough. 

Summits of this kind are a creation of the nuclear age. They cannot be treated as just another bilateral meeting between important states. The very fact of direct negotiations is a measure of how close or far we are from catastrophe.

The United States will arrive at the summit as the leader of a Western bloc whose members – even nuclear powers such as Britain and France – defer to Washington on strategic questions. Russia, for its part, will be watched closely by what is often called the “global majority”: dozens of states across Asia, Africa, and Latin America that resent Western dominance but cannot overturn it alone. These countries know that US mediation in local conflicts will not change the fact that the structure of that dominance remains unjust.

Could Alaska lay the foundation for a new international order? Probably not. The very concept of a fixed “order” is fading. Any order requires an enforcing power – and none exists today. The world is moving toward greater fluidity, to the frustration of those who crave neat arrangements and predictable futures.

Even if a new balance of power emerges, it will not come from one meeting. The wartime summits of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin are not a fair comparison. Those were preceded by the most destructive battles in human history.

Fortunately, we are not in that situation now. The likely outcome in Alaska is the start of a long and difficult process, rather than an immediate settlement. But it is still of fundamental importance. In today's world, only two states possess vast nuclear arsenals capable of ending human civilization.

This alone means that the leaders of Russia and the United States have no more important duty than to speak directly to one another – especially when they are, for now, the only invincible powers at the edge of the world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Trump departs for Alaska to meet Putin: Live updates","https://www.rt.com/news/622916-putin-trump-alaska-summit-live/","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 09:20:00 GMT","

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, are set to hold high-stakes talks on resolving the Ukraine conflict in Anchorage, Alaska.

The negotiations at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson on Friday, scheduled to begin at around 20:00 GMT, will focus on finding a settlement to the Ukraine conflict. According to Moscow, global “peace and security” as well as “further development of bilateral cooperation” in the economy and trade will also be on the agenda.

In addition to Putin, the Russian delegation includes Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrey Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov, and presidential economic envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who has been a key figure in the Ukraine settlement process.

The US has yet to confirm its delegation, although apart from Trump, it is expected to include Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy to Ukraine and the Middle East Steve Witkoff, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.

Ahead of the talks, Moscow said it has a “clear and well-defined” stance as well as arguments to present to the US side. Trump has described the summit as a “feel-out meeting,” assessing that it has a 25% chance of failing.

The US president has suggested that the talks could focus on a land swap deal between Russia and Ukraine. Moscow maintains it will not give up Crimea, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye regions, which joined the country in public referendums in 2014 and 2022.

15 August 2025

Putin's Tu-214 has entered US airspace, data from FlightRadar24 shows, and is expected to land in Anchorage in about an hour. Nearly 150,000 people are reportedly tracking the flight online.



The Putin-Trump summit in Alaska “already inspires hope,” the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, has said. The Christian leader, who held a prayer service ahead of the bilateral talks, said they could “bring hope and peace to all of humanity,” foster stronger Russia-US ties, and “allow the world to breathe a sigh of relief.” 

Everything suggests the two leaders are ready to develop relations and work for “the well-being of the entire human race and human civilization as a whole,” Kirill said.



The makeup of Russia's delegation at the Putin-Trump summit suggests the talks will go far beyond the Ukraine conflict, according to Russian foreign policy expert Alexander Bobrov. He noted that the people on Moscow's team are “not random officials” but seasoned diplomats such as Presidential aide Yury Ushakov who previously served as Russia's ambassador to Washington. Bobrov suggested that the two sides could end up discussing a wide range of issues, including sanctions relief, returning diplomatic missions, cooperation in the Arctic, rare-earth metals, as well as broader trade, economic ties and arms control.

Aside from the Ukraine conflict and economic ties, the two sides expect to discuss the restoration of bilateral relations as a whole, presidential economic envoy Kirill Dmitriev told reporters ahead of the summit.

Dmitriev, who is officially part of the Russian delegation taking part in the discussions, said he was in “high spirits” in the lead up to the talks.

The Trump-Putin summit could last between six and seven hours, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has told reporters, adding that Moscow expects the meeting to be productive. 

He also stated that the face-to-face meeting between the two presidents will be held with aides present.

Vladimir Putin paid an official visit to Russia's Far Eastern city of Magadan ahead of his trip to Alaska to meet with Trump. The Russian leader met with local representatives and laid flowers at the ‘Heroes of the Alsib' memorial, which commemorates Soviet and US cooperation during World War II.

The monument is dedicated to the Alaska-Siberia air route, which was used to ferry over 8,000 aircraft from the US to the USSR, often in extreme weather. More than 100 pilots lost their lives along the way.

Peskov said that during the four-hour-long flight from the Russian city of Magadan to Anchorage, Putin will carefully study and go over all the issues that are set to be on the agenda of the talks. These include the Ukraine conflict, as well as issues in bilateral Russia-US relations, possible joint economic projects, and other regional and international issues, Peskov said.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has confirmed that Vladimir Putin is scheduled to arrive in Anchorage at exactly 11 аm local time and will be personally greeted when disembarking his plane by President Trump.

Trump says he spoke with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko over the phone on Friday. “Our conversation was a very good one. We discussed many topics, including President Putin's visit to Alaska,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social account, adding that he looks forward to a personal meeting with Lukashenko in the future.

RT's Egor Piskunov and other journalists have arrived at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in preparation for the Trump-Putin summit, which is scheduled to begin at around 20:00 GMT.

By Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs, chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, and research director of the Valdai International Discussion Club.

It has been a long time since a diplomatic event drew as much global attention as Friday's meeting between the Russian and US presidents in Alaska. In terms of its significance for the international balance, it is comparable only to the negotiations on German reunification 35 years ago. That process laid the foundations for political developments in the decades that followed. The Alaska talks could prove a similar milestone – not just for the Ukraine conflict, but for the principles on which a broader settlement between the world's leading powers might be reached.

Ukraine has become the most visible arena for historical shifts that go far beyond its borders. But if the German analogy holds, no one should expect a breakthrough from a single meeting. The marathon of high-level diplomacy in 1990 lasted many months, and the mood then was far less acute and far more optimistic than today.

The dense fog of leaks and speculation surrounding Alaska underlines its importance. Much of this “white noise” comes from two sources: commentators eager to sound informed, and political actors seeking to shape public opinion. In reality, the substantive preparation for the talks appears to have little to do with the propaganda framing. This is why official announcements so often catch outside observers by surprise.

That may be a good sign. In recent decades, especially in Europe, diplomacy has often been accompanied by a steady drip of confidential details to the press – a habit that may serve tactical purposes but rarely produces lasting results. In this case, it is better to wait for the outcome, or the lack of one, without giving in to the temptation to guess what will happen behind closed doors.

There is also a broader backdrop that cannot be ignored: the shifts in the global order catalyzed by the Ukraine crisis, though not caused by it. For years, I have been skeptical of claims that the world is dividing neatly into two opposing camps – “the West” versus “the rest.” Economic interdependence remains too deep for even sharp political and military conflicts to sever ties entirely. Yet contradictions between these blocs are growing, and they are increasingly material rather than ideological.

A key trigger was US President Donald Trump's recent attempt to pressure the largest states of the so-called “global majority” – China, India, Brazil, and South Africa – to fall in line with Washington's instructions. The old liberal order promised universality and some benefits to participants. Now, purely American mercantile interests dominate.

As before, Washington dresses its demands in political justifications – criticizing Brazil and South Africa over their treatment of the opposition, or attacking India and China over their ties with Moscow. But the inconsistencies are obvious. Trump, unlike his predecessors, prefers tariffs to sanctions. Tariffs are an explicitly economic tool, but they are now being wielded for political ends.

The attempt has failed to produce the outcome the White House wanted. The US president is used to allies compromising to preserve their relationship with Washington. BRICS countries, too, have often avoided confrontation for the sake of their own economic interests. But the bluntness of the American push this time forced them to stiffen their positions.

Ukraine, in itself, has little to do with this shift – but it is the issue commanding global political attention. Ahead of the Alaska summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been personally briefing BRICS and other key partners on the preparations. They are taking note, and in many cases expressing support for the process.

Across the Atlantic, consultations are equally intense, though marked by unease and limited trust. Western Europe's anxiety that Trump might “cut a deal” with Putin is telling. The world is still dividing into groups, but while one group is moving towards greater coordination, the other is growing less cohesive.

Even if Alaska produces serious discussions, there is no guarantee it will deliver peace. It may not even be the final meeting. What is troubling is that the public debate remains focused on territorial carve-ups – who gets what, and what is given in exchange. This misses the core issue. The acute phase of the Ukraine crisis was not triggered by a hunger for territorial expansion. It began when Moscow challenged the security order that emerged after the Cold War – an order built on the open-ended enlargement of NATO as the supposed guarantor of European stability.

This is where the German reunification analogy returns. That plan, while it resolved a territorial question, also enshrined the political principles that shaped the post-Cold War system. Those same principles, and the imbalance they created between Moscow and Washington, lay at the root of the 2022 escalation. Borders and territories are only part of the picture. The real question is the basis for peaceful coexistence going forward.

In 1990, a settlement between East and West created the architecture of European security. But the way the Cold War ended – and the failure to give Moscow an equal stake – planted the seeds of today's confrontation. In that sense, the Alaska meeting is an attempt to resolve unfinished business from the past. Without a final settlement of this historic imbalance, it will be impossible to create a stable new system of relations, not just between Russia and the West but globally.

The frequency of Putin's meetings with BRICS leaders shows that Moscow understands this reality. Whether Washington does remains to be seen.

BELGRADE, August 15. /TASS/. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has accused participants in the August 13-14 protest in Novi Sad of attempting to burn people alive inside the office of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), Informer TV reported.

""That night, they tried to burn people alive. Can you imagine what they would do to those inside? They would burn 300 people alive!"" Vucic said. ""Now everyone understands who we are dealing with and that they never wanted peace. All this time, it was only about violence.""

According to Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, 42 police officers — including 26 in Belgrade — were injured during mass riots at rallies across the country, and 37 people were detained. The gravest incidents took place in Novi Sad, where SNS premises at several locations were vandalized. Dacic described the unrest as one of the most violent attacks on police in recent years, with protesters using stones, metal bars, sticks, and fireworks.

During the night of August 13-14, protesters also attacked offices of the ruling SNS and the Socialist Party in several cities, injuring 27 police officers and more than 80 civilians, mostly SNS supporters. The Interior Ministry reported that five government vehicles and 22 pieces of equipment were damaged. Around 100 people also attacked members of the Cobras special detachment in Novi Sad.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Trump police takeover will create ‘immediate, devastating, and irreparable harm' for DC, federal lawsuit says

DC sues Trump administration over ‘hostile takeover' of city police

According to the federal lawsuit filed by the DC government today, the Trump administration has engaged in “a brazen usurpation of the District's authority over its own government”.

The suit says that the president's move to federalise the DC police, and attorney general Pam Bondi's order to install DEA administrator Terry Cole as “emergency police commissioner”, both “exceed the narrow delegation that Congress granted the President in Section 740”.

A reminder, earlier this week the president invoked Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act, which grants him a 30-day period to control the district's local law enforcement if he declares a safety emergency. To get an extension, the president would need Congress's approval.

The president has said that violent crime in DC – which the justice department says experienced a 30-year low in 2024 – is “the worst it's ever been”.

The lawsuit also states that Section 740 only requires that the DC mayor “provide services” of the Metropolitan police department (MPD) to federal government, but “does not permit the President to seize control of MPD. Nor does it authorize the President to direct MPD in the policing of local crime.”

House and Senate Democrats introduced a joint resolution today to terminate Trump's federalization of the DC Metropolitan Police Department.

Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting delegate from the District of Columbia, and representative Robert Garcia of California are leading the effort in the House, while senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland introduced the legislation in the Senate.

The resolution, which has little chance of advancing under the Republican-controlled Congress, says the president “has failed to identify special conditions of an emergency nature that compel the use of the Metropolitan Police Department for Federal purposes in the District of Columbia”.

Under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, a president can order DC's mayor to give him temporary control of the police, but Congress can terminate that authority.

In their resolutions, the lawmakers cite statistics showing that violent crime is at a 30-year low in DC as evidence that there is no emergency to justify the president's actions.

“The only emergency here is a lawless president experiencing a growing public relations emergency because of his close friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and his stubborn refusal to release the Epstein file despite his promise to do so,” said Raskin, the top Democrat on the judiciary committee. 

“Trump was AWOL when the District of Columbia actually needed support from the National Guard to protect it from an insurrectionist mob on January 6,” Van Hollen said.

He called Trump's moves “an abuse of power” and a “raw power grab”. “It is a direct attack on the ability of the people of the District of Columbia to govern their own affairs,” he said.

Greetings from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a cold war-era military installation on the outskirts of Anchorage, Alaska, that will play host to Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin today.

I am among an estimated 700 journalists from all over the world. We were greeted at the Anchorage international airport by the sight of a majestic brown bear slain by Governor Mike Dunleavy and displayed as a trophy in a glass case.

The media gathered downtown at 5.30am local time today and were bused to the air force base under a big sky with picturesque mountains. The airbase is like a small city with housing, children's playgrounds, nondescript three-storey lodgings, a church with stained glass windows and great grassy expanses. The temperature is a crisp 50F.

Earlier, Reuters reported: “The Kremlin press pool was housed in an Alaska Airlines Center, where a semi-open-plan room was subdivided by partitions and some reporters were seen making their own camp-style beds. They were fed for free at a nearby university campus, Russian reporters said.”

Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson was crucial to countering the Soviet Union during the cold war. It continues to play a role today, as planes from the base still intercept Russian aircraft that regularly fly into US airspace. Putin's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, arrived in a sweatshirt with “CCCP” – the Russian letters for USSR – across the front.

Today's meeting could prove a win-win for the two leaders. Putin, an alleged war criminal who had been an international pariah, gets to meet the US president on American soil. Trump, for his part, gets to play global statesman in a massive media spectacle where no one is talking about Jeffrey Epstein (well, almost no one).

Donald Trump was asked earlier what would make his summit with Vladimir Putin a success. He told reporters aboard Air Force One:

I can't tell you that.

I don't know it's there's nothing set in stone. I want certain things. I want to see a ceasefire.

This is not to do with Europe. Europe's not telling me what to do, but they're going to be involved in the process, obviously, as well Zelenskyy, but I want to see a ceasefire rapidly.

I don't know if it's going to be today, but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today. Everyone said it can't be today, but I'm just saying I want the killing to stop.

I'm in this to stop the killing. You know, we're not putting up any money. We're making money. They're buying our weapons, and we're sending them to Nato, and Nato is sending us big, beautiful checks.

But that I don't care about … But what I do care about is they lost last week 7011 people, almost all soldiers; 36 people in a town which got hit by a missile.

Over 7,000 soldiers. It's crazy.

You can watch the clip here.

Donald Trump has told Fox News's Bret Baier that if his meeting with Vladimir Putin doesn't go well today, he would walk.

“We're going for a meeting with President Putin in Alaska. And I think it's going to work out very well, and if it doesn't I'm going to head back home real fast,” Trump said.

Asked by Baier if that means he would walk if it doesn't go well, the president replied: “I would walk, yeah.”

Trump earlier confirmed his threat of “severe” consequences for Russia if it fails to show willingness to seriously talk about the end of war in Ukraine.

He told reporters on Air Force One:

Economically severe. It will be very severe. I'm not doing this for my health, okay, I don't need it. I'd like to focus on our country, but I'm doing this to save a lot of lives. Yeah, very severe.

USAID is concerned that the Trump administration's cancellation of independent aid monitoring contracts for Ukraine has increased the risk of waste, fraud and abuse, according to three US watchdog agencies.

“The termination of third-party monitoring contracts has further limited USAID's ability to oversee programs,” the state department, Pentagon and USAID inspectors general said in a report issued today.

The US Agency for International Development was the main American agency that administered civilian foreign aid for more than 60 years. It is being dismantled by the Trump administration – which claims to be tackling waste, fraud and abuse in federal spending – and is scheduled to be closed on 2 September.

The three inspectors general submit quarterly reports to Congress on their oversight of US civilian support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia's full-scale invasion launched in February 2022.

In January, Donald Trump froze all US foreign assistance programs pending a review of their alignment with his “America first” policies, and ordered the dismantling of USAID, which stopped disbursing funds in July.

As part of this decision, Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” oversaw the termination of 83% of USAID programs, including some that supported Ukraine.

The watchdogs' report said that USAID managed $30.2bn in direct support for the Ukrainian government's budget, and provided a guarantee that secured a $20bn loan for Kyiv.

It said that in the three months ending 31 June, 25 civilian aid programs for Ukraine were terminated, while 29 active programs, five under stop-work orders and four of unknown status were transferred to the state department.

The terminated programs included contracts with third parties that provided independent tracking of USAID funds to ensure that they were spent as intended and that helped “inform both current and future decision-making”, it said.

“USAID said that without independent monitoring, it cannot verify that programs are being implemented in line with award terms, increasing the risk of waste, fraud and abuse,” the report said.

This is especially true in conflict-affected areas “where there is a heightened potential for diversion of funds”, it warned.

A federal judge will hold a hearing today on the lawsuit filed by the DC government – challenging the Trump administration's federal takeover of the DC, including Pam Bondi's move to install the DEA chief Terry Cole as “emergency police commissioner”. Judge Ana Reyes will hold today's hearing at 2pm ET.

In response to the lawsuit, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said the following in a statement to the Guardian:

The Trump Administration has the lawful authority to assert control over the D.C. Police, which is necessary due to the emergency that has arisen in our Nation's Capital as a result of failed leadership. The Democrats' efforts to stifle this tremendous progress are par for the course for the Defund the Police, Criminals-First Democrat Party.

A White House official tells the Guardian that 33 people were arrested on Thursday night by federal law enforcement. Almost half of these arrests were undocumented immigrants, according to the official.

The White House also said that 1,750 officers took part in Thursday's operations.

Yesterday, the Pentagon said that all 800 national guard troops had been mobilized, with about 200 soldiers at a time taking turns to assist federal agents and the Metropolitan police department (MPD). The national guard troops are not making arrests at this time, but protecting federal property and aiding law enforcement.

The MPD has not yet provided the number of arrests made by local police on Thursday.

As the president prepares for his pivotal meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, he's received an unlikely vote of confidence from a longstanding rival.

Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton – also the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee – said in a podcast interview released today that she would consider nominating Donald Trump for the Nobel peace prize if he could successfully broker a peace deal with the Kremlin leader that doesn't put Ukraine “in a position where it had to concede its territory to the aggressor”.

Clinton added some crucial caveats while speaking on the Raging Moderates podcast. She said that any potential award endorsement would require Trump to do the following:

Make it clear that there must be a ceasefire, there will be no exchange of territory, and that over a period of time Putin should be actually withdrawing from the territory that he has seized, in order to demonstrate his good-faith efforts, let us say, not to threaten European security.

If Trump were “the architect” of that kind of deal, Clinton said she would nominate him for a Nobel peace prize.

“My goal here is not to allow capitulation to Putin, aided and abetted by the United States,” she added.

This comes after Trump reportedly cold-called Norway's finance minister last month to ask about a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, according to Norwegian press.

With only 95 of the 100 representatives needed to achieve quorum, the Texas house has moved to end the August special session four days early.

House speaker Dustin Burrows told members to “not go very far, as I believe our governor will be calling us back for another special session”, referring to Greg Abbott's plans to immediately call a second session. Local reports say the next session will begin at noon local time today.

For their part, Texas house Democrats have said they would return as long as the first special session adjourned on Friday, and California introduced its own new congressional map to offset the gains by Republicans. California's governor, Gavin Newsom, announced on Thursday that its maps would be coming shortly.

DC's mayor, Muriel Bowser, confirmed that she will be back in DC today, after travelling to Martha's Vineyard on Wednesday to pick her daughter up from summer camp.

In a post on X, Bowser clarified her schedule, after Donald Trump posted a local report which said Bowser had “left town” for the Massachusetts island.

“I am in constant contact with my senior team and have been in constant consultation with our partners throughout a short swing out of the District,” she wrote.

When Donald Trump announced a federal takeover of the Metropolitan police department in Washington DC on Monday, he left room for the possibility of making a similar move in other cities across the US, alluding to their high crime rates.

“You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad,” Trump said. “We're not going to let it happen, we're not going to lose our cities.”

But both experts and elected officials have been quick to counter Trump's claims, pointing out how major cities are in fact experiencing dramatic decreases in violent crime rates since they peaked during the pandemic.

“Every category of crime and every population group that the FBI covers is reporting a drop pretty much nationwide,” said Jeff Asher, an analyst who studies criminal justice data, adding that there was no disparity in the trend between red and blue cities or states.

The downward trend has been consistent nationally since around 2022, as the country began to recover from the pandemic, experts said.

“It's clear that a lot of what we saw during the Covid-19 era has been reversed,” said Ames Grawert, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice who researches crime trends.

While it's impossible to isolate the exact causes of the spike in crime during the pandemic, several experts point to the collapse of social services as one cause. Since then, state and federal agencies poured money into communities for projects like gun violence prevention programs as well as more streetlights on local roads.

My colleague, Jakub Krupa, is bringing you the latest as Donald Trump heads to Alaska to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin today. It's hard to emphasise the stakes of this summit, particularly as the world watches.

Jakub reports that the president wrapped a gaggle with the press onboard Air Force One a short while ago.

A few of the key lines here:

On continuing Russian attacks on Ukraine, Trump says he thinks Putin “is trying to set a stage” and “in his mind that helps him make a better deal”. But the president says “it actually hurts him, and I will be talking to him about it”.

Trump also affirms his chief aim of today's meeting: “I'm not here to negotiate for Ukraine. I'm here to get them at a table.”

Trump also confirms his earlier threat of “severe” consequences for Russia if it fails to show willingness to seriously talk about the end of war in Ukraine: “Economically severe. It will be very severe. I'm not doing this for my health, OK, I don't need it. I'd like to focus on our country, but I'm doing this to save a lot of lives.”

Late yesterday, DC's mayor, Muriel Bowser, hit back against Pam Bondi's move to put DEA chief Terry Cole in charge of the capital's police department. In a post on X, Bowser wrote: “There is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.”  

She also said that her office have “followed the law” and provided the services of the DC police at the request of the president, as outlined in Section 740 of the Home Rule Act.

Bowser also reposted a letter from DC attorney general Brian Schwalb, addressed to the mayor, which said that Bondi's order is “unlawful” and Bowser is “not legally obligated to follow it”.

According to the federal lawsuit filed by the DC government today, the Trump administration has engaged in “a brazen usurpation of the District's authority over its own government”.

The suit says that the president's move to federalise the DC police, and attorney general Pam Bondi's order to install DEA administrator Terry Cole as “emergency police commissioner”, both “exceed the narrow delegation that Congress granted the President in Section 740”.

A reminder, earlier this week the president invoked Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act, which grants him a 30-day period to control the district's local law enforcement if he declares a safety emergency. To get an extension, the president would need Congress's approval.

The president has said that violent crime in DC – which the justice department says experienced a 30-year low in 2024 – is “the worst it's ever been”.

The lawsuit also states that Section 740 only requires that the DC mayor “provide services” of the Metropolitan police department (MPD) to federal government, but “does not permit the President to seize control of MPD. Nor does it authorize the President to direct MPD in the policing of local crime.”

As the federal takeover of the DC police and deployment of national guard troops entered its fourth night, here's a recap of what happened overnight.

The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, ended DC's “sanctuary policies”. In a directive signed yesterday, she rescinded previous orders – including one from the DC police chief, Pamela Smith – that Bondi's office says “limited” the Metropolitan police department (MPD) from working with federal officers. Bondi has now scrapped rules which prevent DC police from arresting people “solely for federal immigration warrants” and “restricted certain information from being shared with federal authorities,” a justice department spokesperson said.

Bondi also stripped power away from Smith, the police chief, and appointed Terry Cole – who leads the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) – as “emergency police commissioner”. According to her order, the MPD “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole” before issuing any further directives.

And today, the DC government announced it is suing the Trump administration for its takeover of the DC police. The district's attorney general, Brian Schwalb, wrote: “Section 740 of the Home Rule Act permits the President to request MPD's services … Even when Section 740 is lawfully invoked, the Home Rule Act keeps operational control of MPD with the Mayor and Chief, and the President must request MPD services through the Mayor.” He added that the federal government's actions are “brazenly unlawful” and “infringe on the District's right to self-governance”.

Meanwhile, federal law enforcement began conducting sweeps of homeless encampments. Crews tore down a major encampment near the Kennedy Center on Thursday, removing residents and clearing out the remaining encampments across the city. My colleague Kirstin Garriss has more on the latest here.

Former president Barack Obama has praised Texas Democrats for protesting against the state's gerrymandered GOP-drawn congressional maps by breaking quorum, according to a report from ABC News.

ABC obtained footage of a Zoom meeting on Thursday in which Obama addressed the legislators.

“We can't let a systematic assault on democracy just happen and stand by and so because of your actions, because of your courage, what you've seen is California responding, other states looking at what they can do to offset this mid-decade gerrymandering,” he said.

In the meeting, Obama also said that the Democrats – who left the state capital almost two weeks ago – “helped to lead what is going to be a long struggle”.

He added:

It's not going to be resolved right away, and it's going to require, ultimately, the American people understanding the stakes and realizing that we cannot take our freedoms and our democracy for granted. You've helped set the tone for that, and I'm grateful for it.

In a statement to ABC News, Texas house minority leader Gene Wu said Obama's message to the Democrats is “proof that when they stand up and fight back, we don't stand alone”.

Wu added that “President Obama's support shows the whole country is watching – and Texas house Democrats won't be silenced by bullies”.

This comes as Texas Democrats also said they are prepared to return to the state under certain conditions, ending their efforts to block Republicans from passing a new map that would add five GOP seats.

The lawmakers said they would return as long as the legislature ends its first special session on Friday, which Republicans have said they plan to do. However, Texas's governor, Greg Abbott, has said he will immediately call another special session.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","Exposure to some common Pfas changes gene activity, new study finds","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/15/forever-chemicals-pfas-exposure-gene-activity","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 12:01:00 GMT","

Findings help decipher mechanisms through which ‘forever chemicals' cause disease, aiding in treating health problems

New research suggests exposure to some common Pfas or “forever chemical” compounds causes changes to gene activity, and those changes are linked to health problems including multiple cancers, neurological disorders and autoimmune disease.

The findings are a major step toward determining the mechanism by which the chemicals cause disease and could help doctors identify, detect and treat health problems for those exposed to Pfas before the issues advance. The research may also point toward other diseases potentially caused by Pfas that have not yet been identified, the authors said.

The study is among the first to examine how Pfas chemicals impact gene activity, called epigenetics.

“This gives us a hint as to which genes and which Pfas might be important,” said Melissa Furlong, a University of Arizona College of Public Health Pfas researcher and study lead author.

Pfas are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment

The study checked the blood of about 300 firefighters from four departments across the country who were exposed to high levels of Pfas. The chemicals are the main ingredient in most firefighting foam, and are frequently used in “turnout gear” worn by firefighters because of their heat repelling properties

Furlong said she was surprised to find the number of genes and biological pathways that were impacted by Pfas, which suggests the chemicals may cause or contribute to a broad range of health problems. The study did not prove the chemicals cause certain diseases, but findings point to biological changes that might precede disease.

Genes play a range of roles in developing or preventing disease, and Pfas essentially change the way the genes are supposed to act, Furlong said. A gene may act as tumor suppressor, but the Pfas interferes with how it expresses, which affects whether cancer develops, or the type of cancer.

For example, PFOS, among the most common and dangerous Pfas compounds, reduces levels of miR-128-1-5p, a gene tied to cancer development. Branched forms of PFOS were linked to changes in five other genes, including some that regulate cancer development.

Different Pfas and chemical structures were found to affect different genes, and were associated with different health outcomes. Not all compounds impacted gene expressions.

The research found connections among Pfas-related gene changes and biological pathways involved in leukemia, as well as bladder, liver, thyroid and breast cancers. Other genes and biological pathways were involved in Alzheimer's disease, and autoimmune and infectious diseases such as lupus, asthma and tuberculosis.

Furlong said it remains unclear at which step in the biological processes disease is triggered, but the picture is clear enough to point to possible treatments. Pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop drugs that could alter gene activity and potentially prevent Pfas-linked disease from developing.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Member states back Correct the Map campaign that urges governments and organisations to use more accurate map

The African Union has backed a campaign to end the use by governments and international organisations of the 16th-century Mercator map of the world in favour of one that more accurately displays Africa's size.

Created by the cartographer Gerardus Mercator for navigation, the projection distorts continent sizes, enlarging areas near the poles like North America and Greenland while shrinking Africa and South America. “It might seem to be just a map, but in reality, it is not,” the African Union Commission deputy chair, Selma Malika Haddadi, told Reuters, saying the Mercator fostered a false impression that Africa was “marginal”, despite being the world's second-largest continent by area, with more than 1 billion people. The union has 55 member states.

Such stereotypes influence media, education and policy, she said.

Criticism of the Mercator map is not new, but the Correct the Map campaign led by the advocacy groups Africa No Filter and Speak Up Africa has revived the debate, urging organisations to adopt the 2018 Equal Earth projection, which tries to reflect countries' true sizes.

“The current size of the map of Africa is wrong,” said Moky Makura, the executive director of Africa No Filter. “It's the world's longest misinformation and disinformation campaign, and it just simply has to stop.”

Fara Ndiaye, a co-founder of Speak Up Africa, said the Mercator affected Africans' identity and pride, especially children who might encounter it early in school.

“We're actively working on promoting a curriculum where the Equal Earth projection will be the main standard across all [African] classrooms,” Ndiaye said, adding she hoped it would also be the one used by global institutions, including Africa-based ones. Haddadi said the AU endorsed the campaign, adding it aligned with its goal of “reclaiming Africa's rightful place on the global stage” amid growing calls for reparations for colonialism and slavery.

The AU will advocate for wider map adoption and discuss collective actions with member states, Haddadi added.

The Mercator projection is still widely used, including by schools and tech companies. Google Maps switched from Mercator on desktop to a 3D globe view in 2018, though users can still switch back to the Mercator if they prefer.

On the mobile app, however, the Mercator projection remains the default.

Correct the Map wants organisations such as the World Bank and the UN to adopt the Equal Earth map. A World Bank spokesperson said it already used the Winkel tripel projection or Equal Earth for static maps and was phasing out Mercator on web maps.

The campaign said it had sent a request to the UN geospatial body, UN-GGIM. A UN spokesperson said that once received it must be reviewed and approved by a committee of experts.

Other regions are backing the AU's efforts. Dorbrene O'Marde, the vice-chair of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) Reparations Commission, endorsed Equal Earth as a rejection of the Mercator map's “ideology of power and dominance”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed “remorse” over World War II in his address at the annual government-organized national memorial service for the war dead in Tokyo on Friday.

“We must once again deeply inscribe the remorse and lessons from that war into our hearts,” Ishiba stated.

A source close to Ishiba emphasized that the prime minister had intended to include the word “remorse” in his address. The source explained that Ishiba's decision was the “culmination of his deep resolve to prevent the recurrence of war, as the nation marks the 80th anniversary of the war's end.”

It has been 13 years since a prime minister last used the word “remorse” in their memorial address. It was used in 2012 by Yoshihiko Noda, who was the prime minister under the Democratic Party of Japan and now leads the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan.

The mention of remorse became a fixture after former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama issued a statement on the 50th anniversary of the war's end, in which he acknowledged past colonial rule and aggression.

In his 1994 address, Murayama expressed “deep remorse” and stated that Japan had “caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations.”

Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also referred to “remorse” in his 2007 address during his first term, but he stopped using the term in his second term and beyond. Instead, he stated, “We have the great responsibility to take the lessons of history deeply into our hearts.”

13:41 JST, August 15, 2025

Ruling and opposition parties issued statements about their intentions for the future to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.

The Liberal Democratic Party declared that the global order was in a “critical state with the potential to collapse.” It pointed to the situation in the Middle East and the United States' increasingly strong “America First” stance as major contributing factors. “Japan must take the lead in upholding and strengthening the free and open international order, the foundation of peace and prosperity,” the LDP said.

Komeito called for multilateral dialogue to build trust and proactively prevent unforeseen contingencies, emphasizing the “increasingly severe security environment around Japan.”

The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan said: “We take pride in the fact that our nation has not waged war in the 80 years since the end of World War II. We will never forget the tragedies and mistakes of the past and use them as lessons to face the world with integrity.”

The Japan Innovation Party aims to build up Japan's “active defense capability” to create and maintain peace as well as a stable international order. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party for the People underscored its resolve to “do its utmost to [ensure Japan] remains a peaceful nation.”

Sanseito spoke of its commitment to “learning from both the light and shadow of history and preserve Japan that was protected at the cost of lives.”

Reiwa Shinsengumi stated that they would “take action to create a nation that will never wage war again,” and the Japanese Communist Party insisted that they would “stop the great military expansion” and “war state building,” which it views as unconstitutional.

The Conservative Party of Japan stated its intention to “focus on constructing peace and prosperity for the future without allowing history to become a political battleground.”

The Social Democratic Party announced its commitment to realizing a politics of “rice over missiles” and preventing any revision of the Constitution.

Team Mirai emphasized the importance of exploring a path of mutual understanding through dialogue without fueling social divisions.

17:23 JST, August 15, 2025

The annual memorial ceremony for Japan's war dead was held at the Nippon Budokan hall in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo, on Friday, as the country marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.

About 4,500 people, including family members of the war dead and representatives from various fields, attended the government-organized memorial service.

The attendees remembered the about 3.1 million Japanese people who lost their lives in the war and renewed their vow to never fight a war again and extend the 80 years of peace since.

The Emperor and Empress and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba were in attendance at the ceremony, which began at 11:51 a.m. A minute of silence was observed as the clock struck noon.

In his address, the Emperor used the expression “deep remorse” again this year, marking the 11th consecutive year that the expression has been used in the Imperial address.

The Emperor spoke for the first time about passing on the memory of the war, saying, “It is my sincere hope that we shall continue to pass down the memories of the sufferings endured during and after the war, and in unity of spirit, to seek peace and the happiness of the people in the future.”

The oldest attendee at the ceremony was Shoji Nagaya, 98, of Hokkaido, who lost his older brother in the war, while the youngest was a 3-year-old from Mie Prefecture who is the great-great-grandson of a war casualty.

Representing the families of the war dead, Hajime Eda, 82, of Kawagoe, Saitama Prefecture, whose father died in the Korea Strait, delivered a message of remembrance.

Of the 3,432 family members of the war dead scheduled to attend Friday's ceremony as of Aug. 8, 3,380 were related to deceased Imperial military personnel or employees, according to the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry. Family members of those killed in the atomic bombings and other war victims totaled 52.

Of those, a record 1,826 were born in the postwar period. At 53.2%, they made up over half the group for the first time.

No parents of war dead have been in attendance for 15 years. This year's ceremony was the first with no spouses of war dead, except for 2021, when attendance was severely restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Passing on the experiences of the war to future generations remains an issue to be addressed.

Flowers were given by children to attendees to offer at the memorial for the first time in six years, as the custom was suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The custom began in 2016 with the aim of passing on the memories of the war to younger generations. This year, 14 children between the ages of 8 and 17, including a great-grandchild of a person who died in the war, handed out yellow chrysanthemums.

From the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 to the end of World War II in 1945, about 2.3 million Japanese military personnel and employees, including those detained in Siberia after the war, lost their lives. About 800,000 civilians were killed in air raids and the two atomic bombings.

It's a fact little known around the world: Some of the biggest names in tech were founded by Ukrainian-born entrepreneurs, including PayPal, WhatsApp, and Grammarly.

These companies, now headquartered across the U.S. and Europe, owe part of their success to Ukrainian-born entrepreneurs whose innovations have shaped how millions communicate, pay, and work online.

Here are 10 of the world's most recognizable tech companies founded or co-founded by Ukrainians.

Co-founder Max Levchin was born in Kyiv, Ukraine

PayPal revolutionized digital payments when it was launched in the late 1990s, eventually being acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002. The platform became the backbone of online commerce, processing billions in transactions globally.

One of the founding members is Max Levchin, a Ukrainian-born entrepreneur who left Kyiv with his family in 1991 as a teenager. He became PayPal's anti-fraud architect and co-created one of the first commercial Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA).

In 2012, in San Francisco, Levchin founded Affirm, which now dominates the buy-now-pay-later market. The company went public in 2021 with a $12 billion valuation and has a current market capitalization of $25 billion. Levchin's current net worth, according to Forbes, is estimated at $2.1 billion.

Co-founder Jan Koum was born in Kyiv, Ukraine

With almost 3 billion users sending over 150 million messages daily, WhatsApp is one of the world's most popular ways to stay in touch. When Facebook bought it for $22 billion in 2014, it was the biggest startup acquisition at the time.

Behind the global messenger stands Jan Koum, who was born in Kyiv and immigrated to the U.S. as a teenager in 1992. From humble beginnings on welfare, the self-taught programmer co-founded WhatsApp and built a $16.9 billion fortune, making him the wealthiest Ukrainian immigrant in the U.S., according to Forbes.

Founded in Kyiv, Ukraine by three Ukrainians

Three Ukrainians — Alex Shevchenko, Max Lytvyn, and Dmytro Lider — launched their English writing helper Grammarly in 2009 in Kyiv. A decade later, more than 40 million users rely on Grammarly daily to help them proofread and spell check their texts. 

The company puts its annual revenue at $700 million, and it was last valued at $13 billion in 2021.

After Shevchenko and Lytvyn's net worths hit $4 billion in 2021, they became the first tech founders to top Ukraine's wealth rankings ahead of traditional oligarchs. Their net worths have since fallen to $1.9 billion, according to Forbes.

Founded in Kyiv, Ukraine, where it maintains its headquarters today

Reface, founded in 2018 by a group of Ukrainian developers, is an artificial intelligence product company best known for its face-swapping application for videos and photos. In the five years since it was founded, it has been downloaded over 250 million times and in 2020, was number one in the entertainment category in the Apple App Store in the U.S., surpassing TikTok and Netflix for a time. 

The app has been used by billionaire Elon Musk, and celebrities Snoop Dogg and Britney Spears, and in 2021, Reface partnered with Warner Bros. to promote ""The Matrix 4."" In 2020, Reface raised $5.5 million for product development from Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and investors including ""South Park"" creators and music managers of stars Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Britney Spears, and Miley Cyrus.

Following the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, the company sent 13 million push notifications to tell Russian users the truth about their country's aggression against Ukraine.

The first Ukrainian unicorn, founded by Dmytro Zaporozhets from Kharkiv, Ukraine

When developer Dmytro Zaporozhets from eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv got frustrated with existing code management tools, he decided to build his own in 2011. Since then, Zaporozhets' initial side project, GitLab, has grown into a comprehensive coding platform used by over 50 million registered users worldwide.

GitLab became Ukraine's first unicorn — a startup with a valuation of more than $1 billion — in September 2018. In October 2021, the company went public on NASDAQ, valued at $11 billion, with shares jumping 35% on the first day of trading to reach a market cap of $14.9 billion. After the company listing, Zaporozhets became Ukraine's then-richest software engineer with a fortune of nearly $460 million.

Co-founded by Ukrainian developer Vlad Yatsenko 

Behind the U.K.-based global payment platform, which lets users manage finances through a single platform, stands Ukrainian developer Vlad Yatsenko. In 2015, he co-founded Revolut with Nikolai Storonsky, who was born in Russia but later renounced his Russian citizenship following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The app's success has earned Yatsenko a $1.2 billion fortune. 

The application now serves over 60 million customers worldwide and is currently valued at $45 billion. The company is reportedly in talks to raise new funding that could boost its valuation to $65 billion.

CleanMyMac was developed in Kyiv by Oleksandr Kosovan

As of 2023, every fifth Mac on Earth had at least one MacPaw application — a testament to how big this bootstrapped software company has become. Founded by Oleksandr Kosovan while studying at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute in 2008, he created CleanMyMac, an optimization tool for Mac users to clean and speed up their computers.

This success evolved into other products like Setapp, a subscription service for Mac apps, and AI assistant Eney. The company now serves 30 million users worldwide, with MacPaw's software downloaded in over 180 countries, all without external investment.

Founded by Dmitry Sergeev in Kyiv

With over 300 million files and 44 million customers worldwide, Depositphotos is one of the world's largest stock photo marketplaces. Founded in 2009 by Dmitry Sergeev in Kyiv, it grew into a global content empire, competing with industry giants like Getty Images and Adobe.

The U.S. firm VistaPrint acquired Depositphotos in October 2021 for $85 million, with Sergeev reportedly receiving nearly $50 million from the deal. Depositphotos today employs nearly 450 people in six countries, including Ukraine.

Founded by three Ukrainians in Kyiv

Petcube was the first company in the pet-tech sector to create smart cameras that let owners watch and play with their pets remotely. When the Kyiv-based trio — Alex Neskin, Andrey Klen, and Yaroslav Azhnyuk — launched their Kickstarter campaign in 2012, they raised a record-breaking $251,000, the most ever for a pet product on the platform at the time. Since then, Petcube has sold more than 1 million products worldwide.

Petcube is headquartered in the U.S., but most of the company's 60 employees remain in Ukraine. The U.S. market, which consists of 85 million pet owners, was the first target and still makes up 80% of sales, typically through online retailers like Amazon. The company also donates to the Armed Forces and UA Animals, an NGO that helps animals during the war.

Founded in the U.S. by three Ukrainians

Preply, an online marketplace connecting language learners with tutors, was founded in 2012 by Ukrainian entrepreneurs Kirill Bigai, Serge Lukyanov, and Dmytro Voloshyn. Today, over 100,000 tutors teach hundreds of thousands of students worldwide in more than 90 languages, the company told the Kyiv Independent in a statement.  

While the company's value isn't publicly known, various estimates from 2022 and 2023 put it somewhere around $430 million. The company raised $70 million in funding in 2023, bringing its total funding to $170 million.

Editor's note: This story has been updated with details on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's arrival.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Alexander Darchiev have arrived in Alaska ahead of a planned Trump-Putin summit, Russian state media reported on Aug. 15.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to meet in Alaska later in the day as Washington intensifies efforts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.

Lavrov, wearing a sweatshirt with a Russian-language inscription ""USSR,"" arrived at a hotel in Anchorage, Alaska's largest city and the site of upcoming talks between U.S. and Russian leaders.

Putin has arrived in the town of Magadan in Russia's Far East ahead of the planned summit, Russian state media reported. Magadan is located about 3,162 kilometers (1,965 miles) from Anchorage.

The Russian leader is expected to meet with the local governor and visit an industrial facility before departing for Alaska, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.

An airplane with Russian journalists has also arrived in Anchorage, state media claimed.

On Aug. 14, Trump said that Putin will come to the summit in Alaska ready to make a deal to end Russia's war against Ukraine.

""I believe now he's convinced that he's going to make a deal. He's going to make a deal. I think he's going to,"" Trump told Fox Radio. ""And we're going to find out, I'm going to know very quickly.""

Meanwhile, the White House has said Trump prefers diplomacy but is ready to increase economic pressure on Russia if necessary.

""Certainly, there are sanctions and many other measures that the president could utilize if he has to. Not that he wants to… diplomacy and negotiation have always been the way for this president,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Aug. 14.

Trump has previously said that if the Aug. 15 meeting goes well, he will seek a trilateral meeting between himself, Putin, and President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Russia has issued maximalist demands to Kyiv in previous direct peace talks, including that Ukraine give up its NATO aspirations and demilitarize.

Months earlier, U.S. attempts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia failed. Kyiv and Moscow later held three rounds of direct peace talks in Istanbul, which were largely inconclusive.

He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography. Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto. He previously completed an internship with The Kyiv Independent.





Trump said he and Putin plan to discuss territorial exchanges in Ukraine, but Kyiv itself must make the decision. ""But I'm not here to negotiate for Ukraine,"" the U.S. president said.

The corps claimed that Ukrainian units are operating inside the city, and civilians can move about, though travel within Pokrovsk remains heavily restricted. It is still possible to reach the city, the statement added. 

Russian officials have not named the cause of the explosion, but preliminary accounts reported by Russian media point to possible safety violations in the workshop. 

""This is a Russian tactic before any negotiations,"" Alina Alekseeva, the deputy head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, told the Kyiv Independent.

The Elysee Palace described the dialogue between the two leaders as ""close and constant,"" but did not provide a specific date or location for the follow-up meeting.



Beka Museum urged immediate action, highlighting Russian President Vladimir Putin's role in the forced deportation of Ukrainian children and other atrocities committed under his rule. 

The issue concerns refugees who have lived in the country since Aug. 16, 2023, under the Uniting for Ukraine program, devised by the Biden administration to allow Ukrainians to stay in the country on humanitarian parole.



EU ministers could reportedly agree in early September to open the first negotiating cluster with Moldova, a key legal step toward membership, ahead of the country's Sept. 28 parliamentary elections. 

The Russian delegation will include Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, presidential aide Yuri Ushakov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, and Russian Direct Investment Fund head Kirill Dmitriev.

Kyivstar, Ukraine's leading mobile operator, became the first Ukrainian company to list on a U.S. stock exchange, the company announced on Aug. 15.

Shares of the telecommunications giant now trade on Nasdaq under the ticker KYIV.

Kyivstar's listing provides global investors with direct access to Ukrainian business and the country's economic recovery — crucial for rebuilding following Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the close of the business combination, parent company Veon holds an 89.6% stake in Kyivstar Group Ltd., according to the company's press release. 

Previously, Veon said it would retain a minimum of 80% of the issued and outstanding shares of the telecommunications business.

The company said Kyivstar has already secured at least $52 million in commitments, with hopes to raise $200 million through the Nasdaq listing. 

The market-leading operator previously received a pro forma valuation of $2.21 billion.

The public offering of Kyivstar shares will take place following the official Nasdaq Opening Bell ceremony scheduled for Aug. 29 in New York, the company announced.

""Our public market debut is a defining moment not only for the company, but for the entire Ukrainian business community,"" said Kyivstar CEO Oleksandr Komarov in a press release.

The company took a decisive step on July 12 toward listing after investors in special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Cohen Circle Acquisition Corp. announced the merger with the Ukrainian firm, changing the name to Kyivstar.

Kyivstar chose to go public through a merger with the New York-registered SPAC company to simplify and accelerate the process of entering the U.S. stock exchange.

Kyivstar, owned by telecoms group VEON, dominates Ukraine's market with more than 24 million subscribers.

The company is actively scaling up operations. In March, it acquired ride-hailing service Uklon for $155 million after expanding its portfolio with medical tech platform Helsi in 2022.

On Aug. 12, Kyivstar successfully tested Starlink's Direct to Cell satellite technology, which enables text messages sent directly from smartphones via satellite. The company hopes to launch the service to the public in the fall of 2025.

Some save every penny for a down payment on a home. Others live for today and figure tomorrow will sort itself out. I've spent years comparing myself to them

Last year, while being laid off over a Slack call, I had a vision. I saw myself, greying and tired, in a white room. My theory is that the shock of the news swept clean the imagination of my entire future.

That vision came on the heels of a long buildup. I freelance on the personal finance beat and often talk to Gen Zs and millennials about their money habits, career decisions and retirement plans. 

Some save every penny for a down payment on a home. Others live for today and figure tomorrow will sort itself out. I've spent years comparing myself to them.

In the middle of one of my comparison spirals, I asked ChatGPT a question I couldn't bring myself to ask a human: “Do you think I'll be okay when I'm 65?”

We asked ChatGPT for personal finance advice. Here's what human advisers think about AI's answers 

Off the bat, the bot, known for agreeing with its user, legitimized my feelings in its em-dash-heavy fashion. “It's totally valid to feel anxious about retirement – especially after a job loss,” it replied.

“You're not alone in this,” it said, which is true. Almost half of Canadians lose sleep over money issues, according to a Financial Stress Index.

It basically congratulated me for being proactive. “Your concern shows you're thinking ahead, which is a great first step.” 

Opinion: Testing AI hype with questions about how to save a home down payment and when to start CPP

Next, it asked for details about my age, savings, income, expenses, retirement goals, eligibility for the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security, and whether I plan to buy a home.

I gave it all the details: I'm a 29-year-old freelancer with $20,000 in my tax-free savings account, $5,000 in my registered retirement savings plan, some other savings, some gold and no real plan. I spend about $3,000 a month, have no debt or pension and rent in Toronto with my husband, who works full-time in technology. 

My freelancing income swings between $1,000 and $5,000 a month. We don't own property, nor do my parents. We sometimes talk about buying a place, having a kid and retiring in Egypt, where his family has a home. I'd like to retire by age 65.

“You're actually in a much better position than you might think, especially at 29.” I found it hard to believe that I was on par with my peers, so I Googled it.

Again, the bot was right, kind of. Reddit threads and a big bank's advice team agreed that you should have around one year of your annual salary saved by 30, which I almost do. 

But that's based on an entry-level salary, not enough to survive in one of Canada's most expensive cities.

Still, it continued to reassure me that I was on the right track, highlighting my lack of debt, low expenses and solid savings. 

But it also flagged risks like needing to save more for rent later since I don't own property. It reminded me that my inconsistent income might affect CPP eligibility and to check on my contributions regularly. It even told me to get the ball rolling on conversations about kids and home ownership with my husband.

Four wealth traps that can derail your retirement

I already knew a lot of that. It didn't go into detail about whether my income was enough to survive the expenses of a home or child, how much more I needed or if my income would live up to the cost of living over the next few decades. I'm sure it could if I poked around more.

I was already starting to feel better, so I skipped all that and went straight to the big number. I told ChatGPT about contributing $550 into my TFSA every month and about an upcoming fellowship. I also said I eventually did want to find a stable job with benefits. I asked it to give me the projection, as vague as that sounds. 

Within seconds, it returned with numbers and showed just how. If I don't touch my TFSA until retirement, it said I'd have almost a quarter of a million dollars. 

I don't believe that. What would our monthly budget be? How long would it last? Would we be paying for our theoretical kid still? I had a lot of questions, but not enough will to poke holes in my perfect story.

I was ready to escape the spreadsheet vibes, so I ended by asking it to show me what a day in my retirement could look like.

“You're 67 years old. You live in a peaceful Nile-side neighbourhood in Egypt. The cost of living is a fraction of what it was in Toronto. You and your husband either own a small home or rent a beautiful, affordable apartment in a community where you're known for your stories,” it said.

I asked ChatGPT to generate a picture of me in retirement, and this is what it created.

It described my morning coffee, my afternoon hobbies and my evening reading. Between them, I occasionally co-hosted a podcast, edited a few articles and blogged about my travels from an Egyptian courtyard while my husband brought me coffee. It said that I could live a comfortable life travelling and hosting friends for dinner parties in Egypt. As romantic as it all sounded, it was a projection built on my TFSA alone. 

I found that the AI leaned heavily on common sense and a shaky piece of advice: Use your home as a retirement asset and downsize, assuming we'd buy in Toronto eventually, which seems like a hard reality without a real path to get there.

What struck me most wasn't the forecast but the tone. It was reassuring, warm and borderline coddling. “You didn't retire early. You retired intentionally. You built a flexible career that gave you options. You have a life that still lets you tell stories, eat well and sleep soundly,” it said.

The white box in my head started collecting colour. ChatGPT read like it knew me, which makes sense, because I often talk to it about recipes, work and travel.

I often feel numb and cynical when thinking about retirement. Like, what's the point of saving when the world is on fire? Will the future even exist? Will I be too burnt out to enjoy it?, ChatGPT let me self-indulge and be a little delulu. It helped me romanticize a future I was afraid to imagine.

It didn't replace doing the work, though. I still need to earn more, save more and have hard conversations with my partner about what we want. But ChatGPT created a starting point. It was like holding up a mirror and being told, gently, that maybe I'm not failing.

Would I recommend it? Yes, but with caveats. It won't make your money magically grow. It's not a licensed financial adviser. But if you're in a job limbo, renting or just financially anxious, it can offer hope in moments of chaos.

At the very least, it's better than picturing yourself in a blank white box.

Walking's accessibility make it an easier choice for a healthy lifestyle, but for many, its simplicity isn't enough for a great exercise session.YANA PASKOVA/The New York Times News Service

Over the past decade, walking has become a popular tool for fitness. The reasons are simple. It's free, it doesn't require any equipment and you can do it almost anywhere. And with some augmentations, it can make you break a serious sweat. 

Walking also has all sorts of positive impacts on your health. The Heart Foundation in Australia noted that walking a half-hour or more each day can lower the risk of stroke, heart disease and type two diabetes. A recent study out of Britain found that brisk walking was associated with lower rates of cancer. The research pool was substantial, consisting of more than 400,000 participants with a mean age of 56 years old. 

Try these three daily exercises to keep your hips happy and healthy

The activity's accessibility makes it an easy choice for a healthier lifestyle, especially when starting out. 

“You can walk pretty much anywhere, but also the idea that if you're getting out of bed in the morning, you're already doing it,” says nutrition coach and personal trainer Jeremy Fernandes. 

Fernandes studied kinesiology at Western University and devoted his career to working with clients across various levels of fitness. He credits the rise of fitness trackers with people's interest in getting their steps in. “The difference is now we're intentionally capturing the data and giving ourselves credit for our efforts.” 

For a lot of people, the simplicity of walking isn't enough for a great exercise session: Speed, resistance and distance matter when walking for fitness. On social media and gyms across the country, people have been augmenting the exercise with the hope of optimizing their workouts. Three popular variations include the incline treadmill, using weighted vests or backpacks and walking at interval speeds, known as “Japanese walking.” 

Most treadmills have a feature that positions the machine on an incline, mimicking walking uphill outside. 

Walking on an incline takes more energy than walking on a flat surface. That's great if you're short on time. 

“The logic is that increasing the incline on your treadmill will result in a greater metabolic cost, meaning your body has to work harder,” said Fernandes. 

The trainer estimates that people would see an approximate 50-per-cent increase in calories burned when walking on a 10-per-cent incline, compared with walking on a zero-per-cent incline. That can lead to weight loss. It can also be easier on the joints than running or jogging. 

Why you should try walking backward

“It will reduce overall impact forces, which is maybe more of a concern for folks with pre-existing joint issues or those training hard to build muscle and strength,” said Fernandes. 

The increased calorie burn, combined with the relative ease of the workout compared with other forms of cardio, are some of the reasons incline treadmill walks have trended across TikTok and Instagram. 

Dozens of videos about the 12-3-30 workout – treadmill walking with an incline at 12 per cent and speed at three miles an hour for 30 minutes – can be found across the platforms, anecdotally praising the workouts for fat loss. 

Fernandes notes that incline treadmill walks are safe to try for anyone who isn't dealing with a chronic lower-leg injury. 

Companies such as GORUCK and Rogue sell weighted vests as an expression of extreme masculinity with military associations. Weighted vests have also been marketed for women to help combat osteoporosis and increase bone density while aging. 

For those looking to try out a weighted vest for exercise, it's best to start out small – 5 per cent to 10 per cent of your bodyweight – and work up from there, according to Fernandes.

Weighted vests and backpacks are good for adding some extra intensity to cardio exercises. They can also be useful for anyone preparing for long hikes where carrying equipment is necessary. But along with the benefits there's a lot of hype. 

How to prevent tweaks, strains and tears caused by tennis, running and other popular workouts

While there have been small studies showing positive relationships between walking and bone destiny in postmenopausal women, there hasn't been enough research to definitively say that it works. Similarly, for anyone with pre-existing strains or injuries, the added weight of a vest could exacerbate the conditions. 

“Folks with neck and back issues should be extra cautious with adding in rucking or weighted vests to their routine, as the added stress on these areas may cause issues,” said Fernandes. 

For anyone keen to step up their daily stroll, consider “Japanese walking.” The exercise consists of three minutes of normal walking followed by three minutes of walking at a faster pace, repeated for five rounds. 

Also referred to as 3-3 walking or interval walking, the technique was created by professors at Shinshu University in Matsumoto, Japan. Explainers about the trend and personal stories touting the health benefits of the low-impact exercise have been spreading across social media. For some, it's changed their routine for the positive. 

There's data to back up the anecdotes. A 2007 study by Shinshu University showed that middle-aged and older adults participating in interval walking had lower blood pressure and better aerobic capacity than those who walked 8,000 steps a day at a moderate pace. 

Quick, intense exercise may put the brakes on aging, research shows

“Increasing intensity in accessible ways tends to lead to beneficial outcomes for folks,” said Fernandes. The fitness expert notes that interval training in many different forms has always been popular for exercise. Japanese walking fits into those larger trends. “It may have benefits in terms of aerobic health. There's also small strength benefits as well.” 

Switching up your pace and walking for brisk intervals can be a great entry point into exercising. It's also something we can incorporate into daily activities we're already doing such as grocery shopping or strolling into work. 

Still, if you're thinking about augmentations that make walking more challenging, first make sure you're actually willing to walk without them. Getting started and doing something consistently is always going to be better than going hard right away. 

Walking 10,000 steps... But better 😯 I know I can't be the only one who looks at my step count at the end of the day and feel like a failure. Some days, I get around 2,000 steps. I still aim for at least 8,000 a day - but sometimes, life just gets in the way. But even if it's only an extra ~3000 steps, this simple 30 minute protocol on my walking pad can make a huge difference.

More or less human-like robots played soccer, table tennis, ran, danced and, often, fell over at the kickoff of the first humanoid robot games in China.

More than 500 humanoid robots in 280 teams from 16 countries are competing in 26 events ranging from soccer and boxing to sorting medicine and cleaning up at the first World Humanoid Robot Games.

Three days of competitions began in Beijing, China, on Thursday evening as the country steps up efforts to develop robots powered by artificial intelligence.

""We come here to play and to win. But we are also interested in research,"" said Max Polter, a member of the HTWK Robots football team from Germany, affiliated with Leipzig University of Applied Sciences, told Reuters news agency.

""You can test a lot of interesting, new and exciting approaches in this contest. If we try something and it doesn't work, we lose the game,"" Polter said. ""That's sad, but it is better than investing a lot of money into a product that fails.""

The robots crashed into each other and toppled over repeatedly during football matches, while another fell over mid-sprint during running events. The AFP news agency reported that one of the fastest robots finished a 1,500-meter race in 6:29:37 — well off the current human record of 3:26:00.

At the kung fu competition, a child-sized robot resembling one from the popular Transformer series tried a complicated move only to fall on its face and spin on the floor in an attempt to get back up. The crowd, however, cheered happily.

Chinese officials made humanoids the ""center of their national strategy,"" the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) wrote in a paper published Thursday. 

""The government wants to showcase its competence and global competitiveness in this field of technology,"" it added.

In March, China announced plans for a one-trillion-yuan fund (€119 billion, $139 billion) to support technology startups, including those in robotics and AI.

Joost Weerheim, part of the Dutch five-a-side robot football team, told AFP he was impressed by the skill of China's teams.

""I think right now if they are not already the world leader, they are very, very quickly becoming it,"" he said.

Tickets to the humanoid games at Beijing's National Speed Skating Oval, built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, range from 180 yuan (about €22, $25) to 580 yuan (about €69, $80).

China has staged several robotics events in recent months, including what it called the world'sfirst humanoid robot marathon, a robot conference and the opening of retail stores dedicated to humanoid robots.

US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet at military base in Alaska

Trump will welcome Putin as he arrives on the plane, the Kremlin says

Zelenskyy says summit should ""open up a real path toward a just peace""

Yulia Navalnaya calls for the release of political prisoners from Russia and Ukraine

Here's the latest on the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska along with news about Russia's invasion of Ukraine:

DW's Europe correspondent, Rosie Birchard, has the latest from the EU's de facto capital, Brussels, where all eyes are on developments in Alaska.

A Friday night in mid-August is usually the peak of the European Union's sleepy summer political recess. But tonight, officials are glued to their phones, waiting for any clue on whether their bid to influence US President Donald Trump ahead of his talks with Putin has worked. 

European leaders said their virtual meeting with the US president and his Ukrainian counterpart earlier this week went well — and there's no doubt the trans-Atlantic mood music is better now than back in February when President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was booted out the White House, and Europe was left looking powerless.

A European Commission spokesperson told reporters on Thursday their ""understanding"" is that Trump will ""debrief"" Zelenskyy and European leaders following his tete-a-tete with Putin. ""We don't have a timeframe on this,"" she added.

Until then, it's a case of putting on a brave face and watching from afar. You can read all about Europe's hopes and fears in this analysis by my colleague Anchal Vohra.

On his way to the summit with US President Donald Trump in Alaska, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the Magadan region of his country, some 6,000 kilometers (about 3,750 miles) east of Moscow.

According to state media, Putin's scheduled included a visit a fish oil capsule factory and cultural centers in the Russian Far East region's capital, also called Magadan.

The city was a major transit centre for political prisoners during the Stalin era and was the administrative centre of a forced labor gold mining operation. The sparsely populated wider Magadan region, on the Sea of Okhotsk, today relies on mining and fishing.

After his visit, Putin was expected to review materials on Ukraine, bilateral tensions, and economic cooperation on his 3,000-kilometer journey to the summit in Anchorage.

DW's Washington Bureau Chief Ines Pohl is in Alaska ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting. She spoke to Alaskans about their thoughts on the historic summit. 

While Donald Trump is rolling out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin, not everyone is pleased with the visit. 

Several hundred people have expressed their protests by waving yellow and blue flags in support of Ukraine. Their main concern is that Zelenskyy is not participating in the meeting. 

Many of the protesters have voiced their opposition to having an alleged war criminal on American soil. The International Criminal Court in The Hague has issued a warrant for Putin's arrest. 

Conversely, some Alaskans we met at a golf course expressed pride in having the president here, stating that they would prefer him to meet his Russian counterpart on American soil rather than in Russia.

US President Trump is expected to greet Russian President Putin on the plane upon his arrival in Anchorage, Alaska, the Kremlin has said.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Russian state TV that the Russian president was due to arrive at 11:00 am local time (1900 GMT).

The meeting between US President Trump and Russian President Putin in a few hours in Alaska should "" open up a real path toward a just peace and a substantive discussion between leaders in a trilateral format,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

In a Friday post on X, Zelenskyy said he expected an intelligence report on Russia's intentions and preparations for the meeting.

""It is time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia,"" Zelenskyy wrote. ""We are counting on America. We are ready, as always, to work as productively as possible.""

If there's one thing that commentators from the West and Russian Kremlin-friendly media seem to agree upon, it's that the bilateral summit in Alaska is already, before it has even started, a diplomatic success for Vladimir Putin.

The Russian president is known to feel personally offended by the dissolution of the Soviet Union. He's longing for Russia to be respected and seen as a global superpower again.

According to the country's commentators, Russia is indeed back on the world stage.

The website 1prime.ru is already celebrating: ""Putin's victory.""

Moscow-based daily newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets (MK) writes that the West's strategy of isolation through sanctions hasn't worked: ""On the contrary, [… Russia] has turned out to be a player that is taken into account and consulted.""

Russian media also welcomed the choice of venue — which they see as symbolic.

MK is calling Alaska ""an obvious example of the movability of state borders and the change of ownership of large territories.""

The state was sold to the US by Tsarist Russia in the 19th century.

Now, Moscow is reportedly asking Kyiv to hand over four Ukrainian oblasts that Russia is partially occupying: Donetsk and Luhansk — which form the Donbas region — and the oblasts Zaporizhzhia and Kherson further south.

Kyiv has refused to cede the territories. Freezing the frontline in these oblasts could be on the table, though.

Meanwhile, Russian newspapers are not only rejoicing that Europe and Ukraine will be shut out from the Alaska talks. Commentators even seem irritated that Europeans are trying to weigh in.

Kommersant, another Russian daily, features the headline: ""Dancing around Alaska — Europe and Ukraine move to get between the US and Russia.""

As if the main topic on the summit agenda weren't Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine — in the heart of Europe.

US President Trump said on Friday it was up to Kyiv to decide on whether it will engage in territorial swaps with Moscow, as he prepared to meet Russia's Putin.

Speaking to reports on Air Force One en route to Alaska, Trump said he would let Ukraine make the decision.

Trump also hailed his relationship to Putin.

""He's a smart guy. He's been doing it for a long time, but so have I... We're presidents. We get along. There's a good respect level on both sides,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force Once during the flight to Anchorage.

US President Trump has boarded the plane en route to Alaska, where he is due to meet Russian President Putin later today.

Trump posted ""HIGH STAKES!!!"" on his Truth Social platform as he prepared for the meeting.

The US president is joined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and special envoy Steve Witkoff.

One suggestion that has come up in the run-up to the summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is the idea of an air truce, in which both sides would halt airstrikes.

But it is not clear how any such agreement could work.

It'll be late evening in Kyiv by the time Trump and Putin sit down; the best-case scenario for most people here would be not waking up to bad news on Saturday. 

Hopes for a ceasefire are dim, while concerns are high about Trump promising a lot more than Ukraine is willing to concede. An earlier mention of ""land swaps"" by Trump has raised hackles here.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has repeatedly asked for a seat at the table, which Trump says he'll work towards in Alaska. The president and Ukrainians have made it clear that they will not accept decisions on Ukraine that do not include Ukraine. 

Whether Trump is willing to actually follow through on his threats of sanctions and consequences for Russia if Putin doesn't play ball, especially after a sitdown with his ""good friend,"" is what many here in Kyiv will be looking out for.

An earthquake of a magnitude of 5.9 struck the east coast of Kamchatka, some 3,144 kilometers (1,952 miles) away from Anchorage, Alaska, where US President Trump and Russian President Putin are due to meet in a few hours.

The German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ) said the tremor occurred at 1011 UTC/GMT. 

Several tremors have hit Russia's east coast of Kamchatka in recent weeks, prompting tsunami warnings off the Russian coast as well as in Alaska and Hawaii, although these were later downgraded.

Exiled Russian opposition leader Yulia Navalnaya urged Presidents Putin and Trump to agree on the release of political prisoners from Russia and Ukraine who were detained for criticizing the war.

""Release Russian political activists and journalists, Ukrainian civilians, those who were imprisoned for anti-war statements and posts on social media,"" Navalnaya said in a video message on social media, hours ahead of the Alaska summit.

Navalnaya's husband, Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition figure, died in a Russian prison last year.

Alaska was once a Russian colony until it was sold to the US in the mid-19th century.

Here's why it's the perfect place to hold the upcoming Putin-Trump talks on Ukraine.

Read the full story on the Alaskan backdrop to the Trump-Putin meeting.

Moscow is going into the Alaska talks with the US with a ""clear and understandable"" stance, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said late on Thursday, as he arrived in Anchorage.

The Russian top diplomat said that much of the groundwork for the meeting was laid out during US envoy Steve Witkoff's visit to Moscow last week. He hoped to continue the ""useful conversation.""

""We know that we have arguments, a clear and understandable position. We will present them,""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Countries can't agree on how to stop plastic crisis","https://www.dw.com/en/countries-cant-agree-on-how-to-stop-plastic-crisis/a-73638280","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 11:27:24 GMT","

After limits on production and regulations of chemicals prevented agreement at UN talks in Geneva, what is next for the fight against plastic pollution?

The collapse of the latest UN plastic treaty negotiations once again laid bare a fault line in global environmental diplomacy: the clash between countries pushing for plastic production cuts and those defending fossil fuel-linked industries.

 ""At one end of the spectrum are the small island states, which are confronted with immense plastic pollution on their coasts and in their seas without contributing significantly to the pollution themselves,"" said Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's state secretary for the environment. At the other end, he added, are ""those countries whose economies are dominated by oil or the raw materials for plastic.""


While the failure to reach an agreement was widely anticipated, the sixth round of talks in Geneva revealed how entrenched interests , particularly from oil-producing states and major plastic manufacturers, continue to shape the trajectory of global efforts to curb plastic pollution.

""It is deeply disappointing to see some countries that are trying to block an agreement, a treaty that will give us the instruments needed to tackle plastic pollution, one of the biggest pollution problems we have on Earth,"" Danish Environment Minister Magnus Heunicke told DW early Friday morning after more than 180 nations failed to reach a deal.  

Negotiations on a binding UN treaty began in 2022. After three years of talks, securing a decisive commitment to reduce plastic production remained the central sticking point in Geneva.

Roughly 100 nations, including in Africa, Latin America, and the European Union, pushed for deep production cuts, regulation of toxic chemicals and a phase-out of single-use plastics in favor of reusable alternatives.  


But major producers and oil states in the ""like-minded"" group, including Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United States, resisted any binding limits. They favored focusing on waste management, leaving production largely untouched.

A revised draft presented Friday morning recognized that current plastic output levels are ""unsustainable"" and require global action to reverse the trend but stopped short of imposing binding limits.

Such limits were a red line for many countries in the like-minded bloc. Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti negotiators criticized the final proposal for addressing plastic production, which they consider outside the scope of the treaty.

Yet scientists have warned that capping production is essential to curb pollution and protect water, soil, oceans and human health. Marine scientist Melanie Bergmann of the Alfred Wegener Institute argues the world has already exceeded its planetary limits for plastic waste.

Microplastics have been found from the highest mountains to the deepest seas — and in human blood, breast milk, and vital organs — with links to strokes, heart attacks, and other health risks.

Plastics, 99% of which are derived from fossil fuels, contribute to greenhouse gas emissions at every stage, from production to disposal.

Meeting the Paris Agreement climate goals and limiting planetary heating would require cutting plastic production by at least 12 to 19%, yet just 9% of plastic is recycled. The rest is burned, landfilled, or escapes into the environment.  

Observers noted the fossil fuel and chemical industry's strong presence at negotiations, with their registered lobbyists outnumbering the diplomatic delegations of all 27 European nations and the EU combined, according to analysis from Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL).

Countries were also divided on placing legally binding controls on the chemicals used in plastics, with the high-ambition bloc wanting tighter regulation.  

Some 16,000 chemicals are used in plastics production, with more than 4,000 known to be toxic and most of the rest poorly studied. Advocates had called for tighter controls on hazardous substances, stronger waste management rules, and clear financing commitments, especially for lower-income countries dealing with pollution.  

Several states' representatives, including from Norway, Australia and Tuvalu, said they were deeply disappointed to be leaving Geneva without a treaty. Delegations from countries such as Peru, Colombia, and island states like the Maldives and Panama had fought for stricter rules with passionate statements.

Commenting on an earlier draft of the text, Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, Panama's climate envoy, said, ""We will not sell out our children's future.""

Environment secretary Flasbarth said Germany and its EU partners would continue to build bridges and push for further negotiations to reach a global agreement.

Yet the absence of political heavyweights in Geneva also fueled doubts about how committed some in the ""high-ambition"" group were to the agreement. While several European environment ministers attended, Germany's federal environment minister was notably absent.


Germany, while part of the pro-ambition bloc, is also Europe's biggest plastic producer and home to chemical giants like BASF, Bayer, Merck and Henkel.

Recognizing those competing priorities, some observers stressed the need for cooperation across divergent national and industrial interests.

""There are governments that have very significant economic interests in this industry continuing, and we have to work together to figure out a way to resolve this crisis,"" said Graham Forbes, head of the Greenpeace delegation.

The Business Coalition for a Global Plastic Treaty and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation urged governments to continue striving for an agreement on ""harmonized regulations across the full lifecycle of plastics.""


But it remains unclear whether negotiations toward a UN plastic treaty will resume in their current form. Under existing rules, all countries must agree to adopt any proposal.

Luis Vayas Valdivieso, chair of the UN plastic talks, told AFP that countries and the secretariat ""will be working to try to find a date and also a place"" for continuing negotiations.

However, David Azoulay, director of environmental health at CIEL, said the negotiation process itself was broken and that high-ambition countries should leave to ""form a treaty of the willing.""

""The world does not need more plastic. The people know it, doctors know it, scientists know it, and the markets know it. The movement to end plastic pollution goes beyond just the treaty, and it does not end here,"" Azoulay added.

Donald Trump said he is “not going to be happy” unless a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine is agreed today. 

Speaking from Air Force One en route to Alaska for a summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, the US president said: “I want certain things. I want to see a ceasefire.

“This is not to do with Europe. Europe's not telling me what to do, but they're going to be involved in the process, obviously, as well Zelensky, but I want to see a ceasefire rapidly.

”I don't know if it's going to be today, but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today. Everyone said it can't be today, but I'm just saying I want the killing to stop.”

Mr Trump has also warned that he would “walk” if his meeting with Putin doesn't go well. 

“I think it's going to work out very well and if it doesn't, I'm going to head back home real fast,” he told Fox News on board Air Force One.

Mr Trump left Washington for Anchorage on Friday. His summit with Putin is scheduled to take place at 11.30am local time (8.30pm BST) at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

Putin has stopped over in the city of Magadan in Russia's far east, where he is expected to meet the local governor and visit an industrial facility.

Donald Trump has posted a video on Truth Social of his conversation with reporters on board Air Force One.

In the video, the US President called for a ceasefire but said that “nothing is set in stone” ahead of talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.

“This is not to do with Europe. Europe's not telling me what to do, but they're going to be involved in the process, obviously, as well Zelensky, but I want to see a ceasefire rapidly.

“I don't know if it's going to be today, but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today. Everyone said it can't be today, but I'm just saying I want the killing to stop.

“I'm in this to stop the killing. You know, we're not putting up any money. We're making money. They're buying our weapons, and we're sending them to Nato, and Nato is sending us big, beautiful checks.

“But that I don't care about. … But what I do care about is they lost last week 7,011 people, almost all soldiers; 36 people in a town which got hit by a missile.

“Over 7,000 soldiers. It's crazy.”

Donald Trump has said he does not know what would make his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin a success.

Asked what would make the meeting a success, he told reporters aboard Air Force One: “I can't tell you that. I don't know. There's nothing set in stone. I want certain things. I want a ceasefire.”

“I want to see a ceasefire rapidly... I'm not going to be happy if it's not today,” he said, adding that Europe and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would also be involved. “I want the killing to stop.”

General Alexus Grynkewich, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, is in Alaska to provide “military advice” to Donald Trump and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, a source has told AP.

“Gen. Grynkewich, as the commander of both NATO and U.S. forces in Europe, is in Alaska to provide military advice to President Trump and Secretary Hegseth as President Trump tries to bring this war to a peaceful close,” a senior NATO military official told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Gen Grynkewich is a supporter of Ukraine and views Russia as a clear threat to European security. He has previously spoken of the need to get military aid into Kyiv quickly, including after President Trump said in July that NATO would be coordinating deliveries of U.S weapons.

His presence in Alaska is likely to be welcomed by European leaders who have spent recent days trying to convince President Trump to be robust with President Putin and not to do a deal over Kyiv's head.

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin appear to be on friendly terms, but their representative lobby hacks are not so amenable.

The long security delay is causing frustration amongst some American journalists concerned their Russian counterparts will get a better seat at the summit.

One disgruntled journalist asks: “Can we make sure Americans are seated before the Russians?”

“This is America after all,” another adds.

American and Russia media have been kept apart on separate buses. Probably for good reason.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was still killing people on Friday and not showing that it wanted to end the war.

Ukraine's President said on the Telegram messenger: “On the day of the negotiations, they also kill people. And that says a lot.”

“The war continues. It continues precisely because there is no order, nor any indication that Moscow is preparing to end this war,” he added.

Russia has been racing to seize as much Ukrainian territory as possible ahead of peace talks with Donald Trump.

Russian sabotage and reconnaissance units punched through exposed defences in eastern Ukraine, slipping as far as six miles behind the front line in just 48 hours, according to battlefield reports.

Kyiv has since diverted special forces units to confront the insurgents on the ground in an attempt to prevent any more of Ukraine falling under Russia's control before the summit in Alaska.

Ukrainian forces have also evacuated Druzhkivka, a town near the front line in Donetsk, as intense fighting continues.

Hillary Clinton has posted on X: “If Donald Trump negotiates an end to Putin's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to cede territory, I'll nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize myself.”

Mrs Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state and Mr Trump's 2016 Democratic opponent, added: “Trump should know by now that he's not meeting with a friend of the United States today. 

He is meeting with an adversary who wants America's destruction and the end of the entire western alliance.”

It has long been thought that Mr Trump is desperate for a Nobel Peace Prize and has a particular grudge against Barack Obama for being decorated only eight months into his first term.

It was an early start for the world's media hoping to get a view of today's summit.

Tired-eyed hacks, including your two Telegraph reporters Connor Stringer and Dominic Nicholls, began the journey to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, where Donald Trump will meet Vladimir Putin at 11am.

It's 11 degrees on the ground and cloudy overhead.

After being herded onto awaiting school buses, we were shuttled to a holding area on the camp, where we now wait to be screened by the secret service.

The intense security is a sign of the scale of this meeting and the nervousness amongst officials tasked with making proceedings run as smoothly as possible.

Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev said ahead of the meeting on Ukraine between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump that the mood is “combative”, Russia's RIA news agency reported.

The leaders will discuss the full spectrum of US-Russia relations, not only Ukraine, and their talks will be aimed at restoring ties, said Dmitriev, who is responsible for investments and economic cooperation

The Kremlin has confirmed the talks are expected to last a minimum of six to seven hours, and that Trump will meet Putin at the steps of the Russian president's aircraft upon his arrival in Alaska.

“You can expect that it will take up a minimum of six to seven hours,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russia's Channel One state TV ahead of the summit, adding that Moscow anticipated a “productive” meeting.

Former US Vice President Mike Pence says he is “praying” for Donald Trump to “stand strong” during his meeting with Vladimir Putin. 

He added in a post on X: “A Ceasefire followed by a Just and Lasting Peace will only come through American Strength.”

Mr Pence served as Vice President from 2017 to 2021 during President Trump's first term but the pair fell out after the January 6 Capitol riots.

Increasingly targeted in immigration raids, Mixteco and Triqui communities hold festivals of resistance.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

In many agricultural fields of the West Coast of the United States, you're more likely to hear Mixtec or Triqui languages spoken than Spanish. Both are common among the Indigenous people of southern Mexico, some of whom now pick grapes for Napa and Sonoma County's prestige wineries, or apples in century-old orchards. Without their labor, rural economies in California would collapse.

Yet Mixteco and Triqui migrants are being increasingly targeted in immigration raids terrorizing California's rural communities. In farmworker families, mothers and fathers now give their children phone numbers to call if parents are abducted on the way to or from work. It can be an act of bravery simply to walk to the store, or to drive a car at night.

That made it an act of resistance when Triquis and Mixtecos in the Sonoma County town of Healdsburg came out in late July to celebrate the unique culture they've brought with them over the course of their 2,000-mile journey from Oaxaca and Guerrero. They call their festival the Guelaguetza — a celebration featuring a fabulous display of dancers in elaborate masks and tall headdresses, performing to music from home. Indigenous towns in Mexico often have their own dance; the Guelaguetza brings them together in all their vivid variety.

Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.

The main Guelaguetza is held in Oaxaca itself, but over the last four decades, the number of Mixtecos, Triquis, Chatinos, and other Indigenous peoples in the U.S. has grown so large that there are now several Guelaguetzas held each year north of the border. Indigenous communities organize dance troupes partly to show off their culture, and partly to give young people growing up in the U.S. a chance to learn the language and dances, and to imagine a home they may have never seen.

When Healdsburg's Triquis decided to do a Guelaguetza, it would be, as one organizer told Truthout, a Guelaguetza de Resistencia, or a Resistance Guelaguetza. The act of simply dancing in public on a Sunday in the town plaza was a way of saying, “Aqui Estamos, y no nos vamos” — “We're here, and we're not leaving.” And even Healdsburg's mayor and one of its council members attended, offering their welcome. 

The late Mixteco community leader Rufino Dominguez-Santos explained that dances and language are not just a way to celebrate identity, but are an essential glue that keeps communities together, helping them survive in a hostile environment. “Beyond organizing and teaching our rights,” he told Truthout back in 2006, “we try to save our language. Even though 500 years have passed since the Spanish conquest, we still speak it. We are preserving our way of dancing, and rescuing our lost beliefs — that nature is something sacred for us, just as it was for our ancestors.”

In these photographs, Healdsburg's Indigenous community activists showcase their deep roots. In spite of fear and racism, the culture of their hometowns in Mexico have been reproduced and they now celebrate thousands of miles further north in California.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The lawsuit also sought to block Trump's DEA administrator from becoming the police force's “interim commissioner.”

Washington, DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb on Friday filed a lawsuit to block United States Attorney General Pam Bondi from taking over the US capital city's police department.

The lawsuit accused the Trump administration of violating the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, a 1973 law that delegated certain powers over the city once held by the federal government to local government officials.

Schwalb argued in the lawsuit that the Home Rule Act gives the president of the United States a very limited set of powers over the governance of the city's police force, as it states that the president may commandeer the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) if he “determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist” that require the MPD to help fulfill “federal purposes.”

Schwalb further noted that the timeframe for this authority is extremely limited. In all, the president can take command of MPD for just 48 hours unless he sends proper notice to the US Congress, after which he will have command over it for a maximum of 30 days.

“For the president to obtain MPD's services for longer than 30 days — even in the face of an ongoing emergency — Congress must pass a joint resolution permitting the extension,” Schwalb argued.

The DC attorney general then poked holes in Trump's claims that a federal takeover of MPD was necessary due to a crime emergency.

“The president did not identify any new or unusual exigency that justified the invocation of [emergency powers],” Schwalb alleged. “Instead, he claimed that violent crime in the district is ‘increasing,' when, in fact, it has fallen 26% since 2024. The president also did not limit the scope of his order to specific ‘federal purposes,' instead directing the mayor to provide any services the attorney general deemed necessary to ‘maintain law and order in the Nation's seat of Government.'”

Schwalb also claimed that the Trump administration flatly broke the law when it appointed Terrance Cole, the current administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to serve as MPD's “interim commissioner.” He said that this action would greatly harm MPD's ability to enforce the law and maintain public safety.

“Imposing a new command structure ‘effective immediately' will wreak operational havoc within MPD,” he wrote. “The new command structure will create confusion for MPD personnel, who are required under district law to respect and obey the chief of police as the head and chief of the police force.”

He emphasized that “this will also inevitably lead to delays and confusion as MPD personnel… are forced to run their directives by an ‘Emergency Commissioner' who is unfamiliar with MPD procedures and the local communities MPD serves,” before warning that “there is no greater risk to public safety in a large, professional police force like MPD than to not know who is in command.”

Schwalb concluded his complaint by asking the court to vacate Bondi's order of the federal takeover of MPD, and also to permanently block DEA Administrator Cole from assuming “any position of command” within the department.

In a statement separate from the lawsuit itself, Schwalb charged that “the administration's unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call DC home” and “this is the gravest threat to home rule that the district has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it.”

“By declaring a hostile takeover of MPD,” said Schwalb, “the administration is abusing its limited, temporary authority under the Home Rule Act, infringing on the district's right to self-governance and putting the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The unit aims to give the military leeway “so countries like America wouldn't stop supplying weapons,” one source said.

The Israeli military operates a special unit known as the “Legitimization Cell” that exists to create propaganda justifying the military's targeting of civilian infrastructure and civilians, particularly journalists, in order to ensure that Israel maintains its legitimacy on the world stage, an investigation finds.

According to a +972 Magazine and Local Call investigation published Thursday, the Legitimization Cell is a public relations unit that is tasked with finding a narrative to create cover for some of the most highly criticized actions by Israel's military.

“If the global media is talking about Israel killing innocent journalists, then immediately there's a push to find one journalist who might not be so innocent — as if that somehow makes killing the other 20 acceptable,” an Israeli intelligence source told journalist Yuval Abraham.

“The idea was to [allow the military to] operate without pressure, so countries like America wouldn't stop supplying weapons,” another Israeli source said.

Observers have seen this pattern play out numerous times, including in the recent assassination of famous Gaza journalist Anas Al-Sharif, who Israel killed along with five other Al Jazeera journalists earlier this week. Israel has long smeared Al-Sharif as a member of Hamas — claims that he always denied and for which Israel has not provided any evidence that can  be independently verified. 

Israel does this regularly. Last year, after killing Al Jazeera journalist Ismail al-Ghoul, Israeli officials claimed that he was given a Hamas military ranking in 2007 — when al-Ghoul was only 10 years old.

“[T]hree intelligence sources said the army treated the media as an extension of the battlefield, allowing it to declassify sensitive intelligence for public release,” said the investigation.

+972 and Local Call report that the Legitimization Cell is responsible for narratives like its denial of responsibility for the strike on Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City in October 2023 — a high-profile strike that killed hundreds of Palestinians. The bombing gained widespread media attention as one of Israel's first strikes on Gaza's health care system that it has now destroyed, with Al-Ahli put out of service by Israeli attacks. 

A flood of disinformation sourced from the military — much of which was later debunked by numerous investigations — followed the attack. The day after, the Legitimization Unit put out a recording of a phone call that it claimed was between two Hamas operatives saying that the hospital was struck by a misfired Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket. 

But this claim was roundly debunked by analysts and multiple news outlets. And the phone call, too, was fake — a Palestinian human rights activist told +972 and Local Call that it was actually a benign phone call between him and his civilian friend that had been intercepted by the military. Israel keeps a huge database of Palestinians' phone calls as part of its vast surveillance network.

In response to the report, the Israeli military outright admitted that Israeli military intelligence maintains “research teams” that have the goal of “discredit[ing]” journalists reporting from Gaza who are supposedly “Hamas members.”

But, despite supposedly being responsible for finding journalists' ties to Hamas, the “research teams do not play a role in the selection of individual targets to be attacked,” the report finds — meaning that they are looking for justification after the fact.

“There was this phrase, ‘That's good for legitimacy,'” one source told +972 and Local Call. “The goal was simply to find as much material as possible to serve hasbara efforts.”

Sources recalled a case where the Legitimization Unit falsely represented a journalist as a member of Hamas's military wing, saying that the propaganda research cell was “eager” and “excited” about the narrative. “In the end, they realized he really was a journalist,” and he wasn't targeted, one source claimed.

Israel has long had a robust propaganda operation — so robust, in fact, that Israel has exported some of its intelligence and surveillance technologies. Members of one of its well-known intelligence units, Unit 8200, are trained in Israel but go on to work across numerous sectors, including as journalists in the U.S. at outlets key to shaping American opinion.

This month, the Ukrainian journalist Victoriia Roshchyna was finally laid to rest in a cemetery in Kyiv. She had disappeared in August 2023 while investigating abuses by Russian forces in occupied areas of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region. After more than a year in Russian custody, she was to be released as part of a prisoner swap between Kyiv and Moscow. But she died before the exchange took place. Russian authorities eventually repatriated her body, which showed signs of torture.

Last October, when news broke of Roshchyna's death, Donald Trump was running for U.S. president and repeatedly promising that if elected, he would end Russia's war against Ukraine “in one day.” But the war grinds on, with Russian forces intensifying attacks across the frontline and ramping up long-range strikes on Ukrainian cities. Expectations are low that Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin today in Alaska will resolve the many important questions that the warring parties must iron out, such as security guarantees for Ukraine and the future of the occupied territories.

But the many thousands of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) and captured civilians held in the occupied territories and in Russia proper, as well as the hundreds of Ukrainian children put up for adoption after they were deported to Russia, cannot wait for a negotiated end to the armed conflict that could take years to materialize. Nor can the scores of Russian nationals imprisoned for their antiwar stance or actions. Every day that Ukrainians and Russian political prisoners remain in custody comes with a risk that they will share Roshchyna's fate.

Releasing war captives may be the one thing that all parties can quickly agree on. In June, Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, noted the importance of Russian-Ukrainian negotiations from a “humanitarian perspective” and spoke of the hundreds of captured Russian soldiers who were able to “return home” following a prisoner swap that Kyiv and Moscow agreed to during negotiations in Istanbul. Throughout the spring and summer, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky repeatedly declared that “bringing home” Ukrainian captives was “a top priority” for his government. Kyiv's backers share this concern. The European Union and the Council of Europe have strongly emphasized the need for Moscow to release Ukrainian detainees. So has the United States, which, in a joint statement with Ukraine published in March, demanded that the Kremlin prioritize “the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of deported Ukrainian children.” Qatar, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have all been involved in mediating prisoner swaps and in efforts to secure the repatriation of Ukrainian children.

The U.S. administration must now emphasize the need to release and repatriate wartime detainees in its negotiations with Moscow. This is not just an idealistic goal. Because an agreement for both sides to free civilian detainees and exchange POWs is relatively low-hanging fruit in diplomacy with the Kremlin, securing it could help smooth the way for talks over more vexing issues. And in the meantime, a deal could meaningfully reduce the human suffering this war inflicts daily. It is too late to save Roshchyna, who was just 27 years old when she died in Russian detention. But thousands of war captives can still come home.

The exact number of POWs held by Russia and Ukraine and civilian detainees held by Russia is unknown, but according to estimates by both Russian and Ukrainian officials, the number is in the thousands. In the past 12 months, hundreds of POWs have been released in exchanges. In talks in Istanbul in May, Kyiv and Moscow agreed to the first large-scale prisoner swap of the war: 1,000 from each side. (Roughly every eighth prisoner released by Russia as part of that swap turned out to be a civilian, not a combatant; detaining civilians for the purpose of exchanging them as “prisoners of war” could constitute the war crime of hostage taking.) The swap was followed by several substantial exchanges over the course of the summer, including exchanges of gravely wounded or ill POWs and exchanges of the bodies of fallen soldiers.

In a recent report, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) referenced interviews with 117 Ukrainian POWs who had returned to Ukraine in exchanges after more than two years in captivity. In most of the cases, the interviews confirmed “patterns of widespread and systematic torture and ill-treatment.” Former POWs spoke of “severe beatings, stress positions, electric shocks, dog attacks, sexual violence, prolonged standing or exhaustive exercising and humiliation.”

The report also flagged that between December 2024 and May 2025, Russian courts convicted at least 125 Ukrainian POWs on terrorism-related charges over actions that were, in fact, lawful acts of war. According to the Geneva Conventions, POWs may not be tried for merely participating in hostilities as combatants. They, like any other soldiers, can and should be prosecuted for their actions in war if those actions involve war crimes or crimes against humanity, such as acts of torture or the deliberate killing of civilians. Russian authorities, however, commonly prosecute Ukrainian POWs based on false confessions to war crimes extracted through torture.



In addition to POWs, Russia holds thousands of Ukrainian civilian detainees—more than 16,000, according to Ukraine's human rights commissioner. Most of them were detained by Russian forces and their proxies in occupied areas of Ukraine on suspicion of providing intelligence to Ukrainian authorities, for speaking out against the occupation, or for refusing to collaborate with occupying authorities. These civilians are then either jailed in the occupied territories or deported to Russia and imprisoned there. Most are denied contact with their loved ones and access to lawyers. OHCHR documented hundreds of such cases soon after the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, a leading Ukrainian civil society organization, has verified the identities and whereabouts of 1,863 Ukrainian civilians in Russian detention.

Russian authorities have prosecuted some detained Ukrainian civilians on terrorism, espionage, and other politically motivated charges. For example, Iryna Horobtsova, a civic activist, was detained in May 2022 by Russian authorities in Kherson when that city was under occupation. She was unlawfully transferred to occupied Crimea, given a trial that was closed to the public, convicted of espionage, and sentenced to ten years in prison. Another civilian, Iryna Kulish, a housewife in her 50s, was arrested by Russian security agents in October 2023 in the occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region. They held her in secret detention for 20 days, and through torture and threats forced her to confess to having planned to plant an explosive device at a polling station before a referendum on the incorporation of the Zaporizhzhia region into Russia. Kulish was then deported to Russia and tried before a military court on terrorism charges. She is now serving an eight-year sentence. Kulish suffers from a medical condition that is rapidly deteriorating without adequate medical assistance. Her lawyer told Human Rights Watch this summer that she has tremors in her hands so severe that she cannot sleep at night.

Russia invents false charges because it has no legal basis to hold Ukrainian civilians in custody. These civilians should all be released and allowed to return to their homes immediately and without condition. Instead, they are unlawfully used as bargaining chips in POW exchanges and suffer inhumane treatment while in confinement. In October 2024, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, which was established by the United Nations after Russia's full-scale invasion to investigate alleged human rights abuses and violations of the laws of war, concluded after extensive research that the torture of Ukrainian civilians and POWs in Russian custody is widespread, systematic, and driven by coordinated state policy. It therefore constitutes a crime against humanity.

Among the Ukrainian civilians transferred to Russia since February 2022 are thousands of Ukrainian children—a war crime for which the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Putin and Russia's children's rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova. Russian authorities and their proxies took many of the children from boarding schools and care homes for children with disabilities or children in difficult family circumstances in occupied areas of Ukraine. The children were deported without their families' consent and placed in Russian orphanages or, in some cases, handed over to foster families. Russian authorities have shared no information with Ukraine about the children's identities or whereabouts.

After the full-scale invasion, the U.S. State Department under President Joe Biden began funding Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab to track down the deported Ukrainian children. By scouring Russian adoption databases and conducting other open-source research, including satellite imagery analysis, the lab found thousands of children. It identified more than 40 Russian facilities housing deported Ukrainian children and determined the locations of more than 300 children who had been adopted.

Russian authorities insist that all the Ukrainian children brought to Russian territory were “evacuated” for their own protection from areas with active hostilities. But the laws of war prohibit a warring party from transferring children who are not its own nationals without their parents' or guardians' written consent, except as a temporary measure for compelling health or safety reasons. Moscow's refusal to provide Ukrainian authorities with a list of deported children and their locations, its assignment of Russian citizenship to many deported children, and its decision to put them up for adoption clearly indicate that Russia by no means considers the evacuations temporary. In November 2022, the UN Children's Fund raised alarms about the last practice in particular, flagging in the guidance it issued for protecting Ukrainian children that adoption “should never occur during or immediately after an emergency.”



Yale researchers also found that Ukrainian children in Russia were being indoctrinated with anti-Ukrainian propaganda in an attempt to erase their national and cultural identities and sever their ties with their home country. Teachers and orphanage workers reprimanded children who spoke Ukrainian or criticized the war. Some children were placed in military training in Russian youth camps or sent to study in Russian military academies.

In March, the Trump administration abruptly withdrew the Yale lab's funding as part of its sweeping budget cuts. The researchers lost access to the data they had collected, as the database belonged to the U.S. government under the terms of the contract with the lab. After a public outcry, the administration restored the lab's funding through July 1 and allowed the lab to transfer its data to the European Union's law enforcement agency, Europol. But researchers do not have the resources to update the database since. As the Russian state continues to relocate children and move forward with adoptions, the lab's data may soon become obsolete—unless the Trump administration or a private institution funds the work needed to resume investigations. In June, during the talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian negotiators presented their Russian counterparts with a list of 339 kidnapped children, seeking their immediate return; accurate information will be crucial to compiling future such lists.

The final group of captives is composed of Russians who have spoken up or taken action against the war—and who have paid a high price for doing so. The list of political prisoners maintained by the Russian human rights organization Memorial currently includes 269 cases, with over a thousand additional cases under investigation. A prisoner swap among Germany, Russia, and the United States in August 2024 resulted in the release of the prominent opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza, the human rights defender Oleg Orlov, and a few others who had been imprisoned in Russia over their antiwar stance. But the number of prosecutions of domestic war critics keeps rising.

Rights groups such as Memorial, OVD-Info, and others have documented a pattern of ill treatment of political prisoners in Russia. The authorities arbitrarily place dissidents in solitary confinement and cells with extremely harsh conditions for alleged disciplinary violations, deny them family visits, hinder their access to lawyers, and fail to provide them with adequate medical care.

Ukraine's leaders have made it clear that they are willing to release Russian prisoners in their custody in exchange for Ukrainian POWs and civilian detainees. The return of Russian POWs is important for the Kremlin's own constituency, especially the families of POWs, active-duty soldiers, and members of the public who could be mobilized to serve in the armed forces. In his speeches and media comments, Putin frequently says that “Russia does not leave our own behind.”

For the Kremlin, a limited humanitarian concession would cost little and could improve relations between Moscow and Washington—a major objective for Putin. Washington should use the summit in Alaska and other channels to Moscow to help secure the release of war captives. Some of Kyiv's European allies, such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, have already stressed the urgency of releasing all war captives; they should encourage Trump to engage directly with Putin on this issue. Other countries that maintain working relations with Russia can bring pressure to bear, too. Qatar and the UAE are already engaged in efforts to secure the repatriation of abducted Ukrainian children, and Turkey and the UAE have acted as mediators for previous POW exchanges. They can now play bigger roles in convincing the Kremlin to release wartime detainees. Turkey in particular has a good deal of leverage with Russia, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said repeatedly, including this week, that Turkey is eager to host a meeting between Putin, Trump, and Zelensky. A call by Erdogan for the Kremlin to release war captives would be a powerful humanitarian gesture and would be well received by the Turkish president's domestic and international audiences.

For the thousands of Ukrainian POWs and civilians in Russian custody, each passing day brings more brutality, torture, and indignity. For the thousands of Ukrainian children deported to Russia, each day in exile erodes their connection to their Ukrainian families and identity. And for imprisoned Russian war critics, each day behind bars compounds the injustice they face. The fate of Russia's war captives is a humanitarian issue that can be resolved soon. There isn't a moment to lose.

YUN SUN is Director of the China Program at the Stimson Center.

 Yun Sun

In the wake of Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election in 2024, Chinese policymakers and intellectual elites feared the worst for relations between China and the United States. The bitterness and trauma of the first Trump administration's trade war lingered in Beijing. And with an already sluggish economy and glaring vulnerabilities from trade interdependence, China's leaders braced for what experts privately called an “unprecedented storm” that could doom bilateral relations.

Six months into Trump's second term, however, the outlook in Beijing has improved markedly. The storm came and went—and left Chinese policymakers feeling that they have far more power and leverage over the United States on trade than they had previously imagined. And for now, at least, Beijing views the trade-deficit-obsessed Trump as a more pragmatic and adaptable partner to work with than the China hawks that called the shots during Trump's first term.

China's leaders now believe they can broker a trade deal with Trump to reduce tensions. They are eager to host a summit between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping this fall to establish a more positive tone for the relationship between Washington and Beijing. The newfound optimism does not mean that Beijing thinks it has found a permanent solution to U.S.-Chinese relations, however; the overwhelming feeling in elite circles in China remains that the two countries are entangled in long-term strategic competition. But China's leaders want to use their trade leverage to craft a deal that will buy them time to mitigate their political and security vulnerabilities. In dealing with a second Trump administration, China's leaders believe they may have found an opportunity to achieve their goals without a war with the United States.

When Trump was inaugurated for a second time on January 20, 2025, Beijing expected that he would resume bilateral relations where he had left them four years earlier. That meant revamped efforts by his administration to address the trade imbalance between the United States and China, likely through aggressive punitive tariffs. Beijing also braced itself for U.S. criticism of China's political regime, including its treatment of minority groups and dissidents, and worried about enhanced U.S. support for Taiwan.

Early signs confirmed these suspicions. In February and March, Trump imposed two rounds of ten percent tariffs on Chinese exports because of concerns about fentanyl coming into the United States from China. When China responded to Trump's broader “Liberation Day” tariffs in April with countermeasures including reciprocal tariffs and export restrictions, the United States placed an additional 125 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States. Combined with existing levies, by mid-April, the U.S. tariff rate for goods from China had reached nearly 150 percent—a major escalation that didn't seem to offer any way out.

But then the situation took an interesting turn. Many observers believed that China had taken a major risk by pushing back on Trump and that China's economy would not be able to withstand a trade war. But once reciprocal tariffs were in place, Beijing was surprised to see that it was Washington that was more eager to de-escalate trade tensions. The United States and China signed an agreement in Geneva on May 12 to reduce tariff rates, and Trump and Xi had a follow-up phone call on June 5. Although the agreement did not eliminate tariffs, the first round of trade escalation was over. China's leaders felt, to their surprise, that they were in a very strong position on trade with the United States.

Many policymakers in Beijing concluded from the events in April and May that the United States' ability to tolerate a trade shock is weaker than China's, which made Washington desperate to find a solution. As Adam Posen has argued in Foreign Affairs, the “supply shock” that the United States faces from higher tariffs is more difficult to absorb than the “demand shock” on China. This is not only because U.S. consumers immediately feel a supply shortage but also because China's political system makes it easier for Beijing to manipulate domestic public opinion and limit blowback. Chinese leaders were pleased to discover that Trump changed his tune when tariffs affected the stock market, the bond market, the retail industry, and consumers. The U.S. reaction to Trump's tariffs revealed to Beijing new pressure points that China could potentially exploit.

China's leaders also learned how dependent the United States is on rare-earth elements and magnets, the supply of which is almost entirely in Beijing's hands. China halted exports of key rare earths on April 4, which threatened the ability of the United States to procure the metals it needs to manufacture cars, airplanes, and other products. At the May meeting in Geneva, China agreed to remove the restrictions on rare-earth exports it had imposed in response to “Liberation Day”; yet after accusing Washington of violating the agreement by placing new restrictions on Chinese companies, including prohibiting U.S. companies from using AI chips made by the technology company Huawei, China delayed following through with its commitment.

The ensuing confrontation further proved to China's leaders the effectiveness of their leverage over the United States. Beijing's reluctance to release more rare earths infuriated Washington, which responded with visa restrictions on Chinese students and export restrictions on jet engines. What China's leaders learned from this response was that rare earths are so important to U.S. industry that Washington will go to extreme lengths to protect their supply. For many Chinese policymakers, rare earths are China's first effective strategic chokepoint in the history of U.S.-Chinese relations.

Beijing also realized that its efforts over the past decade to boost economic resilience have paid off. Starting in 2018, China reduced its dependence on U.S. supply chains and diversified the sources of its imports and exports. By the end of 2024, in terms of total value, China traded more with the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations than with the United States. The extensive use of transshipment—funneling Chinese goods through other countries, often emerging economies—also cushions Chinese exports from some shocks of a bilateral trade war because it complicates attempts to impose direct sanctions on China. The Trump administration has been trying to crack down on transshipment in its ongoing trade negotiations, but any transshipment penalties will be nearly impossible to enforce unless Washington fully retreats from the world economy and stops trading with any country that has ties to China.

In policy dialogues in Beijing this summer, Chinese scholars and decisionmakers repeated a simple phrase that captured their newfound sense of empowerment: “So what?” “There is a trade war. So what?” “Trump might dial up the pressure on China. So what?” When discussing how China might react to Trump's unpredictability even if there is a trade deal, Chinese decision-makers appeared fully confident in their ability to weather the storm. There is now a conviction that the United States' ability to damage China's economic interests through tariffs has declined, which offers Beijing more latitude in future trade negotiations.

China's policymakers now believe that the United States is unlikely to launch another round of major tariffs on China if doing so would hurt the United States significantly in the process. As a result, Beijing sees a path forward through regular and piecemeal trade negotiations, which suits its preferences. China's leaders are happy to negotiate short-term fixes to the trade imbalance, especially if doing so avoids addressing the long-term structural issues in the Chinese economy that are harder to change, such as widespread government subsidies of local industry. Beijing, for instance, is willing to increase Chinese purchases of American products in exchange for the United States' easing some export controls on high-tech products. Beijing is even willing to discuss voluntary export restrictions to hold back shipments of certain Chinese products, such as batteries, to the United States, which would help reduce the trade imbalance.

Beijing is also optimistic about a short-term deal because of the differences it perceives between the first and the second Trump administrations. Unlike during Trump's first term, in which anti-China “new cold warriors” shaped policy, the second Trump administration has made little reference to ideology and mostly avoided criticizing the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. In the past six months, Washington has also been restrained in its support of Taiwan: not only did Trump impose new 20 percent tariffs on Taiwan at the end of July, he also refused to allow Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te to use New York as a stopover during Lai's scheduled international travel—departing from a long tradition in U.S.-Taiwanese relations. In other words, Trump's focus on trade and his indifference to sensitive political issues is exactly what Beijing has long sought from U.S. leaders. It's almost as if Chinese leaders finally got the “businessman” they expected to deal with when Trump was first elected in 2016.



In Trump's first term, Beijing tried to manage the president by managing his team, including by setting up a backchannel for negotiations through Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. This approach failed, partly because of conflicting priorities among members of the Trump administration. This time around, Beijing believes its best option is to manage Trump himself. Negotiating directly with the president, rather than working behind the scenes, appears to be the most likely way to shape Trump's agenda. Trump has also more clearly set the priorities for his current administration than he did for the previous one. Trump's team has been extremely loyal to his policy agenda: even Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who harshly criticized China's human rights record and authoritarian political system when he was in the U.S. Senate, has been restrained in his criticisms of China while running the State Department.

Getting face time with Trump is thus increasingly important for China. This is why Beijing is hoping for a leadership summit in the fall in China. In the view of Chinese leaders, for whom each foreign policy action carries important symbolic weight, it is Trump's turn to visit China: Xi visited the United States in 2023, so the next presidential visit should be in China to show the equality of the relationship. Chinese leaders hope to use this meeting to appeal directly to Trump and probe his appetite for any kind of grand bargain that might reduce political tensions. For example, China hopes it can get the United States to concede on some of its policies supporting Taiwan, such as reducing U.S. arms sales or more firmly signaling U.S. commitment to oppose any Taiwanese attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. The goal of winning such concessions is not to immediately make it possible for China to take Taiwan by force, but to further shake Taiwanese confidence in the U.S. commitment to the island.

Beijing's sense of empowerment on trade, however, has not translated into overall optimism about China's long-term relationship with the United States. Many Chinese leaders don't believe a trade deal is Trump's endgame, despite his focus on trade deficits. Instead, they see reaching a trade deal as the first step in the long process of reshaping U.S.-Chinese relations, with U.S. policymakers then free to focus on whatever the next source of friction might be.

China's community of foreign policy scholars and decisionmakers fears such a shift in U.S. attention. The common anxiety is that positive trade signals from the United States are tactical and ephemeral, and therefore it is only a matter of time before Washington resumes hostility toward China and its political system. The Trump administration could renew its campaign to target Communist Party members and their families, which involved limiting access to visas to travel to the United States, or it could ramp up support for Taiwan through political, economic, military, and diplomatic assistance. Beijing also does not want the United States to increase efforts that, as Chinese foreign policy insiders often put it, attempt to “separate the Chinese Communist Party from the Chinese people,” which the party perceives as a fundamental attack on its rule, nor does it want the United States to reinvigorate a global anti-China coalition that could isolate Beijing. Unlike with trade issues, in which Beijing is approaching the table with confidence and sees room for dealmaking, a focus on politics will only push the bilateral relationship toward free fall. To Beijing, this is what happened in 2020 when Washington blamed China for the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a series of increasingly bitter public recriminations from both sides and drove U.S.-Chinese relations to new lows.

Beijing's confidence in trade negotiations combined with its worries about long-term tensions between the two countries may encourage China to deliberately prolong the trade negotiation process to keep the conversation going even after a first agreement to address trade imbalances, fentanyl sales, and the free flow of rare earths. Beijing feels it can withstand U.S. pressure as long as the main issue is trade, not politics. In addition, China is likely to specify rescission clauses in any potential deal to give it flexibility to respond to the Trump administration. If Trump changes his mind about focusing on trade, or if Washington targets China on political issues and takes hostile actions against Beijing on Taiwan, China is ready to flex its muscles by refusing to implement its side of the trade deal and to retaliate with its own economic measures.

As Beijing looks toward the next stage of dealmaking, it remains on edge about which version of the Trump administration will emerge. Beijing wants face-to-face negotiations with Trump, focused on economic and trade issues, to tie his hands with a commitment to positive and friendly U.S.-Chinese relations for the next three years at least. But its plan could backfire. China's inflated sense of empowerment on trade could leave its policymakers too comfortable, which could provoke a harsher U.S. response and send bilateral relations back into a tailspin of mutual distrust and hostility. In many ways, policymakers and analysts in Beijing believe an eventual downturn in relations is inevitable. And given Trump's unpredictability, an initial trade deal may turn out to be a short-lived reprieve. No matter how strong China's leaders feel their position is vis-à-vis the United States after six months of Trump's second term, they feel there is no choice but to prepare for the likely possibility that much worse is yet to come.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","It's now possible to give yourself a flu vaccine at home","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/15/health/first-us-home-flu-vaccine-launch-flumist-astrazeneca","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT","


            For the first time, many people in the United States who want to protect themselves against the flu this respiratory virus season can order a vaccine to give themselves at home.
    


            AstraZeneca's FluMist, the only nasal spray flu vaccine in the US that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, is now available for home delivery in 34 states under the brand name FluMist Home. It can be self-administered by adults under 50 and to children as young as 2 with the help of a parent or caregiver.
    


            The online ordering platform includes a brief medical screening questionnaire to be reviewed by a licensed health-care provider before prescribing the vaccine. It is covered by most commercial insurance, with an $8.99 fee for shipping and handling.
    


            FluMist has been on the market for more than two decades, receiving initial FDA approval in 2003. In September 2024, the FDA gave the green light for the nasal spray vaccine to be self-administered but it wasn't ready to reach the public in time for last respiratory virus season.
    


            Experts say this novel option for self-administration could be a useful tool to help improve vaccination rates at a critical time.
    


            Last flu season was unusually intense and severe. Preliminary estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that there were up to 82 million illnesses, 1.3 million hospitalizations and 130,000 deaths from flu between October 2024 and May 2025 – but less than half of kids and adults in the US had gotten their annual flu vaccine.
    


            The general public is becoming “increasingly comfortable” with home administration of drugs and biologics such as Covid-19 tests and GLP-1 injections, said Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatrician who co-directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital.
    


            “We learned during Covid how home diagnostic testing became widely accepted and that turned out to be a great public health intervention,” Hotez said. “Given the low uptake of seasonal flu vaccine in America, I think it is worth exploring some novel approaches.”
    


            With the rise of vaccine hesitancy and other challenges, it's key to remove as many barriers as possible, said Elizabeth Bodin, vice president of AstraZeneca's US respiratory and immunology vaccines and immune therapies team.
    


            “There can be many reasons that patients maybe don't get vaccinated, but one of them can be the practical elements of booking appointments, convenience, being able to get in to see the doctor,” she said. “The ability to go online and with a couple of clicks to be able to order FluMist, have it reviewed by a health care provider to ensure it's appropriate for you and your family and have it delivered to your doorstep, that can remove one of the barriers that may stand in the way of people getting vaccinated.”
    


            The data AstraZeneca presented to the FDA for approval of FluMist Home included a “usability study” showing people can use it properly without a health-care provider present. The results showed that 100% of intended users administered a full dose, according to the drug company.
    


            A focus on patient-centered care creates pathways for people to take a leading role in their own health care, Bodin said.
    


            “The population that I see benefiting from FluMist Home the most are individuals who are busy convenience-seekers or busy families,” she said. “Maybe they're getting ready for back-to-school season, and it's one less item on their to-do list to book a clinic visit or a pharmacy visit. Knowing that they can bring FluMist Home right into their home and vaccinate on their schedule – the time they want, no waiting in line – makes it very manageable for them to ensure that they can protect their family for the upcoming flu season.”
    


            The vaccine that people can now self-administer at home will have the same vial, same vaccine formulation and same effectiveness as the FluMist used by health-care providers, AstraZeneca said.
    


            The vaccine is mailed in temperature-controlled packaging with a tag that patients scan to ensure the vaccine stayed at an appropriate temperature throughout the shipping process.  The vial includes two pre-measured doses – one to squirt into each nostril, separated by a clip – and there are a variety of materials to support those who have questions.
    


            FluMist is the only needle-free option available for flu vaccination in the US. It uses a live, weakened version of the influenza virus to provide protection, but injectable flu vaccines use different technology: either killed viruses or proteins to train the immune system to fight off the virus. AstraZeneca says FluMist has been shown to be as effective as other flu vaccines. 



            According to the FDA, the most commonly reported side effects of FluMist are runny nose and congestion, as well as a fever for young children and a sore throat in adults.
    


            The FDA issued recommendations for the the composition of the 2025-2026 flu vaccines in March, and Bodin says FluMist Home is “ready to target” the virus likely to impact Americans most in the upcoming season.

            In March, Kroger's CEO resigned from his corner-office role after nearly five decades at the company — an abrupt exit that left questions and $11 million on the table. Now, a lawsuit involving '90s folk sensation Jewel could bring some answers.
    


            Rodney McMullen, who joined Kroger in 1978, left after an internal investigation into “his personal conduct,” the grocer said in a statement at the time. The Cincinnati-based company had kept the details tightly under wraps.
    


            A lawsuit from 2023 might push Kroger or McMullen himself to reveal those details. In legal filings, the plaintiffs — which include a company co-owned by singer-songwriter Jewel Kilcher — accused Kroger of breach of contract over a wellness festival partnership. McMullen isn't a defendant in the lawsuit, but he was identified as a trial witness.
    


            McMullen and his lawyer refused to answer questions about his resignation during deposition this year and requested a protective order to bar questioning on the “embarrassing” topic, as described by his lawyer in court documents. But an Ohio judge had ordered McMullen to submit a written response by August 8 about his resignation, including the names of people involved.
    


            There will be “incredible consequences… if this ever gets out,” McMullen's lawyer, Jeffrey Hinebaugh, said in front of the judge in May.
    


            Hinebaugh added that “having to sit there and explain to people something that's completely unrelated and personal is the embarrassment.”
    


            The plaintiffs, meanwhile, said these questions are “routine” and could reveal the corporate culture at Kroger.
    


Kroger's CEO abruptly resigns after probe into personal conduct



            “We respect the court's thoughtful ruling, and we're pleased that the court is not giving Mr. McMullen a free pass to avoid testifying just because the former CEO's lawyer says that answering questions would be embarrassing,” Brian O'Connor, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement to CNN.
    


            CNN has reached out to Hinebaugh for comment. Kroger declined to comment.
    


            However, the public will not get its eyes on McMullen's written response. If the court grants the protective order, the statement will be made part of the record kept under seal – meaning it's only available under judicial eyes. And if the court denies the request, then the written disclosure won't be entered into the record at all.
    


            But if the court decides to deny the request, more information on McMullen's resignation may come out because the plaintiff's lawyers would be able to question the ex-CEO on the topic. A trial is set for May 2026.
    


            Jewel had come up with an idea for a wellness festival alongside Trevor Drinkwater, CEO of Inclusion Companies. Drinkwater's company already had experience creating other retail-sponsored, celebrity-backed festivals like Bentonville Film Festival.
    


            Jewel and Drinkwater then decided to partner with Kroger on the “Wellness Your Way” festivals for five years, according to the lawsuit. There was no formal agreement, but rather an agreement over email in June 2018 since Drinkwater's company would take the financial risk, the lawsuit said.
    


 Festivals under the partnership took place from 2018 to 2021, and Jewel performed a total of 12 times and and participated in 45 panels at these events, according to a legal complaint. But after the festivals became profitable, Kroger replaced Drinkwater and Jewel's company with one run by Kroger executive Colleen Lindholz's sister, legal filings allege. The plaintiffs argue this violated Kroger's business ethics policy. 



            “(Lindholz) also informed (Drinkwater) that the festival had become Kroger's premiere annual corporate event, the CEO Rodney McMullen wanted to make it a part of his legacy, and Kroger needed to have ownership and control of it,” the lawsuit said.
    


            Kroger and the new company, Advantage, went on to host two more festivals in 2022 and 2023. The lawsuit alleges the plaintiffs lost $2 million of their own money and profits of at least $5 million.
    


            McMullen told Jewel over email, “I'm not involved in planning of the Festival this year. That's Colleen's responsibility. Please communicate with her on this,” according to the lawsuit.
    


            McMullen resigned in March after a company investigation found his personal conduct was “inconsistent” with Kroger's ethics policies. The company said it did not involve Kroger's finances and no associates were involved.
    


            His resignation came a few months after Kroger rival Albertsons called off its $25 million merger with Kroger amid regulatory pressure. Albertsons subsequently sued Kroger for breach of contract agreement.
    


            Albertsons' lawyers, too, are curious about the circumstances leading to McMullen's departure. The company wants to compel Kroger to disclose McMullen's actions because it could have distracted him “or conflicted with his obligations to Kroger” during the doomed merger process.
    


            “McMullen's conduct and business ethics are central to this litigation,” Albertsons said in a motion filed late July. “Yet Kroger refuses to produce any documents regarding significant lapses of ‘business ethics' so serious they cost McMullen his job weeks after the Merger was blocked.”
    


            McMullen earned roughly $15.7 million in 2023, according to an SEC file. With his resignation, he forfeited more than $11 million in unvested stock and options, and any bonuses.

            DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit Friday against the Trump administration over its moves to take over the city's police department and appoint an emergency commissioner, the latest sign of pushback from district officials against the federal takeover.
    


            “By declaring a hostile takeover of (Metropolitan Police Department), the Administration is abusing its limited, temporary authority under the Home Rule Act, infringing on the District's right to self-governance and putting the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk,” Schwalb said in a statement. “The Administration's unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call DC home. This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it.”
    


            DC is also seeking a temporary restraining order.
    


            The case has been assigned to federal district Judge Ana Reyes, an appointee of former President Joe Biden. A hearing has been scheduled for 2 p.m.
    


            It comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday evening ordered the city's mayor and police department to accept Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, as the district's “emergency police commissioner” and give him full control of the department during the federal takeover — quickly drawing rebukes from the district's mayor and attorney general, who suggested they would not comply.
    


            Bondi's order formalized the federal government's control of DC police and directed Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and the Metropolitan Police Department to end the capital's sanctuary city policies.
    


            Bowser quickly rejected the order, writing on social media, “There is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.”
    


            “Let us be clear about what the law requires during a Presidential declared emergency: it requires the mayor of Washington, DC to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal purposes at the request of the President,” Bowser said. “We have followed the law.”
    


            In a filing as part of the lawsuit, MPD Chief Pamela Smith said the takeover places officers and residents at “grave risk.”
    


            “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Smith said
    


            It is, Smith wrote, “placing the lives of MPD officers and District residents at grave risk.”
    


            Smith confirmed that she was “unaware of President Trump's plans to assume control of the local police force until he announced it at a press conference” on Monday.
    


            Friday's lawsuit marks a forceful response from city leaders after days of public statements largely appeasing Trump. Bowser has repeatedly said she wants to make sure the federal law enforcement surge is useful to the city, though she struck a more adversarial tone during an event this week, calling Trump's police department takeover an “authoritarian push.”
    


            Schwalb reviewed Bondi's order and declared it illegal, saying he determined the Home Rule Act did not give President Donald Trump the authority to remove or replace the chief of police, or alter the MPD chain of command.
    


            “It is my opinion that the Bondi order is unlawful, and that you are not legally obligated to follow it,” Schwalb said in a letter to Smith.
    


            Schwalb wrote in the letter the act “does not authorize the President, or his delegee, to remove or replace the Chief of Police; to alter the chain of command within MPD; to demand services directly from you, MPD, or anyone other than the Mayor, to rescind or suspend MPD orders or directives; or to set the general enforcement priorities of MPD or otherwise determine how the District pursues purely local law enforcement. The Bondi Order is, therefore, ultra vires.”
    


            Filed in US District Court, the suit argues the Trump administration is “brazenly violating” the Home Rule Act, which gives the president limited, temporary authority to request MPD services.
    


            “Congress did not grant the President authority to displace the Chief of Police, assert operational control over MPD, or rescind MPD policies — as the Administration seeks to do,” Schwalb said. “Congress also limited the President's authority to requesting services for ‘federal purposes,' such as protecting federal property or personnel — not dictating local enforcement of local laws.”
    


            The Department of Justice declined to respond to a request for comment.
    


            Bondi's order had further directed MPD to abandon a directive Smith signed earlier in the day giving officers limited ability to share information with federal immigration officials. And, the order said, MPD leaders “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole before issuing any further directives.”
    


            Justice Department officials believed that earlier directive was meant to reinforce the type of sanctuary city policies that DOJ has vowed to put an end to, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            In addition to ordering that the directive be rescinded, Bondi instructed Bowser to get rid of two additional police policies aimed at protecting undocumented migrants, including one that prevents MPD from arresting an individual solely for federal immigration warrants.
    


            This comes after Trump earlier this week declared a crime emergency and federalized DC's police, tapping Cole as interim federal commissioner of MPD.
    


            Schwalb wrote in his letter to Smith that Trump and Bondi are now overstepping their legal authority.
    


            “Having been duly appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the Council, you are the lawfully appointed Chief of Police of the District of Columbia,” Schwalb wrote to Smith. “Therefore, members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor.”
    


            CNN has reached out to MPD for comment.
    


            Bondi's move makes clear that the federal police takeover in DC will go hand-in-hand with the Trump administration's hardline immigration enforcement goals, using control over law enforcement in the district as a way to try to put an end to the city's laws that protect undocumented migrants.
    


            “DC will not remain a sanctuary city actively shielding criminal aliens,” Bondi said in an interview on Fox News Thursday. “Will not happen.”
    


            Christina Henderson, a member of the DC City Council, also responded to the order on social media Thursday, writing “Respectfully, the Attorney General does not have the authority to revoke laws.”
    


            Earlier Thursday, Smith signed an executive order allowing DC police officers to share information about people not in their custody with federal immigration enforcement agencies, as well as allowing local police to assist with transporting the agencies' personnel and detainees.
    


            However, the earlier order — citing DC law and police code of conduct — continues to prohibit officers from looking through police databases solely for a person's immigration status, from making inquiries about a person's immigration status “for the purpose of determining whether they have violated the civil immigration laws or for the purpose of enforcing civil immigration laws” and from arresting anyone based only on federal immigration warrants.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation's capital sued to block President Donald Trump's takeover of its police department in court on Friday, hours after his administration escalated its intervention into the city's law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department.

Washington's police department chief said Trump's move would threaten law and order by upending the command structure. “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Police Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing.

The legal battle playing out Friday showed the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department under the control of the Republican presidential administration that exists in its midst. Trump's takeover of the police department is historic yet had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week. 

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city's immigration and policing policies, the district's right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

Washington's top legal official was pushing in court Friday to reverse the order putting the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in charge of police in the nation's capital. 




District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc.” Conflicting commands and confusion about who's in charge are a serious problem for effective policing, Smith said. 

The lawsuit comes after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday night DEA boss Terry Cole will assume the police chief's duties and approval authority for any orders issued to officers. It was unclear where the move left the city's current police chief, Smith, who works for the mayor.

Schwalb argues the new order goes beyond Trump's authority and implementing it would “sow chaos” in the Metropolitan Police Department. “The administration's unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call D.C. home,” Schwalb said. 

The Justice Department declined to comment on the district's lawsuit, and a White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city's homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

Schwalb had said late Thursday that Bondi's directive was “unlawful,” arguing it could not be followed by the city's police force. He wrote in a memo to Smith that “members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” setting up the legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration.

The district's attorney general is an elected position and the city's top legal officer. It's separate from the federal U.S. attorney appointed by the president to serve in Washington, a role now filled by former Fox News Channel host and judge Jeanine Pirro. Trump also appointed Bondi as U.S. attorney general, the nation's top law enforcement official.

Bondi's directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Bondi said she was rescinding that order and other MPD policies limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, Bondi said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media “there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.”

The president has more power over the nation's capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city's police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he'd seek to extend it. Schwalb argues the president's role is narrow under the law, limited to requiring the mayor to provide police services for federal purposes.

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world's most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. They made 33 arrests, including 15 migrants who did not have permanent legal status, the official said. Others were arrested on warrants for murder, rape and driving under the influence.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha's Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.

The uptick in visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, has been striking to residents going about their lives.

Officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.'s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump started in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

Troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control, National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics and crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.

National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. They have regularly been used in the past for crowd control in and around Metro stations.

JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON, Alaska (AP) — President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Friday for a pivotal Alaska summit that could reshape both the war in Ukraine and relations between Moscow and Washington.

The sit-down gives Trump a chance to prove to the world that he is both a master dealmaker and a global peacemaker. He and his allies have cast him as a heavyweight negotiator who can find a way to bring the slaughter to a close — something he used to boast he could do quickly.

For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia's gains, block Kyiv's bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit. Despite having so much at stake, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders aren't invited.

There are significant risks for Trump. By bringing Putin onto U.S. soil — America bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 for 2 cents per acre — the president is giving him the validation he desires after his ostracization following his invasion of Ukraine 3 1/2 years ago. Zelenskyy's exclusion from Trump and Putin's first meeting is a heavy blow to the West's policy of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine” and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want.

Any success is far from assured because Russia and Ukraine remain far apart in their demands for peace. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine's mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.




“HIGH STAKES!!!” Trump posted shortly before he boarded Air Force One for Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. 

On his way to the meeting, Putin stopped in Magadan, in Russia's Far East, where he visited a factory producing omega-3 fish oil capsules, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Putin was reviewing materials on Ukraine, tensions with the U.S., economic cooperation and global affairs during his four-hour flight to Alaska, where he will be greeted at his plane by Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV.

Trump and Putin have shared closely watched handshakes before — but Friday's will be as scrutinized as any, as will any body language or hints about how each is feeling. 

Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting — a possibility that Russia hasn't agreed to.

When asked after arriving in Alaska about Trump's estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia “never plans ahead.”

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports President Trump has left for his Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin.

“We know that we have arguments, a clear, understandable position. We will state it,” he said in footage posted to the Russian Foreign Ministry's Telegram channel.

Trump said in a Fox News radio interview Thursday that he didn't know if they would get “an immediate ceasefire” but he wanted a broad peace deal done quickly. That seemingly echoes Putin's longtime argument that Russia favors a comprehensive deal to end the fighting, reflecting its demands, not a temporary halt to hostilities. 

The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over “a working breakfast.” They are then expected to hold a joint press conference. 

In the days leading up to the summit, Trump described it as “ really a feel-out meeting.” But he's also warned of “very severe consequences” for Russia if Putin doesn't agree to end the war and said that though Putin might bully other leaders, “He's not going to mess around with me.”

Trump said Friday that his talks with Putin will include Russian demands that Ukraine cede territory as part of a peace deal. He said Ukraine has to decide, but he also suggested Zelenskyy should accept concessions. 

“I've got to let Ukraine make that decision. And I think they'll make a proper decision,” Trump told reporters traveling with him to Alaska. 

Trump said there's “a possibility” of the United States offering Ukraine security guarantees alongside European powers, “but not in the form of NATO.” Putin has fiercely resisted Ukraine joining the trans-Atlantic security alliance, a long-term goal for Ukrainians seeking to forge stronger ties with the West. 

Zelenskyy has time and again cast doubts on Putin's willingness to negotiate in good faith. His European allies, who've held increasingly urgent meetings with U.S. leaders over the past week, have stressed the need for Ukraine to be involved in any peace talks.

Political commentators in Moscow, meanwhile, have relished that the summit leaves Ukraine and its European allies on the sidelines.

Dmitry Suslov, a pro-Kremlin voice, expressed hope that the summit will “deepen a trans-Atlantic rift and weaken Europe's position as the toughest enemy of Russia.”

Foreign governments will be watching closely to see how Trump reacts to Putin, likely gauging what the interaction might mean for their own dealings with the U.S. president, who has eschewed traditional diplomacy for his own transactional approach to relationships.

The meeting comes as the war has caused heavy losses on both sides and drained resources. 

Ukraine has held on far longer than some initially expected since the February 2022 invasion, but it is straining to hold off Russia's much larger army, grappling with bombardments of its cities and fighting for every inch on the over 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line.

Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow and director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, said U.S. antagonists like China, Iran and North Korea will be paying attention to Trump's posture to see “whether or not the threats that he continues to make against Putin are indeed credible.” 

“Or, if has been the past track record, he continues to back down and look for ways to wiggle out of the kind of threats and pressure he has promised to apply,” said Kendall-Taylor, who is a former senior intelligence officer.

While some have objected to the location of the summit, Trump has said he thought it was “very respectful” of Putin to come to the U.S. instead of a meeting in Russia.

Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin Moscow-based analyst, observed that the choice of Alaska as the summit's venue “underlined the distancing from Europe and Ukraine.”

Being on a military base allows the leaders to avoid protests and meet more securely, but the location carries its own significance because of its history and location. 

Alaska is separated from Russia at its closest point by just 3 miles (less than 5 kilometers) and the international date line. 

Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson was crucial to countering the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It continues to play a role today, as planes from the base still intercept Russian aircraft that regularly fly into U.S. airspace.

They typically investigate drug lords, weapons traffickers or cyber criminals. This week, though, federal agents are fanning out across the nation's capital as part of President Donald Trump's efforts to clamp down on crime in the city. 

The sometimes-masked agents joined members of the National Guard as well as the United States Park Police, whose responsibilities include protecting the country's monuments and managing crowds during demonstrations. 

Soldiers in fatigues kept watch near Union Station, while officers with the Drug Enforcement Administration patrolled along the National Mall. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives helped question a couple in northwest Washington who were parked illegally and eating McDonald's takeout. 

Trump said Monday that he's taking over Washington's police department in hopes of reducing crime, even as city officials stressed that crime is already falling. The District of Columbia's status as a congressionally established federal district allows the president to take control, although he's limited to 30 days under statute unless he gets approval from Congress.

Amid the takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department, or MPD, here's a list of some of the federal agencies involved and what they typically do: 




THIS WEEK: The Pentagon said that 800 Guard members have been activated for missions in Washington that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts. Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said the troops won't be armed and declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail. The White House said Thursday that Guard members aren't making arrests but are “protecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence.”

THE BACKSTORY: The National Guard serves as the primary combat reserve of the Army and Air Force, according to its website. But it also responds when “disaster strikes in the homeland” to protect life and property in communities.

THIS WEEK: DEA agents have also fanned out across Washington, working with police on traffic stops and other enforcement efforts. The agency has touted this week that its agents have helped to recover guns and drugs.

THE BACKSTORY: The agency typically enforces the nation's controlled substances laws and regulations, while going after drug cartels, gangs and traffickers in the U.S. and abroad. For example, a DEA-led investigation scored a record seizure of fentanyl in May, “dismantling one of the largest and most dangerous drug trafficking organizations in U.S. history,” the agency said in a news release. The DEA also operates a little-known research lab in northern Virginia that's working to analyze seized narcotics to find ways to stop the supply. Its chemists identify the ever-evolving tactics employed by cartels to manufacture drugs flowing into the U.S.

THIS WEEK: Agents with Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security, could be seen on Wednesday alongside MPD officers as they conducted traffic checks at a checkpoint along 14th Street in northwest Washington.

THE BACKSTORY: HSI investigates a wide variety of crimes on a global scale – at home, abroad and online – with hundreds of offices across the country and abroad. Those crimes include “illegal movement of people, goods, money, contraband, weapons and sensitive technology into, out of and through the United States,” the agency says on its website. In the last few months, as the Trump administration has ramped up its immigration enforcement efforts across the U.S., HSI agents have been out on raids and involved in immigration arrests at courthouses and other sites around the country. HSI agents also investigate a vast array of crime, including cyber and financial crimes and intellectual property offenses.

THIS WEEK: United States Park Police have been seen helping with traffic stops this week in the district and are a regular presence in Washington. D.C. The federal agency is actually one of the nation's oldest, being founded in 1791 by George Washington. 

THE BACKSTORY: The police are part of the National Park Service and has jurisdiction in all federal parks, with offices in Washington, New York and San Francisco, according to the agency's website. Before this week's takeover, it already had the authority to make an arrest in the District of Columbia.

THIS WEEK: ATF agents have been helping out with traffic stops. 

THE BACKSTORY: The agency primarily focuses on the illegal use of guns and explosives, bombings and acts of terrorism, and the trafficking of illicit liquor or contraband tobacco.

Today's live updates have ended. Read what you missed below and find more coverage at apnews.com.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has named the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as Washington's “emergency police commissioner,” saying she is granting him the powers of the police chief amid the federal takeover.

Bondi said in a directive issued Thursday evening that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume “powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police.” The Metropolitan Police Department “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole” before issuing any orders, Bondi said. It was not immediately clear where the move left Pamela Smith, the city's current police chief, who works for the mayor.

Following President Donald Trump's unprecedented announcement that his administration would take over the Washington, D.C., police department and dispatch the National Guard for at least a month, the White House announced there would be a round-the-clock presence of local and federal law enforcement officers in the city.

Other news we're following today:








During an interview on the “State Of The People Special: The Attack on Black America,” former MSNBC host Joy-Ann Reid pressed Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser on the city's decision to go along with the president's order.

“You aren't hearing me say that we asked for this insurgence of police or that we think we need them,” Bowser responded. “What we know is that the president is making a show of force in Washington, D.C., that is meant to be a signal for the rest of the nation. We know that he has broader authority to do it in Washington, D.C.”

Bowser repeatedly made the point that D.C. does not have full autonomy under its limited home rule arrangement.

Still, she said: “I'm concerned that we have this intrusion on our autonomy. I'm concerned that our law allows it. I'm concerned that we're not the 51st state. I'm concerned that we're subject to federal influence and intrusion on matters of policing. And all of us should be concerned about it.

Students and teachers returned to class for the new academic year Thursday amid worries that schools could become targets in the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown after a summer filled with raids.

At 93rd Street Elementary School in southern Los Angeles, volunteers with activist group Union del Barrio patrolled the neighborhood in the early morning for any immigration activity, and staff wearing bright orange vests gave children — some walking alone — a warm welcome as they arrived.

“We want to make sure that … everyone feels like they're protected and we're watching and every student can make it inside our school building,” said Ingrid Villeda, a teacher and community coordinator.

As children played in the schoolyard, there were no reports of federal agents in the area.

When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law 90 years ago, he said it would provide economic stability to older people while giving the U.S. “an economic structure of vastly greater soundness.”

Today the program provides benefits to almost 69 million Americans each month. It's a major source of income for people older than 65 and is popular across the country and political lines.

But just as it has for decades, Social Security faces a looming shortfall in money to pay full benefits. 

And since Trump took office, it has faced more tumult. Agency staffing has been slashed. Unions and advocacy groups concerned about sharing sensitive information have sued. Administration officials including the president have falsely claimed that millions of dead people were receiving benefits. Former adviser Elon Musk called it a potential “Ponzi scheme.”

In her ruling earlier Thursday, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland struck down administration guidance aimed at eliminating diversity programs at schools and colleges. She said the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continue with such initiatives.

The department reacted later in a statement, saying it was disappointed by the decision but “judicial action enjoining or setting aside this guidance has not stopped our ability to enforce Title VI protections for students at an unprecedented level.”

The case centers on two department memos ordering schools and universities to end all “race-based decision-making” or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It's part of a campaign to end practices that the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.

They typically investigate drug lords, weapons traffickers or cyber criminals. But this week they fanned out across the capital as part of Trump's efforts to clamp down on crime.

The sometimes-masked federal agents joined the National Guard as well as the United States Park Police, whose responsibilities include protecting monuments and managing crowds during demonstrations.

As National Guard troops deploy across her city as part of the president's efforts to clamp down on crime, Muriel Bowser is responding with relative restraint.

She has called the takeover of the city's police department and the activation of 800 members of the Guard “unsettling and unprecedented” and gone as far as to cast such efforts as part of an “authoritarian push.”

But Bowser has so far avoided the kind of biting rhetoric and personal attacks typical of other high-profile Democratic leaders. Instead she is cooperating with administration efforts, including having city workers clear homeless encampments and work more closely with immigration agents, as Trump demanded.

“While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can't say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised,” Bowser said. She even suggested the surge in resources might benefit the city.

Orthodoxy is the majority religion in both Russia and Ukraine, although it has also been a source of controversy. Russian church leadership has strongly supported the invasion of Ukraine, and the war has aggravated a schism among Ukraine's Orthodox.

“With the leaders coming to Alaska, what is the one thing that the church can offer? That is prayers for peace,” said Archbishop Alexei of the Diocese of Sitka and Alaska in the Orthodox Church of America.

The first prayers Tuesday sought the help of St. Olga of Kwethluk, an Alaska Native woman canonized in June as the first Orthodox woman saint in North America.

Wednesday's services sought the intercession of St. Herman, a monk and missionary “known for standing up against Russian authorities when they were doing what was wrong to the people,” Alexei said.

And Thursday prayers focused on a historic icon of the Mother of God at the cathedral in Sitka.

The court ruled that six grants must be restored to organizations that lost their funding after several Trump administration Executive Orders and at the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 

The ruling “sets a strong precedent that could allow hundreds of other grants to be challenged and reinstated,” environmental nonprofit Earthjustice said in a statement.

Plaintiffs included groups that support causes like tree planting, climate-friendly farming practices and growing food in underserved communities. 

The total value of the terminated grants was over $34 million, the attorneys said.

“In the wake of this ruling, we hope the USDA stops arbitrarily cancelling grants and contracts without an understanding of the work being done,” said Erin McKee, community food systems program director at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, one of the plaintiffs.

The USDA referred a request for comment to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond.

Muriel Bowser said on the social platform X that, as a “mom and mayor, raising a delightful 7 year old on my own,” she needed to leave amid the ongoing federal law enforcement activity to bring her daughter home from camp.

The mayor added that she also “cancelled a scheduled family trip” this week “to lead our city's crisis management efforts.”

Bowser said she has been “in constant consultation with our partners throughout a short swing out of the District,” which began Wednesday “after work.”

Bowser's office had said she had a “family commitment” in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, and would return Friday afternoon. 

After it was reported that Bowser was not in the city Thursday, critics accused her of going on vacation or otherwise fleeing during the federal law enforcement intervention.

The judge ordered the nation's health department to stop giving deportation officials access to the personal information — including home addresses — of all 79 million Medicaid enrollees.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services first handed over the data in June. After an AP report identified the new policy, 20 states sued to stop it.

The order by Judge Vince Chhabria in California temporarily halts the health department from sharing personal data of enrollees in those 20 states, which include California, Arizona, Washington and New York.

“Using CMS data for immigration enforcement threatens to significantly disrupt the operation of Medicaid — a program that Congress has deemed critical for the provision of health coverage to the nation's most vulnerable residents,” Chhabria wrote in his decision, issued Tuesday.

An HHS spokesperson declined to directly answer whether the agency would stop sharing the data. HHS has maintained that its agreement with DHS is legal.

The man, who has been charged with a felony, has been dismissed from his job at the Department of Justice, the attorney general said in a social media post.

A video of Sean Charles Dunn berating a group of federal agents late Sunday went viral online. Dunn was arrested on an assault charge after he threw a “sub-style” sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent, a court filing said.

Dunn, 37, of Washington, was an international affairs specialist in the DOJ's criminal division, according to a department official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter.

“You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement,” Bondi said.

An attorney who represented Dunn at his initial appearance in federal court declined to comment. 

The Russian president made the remarks Thursday, more than three years after Moscow launched its invasion, as the two leaders prepared for their Friday Russia summit.

Following a meeting with top officials, Putin said in a short video released by the Kremlin that the Trump administration was making “quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities” and to “reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved.”

Putin also suggested that “long-term conditions of peace between our countries, and in Europe, and in the world as a whole,” could be reached under an agreement with the U.S. on nuclear arms control.

Trump said there was a 25% chance the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that, if the meeting succeeds, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could come to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting.

The portraits of Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush had been on display in the foyer, visible to tourists and guests alike.

But Trump recently had Obama moved to the top of the staircase to his private living quarters, an area off-limits to visitors. The Bushes also were relocated to the staircase. The change was first reported by CNN.

White House spokesperson Davis Ingle attributed the rearrangement to Trump's “incredible eye for detail and design” and said he is “carrying out a historic renovation of the People's House for Americans to enjoy for generations to come.”

“And just like every other President before him, he and the First Family may request changes to the Executive Residence,” Ingle said.

Trump and Obama have had a fraught relationship. Trump also has not hidden his dislike for the Bush family.

Portraits of the most recent presidents traditionally get a place of prominence in the foyer.

In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland said the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continue with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.

The ruling followed a motion for summary judgment from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which challenged the government's actions in a February lawsuit.

The case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all “race-based decision-making” or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It's part of a campaign to end practices the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.

Texas Democrats on Thursday moved closer to ending a nearly two-week walkout that has blocked the GOP's redrawing of U.S. House maps before the 2026 election and put them under escalating threats by Republicans back home.



The Democrats announced they will return so long as Texas Republicans end a special session and California releases its own redrawn map proposal, both of which were expected to happen Friday.



Democrats did not say what day they might return.



Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott still intends to push through new maps that would give the GOP five more winnable seats before next year's midterm elections.

A network of clinics that provides health care in Maine asked a judge Thursday to restore its Medicaid funding while it fights a Trump administration effort to keep federal money from going to abortion providers.

President Donald Trump's policy and tax bill, known as the “big beautiful bill,” blocked Medicaid money from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider. The parameters in the bill also stopped funding from reaching Maine Family Planning, a much smaller provider that offers health care services in one of the poorest and most rural states in the Northeast.

A federal judge ruled last month that Planned Parenthood clinics around the country must continue to be reimbursed for Medicaid funding as the provider wrangles with the Trump administration over efforts to defund it. That legal fight continues.

Trump on Thursday denied that the federal law enforcement officials he sent into Washington's streets to fight crime have been pulled away from priority assignments. 

Asked if he was concerned about that, Trump said he's using a “very small force” of soldiers and that city police are now allowed to do their job under his takeover of the department.

“And no, they're not being pulled off for anything,” Trump said.

Ahead of a summit between the American and Russian leaders, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is warning that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been allowed to “play” American President Donald Trump for months.

“We've seen again red line after red line that he's drawn and then allowed Vladimir Putin to cross while the conflict gets worse or people are killed,” Shaheen told reporters. “The president, frankly, should be embarrassed because Vladimir Putin is playing him and has been playing him for months. And this summit, unfortunately, seems like it's just one more effort to do that.”

Still, Shaheen said she was hopeful that the meeting could yield a positive result for Ukraine and urged the Republican president to show strength, including by moving ahead with legislation to impose further sanctions on Russia.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's move is in response to Republican efforts to pick up five seats in Texas.

Newsom released a campaign add on social media Thursday as Democrats kicked off a press conference. State lawmakers technically need to declare the special election and they plan to do so next week. Democrats have not yet released their draft maps, but they aim to pick up five more seats.

The maps need voter approval. That's because voters previously granted the power to draw maps to an independent commission instead of lawmakers.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, led by prominent vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr., will revive a childhood vaccine panel to “improve the safety, quality and oversight of vaccines.”

The panel was disbanded in 1998.

National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary will all sit on the panel but it is unclear who else will serve on it.

The panel will give a formal report to Congress on vaccines within two years, according to an HHS announcement on Thursday.

A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to reinstate millions of dollars in grant funding that it terminated for several nonprofits involved in agriculture and ecology-related projects.

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, D.C., ruled in favor of five groups that sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture after it terminated their grants in response to executive orders issued by President Donald Trump. One plaintiff, Urban Sustainability Directors Network, received a $28 million grant in 2023 to promote urban forestry.

USDA terminated a total of approximately 600 grants, but the judge's ruling only applies to six grants received by the five plaintiffs.

Howell rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs' claims are essentially contractual in nature and belong in the Court of Federal Claims. She ruled that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the five grant terminations were “arbitrary and capricious.”

Trump was just asked about Washington police chief's executive order regarding cooperating with immigration authorities and said he'd just heard about it.

“That's a very positive thing, I have heard that just happened,” Trump said in response to a question in the Oval Office as he marked the 90th anniversary of Social Security.

“That's a great step. That's a great step if they're doing that,” Trump said.

The president had no qualms about the possible national security risks from his reassigning of officers for the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to deal with local crime in Washington.

“Like what? Like what?” Trump said.

A reporter suggested that moving federal officials could compromise efforts to stop terrorism.

“Oh, really, terrorism?” Trump said. “They'll stop terrorism as part of what they're doing right now.”

That's after he recently reposted a video on social media about a Christian nationalist church that included various pastors saying women should no longer be allowed to vote.

“Of course the secretary thinks that women should have the right to vote. That's a stupid question, to be honest with you,” Pentagon's press secretary Kingsley Wilson told reporters Thursday.

She was asked about Hegseth's support for Doug Wilson, co-founder of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, or CREC.

Doug Wilson has said he was grateful Hegseth shared the video.“He was, in effect, reposting it and saying, ‘Amen,' at some level,” Wilson said.Wilson said Hegseth's support for CREC isn't expected to hurt recruitment in the future.

The police chief of Washington, D.C., ordered an increase in cooperation between local officers and federal immigration agents on Thursday, a development that ramps up the stakes in an already tense environment after President Donald Trump's security crackdown put the city's police force under the command of the administration. 



The Executive Order, issued Thursday and signed by Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith, establishes that MPD officers may now share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody —such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. MPD officers may also provide “transportation for federal immigration employees and detained subject,” the order states. 



The changes, which raise collaboration between the two forces in notable ways, are effective immediately.

Some analysts have suggested that, simply by agreeing to meet with Putin on U.S. soil, Trump is undermining longstanding U.S. and international efforts to isolate Putin and Russia.

But asked by reporters if sitting down with Putin in Alaska constituted a win for Putin, the president insisted, “I don't think it's a reward.”

Trump says his meeting in Alaska with Putin will be a “big meeting” and is “going to be a good meeting,” but that “the more important meeting is the second meeting we're having” with Putin and Zelenskyy.

In comments to reporters in the Oval Office, the president suggested he may even bring in European leaders for the second discussion after meeting with Putin.

Trump said he believes that both Putin and Zelensky want to make peace.Asked if he might offer a rare earth minerals deal with Russia as part of his discussions with Putin, Trump said, “We're going to see what happens with our meeting” but he also suggested that such minerals were “very unimportant.”

In an appearance at the Oval Office, President Donald Trump said that he saved Los Angeles by calling in the National Guard earlier this year, and that the city would have burned down without his intervention. 

He said that if he had allowed protests to continue without intervention, he would have had to cancel the Olympics.

“If I didn't send in the troops, I don't think you would have had Los Angeles in condition to have the Olympics,” Trump said.

Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano said “Social Security will be great again,” under his watch, “you have my commitment,” he told Trump. However, the Republican president and Republican lawmakers have not yet proposed a long-term solution to shore up the program.

The so-called go-broke date — or the date at which Social Security will no longer have enough funds to pay full benefits — has been moved up to 2034, instead of last year's estimate of 2035.

Legislation signed during the Trump and Biden administrations have contributed to the accelerated insolvency date of SSA, including the Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law by Democratic President Joe Biden and the new mega-tax law signed by Trump in July.

During a signing ceremony in the Oval Office commemorating Social Security's 90th anniversary, President Donald Trump repeated the claim that Republicans' mega tax and spending cut legislation signed into law last month will eliminate taxes on federal Social Security benefits.

It does not.

Trump's “no tax on Social Security” claim exaggerates the benefits. The temporary tax deduction for seniors aged 65 and over applies to all income — not just Social Security.

And it turns out, not all Social Security beneficiaries will be able to claim the deduction. Those who won't be able to do so include the lowest-income seniors who already don't pay taxes on Social Security, those who choose to claim their benefits before they reach age 65 and those above a defined income threshold.

If Trump wants to help cities lower violence and crime, he's doing it the wrong way, Baltimore mayor Brandon Scott said in a call with reporters Thursday.

Scott said federal officials should be working for agencies and collaborating with cities on issues such as gun trafficking and drug crimes rather than being taken off their posts to surge into cities.

Trump should allow public safety professionals “to do what they signed up to do” instead of his D.C. “dog and pony show of force,” Scott said.

The National Guard now assisting law enforcement in Washington, D.C. will not have the power of arrest, Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said Thursday.

Similar to role they played when responding to protests in Los Angeles, the Guards will have the ability to temporarily detain people but it will be up to law enforcement agencies to arrest anyone, she said.

“They will not be arresting people, but they may temporarily limit the movement of an individual who has entered a restricted or secured area without permission,” Wilson told reporters during a press conference. “So this will be very similar to the L.A. mission, where we could temporarily detain someone and then turn them over.”

The advocates expressed “profound concerns” about Trump's plan to crack down on crime and homelessness in the nation's capital in a letter sent to the Republican chairs and Democratic ranking members of the House Oversight and Senate Homeland Security committee.

The leaders, who represent some of the largest civil rights groups in the country, argued Trump's moves were an “unprecedented and needless takeover of a local government's law enforcement mechanisms” that posed “a dire threat to public safety as well as to civil and human rights.”

They urged Congress to investigate Trump's actions make sure that DC residents' constitutional rights “are being fully protected and enforced.”

“This administration has proven that it will push every boundary to test for exploitable weakness in Congress and the courts,” reads a letter signed by the leaders of 126 civil rights organizations. “Given the role of your respective committees in matters affecting our nation's capital, we urge you to promptly call for hearings into this decision, and to engage in vigorous oversight moving forward.”

The D.C. Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Wayne Turnage on Thursday spoke to reporters from a homeless encampment near the Institute of Peace that the city had just closed down.

He said after the National Park Service notified the city it planned to close all encampments in the district, both on federal and district lands, the city opted to tackle some of the work themselves.

He said they have more social services resources than the federal government and can do it “the way it should be done.”

“Closing encampments is a very, very complex process,” Turnage said. “We're dealing with human beings who, in many cases, have been marginalized. Their lives are being disrupted. And so we have put a process in place that we think respects that.”

He said federal officials have laid out an “aggressive timeline” that aims to finish closing encampments within about a week. The city will learn more about which sites will be targeted next at 6 p.m. tonight.

Turnage said that timeline could be achieved if the officials focus only on sites where NPS has jurisdiction, but it may not be possible to clear all 62 encampments across the city in just one week.

The Pentagon says the 800 National Guard members who have been activated in Washington will have missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts.



Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson also said Thursday that the troops won't be armed.



National Guard Major Micah Maxwell added that troops will assist federal and local law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics as well as the proper use of crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.



Wilson declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail or how many Guard members have already been deployed to the streets of Washington.



On Thursday, troops and their Humvees are visibly stationed outside Union Station.



The White House said Thursday that Guard members aren't making arrests but are “protecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio says preparations for President Donald Trump's summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin over prospects for peace with Ukraine are proceeding apace and that the U.S. expects any result of the meeting will be known very soon after it begins quickly.

Speaking at the State Department after a meeting with Paraguay's foreign minister, Rubio told reporters on the eve of Friday's summit in Alaska that the preparations are “going very fast because this was put together very quickly.” Trump's “hope is to interact with Putin tomorrow and sort of get a sense very quickly and early whether a peace is possible or not.”

“We'll see how tomorrow plays out,” said Rubio who will be accompanying Trump to Anchorage for the summit in his role as acting national security adviser.

Missouri lawmakers are preparing for a special session on congressional redistricting as part of President Donald Trump's push to draw more favorable maps for Republicans ahead of next year's elections.

A document obtained by The Associated Press shows the Senate has received a $46,000 invoice to activate six redistricting software licenses and provide training for up to 10 legislative staff members. Senate Administrator Patrick Baker says he stands ready to pay the bill as soon as Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe officially calls a special session.

Kehoe expressed support for a redrawing Missouri's congressional districts while speaking to reporters Thursday at the Missouri State Fair but did not commit to a special session.

Republican House Majority Leader Alex Riley said a special session on redistricting is “pretty likely” to happen. Riley said he's had conversations about it with White House staff, and discussions already are underway about what a new map could look like.

Six of Missouri's eight congressional seats are currently held by Republicans. GOP lawmakers could target a Democratic-held district in Kansas City to pick up another seat.

Amber W. Harding, executive director of the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, said she believes that “federal law enforcement will begin systematically rounding up and arresting unhoused people.” She believes officers would ask people to move on or would “offer shelter,” arresting people if they refused either directive.

“We do not have enough shelter beds for everyone on the street,” Harding said. “This is a chaotic and scary time for all of us in D.C., but particularly for people without homes.”

Lucho Vásquez, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, said his group is “focusing all energies on opening and operating temporary facilities” for anyone in need of emergency shelter, food or other resources after the removals.

AP journalists talked to homeless people who were being told Thursday either by federal law enforcement officials or advocacy groups to pack up their tents and belongings from public spaces before more formal removal measures. Some expressed fear and anxiety about what might be coming.

Trump posted before announcing the takeover that “The homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.” But whether federal troops will move them and how they'll be provided for outside the city has not been explained.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that homeless people “will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services,” and those who refuse “will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.”

Trump says there's a 25% chance his summit with Putin fails, but floated the possibility of bringing Zelenskyy to Alaska for a three-way meeting if it's successful.

Trump made the comments in a radio interview Thursday with Fox News commentator Brian Kilmeade. 

The president said no decisions have been made about whether he'll hold a joint news conference with Putin, as he did during a controversial 2018 meeting with the Russian leader in Helsinki, Finland.

The White House said Thursday morning marked the start of law enforcement efforts to proactively target certain people and places in the nation's capital, rather than patrolling general areas.

That could include specific gang members, drug dealers or high-crime locations. The White House said it is creating specialized teams from multiple agencies to target criminal hotspots.

The White House also said law enforcement operations will now be taking place around the clock, rather than focusing on the evening hours.

HONG KONG (AP) — The final arguments in prominent Hong Kong activist Jimmy Lai's national security trial were postponed Friday after his lawyer said the former pro-democracy newspaper founder had experienced heart palpitations and the judges wanted him to receive medical treatment first.

Lai, the 77-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, was arrested in 2020 under a national security law imposed by Beijing following anti-government protests in 2019. He faces charges of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications. If convicted, he faces up to life imprisonment. 

Lai's landmark case — which has already lasted over 140 days, far beyond the original estimate of 80 days — is widely seen as a trial of press freedom and a test for judicial independence in the Asian financial hub.

Closing statements were initially scheduled to begin on Thursday, but were postponed due to heavy rains from Tropical Storm Podul.

On Friday, Lai's lawyer, Robert Pang, told the court that Lai felt unsteady and had experienced heart palpitations. Pang said his client does not want to disturb the court proceedings.

Judge Esther Toh said Lai had not received medication and a heart monitor, as recommended by a medical specialist. The judges decided to postpone the hearing until Monday.

When Lai entered the courtroom, he smiled and nodded at people sitting in the public gallery. 




His detention has drawn attention from foreign governments. U.S. President Donald Trump, before the election last November, was asked whether he would talk to Chinese leader Xi Jinping to seek Lai's release, and Trump said: “One hundred percent, I will get him out.”

In a Fox News radio interview released Thursday, Trump denied saying he would “100%” save Lai. “I said, 100%, I'm going to be bringing it up. And I've already brought it up, and I'm going to do everything I can to save him,” he said.

Lai's son and rights groups have voiced concerns about his health. His son Sebastien Lai earlier told reporters in Washington that he fears his father could pass away at any time. 

On Tuesday, global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said Lai has been held in solidarity confinement for over 1,680 days and that his health is deteriorating. In a statement, it called for the international community to take action to ensure the immediate release of Lai and six other former Apple Daily executives involved in the case. 

But the Hong Kong government rejected in a statement on Wednesday what it called “slanderous remarks” by external forces, including “anti-China media organizations,” about the case and Lai's custody treatment.

On Friday night, it condemned what it described as inaccurate and incomplete reports by foreign media outlets, alleging the articles had attempted to mislead the public into thinking that Lai had not received the necessary medical care. The acts were despicable and violated professional journalistic ethics, it said. 

The statement said Lai's lawyer confirmed to the court that his client received daily medical check-ups in custody and had no complaints about the medical care provided, with the judge saying the correctional services department deserves praise. 

After Lai said he suffered palpitations, a medical examination found no abnormalities, but the doctor, as a precaution, suggested he wear a heart monitor and recommended prescribing medication to be taken as needed, it said. 

“Doctors had repeatedly confirmed Jimmy Lai was physically and mentally fit to attend the court hearing before his appearance,” it said. 

Ahead of the hearing, dozens of people lined up outside the court building to secure a seat in the main courtroom. Some of them also waited for hours in heavy rain on Thursday before the postponement, including resident Margaret Chan.

Chan, who arrived before 5:30 a.m. on Friday, said Lai's case showed the world the decline in Hong Kong's press freedom.

“To me, he's a great person. He made such a big sacrifice. He's so rich. He could have predicted this, and he could have left,” said Chan.

New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel apparently got his birthday punches after he attempted to break up a fight during the team's joint practice with the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday. 

The head coach, who turned 50 on Thursday, was captured on video getting knocked to the ground after he threw himself in the middle of a scuffle on the field in an attempt to break it up.

Video shared on social media showed two NFL players on the ground scrapping after the whistles were blown.

That quickly turned into a pile up of players, and Vrabel wasn't far behind. 

As the scrum of people moved on the field, Vrabel was momentarily knocked down in the process. The fight quickly settled down and there were no reported injuries. 

Speaking to the media earlier in the day, Vrabel seemingly offered an explanation for the tense nature of joint practices.

""These practices are like a game – we've said that. There's ups and downs. We hit some plays. They hit some plays.""

However, Thursday's practice wasn't the first time Vrabel had involved himself in a practice fight. Earlier this month, during a joint practice with the Washington Commanders, Vrabel stepped in to try and break up another fight. 

ESPN reported at the time that Vrabel walked away with a bloodied cheek.

 Attorney General Pam Bondi discusses a letter she sent to sanctuary city and state leaders, President Donald Trump's DC crime crackdown and the firing of a DOJ worker over a sandwich throwing incident on 'Hannity.'

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued an order on Thursday to slap down D.C. Metropolitan Police Department sanctuary policies and place Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terrence Cole in charge of the department as emergency police commissioner —  but D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back, highlighting a letter in which District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb opined that the order from Bondi ""is unlawful.""

""In reference to the U.S. Attorney General's order, there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official,"" Bowser said in a social media post.

Bowser included a letter from Schwalb to MPD Police Chief Pamela Smith, in which the D.C. attorney general said that, in his view, the order from Bondi ""is unlawful"" and that Smith is ""not legally obligated to follow it.""

In her order, Bondi declared that police leadership ""must receive approval from Commissioner Cole before issuing any further directives to the MPD.""

Bondi rescinded an executive order that was just issued on Thursday by the police chief. 

She also suspended parts of two general orders ""until further notice,"" and directed the MPD ""to enforce, to the maximum extent permissible by law, section 22-1307, District of Columbia Code, and all District of Columbia municipal regulations pertaining to the unlawful occupancy of public spaces.""

The showdown between the two attorneys general comes as President Donald Trump seeks to crack down on crime in the nation's capital. 

This week he issued an executive order that declared ""the Mayor of the District of Columbia (Mayor) shall provide the services of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act.""

But in the letter to the D.C. police chief, Schwalb asserted that Section 740 of the Home Rule Act ""does not authorize the President, or his delegee, to remove or replace the Chief of Police; to alter the chain of command within MPD; to demand services directly from you, MPD, or anyone other than the Mayor; to rescind or suspend MPD orders or directives; or to set the general enforcement priorities of MPD or otherwise determine how the District pursues purely local law enforcement. 

""The Bondi Order is, therefore, ultra vires,"" he declared.

Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith, a National Police Association spokesperson, told Fox News Digital police in Washington, D.C., support the president's temporary takeover.

President Donald Trump's takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department came as a result of politicians in Washington, D.C., failing to take control of an increase in youth violence, a law enforcement group said.

President Trump made the decision Monday to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, allowing the president to take emergency control of police in Washington, D.C., for 30 days.

""Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,"" Trump said Monday while announcing the move. ""And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it."" 

In explaining why he was federalizing D.C. police, Trump pointed to a rise in criminal activity that included a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer being beaten and the murder of a congressional intern.

The Metropolitan Police Department announced that a 15-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl face carjacking charges after Edward Coristine was beaten Aug. 3 at around 3 a.m. Authorities said the teens tried to carjack Coristine and a woman identified as his significant other.

Police said Coristine got the woman inside the vehicle while he confronted the group of people, which led to the attack.

Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who was in D.C. for an internship, was shot June 30 around 10:28 p.m. and died at a hospital July 1, police said. At the time, Tarpinian-Jachym was an intern for Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan.

Several people were seen exiting a car before opening fire, with one of the shots wounding Tarpinian-Jachym. Police said Tarpinian-Jachym wasn't the intended target, adding an adult female and 16-year-old male were injured. The shooting happened in the 1200 block of 7th Street, Northwest, near the Mt Vernon Sq 7th St-Convention Center Metro stop.

Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith, a National Police Association spokesperson, told Fox News Digital politicians in Washington, D.C., paved the way for Trump to take over the Metropolitan Police Department due to their failure to address a recent rise in youth violence.

According to NBC Washington, the number of juveniles arrested in Washington, D.C., has increased every year since 2020, with over 2,000 arrested in 2023 and 2024.

In 2024, juveniles made up 51.8% of robbery arrests, according to police, adding that almost 60% of carjacking suspects in 2025 are also juveniles. In Washington, D.C., most violent crimes committed by adults are prosecuted by the United States Attorney's Office, while most juvenile crimes are prosecuted by the District of Columbia's attorney teneral.

""It is a huge issue,"" Smith said of juvenile crime in Washington, D.C. ""It's frustrating for the crime victims to know that if they're the victim of a juvenile offender, even if the crime is violent, that the offender will likely not be prosecuted commiserate with the law. It is also frustrating for the police officer who makes the arrest and/or investigates the crime to then sees the offender not receive appropriate punishment.""

Smith said D.C. should be encouraged to ""lower the age of responsibility,"" which would allow ""for more effective prosecution of juveniles.""

""There needs to be a substantive change in the way that our criminal justice system deals with juvenile offenders. We need to do a better job of addressing true criminality, and we need to separate it out from a kid who runs away from home or a kid who steals a soda and a bag of chips from the local gas station,"" she said.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser met Tuesday with federal officials to discuss how the city will coordinate an increased law enforcement presence in the city.

""What I'm focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have,"" Bowser said, according to Fox 5. ""We have the best in the business in MPD Chief Pamela Smith to lead that effort and to make sure that the men and women who are coming from federal law enforcement are being well-used and that if there's National Guard here they're being well-used.""

President Donald Trump joins 'The Brian Kilmeade Show' to discuss his upcoming summit with Putin, the latest on his crime crackdown in Washington, D.C. and more.

President Donald Trump is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin for a historic summit Friday in Alaska.

The president will travel to Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday morning for the meeting, which is somewhat equidistant from both Washington, D.C., and Moscow. The United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867.

The high-stakes meeting is the first U.S.-Russia summit since June 2021, which was under former President Joe Biden's administration. That summit came just eight months before Putin invaded Ukraine.

WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT TRUMP'S MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN IN ALASKA

Trump has described the talks as a ""feel-out meeting,"" and has made clear that his top priority will be to determine whether a ceasefire in Ukraine is possible. Trump predicted earlier this week that he would be able to make that determination within the first ""two minutes.""

""I'm not going to make a deal. It's not up to me to make a deal,"" Trump said. ""I think a deal should be made for both (Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy).""

""I'd like to see a ceasefire,"" Trump continued. ""I'd like to see the best deal that could be made for both parties. You know, it takes two to tango.""

However, the president threatened ""very severe consequences"" for Russia if Putin does not agree to end the war after Friday's meeting. Additionally, while all eyes are on the summit between Trump and Putin, Trump said ""the more important meeting will be the second meeting that we're having.""

""We're going to have a meeting with President Putin, President Zelenskyy, myself, and maybe we'll bring some of the European leaders — maybe not … It's going to be very important.""

""We're going to see what happens,"" Trump continued. ""And I think President Putin will make peace.""

The day before the summit, Trump predicted that his meeting with Putin had a 25% chance of failing outright, but he said the hope is to push for a second meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

""This meeting sets up the second meeting,"" Trump told Fox News' Brian Kilmeade, adding that the second meeting would be ""extremely important,"" and hinted that there would likely be negotiations over land swaps, a notion Zelenskyy has opposed.

COULD TRUMP'S MEETING WITH PUTIN BE THE NEXT REAGAN-GORBACHEV MOMENT?

Zelenskyy is not a part of Friday's summit. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump was agreeing to the meeting at the request of Putin.

""The goal of this meeting for the president is to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war,"" Leavitt said at a recent White House press briefing. ""I think the president of the United States getting in the room with the president of Russia, sitting face-to-face rather than speaking over the telephone will give this president the best indication of how to end this war and where this is headed.""

However, Zelenskyy has maintained that any decisions to end the war made without Ukraine would be impossible.

Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he is open to meeting with Putin directly to end the war, though Putin has thus far refused.

PUTIN PRAISES TRUMP'S ‘SINCERE' PEACE EFFORTS, SIGNALS POSSIBLE US-RUSSIA NUCLEAR DEAL

""Any decisions made against us, any decisions made without Ukraine — they are simultaneously decisions against peace,"" Zelenskyy said in a Saturday statement. ""These are dead decisions; they will never work. And what we all need is a real, living peace, one that people will respect.""

However, as recently as Wednesday, Zelenskyy said there is ""no sign"" Russia is preparing to end the war.

The Ukrainian leader wrote on X Wednesday, saying, ""This war must be ended. Pressure must be exerted on Russia for the sake of a just peace. Ukraine's and our partners' experience must be used to prevent deception by Russia.""

""At present, there is no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war,"" he added. ""Our coordinated efforts and joint actions — of Ukraine, the United States, Europe, and all countries that seek peace — can definitely compel Russia to make peace."" 

ZELENSKYY, AHEAD OF TRUMP-PUTIN MEETING, SAYS THERE IS 'NO SIGN' RUSSIA WANTS TO END THE WAR

Zelenskyy also wrote on X recently, ""The path to peace for Ukraine must be determined together with Ukraine — this is fundamental.""

""It is important that joint approaches and a shared vision work toward genuine peace. A consolidated position. Ceasefire. End of occupation. End of war,"" he also said.

Zelenskyy this week also said he discussed the possibility of holding high-level talks organized by Turkey, which has hosted previous diplomatic negotiations that have failed to secure any lasting ceasefire agreements, but have released thousands of Ukrainian and Russian prisoners of war. 

""We are ready for any format of meeting aimed at stopping the killings and ending the war,"" Zelenksyy said. ""President Erdogan confirmed his country's readiness to organize a summit of the leaders of Ukraine, the United States, Russia, and Turkey."" 

Putin, though, has praised Trump for making ""sincere efforts"" to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, saying that the U.S. was making ""quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict,"" according to Reuters.

Putin also reportedly mentioned possible future ""agreements in the area of control over strategic offensive weapons.""

Russia and the U.S. hold the world's largest nuclear weapons arsenals and have a treaty limiting the number of weapons they may possess, which is set to expire in February, adding more pressure to the upcoming talks. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty covers strategic nuclear weapons and caps the number of deployed warheads at 1,550 on each side, according to Reuters.

There has already been some nuclear tension between the two nations in recent weeks, as Trump ordered two nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia after the country's former president made ""highly provocative statements."" The Kremlin downplayed the move but warned all sides to be ""very, very careful"" about nuclear rhetoric, according to Reuters.

Meanwhile, reporters pressed Trump on Thursday, the day before the summit, on whether his agreement to meet with Putin could end up ""rewarding"" the Russian president for his invasion of Ukraine. 

Trump scoffed at the question, and said: ""No. I don't think it's a reward.""

""What we have is a situation that should have never started — it should have never started,"" Trump said. ""It didn't start under me. And for four years, it wasn't even discussed. And I could see it was going to happen. After I left, I could see what was happening. Everything we did was wrong, everything that was done was wrong. Everybody's to blame. Putin is to blame. They're all to blame."" 

""This war would have never happened when I was president. If I were president, this war would have never happened,"" Trump continued. ""But millions of people have been killed and, I'm there for one reason: to see if I can solve this. This was Biden's war.""

Fox News contributor Nicole Parker discusses Zohran Mamdani's radical agenda and how he plans to keep New York City a sanctuary city on ‘Hannity.'

I'm part of Generation Z — the very group Zohran Mamdani, a self-described Democratic Socialist, is counting on to deliver him the mayor's office in New York City. I've seen how the left sells socialism to my peers: dress it up as ""compassion,"" brand capitalism as ""greed,"" and use TikTok to pump millions of young Americans full of ""government is your savior"" soundbites. 

But here's the truth: you don't wake up in a socialist America overnight. It happens slowly — vote by vote, race by race — until one day, the people chanting ""liberation"" realize they've built their own cage. And once socialism takes hold, it doesn't hand back power. 

I understand that socialism looks trendy to my peers on TikTok, but it's not some experiment in a lab. People build rafts out of garbage to flee socialist countries for the chance to live in freedom here. Find me one person who escaped a socialist country, came to America for a new life, and isn't disturbed by the modern-day left embracing Mamdani's platform. You won't. 

UNEARTHED MAMDANI CLIP REVEALS HOW HIS UPBRINGING MADE HIM OPEN TO BEING CALLED 'RADICAL,' SOCIALIST

This didn't start with Mamdani's campaign. It started in classrooms where gratitude for America was replaced with guilt. In entertainment that mocked faith, family and free markets. On social media platforms where dissent is shadow-banned and socialist talking points trend on cue.

Here's what you won't hear on CNN or MSNBC: my generation isn't lost. More and more of us are waking up to the truth — socialism doesn't ""level the playing field,"" it levels the entire country into shared misery. We've seen the countries our professors praise, and we've seen the people who risk everything to escape them. We know the most rebellious thing you can be in 2025 is unapologetically pro-America, pro-faith and pro-freedom.

For the people like my parents and grandparents who turn on their TV screens and see stories like this and wonder how we got here — I understand your concern. But the fight isn't over. There's a growing number of young conservatives who aren't interested in watching the American experiment get dismantled. We intend to keep the promise of this country alive. 

ZOHRAN MAMDANI'S 'FREE' PROMISES ARE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, YOUNG CONSERVATIVES WARN

That's why I keep thinking about something President Ronald Reagan said — that ""freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction."" He wasn't talking about some far-off threat. He was warning about exactly this moment — when one election could set in motion a change that future generations might never undo. 

He also called America a ""shining city on a hill"" — a beacon of hope to the world. If socialism can win in New York, that beacon risks becoming a cautionary tale — a dimmed light signaling to the world that freedom in America was just a temporary experiment.

And the truth is, we're not just one generation away from losing it. In New York, we might be one election away. 

If my generation doesn't act now, we'll be the ones explaining to our children why the light went out — and why we didn't fight harder to keep it burning.

Leading authorities in the District of Columbia on Thursday rebuffed attempts by the Trump administration to further federalize its law enforcement by appointing an “emergency police commissioner.”

Amid President Donald Trump's push to reduce crime in the district by sidelining its prized home rule status, Attorney General Pam Bondi stripped power from its Metropolitan Police Department, tapping Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole to assume all responsibilities carried by MPD Chief Pamela Smith.

The move prompted swift backlash from Mayor Muriel Bowser and D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who argued there is no legal basis for Bondi's order. Their rhetoric marks an escalation in tensions between the White House and district officials, who had been largely amicable to President Donald Trump's effort to target violence and crime in the capital.

“Let us be clear about what the law requires during a Presidential declared emergency: it requires the mayor of Washington, DC to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal purposes at the request of the President,” Bowser said in a statement Thursday night highlighting a letter from Schwalb contending only Smith, not Cole, is legally qualified to exercise the duties of police chief.

“We have followed the law,” Bowser continued. “In reference to the U.S. Attorney General's order, there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.”

In addition to stripping Smith of police authorities, Bondi's order, titled “Restoring Safety and Security to the District of Columbia,” targeted the district's leaders and the MPD for policies viewed as sanctuary city protections shielding illegal immigrants.

“Residents of the District of Columbia, the thousands of Americans who commute into the District for work every day, and the millions of tourists from all over the world who visit our nation's capital have a right to feel safe and to be free from the scourge of violent crime,” her order reads.

When pressed for comment on Bondi's directive, an MPD spokesperson pointed the Washington Examiner to Bowser's statement and Schwalb's letter to Smith telling the police chief she is not legally obligated to follow the Trump administration's order to cede control to Cole.

“We understand there may be questions about recent decisions regarding the Metropolitan Police Department,” the spokesperson said. “What's most important for our community to know is that MPD remains committed to delivering high-quality police service and ensuring the safety of everyone in our city.”

The battle over control of Washington launched in earnest on Monday, when Trump invoked Section 740 of the 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act, allowing federal control for 30 days, with congressional approval required for extensions.

Trump and his allies have argued that said federal intervention is warranted to resolve the crime problems that have dogged the district for years. Problems surged in 2020 when D.C. Councilman Charles Allen, who represents Ward 6, which includes Capitol Hill, spearheaded measures responding to George Floyd's death that instituted sweeping criminal justice reforms and significantly softened penalties for crimes, critics contend. Some of the laws have since been rolled back, with crime metrics showing improvement in recent months.

“Washington, D.C., has one of the Highest Rates of Crime in the World, more than many of the most violent Third World Countries,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on Wednesday.

“The City's Homicide Rate is higher than places notorious for their violence, such as Mexico City, Bogota, Islamabad, and Addis Ababa — Almost ten times higher than Fallujah, Iraq,” he continued. ” … The Violent Crime Rate in D.C. has worsened, and the Murder Rate has essentially DOUBLED in just over a decade — But these are only the ‘official' statistics released by corrupt City Officials. The REAL numbers are many times worse. … Now, D.C. is back under Federal Control where it belongs. The White House is in charge. The Military and our Great Police will liberate this City, scrape away the filth, and make it safe, clean, habitable and beautiful once more!”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Russian President Vladimir Putin is traveling to Alaska to meet with President Donald Trump to possibly negotiate the end to a conflict that experts believed would have ended more than three years ago.

Their highly anticipated meeting, which could change the trajectory of the conflict, comes just shy of the 3 1/2-year anniversary of Russia's invasion.

Ahead of their conversation, Trump has publicly floated the idea that both sides will have to agree to swap land to end the conflict. It raises the possibility that Russia may get to keep some of the Ukrainian territory it holds or has annexed, but not necessarily all of it.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would not willingly give up territory, which also would not be allowed under the country's constitution.

The Russian military occupies less Ukrainian territory than it did in March 2022, just one month into the conflict. Russian forces held roughly 26.8% of Ukrainian territory at its peak on March 23 of that year, and as of this week, they control 18.98% of Ukraine, according to the Institute for the Study of War.

Russian forces are making incremental gains on the battlefield toward the Ukrainian city of Dobropillya, but at exorbitantly high costs.

“These are small-scale penetrations, and it's at the tactical level,” George Barros, an expert with ISW, told the Washington Examiner. “For now, the Russians certainly will seek to try to mature these tactical successes into a larger breakthrough and a larger penetration and seize more territory, but it remains unclear if they would be successful in that endeavor.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that Russia likely suffered around 60,000 soldiers killed or wounded in battle last month alone.

“Last year, Russia gained half of 1% of Ukraine's territory in return for over 400,000 killed and wounded. This year, it's taken a similar amount of territory for a further 200,000 killed and wounded,” Adm. Sir Tony Radakin, the U.K. chief of defence staff, said in an interview with the Center for Strategic and International Studies this week.

Ahead of the summit, “Putin is left with a dilemma: Agree to a ceasefire with his stated aims incomplete and little to show his people in return for the lost blood and treasure,” he added, “or continue the war indefinitely and watch his country become even weaker and poorer chasing the false dream of subjugating Ukraine.”

The Russian military's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 2022, and the prevailing belief among Western officials was that it would only take a matter of days or weeks before it captured Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.

“At the time, we thought the Russian military was more capable than it has proven to be,” Radakin said. “We had limited confidence in Ukraine's defensive strategy. The prevailing view was that Russia would take Kyiv within weeks, if not days. The choice was whether to back Ukraine or not.”

The war has led to more than 1 million “lives sacrificed” since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, he said.

With allies unsure of whether to back Ukraine in a fight for its survival, Ukrainian troops and volunteers alike not only prevented the capture of its capital but also forced Putin to fundamentally shift his short-term war objectives to focus on regions in southeastern Ukraine, close to Russia's borders.

Russia annexed the Zaporizhia, Kherson, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions in Ukraine in September 2022. They were widely disregarded internationally as sham referendums conducted under duress. Russia still does not entirely control the territory it annexed and wants to get it through the ceasefire negotiations.

The front lines of the war stretch more than 600 miles and go through the regions Russia annexed. Russia and Ukrainian forces have been fighting in the Donbas region since 2014. The war is concentrated in the eastern part of Ukraine, and other areas within the country still come under attack.

The losses are staggering, yet Putin has not shown a legitimate interest in ending the war. He believes he can wait out U.S. and European support for Ukraine and then capitalize.

Ukrainian leaders and their European allies have stressed the importance of security guarantees in any agreement to prevent Russia from trying to restart its war when the military has had a chance to resupply and refit.

They “know that Putin's desire is not just to take all of Ukraine, but to rebuild the Russian Empire, which includes parts of NATO, parts of the EU,” Kurt Volker, who previously served as the U.S. ambassador to NATO, told the Washington Examiner. “So they are very concerned that if Putin is just appeased in this aggression, he's going to keep going. And they also know that if there is a ceasefire, it's not a full peace, as you're not changing Putin's ambitions.”

The mid-decade redistricting effort in Texas has been yet another pressure point for Republicans. It has split the party, with more states looking to follow in the Lone Star State's footsteps.

Many Republicans have backed this aggressive redistricting effort, standing with President Donald Trump, while some party members have begun expressing their concerns on the issue.

“Gerrymandering is a disaster for the country and both parties have been responsible for it,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) wrote on X. “I am fighting to ban it nationwide.” 

The Texas state legislature began redrawing the state's congressional districts earlier this month, a move backed by the Trump administration. The redistricting effort would create 30 Republican-friendly congressional seats, compared to just eight districts favoring Democrats, a five-seat boost for the GOP from its current 25-13 advantage.

Along with Texas, the administration has also begun lobbying Missouri, Indiana, and others to do the same. This push comes as Republicans fight to keep their ultra-slim majority in the House.

Despite a visit from Vice President JD Vance, Gov. Mike Braun (R-IN) has shown little interest in making any move for a rare mid-decade redistricting, as state representatives have been outspoken in rejecting the push.

Indiana Republicans and Lawler are not the only faction of the party pushing back on the efforts.

“I'm not somebody who's supportive of any type of gerrymandering,” Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) said on The Joe Piscopo Show earlier this week.

Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-CA) posted on X, quoting a poll saying “California voters oppose [Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA)] redistricting sham by a 2-to-1 margin,” as he urges his state to stay out of the redistricting wars, while Newsom continuously fires back at Trump.

In response to Texas's effort, some blue states have pledged to “fight fire with fire” by redrawing their maps to draw out Republican districts in their fight to flip the House in November 2026. A push has begun for California, Illinois, and New York to redraw their congressional districts, though they face more hurdles than red states to do so, such as overcoming independent redistricting commissions.

California Republicans, who would be targeted by Newsom's redistricting efforts, have been outspoken. Republicans in New York, another state that could use redistricting to push back against the administration, have also been outspoken.

Despite a recent poll showing deep support for the independent redistricting commission by a 2-to-1 margin, Newsom plans to plow forward with the effort. The governor called a Nov. 4 special election on Thursday to have voters approve a constitutional amendment to put out a new map, approved by the legislature, for elections in 2026 through 2030, and the commission would resume its role after the 2030 census.

Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) was hammered in a town hall during his district work period earlier this week. During the town hall, he broke from the administration on tariff policy and split with the party on the redistricting efforts.

“Texas shouldn't be doing that,” LaMalfa said. “This is going to start a grass fire across the country, every single state trying to change it based on a political outcome.”

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris (R-MD), the sole Republican in the Maryland delegation, spoke out against the effort.

“I think that we should probably shy away from mid-cycle redistricting,” Harris told Fox.

Rep. Blake Moore (R-UT) echoed this sentiment in a statement to the Salt Lake Tribune, saying it undermines norms and is a “step too far.”

Democrats are on defense in the House, with 40 seats rated competitive compared to the 29 marked competitive for the GOP. Democrats only need a net gain of three seats to flip the House. Historically, the House flips to the party opposite the White House in the midterm elections, as it has for the last five presidencies.

Democrats have responded to the pushback from some Republicans by pointing out that all of them voted against the 2021 For the People Act, which would have ended congressional gerrymandering.

DEMOCRATS WORRY THEY'RE GETTING TOO OLD FOR OFFICE

“That's great if you're pushing back on it, but I think the reality is that we're looking back at records, and if you didn't show up and vote for the ban on gerrymandering previously, well, we've got your number,” CEO of Girl and the Gov Sammy Kanter told the Washington Examiner.

“So it's a little bit too late in the game, at that point when your party has come out with a full stance towards something and taken action to achieve it, it's great if you're speaking out against it, but words don't do much, action is what's important,” she continued.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Ukraine launched drone strikes against Russia just one day before a meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, seeking to end the war. 

Both sides have played it tough ahead of the high-stakes summit, with Moscow piercing Ukraine's front lines this week, and Russian authorities announcing on Thursday that drone attacks by Kyiv killed one person and injured at least 16 others. 

One strike hit an apartment building in Rostov-on-Don, injuring 13 people, according to regional Gov. Yury Slyusar. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, said another strike injured three people and killed one in the village of Pristen. 

The Russian Ministry of Defense said its defense systems intercepted 44 of Ukraine's drones on Wednesday and early Thursday morning. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also continued drone strikes on Russian oil refineries, raising concerns from Hungary, which borders Ukraine. 

“Hungary is Ukraine's number one electricity supplier. Without us, the country's energy security would be highly unstable,” Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto wrote on X on Wednesday. 

“Given this, the Ukrainian attack on the Druzhba pipeline, which supplies Hungary with oil and is vital to our energy security, is outrageous,” he continued. “We firmly call on Ukraine to stop endangering Hungary's energy supply and to stop attacks on energy supply routes leading to Hungary in a war we Hungarians have nothing to do with!”

Trump is meeting with Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday as the United States seeks to bring the Ukraine-Russia war to an end. 

The president has repeatedly expressed a desire to bring the death and destruction caused by the war to a swift resolution.

Still, Putin and Zelensky have appeared unable to resolve crucial differences regarding territorial boundaries, with Kyiv adamantly denouncing the Russian president's hopes of acquiring the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson territories as part of a peace deal. 

However, this weekend's Trump-Putin summit could be a turning point in negotiations. 

“We have a big meeting,” Trump said in the Oval Office ahead of his departure to the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. “It's going to be very important for Russia and very important for us, and important to us since we're trying to save a lot of lives.”

BESSENT PRESSES EUROPE TO ALIGN WITH TRUMP'S TARIFF STRATEGY TO END UKRAINE WAR

The president suggested there is just a 25% chance the summit would be unsuccessful, indicating during a radio interview on Thursday that Zelensky could join him and Putin in a second meeting in Alaska if the first has a positive outcome. 

“It's like a chess game. This meeting sets up the second meeting. But there is a 25% chance that this meeting will not be a successful meeting,” Trump said. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The meeting could reveal how serious Trump's disaffection with the Russian leader really is. 

In Ukraine, the battle lines long ago calcified into a stalemate, with Russian invaders moving forward incrementally and occasionally getting pushed back. In the diplomatic sphere, however, the territory is shifting fast.

When Donald Trump meets Russia's Vladimir Putin today in Anchorage, Alaska, the summit will be the latest in a series of concessions by the American president. Trump's affection for Putin has waned—“I got along well with Putin,” he said this week, conspicuously adopting the past tense—as his frustration with the ongoing war waxes. Yet by inviting Putin to meet, he's allowing Russia to further protract the conflict.

During the 2024 presidential election, Trump vowed that he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours—or even before taking office. After those targets were far in the rearview, with no resolution in sight, he more than promised vague important developments in his trademark two-week increments. More recently, on July 28, he issued Putin a deadline of “10 or 12 days” to cease hostilities, and the following day, he narrowed that down: 10 days, or by August 8. On the day that the ultimatum ran out, Trump announced he'd meet Putin in person, despite no end to the violence.

For the Russian autocrat, this is a win in itself. Putin is a global pariah facing an international warrant for his arrest, but the United States is welcoming him to American soil for the first time since 2015. (The U.S. has never had much respect for international justice structures, but the Trump administration is particularly dismissive of them.) Without stopping his aggression against Ukraine, and despite blowing through a series of deadlines, he gets a photo op with Trump. Putin today praised what he called “quite energetic and sincere efforts” toward peace by his American counterpart, which is more than anyone can say for Putin himself.

What's in it for the president? As my colleagues Vivian Salama, Michael Scherer, and Jonathan Lemire reported last weekend, Trump has grand dreams of a legacy as a peacemaker—perhaps even one with a Nobel Prize. This gives Trump some reason for patience with Putin. But the expectations for this summit keep getting lowered. Initially, the White House allowed suggestions of a tentative peace deal—or at least a genuine cease-fire—to spread in the media.

Now the White House says that Trump will be in Alaska for a “listening exercise,” with Trump saying, “All I want to do is set the table for the next meeting.” He acknowledged this week that the U.S. doesn't have many levers to pull to stop the killings of Ukrainian civilians. “I've had a lot of good conversations with him,” Trump said, referring to Putin. “Then I go home and I see that a rocket hit a nursing home, or a rocket hit an apartment building and people are laying dead in the street.” It was a notable acknowledgment of limitations from a leader who prefers bluster, but Trump does often respond to images he sees on the news.

Earlier this week, Trump suggested that he might push a deal that ends the conflict by swapping territory between the countries. This would be a sweetheart deal for Putin, who would acquire legal control of large swaths of rich Ukrainian land he has already seized illegally by force. The idea received an angry response from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is not invited to the Alaska meeting—itself another win for Putin (though Trump has floated the possibility of Zelensky joining him and Putin in Alaska later). European leaders, who have sought to ease Trump toward their position of support for Kyiv, spoke with him earlier this week, and they said afterward that Trump would not offer any such deal.

But Trump still has little love lost with Zelensky. The men have improved their relationship since Trump and Vice President J. D. Vance berated Zelensky in the Oval Office early this year, but Trump's interest in Ukraine is purely instrumental—a way to earn plaudits for peace—just as it was when he tried to get Zelensky to assist his 2020 reelection campaign by opening an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden.

Trump, meanwhile, has been embarrassingly acquiescent to Putin in past conversations. During a March 2018 phone call, he congratulated Putin on his victory in an election almost universally viewed as illegitimate, despite an all-caps reminder atop his briefing sheet that warned, “DO NOT CONGRATULATE.” This was just a teaser for a meeting four months later in Helsinki, during which Trump accepted Putin's claim that Russia hadn't interfered in the 2016 election, and indicated that he trusted Putin over the U.S. intelligence community's consensus view. Today, Trump is meeting with Putin one-on-one, without aides who might help keep him on track.

Trump's posture in Anchorage will go some way toward revealing how serious and durable his disaffection with Putin is. But it won't end the war, and it may not even offer much progress toward a resolution. On Wednesday, Trump warned that there would be “very severe consequences” if Russia didn't stop the war, but he declined to outline them: “I don't have to say.” That's unlikely to rattle Putin, who knows how to call a bluff. But at least it doesn't give him another specific deadline to mock.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A professor at the Institute discovered that his students were quietly meeting outside class to write verse. What might it mean for the future of AI?

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

One of the highlights of my first three years as a literature professor at MIT—and indeed, of my 15-year career as an educator—has been the recent discovery that some of my students, past and present, formed an arts collective: The People's Poetry. It began, I was told, with the first class I taught at the institute. Several students in that course, “Reading Poetry: Social Poetics,” created their own group chat, and eventually started meeting outside of class to write together. Every time I taught a new course, their membership grew. These engineers and scientists in training, hailing from across the world, were gathering to compose and critique poems outside the classroom.

Many of these young people were, in other classes, studying or even actively developing forms of technology that raise a range of questions about the purpose and power of human expression: why humans write or draw; what ethics govern our inspiration and training; how the creative act brings us together and alters our thinking. In the midst of a technological revolution, while taking on a notoriously difficult courseload, why have they chosen to devote their time to the ancient art of making poems?

These kinds of questions are not unprecedented at the institute. In the early 1960s, the reading series Poetry From M.I.T. explored the relationship between a strong technical education and the pursuit of the good and the beautiful. In service of this larger inquiry, the series organizers invited renowned writers such as Robert Penn Warren, Denise Levertov, and Richard Wilbur to campus to share their work. These events were broadcast on WGBH, a Boston public-radio station, and featured timely insights on where the practice of poetry and the future of technology might intersect. My students bring some version of this exploration into the classroom with striking consistency—most vividly in their observations of how it feels to use poetry to work through our obsessions, our dreams, in times like these. And at a place like this, no less: an elite research university where they spend most of their time working on projects that feel orthogonal to that sort of labor.

The poet W. S. Merwin once said that you know you are writing a poem when a “sequence of words starts giving off what you might describe as a kind of electric charge.” I've been thinking about how to place the sort of liveness Merwin describes—the sense of your body as a living circuit that the poem moves through—in a world filling up with noise, marred by misdirection and distraction. When, how, and why do we make room for the miraculous? From moment to moment. In any way we can. Because it is part of the practice of being human.

A poem is not merely a record of human activity; it is intended to preserve the complexity, richness, and granular details of our inner lives. Poems provide an occasion for us to talk with one another, creating a shared monument we can carry into the future, establishing a rolling record of our heroes, our planet, our kin. This art form keeps what we love from disappearing. In Odes, the Roman poet Horace writes: “Many heroes lived before Agamemnon / but they are all unweepable, overwhelmed / by the long night of oblivion / because they lacked a sacred bard.” He is referring to Homer's epic The Iliad, a poem that survived by being passed down through live performance long before it was committed to paper. The preservation of the poem's history, in this case, was a communal affair: from bard to bard, and audience to audience, across time and space.

In a moment marked by widespread institutional investment in the promise of artificial intelligence, we should be asking more about not only what AI can and cannot do but what drives the desire for its proliferation: what hope, what sense of longing, boredom, or emptiness. A large language model is a prediction machine. Crucially, it does not think or dream. It establishes the likeliest sequence of words based on its training data and relays it back to you. A well-crafted poem performs a nearly opposite function. It is made from original, dynamic language choices, and it lives and dies on its ability to surprise. It is a means of preserving the particular.

And yet I'm led to wonder whether the hunger for connection, understanding, and astonishment that seems to characterize much of the public interest in AI derives from the same needs that poetry fulfills. The AI market thrives in part as a result of our desire for optimization, efficiency. Brevity is among poetry's greatest advantages; a poem can be written in minutes at the bus stop, during a break at work, or in those first quiet moments after dawn. Any occasion can offer inspiration: Gwendolyn Brooks composed the classic eight-line poem “We Real Cool” after seeing a group of pool players one afternoon in Chicago; Percy Shelley wrote “Ozymandias” during a competitive exchange of sonnets with a friend. At a book-launch party years ago in downtown Manhattan, I saw Sunni Patterson write a poem on the spot, minutes before going onstage, that incorporated lines from other performers who had recited their work throughout the night. In performance, this was both a mesmerizing display of processing speed and a form of loving citation.

The sheer velocity of this kind of language bears a trace of the supernatural. The words can appear to arrive from elsewhere, produced by an elevated consciousness outside our own. A mode of technology that conceals a lack of vetting, understanding, or humanity might bear a resemblance to such a consciousness in moments, but the source of its speed is not—as with Brooks, Shelley, or Patterson—a life spent working toward competence. It does not emerge from centuries of inherited language, or a bond forged for the first time in a room full of strangers and friends. It's worth asking where the warmth of poetry, its connective power across millennia, meets the advances and demands of our technological age.

From the invention of writing to the advent of the typewriter to the rise of the personal computer as collaborator, authors have attempted to address this quandary. Twentieth-century poets across a wide aesthetic range—Robert Frost, Sun Ra, X. J. Kennedy, Nikki Giovanni—asked us to consider “our place among the infinities,” as Frost once put it, the link between our timeless yearning for the stars and the scientific leaps that brought them closer to us. More contemporary writers, including Lillian-Yvonne Bertram and Keith S. Wilson (both of whom are also programmers), have designed works that combine the human voice and the music of machines. Once you know where to look, the overlap is astonishing.

One of poetry's greatest gifts is patience—not only with the difficulties of language but with ourselves as its vessels or makers, working to bring a new vision into the world. I see this dynamic firsthand in the form of an assignment I have been offering students for almost a decade now: the end-of-semester adaptation. Therein, I ask them to take a text we've studied over the course of the term and transform it using the tools of a different genre. Essays, short stories, and poems metamorphose into works of choreography, short films, and, on several occasions now, projects that pull from both the digital world and the living environment.

Matt, for instance, adapted a Lorraine Hansberry play, What Use Are Flowers?, into a device of his own invention called Melia, which uses a field microphone, an old physics-lab computer, and a neural-net algorithm to meld the human voice with the sounds of the natural world. To truly experience Melia, you have to go outside. You have to find a place by a river, or a grove where the cardinals are talking, or a spot where the breeze is blowing through a tupelo tree, and begin to sing. Suddenly, the voice you have always known is expanded, made new. Yasmeen, in another project, transformed Nikki Giovanni's “Winter Poem” into a series of digital collages in which people have become flowers while remaining in familiar settings and dress (imagine a bouquet of hydrangeas dressed in overalls, standing in front of a farmhouse, or a rush of rhododendrons in a blue suit walking down a crowded street, and you might be close).

Elizabeth took a third approach. Inspired by a class session on art-making, AI, and human imagination, she proposed a community program: Songbirds. Since her freshman year, Elizabeth has been visiting a local hospice—playing piano for elders, going on walks with them, and learning about their lives. With Songbirds, she wanted to add another element to the visits: the collaborative adaptation of memories into works of art. For this work, she initially thought of employing various AI tools as a primary means of approach. But she eventually decided to also call upon a range of older, more familiar technologies: her trusted piano, notebooks for poems, production software to engineer instrumentals. For anyone at the hospice who might be losing pieces of the past—the story of the moment he met his first great love; the last time he saw his mother alive; the day his daughter was born, said her first word, or first ran across the living room into his arms—a memory could now be preserved, with a bit of assistance, in the form of a song or poem.

In work like this, musicians, writers, and engineers all share space. They collaborate in service of human life and the preservation of all we adore. They remind us that poetry has always been a technology of memory and human connection: a way to remind ourselves of who and what we are to one another. Which is something infinitely more than we can say with words, although we must try—and in that striving, be made more lovely, and alive.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

As I listened this week to liberal politicians and journalists wave off talk of Washington, D.C.'s heartbreaking violence as mere Republican demagoguery, I was struck by many progressives' dispiriting inability to talk candidly about the plague of crime afflicting working-class and poor Americans. This denial opens a door for President Donald Trump to speak in a language, however cynical, that resonates with those voters.

Responding to Trump's takeover of policing in the nation's capital, Senator Tim Kaine, a liberal Democrat from Virginia, stated this week that crime “is at a 30-year low in D.C., making these steps a waste of taxpayer dollars.” Although that's true of violent crime in general, the city's murder rate was lower throughout the 2010s. The Guardian acknowledged that “violent crime is higher in Washington DC than the national average” but reassured readers that the capital is “not among the most violent large cities in the United States today.” Jim Kessler, a think-tank executive who previously worked as Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer's legislative and policy director, went on Fox News to advise Americans to stifle their fears. “If people are afraid to come to D.C.,” he said, “go to Disney World, get fat, eat French fries.”

I am loath to defend Trump's takeover of policing in D.C. Reassigning FBI agents as beat cops is a dubious crime-fighting practice, as agents know little of the District's neighborhoods and how to distinguish between the good folks and those who are pure trouble. National Guard soldiers, to state the obvious, have little training in police work.

Charles Fain Lehman: Trump is right that D.C. has a serious crime problem

And some of the nation's most violent cities—such as Memphis, Cleveland, and Little Rock, Arkansas—are found in pro-Trump states.

That doesn't mean the city is safe, or that it's politically wise to dismiss concerns about crime. Trump's opponents this week made much of the fact that homicides in the District fell from 287 in 2023 to 187 in 2024. That improved number in the District is equivalent in per capita terms to 2,244 homicides in New York City. The actual count there last year was 377—slightly more than twice as many homicides as in D.C., but New York has more than 12 times as many people.

When I worked for The Washington Post in the late 1990s—not long after the period when D.C. was the nation's murder capital—I reported on the city's tragically high homicide rates. Both then and now, that problem, like so many other aspects of life in Washington, was de facto segregated by race and class. The Post recently published a map of 2024 homicides, with tiny circles for the name and location of everyone who was killed. This becomes clear: To wander the predominantly white, upper-middle-class neighborhoods west of Rock Creek Park and the thoroughly gentrified areas of Capitol Hill and the Navy Yard is to pass through neighborhoods with homicide rates closer to Copenhagen's.

But across the Anacostia River in the majority-Black Wards 7 and 8, where more than 40 percent of the children live in poverty, reality is far grimmer. More than half of the District's homicides last year occurred in these wards. Four years ago, the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform released a report on gun violence in D.C. Well in excess of 90 percent of the victims and suspects were Black males, the report found, “despite Black residents comprising only 46 percent of the overall population in the District.”

Jonathan Chait: Donald Trump doesn't really care about crime

When I arrived in Washington in 1996, the Post would print at the beginning of each week a news brief that reduced the preceding weekend's death toll to a terrible agate of victims' names and addresses. What I recall most from that time was talking with young men who had seen friends killed, and some of whom possessed terrifying armaments and body armor. Mothers described to me how they trained their children to roll off their bed and hit the floor at the sound of gunfire. A grieving father told me maybe it was just as well that his son, a drug dealer, had died. “If he'd made it,” he said, “the first thing that would have come to his mind was revenge.”

The intensity of that bloodletting was not easily explained at the time—and that remains the case today. The D.C. police force still has more officers per capita than New York City or Chicago, and that does not include the federal police forces patrolling Capitol Hill and the parks. Something remains terribly wrong in too many neighborhoods in the District, and no one should dismiss that just because Trump appears to be making cynical use of that misery.

I have no doubt that Trump enjoys targeting Democratic-controlled cities for embarrassment. I also have little doubt that a mother in Ward 8 might draw comfort from a National Guard soldier standing watch near her child's school. And I try to imagine having the audacity to insist to her that the homicides and the danger that are her daily reality are somehow a phantasm.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

In the end, And Just Like That couldn't hide its shame that its characters were aging.

Carrie Bradshaw's last episode of television ended not with a bang but with a flush, which feels appropriate somehow. “Party of One,” the series finale of HBO Max's And Just Like That, rehashes old patterns for the show's last hurrah, but no one's heart seems to really be in it: Miranda tries to adjust to an unexpected pregnancy; Seema wonders if she could be happily partnered without marriage; Charlotte tells Carrie, “I'm so excited to show you my new hallway,” to which Carrie replies, pro forma, “I may be alone for the rest of my life.” The image left in my head, though, is of the toilet bowl being frantically flushed by Charlotte's art-dealer boss, a man whose private jet can't spare him from the gastrointestinal Thanksgiving issues of a lactose-intolerant Gen Zer. Humiliation, more than anything else, has been the theme of all three seasons of And Just Like That, a cringe comedy without comedy. (Who among us will ever forget Carrie peeing into a plastic bottle while Miranda got to third base with Che in her kitchen, or Charlotte taking a pratfall onto a Tracey Emin–esque art installation and emerging with a used condom stuck to her face?)

To be fair to the series, which is more than it deserves, Sex and the City was also often about mortification—the indignity of putting yourself out there as a single woman time and time again, only to be rewarded with funky spunk, porn-addicted dates, pregnancy scares, STDs, men who can't ejaculate without shouting misogynist slurs, envelopes full of cash on the nightstand. When it debuted on HBO in 1998, Darren Star and Michael Patrick King's show seemed determined to puncture the fantasy of single life in post-feminist Manhattan. “Welcome to the age of un-innocence,” Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie narrated in the pilot. “No one has breakfast at Tiffany's, and no one has affairs to remember. Instead we have breakfast at 7 a.m. and affairs we try to forget as quickly as possible.”

Read: And Just Like That is a far cry from Sex and the City

Over the course of six seasons and two movies, the show's thrillingly cynical core got smothered by cloying commercialism—a fixation on both wide-eyed romance and flamboyant luxury. What stayed consistent, though, was the disgust the show seemed to manifest anytime it was forced to think about the corporeal bodies beneath the characters' clothes: Carrie's horror at Miranda's postpartum nipples and Samantha's disgust at her unwaxed bikini line, Charlotte's refusal to look at her own vagina, Anthony's appalled proclamation—when Samantha returned from Los Angeles approximately three pounds heavier—of “Mother of God, what's with the gut!”

And Just Like That has been a lot of things since its debut late in 2021: an apologia for the sins of the past, a lookbook, a backdrop for cameos from the two most Machiavellian men on reality television. But it's consistently been oddly squeamish about both sex and human physicality—almost pathologically so. During the first season, critics winced at the heavy-handed flagellation of the characters for their unconscious bias and uptight middle age; during the second, the show's lack of purpose and stakes crystallized into excruciating storylines about strap-on sex toys and, in one case, an unsolicited octogenarian dick pic that rudely interrupted a fundraiser with Gloria Steinem. The third season, set in the more genteel location of Carrie's new Gramercy Park townhouse, seemed nevertheless stuck on the idea that anyone still tuning in must be watching with the sound off, cackling at the visuals of their favorite characters being ritualistically shamed for the crime of aging.

And so: We had not one but two stories about Harry's penis—first a brief examination of something called “ghost sperm” that troubled Charlotte during sex, followed by a multi-episode storyline about prostate cancer that left Harry impotent and peeing all over his raw-denim jeans. Seema's armpits occupied a variety of scenes, culminating in the gardener she began dating recommending a crystal deodorant that failed her during a crucial business meeting. Charlotte's sudden struggle with vertigo left her staggering all over Manhattan like a toddler on a boat. Miranda, cursed on this show like no one else, had sex with someone who turned out to be a virgin nun, accidentally flashed Carrie, became a meme after a disastrous appearance on live television, and eventually found love with a woman who's strikingly weird about her dogs, even for a Brit.

Read: We need to talk about Miranda

And Just Like That, as Jake Nevins wrote in July, “feels, at times, openly hostile to its own source material and even to the characters themselves.” The pie shoved in Anthony's face by his lover, Giuseppe, felt like a neat distillation of how crudely the series seemed to clown its characters, week after week after week. Earlier this year, I wrote about television's current obsession with extreme wealth, and how shows such as And Just Like That suffer from the diminished stakes that come with easy abundance. When you're insulated from calamity, maybe, the worst thing that can happen is physical degradation—a reminder that no matter how big your closet, how exclusive your couture, we all share the same basic bodily functions, which can fail and shame us in all the same discomfiting ways. Still, the casual cruelty with which And Just Like That treated its cast's bodies as punch lines and visual gags seemed to suggest a deeper unease with what it means to age—to be undeniably, messily human.

The show occasionally expressed the same kind of disgust toward poverty, or toward any evidence of how rising inequality in New York has left many people to live. In the finale, Carrie visits her old apartment, now occupied by a jewelry designer named Lisette, and is horrified to see that Lisette has divided the studio into two claustrophobic spaces with a temporary wall, presumably because she can't afford roughly 600 square feet on the Upper East Side all by herself. The moment reminded me of a plotline in Season 2, in which Miranda went home with a voice actor who was her dream date, only to be repelled by the woman's cramped space: the cat-litter tray, the unmade bed.

No one wants their fantasies to be punctured so abruptly, and yet both scenes demonstrate how out of touch these characters have become, and how hard it is for us to empathize with them in turn. Anthropological curiosity used to define Carrie's work as a columnist; now, in her 50s, she's happier behind the walls of an inward-facing fantasy land, posing for no one in her pre–Gilded Age living room, and turning her romantic misadventures into a god-awfully mawkish historical novel. It's not the ending I would have chosen, but it sure does make it easier to say goodbye.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Garry Kasparov: I was born on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall. When I visited Ronald Reagan's Ranch Center in Santa Barbara, California, in 2016, they had a big piece of the wall Reagan helped tear down on display. I joked that I didn't recognize it because I had only seen the other side.

Back in 1987, I was speaking at an event in West Germany, and I told people that I was sure that the collapse of the Berlin Wall was inevitable and would happen very soon. They looked at me like, Okay, that's crazy. But he's young, 24, and he's just a chess player. What does he know? And they stopped listening. This was before Ronald Reagan's famous “tear down this wall” speech in Berlin, which was around a month later.

Another famous four words from a U.S. president also concerned Berlin. President Harry Truman said We stay in Berlin, to promise that U.S. forces would protect and supply West Berlin during Stalin's siege of the city in 1948: the famous Berlin airlift. Not to put myself in the company of U.S. presidents, but I was inspired by Reagan and Truman in my own Berlin speech at Aspen Institute on October 14th, 2015.

I titled it “Four Words to Change History.” I said, “We must remember that societies do not have values. People have values. If we want our values to succeed, we must protect the people who hold them wherever they are, whoever they are. And if I may finish with my own four words here today: Fight for our values.”

From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I'm Garry Kasparov.

[Music]

My guest is Mathias Döpfner, joining me from Berlin. He's a journalist who is now the CEO of the multinational media and technology company Axel Springer. He leads dozens of publications in many countries, including Politico and Business Insider in the United States and Bild and Die Welt in Germany, among many others. He is German, and it is a German perspective I was after from him. Many around Europe and the world are waiting for Germany to lead. So will it?

[Music]

Kasparov: Hello, Mathias. Thank you very much for joining our program.

Mathias Döpfner: Hello, Garry.

Kasparov: Quick question. Are you at your office now?

Döpfner: Absolutely, at my office in Berlin.

Kasparov: So I want to let the listeners know that this office, that was built by the founder of your company Axel Springer, if I'm correct, in 1966, it's literally next to the former Berlin Wall that divided—physically divided—the free and unfree world back during the Cold War. So it was standing on the edge of democracy and autocracy. Not anymore, now. But not to put too fine a point on it: It is precisely what this show is about. So from this perch, tell me—what do you see as a principal threat to democracy in Europe? And what is Europe's place in this ever-changing world today?

Döpfner: Yeah; thank you, Garry. So sitting here in our kind of historic headquarters building, it's a golden skyscraper right at the edge of the former wall and death strip. Just to illustrate that: When we literally cross the street in order to get to the new part of our headquarters, we cross a row of cobblestones, and these cobblestones are marking exactly the spot where the wall used to be. So this building literally was built as a lighthouse of freedom, as the founder called it. It turned out to be the new center of a reunified Berlin and a reunified Germany, with a lot of euphoria around the idea that freedom prevails, the open-society model prevails.

And at the moment it looks quite different, and it looks different from a factual base. If you check the results of Freedom House analysis and other comparable analyses of the state of freedom, then you see a freedom recession globally for many years. There's never been such a significant downgrading of formerly free countries to partly free and formerly partly free countries to unfree. But also most of the centrist democracies are in relatively weak shape, whereas autocratic authoritarian systems pretty systematically achieve their goals and gain ground.

So it's quite a challenging time for the open-society model. And on top of that, we have internal issues. I think we should not only look at the external threats and the autocrats and dictators, we should also look at ourselves and what we need to do differently in order to succeed.

Kasparov: Agreed. So let's look deep inside. Let's start with Germany. So 35 years ago there was a reunification. Many believed, you know, it would be beyond our wildest dreams and it would never happen. It did happen. Has unification happened in minds as well as geographically and politically?

Döpfner: Well, Garry, I'm not a diplomat, so I speak very openly. Also if it's about my own country. I remember very well when the wall came down. A prominent publisher here in Berlin, Wolf Jobst Siedler, said it's going to take at least a generation until we will see real integration of mindset, and until we see real unification psychologically and mentally. I thought this was totally exaggerated, that it was going to be a question of two, three, five years. It's now more than a quarter of a century, and still there is quite a significant divide. There is still an East and West Germany, and you see that on many levels also politically. At the same time, we also have to realistically see that all together—with regard to management and the economy—the reunification was a success and went well, and there is a lot of prosperity. And if you go to the East German cities and compare them, how they look like 30 years ago—uncomparable. And there is so much progress and wealth and positive development that we should also not be too negative about it. We should be also a bit thankful.

On the third level, and that I think is the most important one, Germany has developed, for many various reasons, a degree of complacency that I find more and more dangerous. And I think we have to really take that as a warning call to do things differently. And here, of course, there is a lot of hope with regard to the new government that is in place and that could, with strong leadership, solve the problems—most importantly, the problem of an economic turnaround. And with regard to migration, we also need a very significant shift conceptually and with regard to execution. I think those are the two most important topics, but that requires really bold decisions in leadership.

Kasparov: After unification, Germany has become the largest country in Europe, and it's a driving engine of the European Union. But considering the, historical, call it liabilities or historical baggage, so, is Germany ready now—after so many years, 80 years since the end of World War II—is Germany ready to overcome this sense of historical guilt and to become a positive force to take a lead?

Döpfner: That's a very interesting question, Garry. Because truly I think this phase of German history during the Third Reich, the Holocaust, and everything that led to this unparalleled horrors have deeply traumatized the country and in a way discredited the term leadership and the idea of leadership and even the idea of excellence, to a certain degree. The unfortunate misunderstanding of this chapter of German history is that not only you should never be involved in any form of military conflict; pacifism is a naive idea. The second horrible misunderstanding is that leadership and excellence is almost something negative. It associates with Germany needs to lead the world and needs to dominate the world. And the irony is that almost everybody in Europe and in the entire world is waiting for German leadership and thinks Germany needs to lead it—needs to lead Europe together with other countries. And that leads me to the second element of your question. Are we able to overcome the traumas? Hopefully not in the sense that we forget about it. I think what happens should never be forgotten and we should learn from that. But we should learn the right lessons.

And the right lessons are always: Do everything to defend the free-and-open-society model. And if we lead with good intentions and in the spirit of partnership together with others, then I think that is the most credible and the most successful mindset. I think apart from a right value set and system of coordinates, the most important thing that the new German chancellor needs to prove and needs to have is courage. To move fast, to act and not only speak, and to really tackle the two biggest priorities: economy and migration.

Kasparov: Yeah, I think of one of Winston Churchill's famous phrases: that no success is final, no failure is fatal, what counts is the courage to continue. Because he has challenges both domestically and internationally. So you mentioned economy and migration. Now, do you consider energy independence as a part of the economy?

Döpfner: Very big issue. Here, the elephant in the room is nuclear energy. Will this government go back to nuclear power plants? That is the big question that everybody is asking at the moment in Germany, because an energy policy that is based on windmills or only solar is not going to solve the problems and is not going to provide the energy that you need, also with regard to excellence in artificial intelligence, so—

Kasparov: But let us again remind our audience that Germany made the decision to walk away from nuclear energy. What, back in 2011, yes?

Döpfner: Yeah, I remember. I can share an anecdote with you. I remember very well. I was invited to the Russian Embassy by the Russian ambassador with a group of editors of Axel Springer for lunch. And it was a coincidence that the lunch took place on that very day, and each person had a glass of vodka at the table. And before we started, the ambassador was raising the vodka glasses and said, Let me cheer to the German chancellor. The decision to drop out of nuclear energy will be very good for Russian energy and for the Russian economy. And people looked a little bit irritated and basically thought it's a joke, but then they realized it was the—

Kasparov: It was greatest gift to [Vladimir] Putin.

Döpfner: Right, exactly.

Kasparov: Because that made Russia the sole supplier or this major supplier of energy to Germany—and via Germany to many other European countries.

Döpfner: I personally think it was one of the most irresponsible decisions of German governments in postwar history, because not only did it create the biggest damage to the German economy and the German energy sector, but more importantly, it has basically strengthened and financed the Putin that we have to deal with since then—and the Putin who then invaded Crimea and who then invaded Ukraine. And the money is the main resource that has funded that war. It's quite a sad case, and it shows again why trade policy, economic policy, is so directly intertwined with geopolitics and security politics. And that's why this whole decision to drop out of nuclear energy is way, way bigger than just a topic in the context of coalition scenarios or energy policies. It goes way beyond it.

Kasparov: Now, the German political map today—again, I'm old enough to remember when Germany was in a classic two-party system, you know, social Democrats on the central left, and Christian Democrats on the right. Now it's a mess. But the danger is that we could see in Germany as everywhere, both in America and Europe, the growing strengths of the radicals on the far left and far right. So the German political map today has a great number of MPs and growing strength of both AfD—Alternative für Deutschland, far right—and also two far-left groups. So how do you describe this new—the political realignment? And how dangerous is the threat of these combined attacks on democracy from the far right and far left? Obviously the far-right group is much bigger. They won more than 20 percent in the last elections, and I think now, their popularity level stands at nearly 25 percent. So just give us just a little bit of a sense of this very dispersed political field. So the political map is quite messy for the traditional two-party system.

Döpfner: This phenomenon, I think it is simply the result of failed and unsuccessful centrist policies and the lack of credibility of centrist political leaders. So if we tackle that problem, we should first look at what did the centrist parties, what did the older parties, the political establishment do wrong? And why feel people, the need to look for alternatives and shift more to the extremes? Why are they seduced by the easy solutions? And I think that is also a pretty global phenomenon where the extremes are getting stronger. The center has made mistakes and should start with self-criticism. Now, concretely to Germany, both extremes are very dangerous and have some ideas that are very anti-constitutional and particularly dangerous with regard to geopolitics and the future of open societies.

Kasparov: Yeah. I want to just talk a bit more about AfD, Alternative für Deutschland. Because the other far-right groups and parties like in France—Marine Le Pen's—or Nigel Farage [and the] Reform Party in Great Britain—they refuse to deal with AfD. They believe it's too far right and it has an open nostalgia for Nazi Germany. So can you tell us more about the nature of this party and the threat it can represent to German democracy and to European integration? Because it's, of course, it's against a united Europe.

Döpfner: I think indeed the foreign-policy concepts, the geopolitical consequences, of that are by far the biggest threat that this party provides. The admiration for strongmen and autocratic countries—like almost Russia, but also China and others—reflect a totally different idea of society, a different idea of leadership. And also the consequences geopolitically would be horrific, I think, for the open-society model and the world order that we are discussing today. That's why I find it particularly hard to understand why this movement is so much more popular in the eastern states of Germany than in the western part of Germany. And that is actually counterintuitive, because you should think like other Eastern European countries—who basically experienced Soviet communism and the ruthlessness of that system—that should lead to a lot of realistic and skeptical expectations with regard to future relationships with Russia, and the future influence of Russia or dealing with China. But the opposite seems to be true. And that is, for me, very hard to explain. Honestly, Garry, I have no very convincing explanation for that.

Kasparov: Let's talk about sympathy to AfD not from the east, but from the west. Actually the far, far west—in D.C. So it seems there are quite a few fans of AfD in Trump's administration. Definitely it's J. D. Vance, who openly supported not just AfD but almost every far-right political group in Europe that was fighting in the elections to get into power. So how do you explain that?

Döpfner: I think it would be particularly negative for the United States, because in large parts of the party there is a deeply rooted anti-Americanist approach, a deeply rooted anti-capitalist approach. And I would be curious how that would play out with regard to the transatlantic relationship. I mean, just take the very concrete request or proposal: no American weapons on German ground. That's funny. Putin will like that, but that's not good for Germany. Now, maybe some people in America may say, Well, that's nice for America, because we have lower expenses in that context. But I think the price that the United States would pay in the long term for that would be enormous, would go up, definitely. Because a Putin that is encouraged by such a move would not stop in Ukraine. He would go further.

Kasparov: So am I hearing you saying that without America, without American leadership, the global democracy will be in peril and may collapse?

Döpfner: Yes. I think it's a very nice but slightly naive idea that now the big historic opportunity is, since America is sending a lot of disturbing and surprising signals, Europe could do it alone or could do it better. It's not going to work.

[Music]

Döpfner: The challenges of China, the challenges of Russia, and the challenges of Islamist dictatorships are much too big in order to be solved by Europe alone, and I would even go that far— they are also way too big than being solvable by the United States alone.

Kasparov: We'll be right back.

[Break]

Kasparov: But let's look at this geopolitical chess board: The United States, China, and of course Russia is still there. So it's a relatively small economy, but you have nukes, [an] army, you have a crazy dictator who made war as an engine of his power. And what is Europe here? Because I think one of the problems between Europe and America and now the way, I think, the Trump administration is viewing Europe is—Europe is divided, is too weak. And Germany is not ready to play the leading role to unite Europe—and to make it speak with one voice that could put Europe at this negotiating table and make, you know, European opinion, European power, to be counted. Do you believe that Europe still has its potential, again led by Germany, to make herself relevant?

Döpfner: The short answer is yes. Europe is a sleeping beauty. It's just a great continent with wonderful countries and a beautiful, probably the most attractive, lifestyle in the world. But it's also sleeping. It's sleeping because it developed a very dangerous degree of complacency. Now the question is: Can that be changed? And here, my take is more optimistic. I think what is happening at the moment in the world is very disturbing. And it can be the beginning of the end—it can be the beginning of the end of the open-society model, of the idea of a free rules–based society, of democracy, of the rule of law, of human rights. And we will have a very different world order. Now, being at the verge of that, seeing the dangers and facing a lot of volatility in the United States and a lot of rigor and aggression in nondemocratic superpowers like China, I think it has the potential to really be the healthy wake-up call—the healthy wake-up call for democracy in the open-society model, and the healthy wake-up call for Europe. And then I think that would be a reawakening of Europe. aAnd suddenly in 10 years, the world can look completely different. People may say, Wow, what a shift of labor, excellence, know-how, value creation to European countries. What a different world where these open societies stick together and build strategic alliances in the economy, but also in the field of defense and security. So I truly think we are at a pivotal moment where both is possible: the beginning of the end, or the healthy wake-up call that starts a new decade, a new century, where Europe plays a more important and a better role.

Kasparov: You said, I think, sleeping beauty. For me, that doesn't constitute any strength. So it is basically waiting for a courageous prince to wake her up with a magic kiss. Is it a sleeping beauty or a sleeping giant?

Döpfner: That's a very good point. It's a beautiful giant, let's call it. But in any case—

Kasparov: That's an interesting mixture.

Döpfner It's—in any case, we definitely agree that it's sleeping at the moment, but I also agree with your criticism of beauty is not enough. And I think with the right injection of energy and ambition and aspiration, it can be a new player, a new giant.

Kasparov: Three and a half years of war in Ukraine. You can hear them from Berlin. Was it not enough to wake Europe up? So how come that in three and a half years, Europe—Europe!—has provided less help for Ukraine than North Korea for Russia? You're still contemplating your next moves. You don't want to see that Putin is at war with Europe. It's a kind of hybrid war. He has been openly interfering in elections in Germany, in Romania, in France, in Britain. So everywhere. What else do you need to wake up? And let's again go back to Germany—can Germany just take a lead? Three and a half years have been lost, so what does come next?

Döpfner: First of all, Garry, I totally agree with your analysis. Secondly, I don't have a very good answer why it's still sleeping. I wrote a text a few days after the invasion in Ukraine and said, This is now a moment where the West has to act, where NATO members have to act. Whether it's under Article V or not. But this is the moment where we have to show strength, because only strength and military deterrence is avoiding an escalation and is avoiding a bigger and long-lasting conflict. And if we don't do that, the price is going to be higher. I was criticized as a warmonger; I was criticized to risk a nuclear escalation. And so on.

So from today's perspective, it feels quite sad, because I still think—and I'm still deeply convinced—had we acted faster and more determinedly, we could have avoided a large degree of what has happened since then. And now we are in a much worse place. Nevertheless, I think it is not too late, and if you just take a percentage of budgets that NATO members and the West is basically investing in order to stop Putin, it is so minor. It is so minimal compared to what Putin is investing. And that leads me to the very simple result: If we would want to stop that, we could stop it. And there is, I don't know—it's a mix of opportunism and naivety. And also a wrong narrative, that only if we are nice to Putin and if we are not focusing too much on military force, only then we can calm him down, which is so wrong. It is misreading so much the mind of almost all totalitarian leaders, and particularly of Putin, who is basically testing the West and always seeing how far can he go. And the further we let him go, the more he will do, and the higher the price is going to be. So it is already late. It's not too late, but we wasted a lot of time.

Kasparov: Again, realistically, so whatever we say about NATO and its historical role, the role has played over 75 years. I mean, it's dead now. It's not functioning. And definitely, the next three-plus years, while Trump is in office, nobody expects NATO to be what it used to be—the organization that we relied upon for decades. I share your optimism that, you know, eventually there will be some kind of new alignment or realignment in European-American relations. The global democracies will get together. But that's in the future. But currently, we have the war. So can Germany, in your opinion, lead this new defense alliance as the prototype for the future version of NATO—to make sure that this war can be won, or at least Ukraine can survive the Russian onslaught? And, what are the limits for Germany in building such an alliance? How realistic is it to envision the German role as an engine for this defense coalition?

Döpfner: Can Germany do that? Yes; Germany can do that. Will Germany do that is more complex. And here I think there is one psychological reason why there is a risk that is not happening. And I mentioned that already. It is history. It is a bit this fear of taking military leadership. I mean, the world was fearing for decades, for good reasons, for German military initiatives, for military ambitions, in a way for military leadership. And I think that is also a very, very kind of poisoned ground.

And that may lead to more reluctance than we need, and that could be a reason why it's not happening or why it's not happening fast enough. But if I may, let us also not forget the possibility that something happens that may be surprising from today's perspective, but psychologically not unlikely. And that is the more Putin plays with Trump, the more he publicly embarrasses Trump—gaining time, not making real concessions, not sticking to agreements, the more Donald Trump could feel provoked. And if Putin continues to do that, then I think Trump could surprise everybody by really changing his mind completely. And then we could have a totally different situation, not only psychologically, but also militarily.

Kasparov: Oh, I'm afraid you're a dreamer, Mathias.

Döpfner: Maybe I am a dreamer, yeah. But do you really think that it's realistic that Trump leaves the field as the loser, having been kind of outsmarted by Putin and basically saying, Okay, I resign. You won, Vladimir. I just leave the battlefield as a loser. For me, it's also hard to imagine, simply psychologically.

Kasparov: Yeah. But Trump's psychology, it's just, it's always to turn any failure into a victory. Okay then; now just going to the end of our conversation. So let's concentrate on what Germany could, should, and hopefully will do. So will Germany move on with the rearmament plans? So investing heavily in its military-industrial complex, building new weapons, and becoming a military powerhouse once again?

Döpfner: I think the likelihood is very high, if you just look to the kind of changes in social behavior. Just a few years ago, people from the weapon—from the defense industry were not even invited to dinner parties. Today, they are stars of dinner parties. Everybody talks to them. They are perceived as heroes. They are perceived as guards of freedom and democracy. So the mindset has really fundamentally changed. And also the number of start-ups that are dealing with drones, and dealing with new technologies of defense, is skyrocketing. People are preparing for that, and everybody sees the need for that. So the likelihood that that mindset changes is pretty high.

Kasparov: So do you think that it's realistic that Germany will also build its strong army that will become the core of this military barrier against potential Russian aggression?

Döpfner: Mmm, that's a long shot. I don't know how developed the willingness of German people is to defend their country. I think it's already tough to defend our country, and even tougher to defend Europe. But maybe I have a slightly—maybe my take is too negative here.

Kasparov: Yeah. No, but it's very important to hear—because I'm afraid, you know, I share your pessimism here. All these guns, all these shells, all these drones: They are not too effective without the willpower behind it. Without manpower behind it. And it seems to me that Germany is yet to cross this road. So it's like from West Berlin to East Berlin. So just from this historical guilt, you know, from this peace-mongering to war reality. Can you imagine just, you know, that as a part of this coalition, Germany may develop nuclear weapons to deter Russia?

Döpfner: Unlikely.

Kasparov: Unlikely. So that means that Germany will always depend on other countries, because the successful deterrence is not—against Russia—will not work without a nuclear umbrella. So who will provide the nuclear umbrella during Trump's years? France, Britain? How do you think Germany will manage it?

Döpfner: Maybe France and Britain will play a bigger role. That's a possibility. But again, I think without America, it's going to be very tough. That's why it is in our very vital interest to keep a healthy relationship with America, regardless whether we like the government or not. It's an overarching paradigm, I think, for Europe and for Germany.

Kasparov: So just a very final question. So you just give us the next three years, just for the next three years of the Trump administration: What will be the ideal outcome? So for us to dream about 2028— from the German perspective?

Döpfner: Strong German leadership leads to conceptual priorities. One is to lead Europe in military strength and support in Ukraine, in defense, in order to limit Putin's aggression. That will impress the United States, because a stronger Europe will be taken more seriously. And a Europe that does more for its own defense will be more credible as a partner to negotiate deals on other levels.

And the second thing will be changed in Germany and in Europe. And that is: that we reach out to America, agreeing on a mutual strategy, trade strategy, toward China, defend that strategy together at the negotiation table. Achieve a much, much better deal with China that strengthens Europe and America. That weakens Putin, that limits China, that strengthens the democratic world. That will be the beginning of a new, prosperous era for America. America First from an American perspective, and a stronger Europe, Europe First, from a European perspective. But based on mutual values excelling together. That would be the most optimistic outcome that would strengthen the open-society model and freedom and democracy. But Garry, honestly, that is the ultimate degree of optimism that I can develop at this stage. Let's work on that. Let's hope for it. But let's not count on it. Prepare for the worst in order to get positively surprised.

[Music]

Kasparov: Yes, we can prepare for the worst, but it's very important to have a vision. And thank you very much for laying down this positive vision, Mathias. And I hope that at least part of this vision will be realized soon.

Döpfner: That would be something.

Kasparov: And first of all is, of course, you know, for Ukraine A) to survive, B) to win. And eventually the Putin regime to collapse and Europe to become a real geopolitical player: to wake up from its sleep and to become, as you said, a beautiful giant on the world stage.

Döpfner: Wonderful. I totally agree.

Kasparov: Yes. Thank you very much, Mathias; thank you.

Döpfner: Thank you, Garry.

This deal has everything: semiconductors, DeepSeek, constitutional violations.

Whatever else can be said about the second Trump administration, it is always teaching me about parts of the Constitution I had forgotten were even in there.

Case in point: Article I, Section 9, Clause 5 states that “No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.” This is known as the export clause, not to be confused with the import-export clause (Article I, Section 10, Clause 2). The Supreme Court has repeatedly held, most recently in 1996's US v. IBM, that this clause bans Congress and the states from imposing taxes on goods exported from one state to another or from the US to foreign countries.

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

I found myself reading US v. IBM after President Donald Trump announced an innovative new deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD. They can now export certain previously restricted chips to China but have to pay a 15 percent tax to the federal government on the proceeds. Now, I'm not a lawyer, but several people who are lawyers, like former National Security Council official Peter Harrell, immediately interpreted this as a clearly unconstitutional export tax (and as illegal under the 2018 Export Control Reform Act, to boot).

At this point, there's something kind of sad and impotent about complaining that something Trump is doing is illegal and unconstitutional. It feels like yelling at the refs that the Harlem Globetrotters aren't playing fair; of course they aren't, no one cares. The refs are unlikely to step in here, either. The parties with the standing to sue and block the export taxes are Nvidia and AMD, and they've already agreed to go along with it.

Maybe the best we can do is understand why this happened and what it means for the future of AI.

While AMD is included in the deal, for all practical purposes, the AI chips in question are being made by Nvidia — and the main one in question is the H20.

As I explained last month, the H20 is entirely the product of US export controls meant to limit export of excessively powerful chips to China. Nvidia took its flagship H100 chip, widely used for AI training, and dialed its processing power (as measured in floating point operations per second) way down, thus satisfying rules restricting advanced chips that the Biden administration put in place and Trump has maintained.

At the same time, it dialed up the memory bandwidth (or the rate at which data moves between the chip and system memory) past even H100's levels. That makes the H20 better than the H100 at answering queries to AI models in action, even if it's worse at training those models to start with.

Critics saw this all as an attempt to obey the letter of the export controls while violating their spirit. It still meant Nvidia was exporting very useful, powerful chips to Chinese AI firms, which could use those to catch up with or leap ahead of US firms — precisely what the Biden administration was trying to prevent. In April, the Trump administration seemed to agree when it sent Nvidia a letter informing it that it would not receive export licenses for shipping H20s to China.

Then, in July, reportedly after both some bargaining with China over rare earth metals and a personal entreaty from Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang, Trump flip-flopped; the chips could go to China after all. The only thing new this month is that he wants to get a cut of the proceeds.

That, of course, is an important new element, not least because it seems bad that the president is asserting the power to unilaterally impose new taxes without Congress. (At least with tariffs, Trump has some laws Congress passed he can cite theoretically granting the authority.) But the big question about H20s remains the same: Does this help Chinese companies like DeepSeek catch up with US companies like OpenAI? And how bad is that, if it happens?

The concerns here are such that maybe the best way to understand them is to imagine a debate between a pro-export and anti-export advocate. I'm taking some poetic license here, in part because people in the sector are often averse to plainly saying what they mean on the record. But I think it's a fair reflection of the debate as I've heard it.

Anti-Export Guy: Trump says he wants the US to have “global dominance” in AI, and here he is, just letting China have very powerful chips. This obviously hurts the US's edge.

Pro-Export Guy: Does it? Again, the H20 is powerful, but it's no H100. In any case, Chinese firms are totally allowed to rent out advanced AI chips in US-based cloud servers. DeepSeek could even rent time on an H100 that way. So, why are we freaking out about exporting a weaker chip?

Anti-Export: You act like the cloud option is a loophole — it's a feature! That way, they're dependent on US servers and companies. If Chinese AI firms ever start making dangerous systems, the US can shut off their access, and they'll be out of luck.

Pro-Export: Again, will they be out of luck? There's a third option after Nvidia exports and US servers. Huawei is making its own AI-optimized chips. Chinese firms don't want to depend on foreign servers forever, and if we deny them Nvidia chips, they'll run right over to Huawei chips.

Anti-Export: Saying you don't need Nvidia chips when you have Huawei chips is like if you told someone 20 years ago that they don't need an iPod because they have a Zune. Yes, Huawei chips exist, but they're so much worse. They're lower bandwidth than H20s, Huawei's software libraries are full of bugs, and the chips sometimes dangerously overheat.

Pro-Export: You're exaggerating. By some metrics, Huawei's latest systems (not just the chips, but the surrounding servers) outperform Nvidia's top-end model — even though that model uses B200s that are faster than H100s and lightyears faster than you'd ever be allowed to export to China. Yes, programmers will have to learn Huawei's libraries, and transitioning from Nvidia's will take time, but it's doable. Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI have all recently moved away from Nvidia chips toward things like Google's own TPUs or Amazon's Trainiums. That took effort, but they did it.

Anti-Export: Sure, but those companies still use Nvidia's too. OpenAI wants 100,000 chips in one Norwegian facility alone. And while US companies may be trying out the competition, Chinese companies still vastly prefer Nvidia to Huawei. DeepSeek reportedly had to delay its latest model because it tried to train it on Huawei chips but couldn't. Even if Huawei chips were popular, Huawei lacks the production capacity to meet demand. It relies on smuggled components to make its top-end chips and can make at most 200,000 this year, compared to the roughly 10 million Nvidia chips shipped annually. There's no substitute for Nvidias.

I suppose we'll see, in the next few months and in the rollout of new chips from competitors like Huawei, who got the better of that argument. China is reportedly discouraging firms from using Nvidia chips in the wake of the export tax deal, largely to encourage them to use domestic chips like Huawei, though they are clearly not banning the firms from using Nvidias if they prove necessary. It's also investigating whether the US is including spyware in them.

The bigger question this debate raises for me, and one I certainly can't answer adequately here, is: To what degree is “beating China” on AI important for making the future of AI go well?

The answer for most US policymakers, and most people I know in the AI safety world, has been “very.” The Financial Times reports that some Trump officials are considering resigning in protest over allowing China to get H20s. As Leopold Aschenbrenner, the AI analyst turned hedge funder, put it bluntly in his influential 2024 essay “Situational Awareness”: “Superintelligence will give those who wield it the power to crush opposition, dissent, and lock in their grand plan for humanity.” If China “wins,” then, the result for humanity is permanent authoritarian repression.

No doubt, the Beijing regime is brutal, and I have no faith that they will use AI wisely. I'm very confident they'll wield it to oppress Chinese citizens. But it feels as though “staying ahead of China” has become the sine qua non of US AI policy.

I worry less that this focus on China is directionally wrong and more that it is exaggerated. The bigger danger is that no one can control these systems, rather than that China can, and that the focus on staying ahead of China will cause the US to speed deployment of automated weapons systems that could prove deeply destabilizing and dangerous.

As with most aspects of AI, I feel like there's a small island of things we're all sure of and a vast ocean of unknowns. I think offering China H20s probably hurts AI safety a bit. I think.

A century-old optical illusion launched a space race.

The richest person in the world is obsessed with creating a city on Mars.

Elon Musk would like to see a million people living in a self-sufficient Martian settlement by 2050, both as a plan B for Earth and because it gives us something cool to get excited about.

Traveling to Mars has been a recurring theme of spacefaring fantasies for decades, from the German rocket innovator Wernher von Braun to science fiction writers Ray Bradbury and Kim Stanley Robinson. Human exploits on Mars have also been the subject of countless movies, TV shows, and comic books.

There are many good reasons to explore Mars. The discovery of water deep below the surface and ice at its poles suggests that the conditions to sustain life may have existed on the Red Planet, and perhaps still do. Studying Mars could teach us about how life emerged on Earth. While rovers have made great strides in uncovering the planet's secrets, human explorers could accelerate the pace of discovery.

Living on Mars would bring many challenges for humans, among them cosmic and solar radiation exposure, an asphyxiating atmosphere, lower-than-Earth gravity, extreme temperatures, toxic soil, and no ready supply of food, drinkable water, or breathable air.

But our cultural and scientific fascination with Mars lives on. And if Musk's SpaceX or a competitor lands humans on Mars in the coming years, it will be the realization of an ancient dream. To think that it all started with an optical illusion that tricked some astronomers into believing that Mars was riven with canals flanked with vegetation and carved by wise, peace-loving extraterrestrials.

Today, Explained co-host Sean Ramewaram spoke with David Baron, author of The Martians: The True Story of An Alien Craze that Captured Turn-of-the-Century America, about the belief in intelligent Martian life and the fixation on Mars that has gripped generations of scientists, science fiction writers, and tech billionaires.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Why do we all care about Mars?

As a culture, Mars has seeped into our collective psyche. There's this sense of mystery and romance. A little more than a century ago, the public believed that Mars was inhabited by intelligent beings. Before Martians were staples of science fiction, they were believed to be a scientific fact.

You could open the New York Times in 1906 and read in all seriousness about the civilization on Mars, what the Martians might be like, how we might communicate with them, and what we might learn from them. In 1907, the Wall Street Journal said the biggest news of the year was proof of intelligent life on Mars.

Where did the fact that there were Martians come from?

It all started in 1877. In the 19th century, all we knew about Mars was what we could see through earthbound telescopes. But in 1877, when Mars came especially close to Earth, an Italian astronomer named Giovanni Schiaparelli decided he was going to make a detailed map of Mars. And so, night after night, he studied the planet and saw what he thought were oceans and continents. But he also saw this network of thin, exceptionally straight lines that he imagined were waterways.

He called them “canali,” which in Italian means channels, but when it was translated into English, it was mistranslated as canals. And so, as soon as 1877, people were joking about these canals on Mars and wondering what they were, but people didn't think they were artificially constructed.

In 1894, Percival Lowell, an American astronomer, came along and said, yes, these were irrigation canals that Martians were using to survive on a planet that was running out of water. All of Mars's moisture was locked up in the polar ice caps at the north and south poles, and for the Martians to survive, they had created this global network of irrigation canals. That's what these lines supposedly were. They would come and go with the seasons. They tended to appear in the spring and summer, and they would fade in the fall and winter.

Lowell theorized that vegetation along the irrigation canals would appear in the spring and summer, and fade in the fall and winter when the leaves presumably died off.

This was also a time when people were looking for hope in outer space. In the late 19th century, at least in the West, there were a lot of reasons for despair. There was anarchism in Europe. There were heads of state being assassinated. President William McKinley was assassinated in the United States early in the 20th century. There was a feeling that society was running down. There were wars, including the Spanish-American War in the late 19th century.

The idea was that the Martians were these advanced beings who were what we hopefully would become in the future. The fact that they had this global network of irrigation canals meant that they had pulled together as a planet and evolved beyond war and divisive politics.

Because it looked like they were cooperating across a planet.

Exactly. So there was a real desire to believe in the Martians.

Was there anyone out there saying, “Guys, just because we see some canals, it doesn't mean there are Martians”?

Absolutely. In fact, the astronomical community divided into the canalists and the anti-canalists. Lowell was a self-made astronomer. He was an extraordinarily wealthy and articulate human being from a very prominent family in Massachusetts. And so he was able to write articles for the Atlantic Monthly promoting his ideas. He was out there giving lectures about the Martians. And so he was able to convince the public, even if there were a lot of astronomers he couldn't convince.

When was peak obsession with Mars in this era?

That was 1908 and 1909. By 1908, the idea was so widespread, you had pastors in church sermonizing about the Martians and expressing to their congregations that we should emulate the Martians and look to our neighboring planet for the kind of society that we should be.

Alexander Graham Bell, who of course invented the telephone, was convinced that the Martians were real. He saw no question that Mars was inhabited by intelligent beings.Nikola Tesla, a great inventor who came up with our modern system of generating and distributing electrical power, was convinced that he picked up radio signals from Mars. And when he announced that to the world at the beginning of 1901, it set off an absolute craze.

Martians invaded popular culture. They showed up on the vaudeville and Broadway stages. There was a popular show called “A Yankee Circus on Mars.” You had a Martian that became a comic character in the newspapers. They showed up in Tin Pan Alley songs. In fact, I have an original wax cylinder recording of a song called “A Signal From Mars” from back then. The Martians were just everywhere in popular culture.

How did it fall apart?

Astronomers by the 1910s had pretty well convinced themselves that this whole canal theory was bunk. But the idea had so taken hold in the brains of the public that the idea of canals on Mars persisted until the 1950s and 60s.

In 1938, there was the famous “War of the Worlds” radio broadcast by Orson Welles. And there were people who actually believed, listening to the radio, that the Martians were invading. I actually found a letter to Orson Welles that was written by one of those listeners who was fooled, who was angry about it. And what she wrote was, well, haven't astronomers found canals on Mars? Don't we know that there are Martians there?

The idea persisted well into the 1960s when NASA sent its first Mariner spacecraft flying by Mars to take the first close-up pictures of the surface. And there was not only no sign of a civilization, there was no sign of straight lines. It just looked like a dead world.

Thinking back to what you said earlier, when people were first enchanted by this idea of Martians in the early 20th century, it was this idea that we could all work together that really captured imaginations. And it's still a nice idea. Do you think there's still a chance that we could get together as a human race to unite in an effort to get to Mars? It doesn't look that likely.

I think what will inspire the United States to get to Mars more than anything is competition, because the Chinese want to get there. But there is still this dream of Mars as this techno-utopia that will be better than Earth, that will be more egalitarian, where we can start over again.

I think there are two lessons from the Mars craze. On the one hand, it's a cautionary tale. We tend to project onto Mars what we hope is there, not what's really there. A hundred years ago, we believed in Martians because we wanted to believe that there was a better world next door. Today, I think a lot of the talk about Mars is that we're going to create this utopia next door. That's going to be so difficult: technically difficult, and, as you said, getting humans together to make this possible, Lord knows if that's ever going to happen.

On the other hand, a lot of good came out of that craziness of a hundred years ago. It was the excitement about Mars and the imagination that spurred the next generations to say, well, maybe we can actually go there, and how would we do it? And they built the rockets, and they had the enthusiasm. And I think the same is true today. And if we're going to get there, we might as well start now.

The original Sex and the City ended with a fairytale happily ever after. It was never quite right.

And just like that, Carrie Bradshaw is single again.

For the last three seasons, fans have watched TV's greatest anti-heroine begin an entire new set of adventures. After HBO original Sex and the City ended in 2004 (followed by the fun 2008 film of the same name and its not-so-fun 2010 sequel), And Just Like That picked up in 2021 with Carrie's happily ever after. The most fabulous woman in Manhattan seemed to have everything she's ever wanted: a loving marriage to her Mr. Big (Chris Noth), a condo on Fifth Avenue, financial security beyond her wildest dreams, and a truly gigantic closet.

But no one is immune to late life's indignities, apparently not even Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker).

In the show's often-clunky style, Carrie faced a series of dismal realities. She became a widow; she hosted a podcast; she left behind her beloved apartment for a beautiful but strangely empty Gramercy Park brownstone. She wasted a bunch of her (and the audience's) time on an ill-fated attempt at rekindling her romance with the country Lurch known as Aidan Shaw (John Corbett). Money remained a non-issue for Carrie, but the show often reminded us that not even immense amounts of wealth could insulate you from life's dishonors.

In the series finale — which showrunner Michael Patrick King abruptly announced at the beginning of August — Carrie finds herself at a place not unlike when we first met her in that pilot episode years ago: single, in heels, living in Manhattan, bolstered by her friends, but wondering if there's love left in the Greatest City on Earth.

It's not the fairytale ending. But Carrie's story ending by herself feels true. Truer, even.

The original show wrapped with true love for all of its heroines, but something felt off. The real point of Sex and the City was always Carrie's relationships with Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Charlotte (Kristin Davis), and Samantha (the now-absent Kim Cattrall).

While And Just Like That has been criticized for its tone and poor writing (one secondary character was seemingly killed off twice), it managed to give Carrie Bradshaw an ending that captured the daring admission of the original: that being lucky in love is good, but being lucky in friendship is everything.

From urinating on themselves, to getting roasted on stage by their nonbinary comedian ex, to dying on a Peloton, the characters of And Just Like That seemingly exist only to be humiliated.

In King's world, life after 40 is nothing but a gauntlet of perverse embarrassments.

The continued indignities of aging — so imaginatively bleak that death starts to seem like a sweet release — have turned And Just Like That into a show that people resent, criticize, and demand 17 more seasons of. One cannot fathom the horrors Carrie, Charlotte, and Miranda will face each week, usually centered on their bodies betraying them or being left behind by a world that deems them too old. Each new mortification feels shocking, sacrilegious to the show's glamorous predecessor. At the same time, there's kind of a perverse glee in watching how deranged it all can get.

What do you mean Carrie had hip replacement surgery and, in a temporary state of medicated paralysis, was left to listen helplessly as her coworker passionately throttled Miranda's lower half like a rotary phone in the other room? Charlotte battling a bout of vertigo and falling into an art installation with fake ejaculate cannot be real, can it? Miranda had sex with a virgin nun played by Rosie O'Donnell? What is a person supposed to say to that… okay???

Unfortunately for Carrie, she endures one final degradation in the series finale: Miranda's Thanksgiving. In the world of AJLT, a beloved American holiday about remembering the things we're grateful for unfurls into a nightmare.

Everyone but Carrie has bailed on Miranda's get-together, staying with their own husbands and families. Since Carrie possesses neither, she has to witness a trainwreck that includes raw turkey, a clogged toilet and brown fecal water, an Italian greyhound emergency at the vet, the future mother of Miranda's grandchild and her obnoxious friends, and a failed, surprise set-up attempt.

There's a heavy-handed point to all this misery.

This gathering is a crystallization of Carrie's future. In this era of her life, Carrie Bradshaw is single, and if she doesn't want to spend Thanksgiving alone, she might have to endure a few lousy ones at the hands of her friends. It all comes around to the bigger question: What if Carrie's future does not include one more love? Is that okay?

“I have to quit thinking maybe a man, and start accepting maybe just me,” she tells Charlotte. “And it's not a tragedy.”

Having survived a holiday radiating such dark, melancholic energy, Carrie taps out. Going home alone isn't such a hardship, though. She returns to her gorgeous mansion to eat pie in heels. For her, it's heaven. After all, this is the woman who professed to find true joy in tearing open a sleeve of saltines and smearing a sliver of grape jelly on each one, while reading an entire issue of Vogue standing up.

What Carrie has is actually the furthest thing from tragic, rather, something much more thrilling — something that the original show should have considered.

The most frustrating thing about Sex and the City is how its ending betrayed the show's heart and soul.

For six seasons, the show touted the revolutionary concept that its heroines — Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha — just needed each other. SATC was unafraid to imagine that female friendship could be more powerful, more enduring, and more satisfying than romantic love.

“Don't laugh at me,” Charlotte tells her best friends in season four. “But maybe we can be each other's soulmates.”

The idea of soulmates has largely been framed as romantic good fortune, the notion that the universe has picked out lives meant to be lived together, if only these hopeful lovers can find one another. SATC offered a more optimistic reimagining, a theory that our best friends are the true matches we should be so lucky to find in this world.

Despite the show's title, sex and love were never really part of the show's fairytale. Men were often terrible, rarely lasting more than an episode. Sex was rarely sexy, more often skewered than celebrated.

It's sort of a shame then, at the end of the series, that these four soulmates all end up married to or are exclusively committed to men nowhere near as magical as they are.

Miranda marries Steve (David Eigenberg), and opens up their home to his mother. Charlotte converts to Judaism, marries Harry (Evan Handler), and they adopt a baby from China. Samantha beats cancer and asks for a monogamous relationship with Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis). Carrie leaves her callous Russian boyfriend (Mikhail Baryshnikov) for Big, and returns to New York with the man she's been chasing all these years.

We're meant to see these as happy, fulfilled endings — even though our main characters were all essentially separated from one another. The relationships they nurtured through some of their worst moments — Carrie's heartbreaks, Miranda's mother dying, Samantha's cancer, Charlotte's divorce — were pushed aside to accommodate men. The show told us over and over that these friends could have a fulfilled life with just each other, but it didn't seem to truly believe its own revolutionary message.

As clumsy as AJLT was at times, it had a better sense of what the original show meant.

Carrie finally stumbled upon the realization that her life never needed marriage, romantic love, or maybe even sex, to be fabulously beautiful. Surely, these things don't hurt, but they were never the heart of the matter.

Decades later, but never too late, Carrie finally got the ending she and her friends told us to believe in.

The racist history that explains Trump's federal takeover of DC police.

Just a few years ago, the movement for Washington, DC, statehood was gaining steam. In 2020 and 2021, Democrats in the House passed bills to make DC the 51st state, re-energizing the fight to grant residents of the nation's capital representation in Congress.

Those bills were ultimately doomed because of strong Republican opposition. But now, statehood for Washington, DC, seems even more far-fetched. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump took the extraordinary step of ordering a federal takeover of DC's local police department. He also mobilized the DC National Guard, deploying troops in the city to allegedly fight crime.

This didn't necessarily come as a surprise. For some time, Trump has fantasized about taking over DC altogether, saying that the federal government would do a much better job running the city than its current mayor, Muriel Bowser.

So, how did DC go from building a growing movement for statehood to a hostile federal takeover in just a few short years?

The simple answer is that Republicans are now in power, and they'd like to make an example out of DC. But even without Republican control of the White House or Congress, statehood and full self-governance have always been an uphill battle, because there's also a deeper history of the federal government's paternalistic relationship with the nation's capital.

Washington, DC, was specifically established to serve as the nation's capital. The US Constitution gave Congress the power to create a small federal district that doesn't exceed 10 square miles to serve as the seat of the federal government. In 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which paved the way to build a new capital along the Potomac River. And so, DC was established by carving out land from Maryland and Virginia (which later took its portion back) and was under Congress's jurisdiction. That meant there would be no democratically elected mayor or local government.

But DC grew into a full city, with residents living there on a permanent basis — not just to serve the federal government. And, for most of the city's history, those residents were entirely disenfranchised — unable to get representation in Congress or even vote for president. That changed during the civil rights era, when DC's voting rights (or lack thereof) garnered more attention, in no small part because of the city's large Black population, which, by 1960, had become the majority. As a result, the constitution was officially amended in 1961 to grant DC residents the right to vote for president, but the amendment stopped short of granting them representation in Congress.

Even then, DC didn't have a democratically elected local government. So, in 1974, Congress passed the DC Home Rule Act, which allowed residents to elect their own mayor and council. That finally gave the nation's capital some form of self-governance, but Congress ultimately retained its power to overrule local laws and budgets if it so pleased.

The federal government's resistance to giving DC autonomy is ultimately rooted in racism. Known as Chocolate City, DC was the epicenter of Black arts, culture, and politics. And since it gained the right to vote for local officials, DC has only ever elected Black mayors. As a result, opposition to DC statehood has often leaned on the paternalistic and racist notion that Black people can't be trusted to govern themselves — that the city's residents simply don't know what's best for them. That's why conservative lawmakers have pointed to issues like crime or corruption as evidence that DC can't be trusted to be a state.

In 2021, for example, Steve Scalise, the Republican House majority leader, wrote, “Why should the District of Columbia be granted statehood when it can't even perform basic governmental duties like protecting its residents from criminals?” Scalise also said that the city was simply too corrupt to be a state. These kinds of arguments have been repeated by people on the right for decades, despite the fact that states, including Scalise's own Louisiana, are well-known for their corruption and crime. So even if those issues were a legitimate concern (they shouldn't be), then why should the residents of DC be treated any differently than other Americans?

Part of the reason in recent years has less to do with explicit racism and more to do with partisan politics. If DC were to get full representation in Congress, it would undoubtedly benefit Democrats, since the city is overwhelmingly Democratic. (Trump, for example, only got 6.5 percent of the vote in DC in 2024.) That explains why Democrats are on board with DC statehood while Republicans are fiercely opposed.

But this is the natural extension of the overt racism that has long defined opposition for DC self-governance. Before the Home Rule Act, President Lyndon B. Johnson reorganized how the district was governed and appointed Walter Washington to serve as the mayor-commissioner of DC. When Washington, who was Black, submitted his first budget to Congress, the response was astonishingly racist; John McMillan, a Democrat from South Carolina who chaired the House Committee on the District of Columbia, sent Washington a truckload of watermelons.

Now, Republicans might not play the same tactics, but the degree to which they ignore Black Washingtonians and their rights is unmistakable. “Yes, Wyoming is smaller than Washington by population, but it has three times as many workers in mining, logging, and construction, and ten times as many workers in manufacturing,” Tom Cotton, the Republican senator from Arkansas, said in 2021 in a speech opposing DC statehood. “In other words, Wyoming is a well-rounded working-class state.”

But, as I noted then, roughly 140,000 people in DC's labor force were considered working class in 2016, according to the Center for American Progress, while about 220,000 workers in Wyoming were considered working class. The most notable difference in those two populations is that the vast majority of DC's working class was made up of people of color, while 84 percent of Wyoming's working class was white.

Federal intervention in DC's affairs has often poorly served residents, and not just because they have, through the years, been denied voting rights, self-governance, and representation in Congress. Congress's meddling in local laws has ultimately served the interests of lawmakers from other states and not the interests of the people living in the city.

One of the most notable examples of this was during the AIDS epidemic. In the 1990s, DC spent money on needle exchange programs, which research has shown is critical in preventing the spread of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS. But, Congress banned the city from using its own funds on needle exchange programs — a ban that lasted nine years. During that time, the city saw a surge in infections and had the highest rate of HIV per capita in the country, even exceeding rates in developing countries. And, because DC was a majority Black city, the policy disproportionately affected Black people.

Trump's plan to federalize the local police force follows those exact footsteps — placing his own interests above those of DC residents and their elected officials. The move is a blatantly political one. Trump is using DC as a warning to other cities: If you pass progressive criminal justice laws, then he will try his best to intervene.

It's a paternalistic instinct, one that is anti-democratic at its core, taking local control away from the hands of voters. And what's unfortunate for DC is that Trump's move is not entirely unprecedented. It falls in line with how the federal government has long viewed DC's self-governance: at best an inconvenience, and at worst, a threat.

﻿Right now, he's doing authoritarianism badly. But it could still work in the long run.

Depending on who you listen to, President Donald Trump's decision to seize control over law enforcement in Washington, DC, is either an authoritarian menace or a farce.

The authoritarian menace case is straightforward: Trump is (again) asserting the power to deploy the National Guard to a major US city, while adding the new wrinkle of federalizing the local police force based on a wholly made-up emergency. He is, political scientist Barbara Walter warns, “building the machinery of repression before it's needed,” getting the tools to violently shut down big protests “in place before the next election.”

The farce case focuses less on these broad fears and more on the actual way it has played out. Instead of nabbing DC residents who oppose the president, federal agents appear to be aimlessly strolling the streets in safe touristy areas like Georgetown or the National Mall. During a pointless Sunday night deployment to the U Street corridor, a popular nightlife area, they faced down the terrifying threat of a drunk man throwing a sandwich.

“This ostensible show of strength is more like an admission of weakness,” The Atlantic's Quinta Jurecic writes. “It is the behavior of a bully: very bad for the people it touches, but not a likely prelude to full authoritarian takeover.”

So who's right? In a sense, both of them. Trump's show of force in DC is both cartoonish and ominous, farcical and dangerous.

It serves to normalize abuses of power that could very well be expanded — in fact, that Trump himself is openly promising to try it out in other cities. However, both the DC deployment and Trump's prior National Guard misadventure in Los Angeles show that it's actually quite hard to create effective tools of domestic repression. Executing on his threats requires a level of legal and tactical acumen that it's not obvious the Trump administration possesses.

Or, put differently: The power they're claiming is scary in the abstract, but the way they're currently wielding it is too incompetent to do meaningful damage to democracy. The key question going forward — not just for DC, but the nation — is whether they get better with practice.

Carl Schmitt, a reactionary German legal theorist who would later become a Nazi jurist, famously claimed that emergency powers create an insuperable problem for the liberal-democratic ideal of the rule of law. In theory, the law can limit how and when a person in government can wield emergency powers. But in practice, it all comes down to who has the power to give those words meaning.

Who says what an emergency is, and when it ends? That person, and not the legal text or its underlying intent, is what determines what the law means — and thus has the real power.

Schmitt expressed this idea in a famous dictum: “Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.” And while Trump has surely never heard of Schmitt, let alone read him, this is basically the way his administration has operated. On issues ranging from trade to federalizing DC law enforcement, Trump has decided that ordinary problems — job losses from trade, crime — are emergencies that justify him invoking powers designed for times of war, natural disaster, or rebellion. And so far, he's mostly gotten away with it.

His federalization of DC will test the limits of Trump's Schmittian approach. By law, Trump's emergency power only allows him to federalize control over city police — the Metropolitan Police Department, or MPD — for 30 days. And federal agents, be they National Guard or the DEA or Homeland Security, have circumscribed legal responsibilities and personnel limitations that prevent them from fully replacing MPD as ultimate authority in the capital city.

This is the first thing to watch in DC: Will Trump go full Schmitt, and simply declare that these constraints on his power are moot? And if so, who — if anyone — will try and stop him?

It's important to emphasize that we don't know the answers to these questions. While Trump has claimed the power to maintain federal control over MPD beyond the 30-day limit, Trump is constantly claiming all sorts of things that aren't true. It is entirely possible that, next month, MPD reverts to local control with basically no long-term ill effects.

But even if Trump does defy a court order to release the MPD back to DC, or otherwise maintain some kind of long-term federal presence on the streets of DC, there's a question of what exactly he is accomplishing.

Here, we have to separate damage to democracy from other concrete harms. Trump's crackdown may already be producing unjust arrests of many unhoused people in DC. That is bad and worthy of condemnation.

Such arrests do not, however, help Trump consolidate the kind of controls a would-be dictator wants from law enforcement: the ability to suppress critical speech and opposition political activity through force of arms. The mere fact that federal troops are on the street, or that MPD is technically under federal control, does not mean that they're arresting Democrats or raiding the Washington Post or opening fire on protesters.

Of course, the fact that something isn't yet happening doesn't mean it won't. But the current deployments, for all their fascist aesthetics, are quite far from that — in fact, they appear to be doing a lot of impotent, haphazard traffic stops. In the U Street area, home to mixed populations of longtime residents and more recent gentrifiers, locals have confronted the cops and jeered at them — with no reports of serious retaliatory injury. Trump is doing something that has an authoritarian intent and appearance that galvanizes resistance, without any kind of plan for turning it into an effective repressive tool.

One could tell a similar story about the National Guard deployment to LA. Back then, Trump sent in the troops with a big show, claiming they were necessary to get (overhyped) riots under control. In reality, they showed up and went on a few drug and immigration raids, and then almost all of them quietly slinked off without scaring the LA population into political submission. Courts are currently hearing arguments on the deployment's legality.

None of this is to say that Trump's deployments are harmless. As Walter points out, he is creating legal and political precedents that could — at least in theory — be used toward repressive ends if they so desire. If Trump does something to mess with the fairness of the midterm elections, and large cities erupt with protest, he's already somewhat normalized a militarized response.

From a health-of-democracy standpoint, then, what's worrying about recent events in DC is not the developments on the ground. It's the precedent they set — the powers that Trump is claiming that could be all too easily abused. The question is whether such abuse will occur.

So far, there is very little evidence that the Trump administration has anything like a systematic plan for suborning American democracy. He isn't doing what someone like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán did in 2010 — come in with a blueprint for destroying the political opposition and executing on it as efficiently as possible.

Rather, he's simply asserting powers whenever it's convenient to do what he wants to do at the moment. Can't get Congress to raise tariffs? Use emergency powers to impose them. Want to impose an unconstitutional export tax on Nvidia? Just make an extortionate “deal” with its CEO. Want to stop seeing images of protesters with Mexican flags in LA? Send in the National Guard.

To be clear: This ad hoc authoritarianism is still dangerous. It's just comparatively less effective than its deliberate cousin. Trump hasn't silenced the Democratic opposition or the American press or shuttered civil rights groups. He's taken steps in all of those directions, but they fit the ad hoc pattern: each troubling, but not (yet!) systematic or successful enough to fundamentally compromise the fairness of elections or Americans' rights to dissent and free speech.

Where we're at, in short, is a place where the building blocks for constructing an authoritarian state are all in a row. The question is whether Trump has the will and the vision to put them together in a way that could durably compromise the viability of American democracy.

This context helps us understand why the DC deployment is both absurd and dangerous.

It is absurd in the sense that it does nothing, on its own, to advance an authoritarian agenda — and, if anything, compromises it by creating images of uniformed thugs on American streets that galvanize his opponents. It is dangerous in that it could normalize abuses of power that, down the line, could be wielded as part of an actually serious campaign of repression.

And at this point, I don't know which scenario is more likely: that Trump's ad hoc efforts to seize control founder and ultimately amount to little, or that he follows his Schmittian logic to its dictatorial terminus.

Don't expect the courts to keep ICE under control.

Last month, a federal judge in Los Angeles handed down a temporary order placing some restrictions on the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in that city. The Trump administration now wants the Supreme Court to lift those restrictions.

The contested provisions of Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong's order are fairly narrow. They provide that federal law enforcement may not rely “solely” on four factors when determining to stop or detain someone suspected of being an undocumented immigrant. Under Frimpong's order, the government may not stop or detain someone solely because of 1) their “apparent race or ethnicity,” 2) the fact that they either speak Spanish or speak English with an accent, 3) their presence at a location such as an agricultural workplace or day laborer pick-up site, or 4) the type of work that they do.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Frimpong's order prohibits the government from relying exclusively on any one of these factors or on any combination of them, so it could not detain someone solely because they speak Spanish and they are a day laborer, for example. The government may still rely on these four factors to determine whom to stop or detain, however, so long as it has other reasons for targeting a particular individual.

Thus, for example, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could target someone because that person speaks Spanish, and they work as a day laborer, and they were witnessed getting into a truck owned by a company known for hiring undocumented immigrants, because one of the three factors that ICE considered in this hypothetical stop is not on Frimpong's list.

That said, at least according to the Cato Institute's David Bier, Frimpong's order has drastically reduced the number of immigration arrests within Los Angeles.

The central issue in this case, known as Noem v. Perdomo, is what courts are practically able to do in order to rein in overzealous tactics by law enforcement. Judge Frimpong's order is modest — again, it does not prevent the Trump administration from targeting anyone, just as long as part of the reason why a particular individual is targeted doesn't appear on Frimpong's list of four — but it is also unlikely to survive contact with a Republican Supreme Court that is extraordinarily solicitous toward Donald Trump.

Indeed, the Court has long cautioned lower court judges against issuing broad orders imposing across-the-board restrictions on law enforcement. One of the seminal cases that the Trump administration relied upon in its Perdomo brief was handed down in 1983, well before the Court's recent partisan turn.

The Republican justices, in other words, likely will not even need to stretch the law very far if they want to rule in Trump's favor in Perdomo.

The Perdomo case arises out of multiple immigration raids in Los Angeles, which have often taken place at job sites and other locations where the Trump administration believes that undocumented immigrants are often present. As Frimpong found, “car wash workers, farm and agricultural workers, street vendors, recycling center workers, tow yard workers, and packing house workers were targeted.” One early operation “detained multiple day laborers outside of the Westlake Home Depot.”

At least some of these operations appear to violate the Constitution. In some instances, law enforcement appears to have targeted people because of their race. Frimpong, for example, pointed to an incident where “agents approached and prevented a nonwhite individual from walking away but not those who appeared to be Caucasians.” A Latino car wash worker targeted by one of the raids testified that the federal agents who arrested him ignored two of his light-skinned coworkers, one of whom is Russian and another who is Persian.

In other cases, federal agents appear to have targeted individuals despite having no reasonable grounds to believe they are undocumented. Plaintiff Jason Brian Gavidia, for example, is an American who was born in Los Angeles. According to an appeals court that upheld nearly all of Frimpong's order, agents “forcefully pushed [Gavidia] up against the metal gated fence, put [his] hands behind [his] back, and twisted [his] arm” after he was unable to identify which hospital he was born in.

The agents eventually released Gavidia after he produced a Real ID card, a document that is only issued to people who are legally present in the United States, but they took his ID.

It is likely, in other words, that at least some of the people targeted by these Los Angeles raids could individually challenge their arrests or detention in court. But the ability to bring such individual challenges often isn't worth very much.

For starters, the Republican justices' decisions in Hernández v. Mesa (2020) and Egbert v. Boule (2022) likely make it impossible to collect money damages from an ICE agent who violates your constitutional rights. In Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents (1971), the Supreme Court held that federal law enforcement officers who violate someone's constitutional rights may be personally liable for that violation. But Hernández and Egbert read that decision so narrowly that such suits rarely, if ever, move forward.

So, even if someone like Gavidia brings a successful lawsuit, he probably wouldn't win anything more than the right to get his ID back.

Someone who is unlawfully detained could potentially obtain a court order demanding their release. But many people targeted by law enforcement lack access to legal counsel or cannot afford to hire a lawyer even if they can find one who will take their case. While indigent criminal defendants have a right to a government-paid lawyer, defendants in immigration proceedings typically do not. And even when immigration defendants do prevail, an occasional court decision declaring some long-past arrest illegal is unlikely to deter future illegal arrests.

Yet, the Supreme Court has long discouraged federal judges from issuing injunctions that forbid law enforcement from acting illegally in the future. The key case is City of Los Angeles v. Lyons (1983), which held that Adolph Lyons, a man who was allegedly choked out by police officers without provocation, could not obtain a court order forbidding LA's police from using such chokeholds in the future.

“Past exposure to illegal conduct,” Justice Byron White wrote for the Court in Lyons, does not permit someone to seek an injunction. Rather, “Lyons' standing to seek the injunction requested depended on whether he was likely to suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds by police officers.”

Indeed, White's decision placed nearly impossible barriers before most plaintiffs seeking court orders requiring police to modify their behavior. To obtain such an injunction, White wrote, Lyons “would have had not only to allege that he would have another encounter with the police, but also to make the incredible assertion either (1) that all police officers in Los Angeles always choke any citizen with whom they happen to have an encounter, whether for the purpose of arrest, issuing a citation, or for questioning, or (2) that the City ordered or authorized police officers to act in such manner.”

At least some of the plaintiffs in Perdomo present an unusually strong case that they are likely to be caught up in an immigration raid again in the future. According to the appeals court which heard this case, “at least one individual with lawful status was stopped twice by roving patrols in just 10 days.” So a court could quite reasonably conclude that this individual is “likely to suffer” the “future injury” that Lyons demands.

But Lyons also places such a high bar in front of plaintiffs seeking an injunction against law enforcement that it would not be difficult for the Republican justices to write an opinion relying on Lyons to toss out Judge Frimpong's order, assuming that they even bother to explain their decision in the first place — something that the Court's Republican majority often refuses to do.

In addition to arguing that Lyons requires the Supreme Court to block Frimpong's decision, Trump's lawyers also point to the Court's recent decision in Trump v. CASA (2025), which held that federal courts typically should not issue injunctions that extend beyond the individual parties to a lawsuit. So, even if the one plaintiff who was stopped twice may obtain an injunction, that court order might have to be so narrow that it protects him and him alone against future illegal stops.

Trump's CASA argument is hardly airtight. Though CASA did hold that broad injunctions are generally discouraged, it did permit them when necessary to give a victorious plaintiff “complete relief.” Frimpong argued that a broad injunction is warranted in Perdomo, because law enforcement officers cannot reasonably be expected to know which suspects are protected by a court order.

“It would be a fantasy to expect that law enforcement could and would inquire whether a given individual was among the [plaintiffs] before proceeding with a seizure,” she wrote. The only way to stop ICE from targeting the Perdomo plaintiffs is to issue a court order that protects everyone in Los Angeles.

Will that argument persuade a majority of the justices? The honest answer is, “Who knows?” CASA is a brand new decision, handed down less than two months ago, and the Court has yet to apply its new rule to the facts of any specific case — including the CASA case itself.

And the fact remains that it is exceedingly difficult to obtain any injunction against law enforcement, much less the broadly applicable one handed down by Judge Frimpong. The Supreme Court has generally preferred for judges to adjudicate alleged legal violations by law enforcement one at a time, rather than issuing wholesale injunctions halting an illegal practice — even though individual decisions often do little to stop these practices.

In fairness, there are some good reasons to prefer individual lawsuits over wholesale court orders. Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases typically turn on the very specific facts of a particular case. Police might reasonably suspect, for example, that a person spotted with a large wad of cash in a neighborhood where illegal drugs are often sold is engaged in illegal activity. By contrast, police may not have reasonable grounds to suspect a similar person spotted walking near a business where people often make down payments on their new homes.

As a general rule, the Fourth Amendment permits police to briefly stop and search someone if they reasonably suspect that person is engaged in illegal activity — or, in an immigration case, of being illegally present in the United States.

To be sure, there are some things that law enforcement may almost never consider when determining whether to stop a particular individual. In Kansas v. Glover (2020), for example, the Court said that police may not target someone based on “nothing more than a demographic profile” or stop and question someone about their immigration status because of their “Mexican ancestry.”

Frimpong's conclusion that ICE may not target someone solely because of their “apparent race or ethnicity” is consistent with Glover.

But Frimpong's conclusion that law enforcement may never reasonably suspect someone of being undocumented solely based on their presence in a particular location is probably a bit of a stretch. As a federal appeals court explained in a 2014 case, day laborer jobs are “one of the limited options for workers without documents.” These jobs are often grueling, unreliable, and underpaid. They are unattractive to virtually anyone who is authorized to work in the United States and, thus, have less-demanding and better-paying job options available to them.

There are at least some cases, in other words, where a law enforcement officer could reasonably suspect someone of being undocumented if they are consistently seen at a location where undocumented workers seek jobs as day laborers — what Frimpong described as a “day laborer pick up site.”

It is difficult to come up with categorical rules governing which factors law enforcement may consider when deciding whom to stop. Even race may be an acceptable factor in very limited circumstances; if multiple witnesses to a robbery tell police that they saw an East Asian man commit the crime, for example, then police could reasonably limit their search to people who appear to be East Asian. This is one reason why cases like Lyons exist: to prevent judges from handing down categorical rules that prevent police from conducting lawful investigations.

The current Supreme Court is far too sycophantic towards Donald Trump, but that does not change the fact that courts are poorly situated to deal with a rogue executive. The executive branch can move quickly, potentially committing thousands of constitutional violations before judges even begin to figure out what happened in those cases. Similarly, practical limits on judicial power can tie judges' hands when they are confronted with rogue law enforcement agencies.

Opendoor's CEO is out — and the stock is soaring.

Carrie Wheeler, the chief executive of Opendoor Technologies, announced on Friday that she's stepping down.

""The last weeks of intense outside interest in Opendoor have come at a time when the company needs to stay focused and charging ahead,"" Wheeler said in a post on X. ""I believe the best thing I can do for Opendoor now is to accelerate my succession plans.""

Opendoor shares spiked, with the stock up as much as 13% on Friday.

Today, I am stepping down as CEO of Opendoor.When the Board of Directors asked me to take on this role at the end of 2022, the company was in crisis. The real estate market was punishing, the business needed a reset, and the path forward was uncertain. My mandate was clear:…

Wheeler's departure comes amid Opendoor's meme stock rally that has sent the residential real estate company's share price up nearly 215% in the past month. The stock is up 104% so far this year.

Hedge fund manager Eric Jackson first drove the rally in July, when he posted that he believed OpenDoor ""could be a 100-bagger over the next few years.""

Jackson told Business Insider last month that he doesn't consider Opendoor a meme stock and that he's in it for the long term.

(Regarding Wheeler's departure, Jackson wrote on X that he ""was on a livestream when she quit lol."")

Retail investors have flocked to OpenDoor's stock, whipped up by Jackson's bullishness and increasingly activist stance. The enthusiasm led investor and tech entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano to post that he, too, had purchased shares in the company this week.

A sharp uptick ensued, with the stock rising 26% in Wednesday's session.

Wheeler joined Opendoor as CEO in 2022 and helped turn the company around.

""We went from $1 billion in losses when I took over, to announcing our first quarter of positive EBITDA in three years this past quarter,"" she said in her social media post announcing her departure.

Jackson has criticized Wheeler's leadership.

""You've got a CEO who never does interviews, sells stock constantly, and never buys,"" he said in an interview earlier this month, adding that he'd be open to joining Opendoor's board.

Opendoor is an institutional homebuyer, or iBuyer. It purchases homes in cash, makes the needed repairs, and resells them. After going public in 2020 via a SPAC, the company struggled, eventually falling more than 90% from its peak before Jackson rallied public support.

The days of landlords knocking on doors for monthly rent checks, or tenants going after landlords to fix a leaky toilet are slowly coming to an end. Technology has been stepping in to address the needs of tenants, landlords and large multifamily operators, and now artificial intelligence is turning that slow progress into a rental revolution.

Work orders, lease renewals, tours and even investor due diligence are being taken over by software and AI. As with the start of any technology, it has been largely fragmented among a multitude of vendors. The integration of all that technology is a huge opportunity for startups and the venture capitalists backing them.

One of the more mature categories for AI in the apartment space is virtual agents talking to prospective residents. This is where agentic AI comes in — meaning AI that can act autonomously and make its own decisions depending on what the consumer asks. There are still, however, just a handful of companies using that advanced level of machine learning.

AI is also proving useful on the investment side of the multifamily business, specifically underwriting and acquisitions. For example, investors looking to purchase a large property have to go through all the leases and load those into a rent roll.

""If you're buying a property that hasn't been professionally managed, where those aren't all loaded into some market-leading software product, somebody may have to manually go through all those leases and capture all the information. Well, AI is great for that, right?"" said John Helm, founder and partner at RET Ventures, a fund focusing on AI in both real estate and rent tech.

CNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.

Instead, according to Helm, you can feed leases into an AI model, and it will spit out a summary of all the data the investor needs. They can then load that directly into an underwriting model and value the property.

RET Ventures said it doesn't rely on endowments or pension funds for its capital, but instead the consumers of the products of the companies they invest in — so-called strategic limited partners.

""We have 60 multifamily operators that have about over 3 million units in our fund,"" he said.

AI can also help with property development and accounts payable. Multifamily developers will often have multiple vendors, from landscaping to plumbing to heating. Many still use paper invoices.

One of RET's portfolio companies is PredictAP. It takes all those invoices, reads them and then repopulates all the necessary data into the company's payables system to make the process and payments more efficient. None of it needs to be manually coded by a human. 

Tyler Christiansen likens the multifamily industry to car dealerships. Every renter interaction was siloed to an individual property. As CEO of Funnel, which is backed by RET Ventures, his aim is to streamline the apartment marketing and leasing process, ""enabling multifamily professionals to generate more profits, efficiency, and insight across their portfolios,"" according to the company website.

Funnel works with large apartment real estate investment trusts such as Camden Property Trust, MAA and Essex Property Trust, as well as Cortland, which owns 90,000 apartments. Christiansen said that rather than the renter's relationship being with the community, the renter's relationship is really with the brand. He calls that ""centralization"" in the industry.

""And then AI, what makes it unique within Funnel is that rather than automating interactions simply at a community level, we're really opening up automations across the portfolio,"" said Christiansen.

One example would be if a tenant is not renewing a lease at one community because they are moving to a different market, Funnel's AI system would open up the possibility of cross-selling that person into another client community.

Despite the progress, the technology is still in its infancy, and it's expensive. Apartment operators and investors are in the experimental phase. It remains to be seen how much they will invest.

Plus, the multifamily industry is highly fragmented. There are close to 50 million rental units in the U.S., the majority owned by small, often mom-and-pop landlords. The largest apartment REITs own roughly between 50,000 and 100,000 units each, with a few larger private operators, like Blackstone and Greystar.

""I guess the challenge is going to be, probably in the next several years, really sifting through everything and understanding where there are real businesses that could grow into this. You're still seeing a lot of these tools just starting to get deployed,"" said Helm.

Erin strengthened into a hurricane on Friday as it approached the northeast Caribbean, prompting forecasters to warn of possible flooding and landslides.

The storm is expected to remain over open waters, although tropical storm watches were issued for Anguilla and Barbuda, St. Martin and St. Barts, Saba, St. Eustatius and St. Maarten.

Heavy rains were forecast to start late Friday in Antigua and Barbuda, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and southern and eastern Puerto Rico. Up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) are expected, with isolated totals of up to 6 inches (15 centimeters), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

Forecasters also warned of dangerous swells.

The storm was located about 460 miles (740 kilometers) east of the Northern Leeward Islands. It had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 18 mph (30 kph).

Hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry said Erin is forecast to eventually take a sharp turn northeast that would put it on a path between the U.S. and Bermuda.

""The forecasts for next week still keep the future hurricane safely east of the mainland U.S.,"" he said.

Erin, which is the Atlantic season's first hurricane, is forecast to become a major Category 3 storm late this weekend.

The hurricane center noted ""there is still uncertainty about what impacts Erin may bring to portions of the Bahamas, the east coast of the United States, and Bermuda in the long range.""

Dangerous surf and rip currents are expected to affect the U.S. East Coast next week, with waves reaching up to 15 feet (5 meters) along parts of the North Carolina coast that could cause beach erosion, according to Accuweather.

""Erin is forecast to explode into a powerful Category 4 hurricane as it moves across very warm waters in the open Atlantic. Water temperatures at the surface and hundreds of feet deep are several degrees higher than the historical average,"" said Alex DaSilva, Accuweather's lead hurricane expert.

Erin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

This year's season is once again expected to be unusually busy. The forecast calls for six to 10 hurricanes, with three to five reaching major status with winds of more than 110 mph (177 kph).

In this article

A government intervention in struggling chipmaker Intel is ""essential"" for the sake of national security, analyst Gil Luria said Friday, following a report that the Trump administration is weighing taking a stake in the company.

""We're all capitalists,"" Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, said in an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""We don't want government to intervene and own private enterprise, but this is national security.""

Bloomberg reported Thursday that the Trump administration is considering having the U.S. government take a stake in Intel. 

The news sent Intel shares higher, and the stock climbed more than 4% Friday. Shares are on track for the best week in more than 25 years.

Intel previously declined to comment on the report.

Luria said such a deal is needed to revive Intel and reduce the country's reliance on companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor to manufacture chips. President Donald Trump has called for more chips and high-end technology to be made in the U.S.

How the White House could structure such an intervention is still in question. Bloomberg reported Friday that the administration has discussed using funds from the CHIPS Act.

Intel received $7.9 billion from the Department of Commerce through the CHIPS Act, and it was awarded roughly $3 billion under the CHIPS Act for the Pentagon's Secure Enclave program.

""Intel has had many opportunities over decades to get it right, and it hasn't. So we need to intervene,"" Luria said. ""The government's going to come in and it's going to give Intel unfair advantages, and if it's going to do that, it wants a piece of the business.""

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan met with Trump at the White House on Monday after the president called for his resignation based on allegations that he has ties to China.

Luria pointed to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's comments that the rise of superintelligent AI could be ""the next wave of nuclear proliferation,"" as evidence that direct intervention by the government is needed.

""We can't rely on somebody else making shell casings for our nuclear arsenal,"" Luria said. ""We have to get it right.""

Don't mix business with pleasure — or the music of the spheres might eject you from the skies even if you are an astronomer — but it seems, in the current milieu, there are no such restrictions between business and politics.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is eyeing a stake in struggling chipmaker Intel, according to a Bloomberg report on Thursday. That consideration is primarily attributable to Intel's status as the only born-and-bred American company that can manufacture the fastest chips on U.S. soil.

While some firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung, both of which can produce 3-nanometer chips — the most advanced semiconductors so far — have factories in the U.S., they are Taiwanese and South Korean companies, respectively, and probably do not enjoy apple pies on the Fourth of July.

In combination with the news that Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% share of their revenue from chip sales in China, as well as Apple committing to make more chips in America, the Trump administration seems to be consolidating a chip empire with the White House as its capital.  

To modify a song last heard by the Astronomer CEO before he was cast down to Earth: ""I used to rule the world / Chips would rise when I gave the word.""

— CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report

The Trump administration is reportedly considering a stake in Intel. The chipmaker is the only U.S. company that can manufacture the most advanced semiconductors in America. Intel's shares soared 7.4% after Bloomberg reported the news.

Wholesale prices in the U.S. heat up. The producer price index for July shot up 0.9% on the month, higher than the Dow Jones estimate of a 0.2% gain. It was the biggest monthly rise since 2022. The annual figure came in at 3.3%, the highest since February.

Potential Fed chair David Zervos backs an aggressive rate cut. The Jefferies chief market strategist told CNBC that reaccelerating wholesale prices in July should not deter the central bank from cutting its ""restrictive"" monetary policy by 50 basis points.

U.S. stocks flirt with the flatline. The S&P 500's barest 0.03% gain, however, means it closed at another high on Thursday. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index added 0.55%. Meanwhile, the U.K. economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter.

[PRO] European defense stocks will benefit from Trump-Putin meeting. Regardless of whether the talks result in any breakthroughs on the war in Ukraine, analysts think it's a ""win-win"" situation for defense stocks.

Putin vs. Trump? Ukraine talks could be a test of statecraft

Russian President Vladimir Putin's standing in the West may be pretty low, but he's a skilled and seasoned statesman who shouldn't be underestimated, analysts say — and he's likely to be looking to outmaneuver his less experienced U.S. counterpart when the leaders meet in Alaska on Friday.

""Let's be clear, Putin does not take Trump seriously,"" Tina Fordham, founder of Fordham Global Foresight, told CNBC ahead of the talks.

CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter offers a view into the business of space exploration and privatization, delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up to receive future editions.

It was a matter of time, with governments racing to clinch the first Mars laurels, that private companies would start offering rides to the red planet.

Italy's Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI) became the first client who's signed on to send scientific experiments aboard SpaceX's first commercial flights to Mars — where Elon Musk's space company has yet to land.

""Italy is going to Mars!"" ASI President Teodoro Valente announced on social media, with Italian news outlet ANSA reporting the agency's payloads will feature a plant growth experiment, a weather surveillance station and a radiation sensor for data collection.

""#MadeinItaly on #Mars,"" Italian Industry Minister Adolfo Urso celebrated, while SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell declared open season for the company's Mars launch bookings.

""Get on board! We are going to Mars! SpaceX is now offering Starship services to the red planet,"" she said on the X social media platform.

Notably, no timeline was given for the launch dates of these flights — with the odds of short-term travel to Mars increasingly under question.

Both parties to the arrangement have been committed to Mars ventures.

ASI barely just made headlines at the end of last month, when it inked a deal to develop the first human lunar outpost with Thales Alenia Space — building on the Italian space agency's 2020 partnership with NASA to coordinate bringing astronauts back to the Moon under the Artemis Accords. Coming in third after France and Germany, Italy contributed 800 million euros ($935 million) — or 15.8% - to the European Space Agency's 7.68 billion euro adopted budget for 2025. It's also been heavily involved in the ExoMars mission, which seeks to launch the Rosalind Franklin rover around 2028.

It's meanwhile at once surprising and predictable that SpaceX, which made a name for itself out of commercializing space launches, is already leaping to book Mars excursions. A longtime NASA contractor, the firm's also been offering satellite launch services to Eutelsat's OneWeb and AST SpaceMobile. 

A few days back, Amazon, whose chief Jeff Bezos owns his own rival rocket company Blue Origin, tapped Musk's company for the second time and launched its fourth batch of Kuiper satellites on SpaceX's 100th mission this year. And Musk has certainly been vocal about his plans to pursue Mars colonization, once echoed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.   

But there's no escaping one (nearly 400-feet) problem. SpaceX's reusable mammoth rocket Starship — the key to materializing Musk's Mars ambitions — has had a long-storied string of publicized test flight failures this year amid technical and refueling woes. We're about to see during its next attempt later this month if it's overcome these challenges in the three months since its last explosive stint. That's skipping over a June incident when a Starship rocket exploded while being loaded with methane and liquid oxygen propellant ahead of its launch — due, Musk later said, citing preliminary data, to problems in the payload bay.

Critically for our conversation, Starship is not yet rated crew-ready, and Musk himself has now pushed back his initial targets, flagging a ""slight change"" of a crewed flight during the next window in 2026, when Earth and the red planet are optimally aligned for travel to Mars.

""Slight chance of Starship flight to Mars crewed by Optimus in Nov/Dec next year. A lot needs to go right for that,"" he said last week on social media.

""More likely, first flight without humans in ~3.5 years, next flight ~5.5 years with humans. Mars city self-sustaining in 20 to 30 years.""

It may seem too early to start selling tickets to Mars, it's no secret that launch capacity worldwide has been struggling to keep up with demand for space access. Time will tell whether ASI's enthusiasm was ultimately strategic or premature.

In combination with the news that Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% share of their revenue from chip sales in China, as well as Apple committing to make more chips in America, the Trump administration seems to be consolidating a chip empire with the White House as its capital.  

To modify a song last heard by the Astronomer CEO before he was cast down to Earth: ""I used to rule the world / Chips would rise when I gave the word.""

— CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report

The Trump administration is reportedly considering a stake in Intel. The chipmaker is the only U.S. company that can manufacture the most advanced semiconductors in America. Intel's shares soared 7.4% after Bloomberg reported the news.

China's economy falters in July. A series of data released Friday — retail sales, industrial output and fixed-asset investment — all underperformed economists' estimates. The statistics bureau attributed the disappointing performance to extreme weather last month.

Berkshire Hathaway unveils a stake in UnitedHealth. Warren Buffett's conglomerate bought more than 5 million shares in the health care firm for a stake worth about $1.6 billion at the end of June, according to a regulatory filing.

U.S. stocks flirt with the flatline. The S&P 500's 0.03% gain, however, means it closed at another high on Thursday. Asia-Pacific markets rose Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 added more than 1% on the country's economy expanding more than expected in the second quarter.

Germany's Merz strikes sharp tone with Europe as he cozies up to Trump

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is looking to redefine Germany's voice in Europe and build a relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump — whom many of Merz's European colleagues do not see eye to eye with.

The historically EU-friendly Merz, a former member of the European Parliament, now has a long list of complaints about the bloc.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets.

European stock markets closed flat ahead of a meeting between President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index shed 0.01%. Regionally, Germany's DAX was also down just 0.01%, while the FTSE 100 closed down 0.4%. France's CAC 40 bucked the trend and rose 0.7%.

Peace in Ukraine is typically viewed as a positive development by most investors for European equities.

Shares of cable maker NKT rose by more than 6% — the most among Stoxx Europe 600 index stocks — after the company raised its outlook amid growth in the renewable energy sector.

The Danish company, which makes and installs the cables to connect offshore wind turbines, lifted its revenue expectations for the full year by about to a range between 2.65 billion euros ($.3.1 billion) and 2.75 billion euros, from a 2.37-billion-euro to 2.52 billion-euro forecast, prior.

Earlier this year, the company had said its order backlog for high-voltage cables stood at more than 10 billion euros.

The stock is up 12% so far this year.

Switzerland-headquartered industrial giant ABB has signed a multi-year agreement with U.S.-based Noveon Magnetics for the supply of rare earth magnets.

Under the multi-million-dollar deal, Noveon will begin supplying sintered rare earth magnets in August for use in ABB's industrial motor applications in North America.

""Capacity for the deal is secured, underscoring ABB's confidence in Noveon's long-term capabilities and product quality,"" said the Zurich-based company on Thursday.

Earlier this month, Noveon also signed an agreement with automaker General Motors to supply magnets for use in trucks and full-size SUVs.

The company says it is the only manufacturer of rare earth magnets in the U.S.

Rare earths have become central to trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.

Spending pressures are dividing beer drinking habits, further clouding the outlook for brewers already battling declining sales volumes.

Drinkers are increasingly bypassing once-loved core beer brands and instead opting for premium or economy alternatives, Danish brewer Carlsberg said Thursday, as beermakers confront wider pressures on the drinks sector.

""We do see a continued bifurcation in terms of preferences,"" CEO Aarup-Andersen told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

Pandora shares dropped 12.7% by 8:45 a.m. in London (3:45 a.m. ET), after the company published its second-quarter earnings release.

The Danish jewelry giant said on Friday morning that it faced ""headwind from foreign exchange, tariffs and commodity prices"" in the second quarter, which would continue to weigh on its bottom line.

Pandora's jewelry is manufactured at two factories in Thailand, which has been hit with 19% ""reciprocal"" tariffs by the U.S. — Pandora's biggest market.  

The firm said it expected to take a direct financial hit from U.S. tariffs this year of 200 million Danish kroner ($31.3 million), and a 450 million kroner annualized hit in 2026. 

""Pandora will consider further price increases, cost measures as well as other mitigation to cover the impact,"" the company said in its release. ""Timing and extent of the measures is to be confirmed.""

We're coming up to 20 minutes of trading, and European bourses are broadly higher.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was last seen up 0.3%, with all major bourses in positive territory.

Aside from the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska on Friday, investors will be monitoring earnings and economic data.

Results have come from Pandora and Finnish utility firms Fortum.

Pandora's quarterly sales came in slightly below expectations, while Fortum's second-quarter comparable operating profit fell to 115 million euros ($134 million) from 233 million euros a year earlier, missing forecasts.

Later on Friday, market participants can expect U.S. retail sales data, as well as figures on U.S. import and export prices, along with the latest Michigan Consumer Sentiment print.

— Chloe Taylor

After three consecutive days of gains, the pan-European Stoxx 50 looks set to rise again today, with futures tied to the index last seen trading 0.6% higher.

Those tied to the German DAX, France's CAC 40 and London's FTSE 100 are also all up by around 0.6%.

Market participants will be watching news out of the highly anticipated meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, with hopes building that a resolution on the war in Ukraine can be reached.

— Chloe Taylor

Danish jewelry brand Pandora on Friday posted a slightly weaker-than-expected rise in second-quarter sales and maintained its full-year outlook despite flagging continued weakness in China.

Revenues rose 8% on an organic basis to 7.08 billion Danish kroner ($1.10 billion) in the three-month period, just shy of the 7.12 billion Danish kroner forecast by LSEG analysts.

China recorded the largest decline in organic sales, down 15%, while the U.S. accelerated 12%. Pandora said performance in China ""continues to be challenged"" and announced an anticipated doubling of store closures in the country to 100 this year.

The company nevertheless reiterated its full-year forecast for organic sales growth of 7% to 8% and an operating profit margin of at least 24%, including the impact of U.S. tariffs.

Oops, something went wrong

Brazilian police have arrested four individuals after they allegedly kidnapped the mother of a crypto trader and held her for a ransom of over 3.3 million reais (over $600,000) worth of Bitcoin. 

Local Brazilian media reported that the retired teacher was captured in March by a gang of two men and two women when she left a forum in Recife. The alleged criminals thought that she would have access to large crypto holdings after tracking her son's activity on social media. 

Brazilian investigators told local media that after looking at her son's online posts, the alleged attackers were able to determine where she lived. After kidnapping the victim, the four attackers then held her at gunpoint for 12 hours until her son, based in Portugal, sent over 5 BTC, local media added. 

Brazilian Men Sentenced in $190 Million Bitcoin Investment Ponzi Scheme

Bitcoin was recently trading at over $117,301, virtually unmoved over a seven-day and 24-hour period despite setting a new all-time high price above $124,000 on Wednesday.

Local cops said that it would be difficult to retrieve the Bitcoin from the alleged kidnappers. 

Crypto-fueled kidnappings—dubbed ""wrench attacks""—are on the rise around the world: Just last month, four people in London were convicted for kidnapping a Belgian barber after he boasted online about a Bitcoin fortune he didn't actually have.

In France, a total of 25 suspects were arrested earlier this summer in relation to a series of crypto-driven attacks and kidnapping attempts, including the failed abduction of the pregnant daughter of Pierre Noizat, co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium.

Earlier in the year, Ledger co-founder David Balland and his wife were kidnapped in France and held for ransom, with Balland's finger reportedly cut off and sent to associates. Police liberated the couple after about 24 hours of captivity.

And two men in June pleaded not guilty to kidnapping and torturing a man for his Bitcoin in a high-profile case in New York. 

A database of ""wrench attacks"" shows nearly as many attacks so far in 2025 as the entirety of 2024.

The Motley Fool->



The passage of the Genius Act could lead to major stablecoin growth.

XRP's investment thesis rests on bank adoption driving XRP's price, but the truth is complicated. 

Ethereum's smart contracts make it incredibly useful, but how will it fare as stablecoin adoption takes off?

Although the cryptocurrency market is rarely -- if ever -- boring, this year has been a particularly wild ride for investors. Bitcoin has more than doubled since last August and reached a new all-time high well above the six-figure mark.

While Bitcoin remains the top dog, two of the most popular and well-established altcoins -- Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) -- have grabbed headlines of their own with big gains. Though in many ways they are very different, their futures are both heavily tied to the legacy financial system. Both will also be affected significantly if there's mass adoption of stablecoins, and with the recent passage of the Genius Act, that looks entirely possible. 

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

So, which is the better long-term pick? I believe that if you look past the hype, there's a clear answer.

The technology underpinning legacy banking's settlements (how banks actually send and receive funds) is extremely useful and secure, but it has some pretty significant shortcomings. Transactions can take days or even weeks to finalize. The process -- especially when sending money across borders -- often involves several intermediaries, and the fees can stack up quickly.

Ripple, the company behind XRP, set out to solve those problems. It created the XRP blockchain and its native token to make financial transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure.

The basic investment thesis for XRP has always been that as banks adopt Ripple's technology, demand for XRP will rise and its price will follow. The more widespread the adoption, the higher XRP's value.

Here's the thing: Banks can use Ripple's blockchain with little or no exposure to XRP at all. In fact, that's how most banks -- especially the largest ones -- choose to interact with the technology. They can capture most of the time and cost savings without taking on the risk of holding a volatile asset like XRP. 

Ripple's on-demand liquidity (ODL) product is the exception. ODL helps institutions that face liquidity issues in cross-border payments by eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts in foreign currencies. Instead, banks use XRP as a bridge asset. This is where the popular investment case holds up.

The problem is, most major financial institutions don't face liquidity issues -- at least not to the extent that holding a risky asset like XRP would justify -- and I believe ODL is unlikely to be adopted at scale.

Image source: Getty Images.

Adding another wrinkle, Ripple just bought Rail, a stablecoin payment platform, and looks to be trying to position itself as a leader in stablecoins as the market takes off. This could further reduce demand for XRP, offering another payment system that doesn't require direct XRP exposure, and even potentially replacing XRP as the asset needed for ODL. The success of stablecoins could actually hurt XRP's value. 

That isn't the case for Ethereum. The pioneer of smart contracts underpins a large portion of stablecoin usage. By far, the most USDC transactions happen on its blockchain. As stablecoins grow in adoption, demand for Ethereum is likely to grow, not diminish. 

Every stablecoin transaction on the Ethereum network requires a small payment in Ether (ETH) -- the actual coin investors hold -- for gas, or transaction fees. Part of that fee is automatically burned, meaning that the ETH is permanently destroyed and removed from circulation. The more activity on Ethereum, the more ETH is burned.

But wait, XRP works the same way, correct? XRP has to be burned for every transaction on its network. Why is this different? The mechanisms are similar, but the economics are very different. A minuscule amount of XRP is burned for each transaction; it has very little effect on price. In contrast, enough ETH is burned in each transaction to meaningfully affect the price. 

Stablecoins could define the next wave of crypto adoption. For XRP, that's more risk than reward, and it's just the opposite for Ethereum. Stablecoin growth directly boosts activity on its network, burns ETH, and reduces supply.

Beyond stablecoins, the possibilities offered by Ethereum's smart contracts in finance, the tokenization of stocks, and more make it the clear answer. It is the better crypto buy.

Before you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:

The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ethereum wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

Oops, something went wrong

Crypto exchange OKX burned—or effectively destroyed—279 million Ethereum-based OKB tokens valued at nearly $26 billion on Friday as part of a major slash to its native token supply. 

The burn marks one of the final steps in OKB's “economic upgrade,” reducing the total supply of OKB from 300 million to 21 million, matching the finite supply standard of Bitcoin, and phasing out its connections to Ethereum mainnet. 

News of the token burn and supply cut first circulated on Wednesday, sending OKB's price up more than 100% on the day, briefly creating a new all-time high mark of $135.12. 

The token has since retraced to $90.36, but remains the largest weekly gainer among top 100 crypto tokens by market cap, according to data from CoinGecko. 

OKB—which also acts as the native gas token for the exchange's Ethereum layer-2 network, X-Layer—will have its smart contract upgraded, removing minting and burning functionalities for the token on August 18. 

The tokenomics modification is part of a broader strategic refocus for OKX, which aims to elevate X-Layer. Earlier this month, the network integrated the latest version of Polygon's chain development kit, or CDK, enabling improved throughput and reduced transaction costs.

OKB Doubles in Price, Hits Record High as OKX Plans to Slash Supply

The firm aims to make it a leading network for DeFi, payments, and real world asset (RWA) tokenization. With its focus on X-Layer, the firm is discontinuing its OKT Chain and the OKT Chain token (OKT), which also jumped around 100% earlier this week amid news it would be automatically converted into OKB. 

Earlier this year, OKX created a new regional headquarters in the U.S. as it began its operations expansion, allowing U.S. residents to use its exchange and OKX Wallet. In June, a report from The Information indicated that the firm planned to go public in the U.S., joining the likes of eToro, Coinbase, and Bullish among publicly traded crypto exchanges.

Momentum has shifted back to the majors, and Ethereum is front and center. Flows into spot ETFs and treasury-style corporate buys have put a bid under ETH, while DeFi bellwether Uniswap (UNI) rides the same tide. At the same time, Remittix (RTX) keeps popping up on watchlists thanks to a clear listing catalyst investors can actually circle on the calendar. Here's a grounded look at cycle-top scenarios for each.

ETH is trading near prior-cycle highs, with live boards showing price in the mid-$4.6K–$4.7K band and a market cap solidly in second place. Analysts describe a “catch-up” move as ether closes the gap on bitcoin's new highs helped by favorable macro, ETF demand and recent network upgrades that tightened fees and boosted throughput. That combination is why desks still like upside follow-through if key levels hold.

For a cycle-top Ethereum Price Prediction, recent coverage points to five-figure targets: Fundstrat's team floats $12k–$15k by end-2025 if institutional participation and ETF inflows stay firm. The path isn't linear; there will be shakeouts but the thesis is straightforward: sustained flows plus improving tech and policy clarity tend to raise the ceiling. 

Institutional appetite is not just theory. Market updates this week framed ETH as inches from its 2021 peak, with the run aided by record ETF interest and corporates adding ether to treasuries evidence that the “buyer base” is diversifying beyond retail. 

UNI tracks DeFi risk; when on-chain activity and volumes expand, the token usually follows. Live data places UNI near the low-$11s with deep daily turnover. 

Technicians flag a key resistance band; clearing it could open a path to the high-teens or low-$20s in this cycle if DeFi keeps heating up. 

Recent roundups cluster 2025 targets in the $16–$25 zone, with some technical notes pointing higher if Uniswap can break and hold above long-term resistance. 

Remittix isn't competing on memes; it's building PayFi rails low-fee, cross-chain transfers that land as money in bank accounts. What's driving mindshare now is a near-term, binary headline: the team says it will reveal the name of its first centralized-exchange listing once the raise hits $20M. 

Traders tend to front-run events like this because they often pull in fresh liquidity and kick off price discovery. Recent features also highlight a beta wallet scheduled for September 15th 2025, launching with Ethereum and Solana connectivity another date investors can pencil in. 

Why RTX keeps landing on watchlists (quick hits)

For ETH, a credible Ethereum Price Prediction range sits in the five figures if ETF/treasury demand persists and the network keeps improving; the Fundstrat $12k–$15k band is the loudest version of that call right now. UNI's cycle-top odds hinge on DeFi breadth breakouts put $16–$25 in play, with upside if long-term resistance finally gives way. RTX is the curveball: it pairs a utility story with a $20M → CEX-name reveal and a dated wallet beta, giving investors concrete milestones instead of open-ended promises. If this bull phase keeps rewarding delivery and real flows, all three have room just for different reasons.

Dinari, a U.S.-based provider of tokenized public securities, is set to launch its own blockchain, joining the latest wave of firms to build their own infrastructure.

The chain, called the Dinari Financial Network, aims to serve as a coordination and settlement layer for the securities issued on other networks like Arbitrum ARB$0.4809, Base, Plume (PLUME) and, soon, Solana SOL$186.51. The network is custom built using Avalanche's (AVAX) tech stack.

""This is going to be the foundational infrastructure for our settlement and clearing system, which has up to this point predominantly happened off-chain,"" Gabe Otte, CEO and co-founder of Dinari, told CoinDesk in an interview.

The test net is currently live with plans for a public launch in the next couple weeks, Otte added.

Dinari is one of the firms spearheading the tokenization of equities, a red-hot trend to make trading with stocks available on blockchain rails. Proponents say tokenization could enable round-the-clock trading, faster settlements while reduce costs.

Recently, digital trading platform Robinhood introduced stock tokens on Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum ARB$0.4809 for EU users with future plans to build its own chain, while crypto exchanges including Kraken, Bybit also started offering tokens of U.S. stocks and ETFs.

In June, Dinari obtained a broker-dealer registration by FINRA with an approval to tokenize National Market System (NMS) securities, offering a compliant solution to issue token version of U.S. public stocks. Gemini, the exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, launched stock tokens in the EU with Dinari providing the tokenization infrastructure in the backend.

Dinari's decision to build its own chain follows a recent pattern seen across fintechs and crypto firms. USDC stablecoin issuer Circle and payments company Stripe revealed this week to pursue proprietary blockchains. Rival tokenization firms like Ondo Finance and Securitize (teamed up with Ethena) are also working on their own networks. 

With this approach, they aim to gain more control over compliance with regulations, uptime and integration with traditional finance systems compared to deploying on existing public blockchains.

For Dinari, having their own chain was ""out of necessity,"" Otte said.

""A lot of the public chains doesn't really allow for the proper level of compliance needed for dealing with securities,"" he explained. Another key reason was to facilitate and coordinate trades of Dinari-issued tokens across multiple blockchains without fragmenting liquidity.

""If part of [the stock tokens] lives on Solana, part on Arbitrum, part on Base, you're taking this $100 trillion market and fragmenting it,"" he said. ""How do you prevent that? With a purpose-built chain that allows us to essentially pull liquidity across all these different chains.""

By unifying settlement and liquidity, the company aims to bring continuous, compliant trading of U.S. equities to a global market, gunning for a similar role to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) for the stock market. DTCC is the world's largest securities clearing and settlement system.

For choosing Avalanche to build on, Otte emphasized the need for flexibility and the ability to control transaction fees (gas prices), which is difficult with rollup and layer-2 solutions. Avalanche's blockchain service, Ava Cloud lets businesses spin up and customize blockchains for their own needs, said Morgan Krupetsky, VP of ecosystem growth at Ava Labs.

Dinari wants to position the Dinari Financial Network to be a ""neutral clearinghouse"" for the industry, Otte said.

At the start, governance will come from a consortium of institutions including Gemini, custodian BitGo and asset manager VanEck, who will serve as validators and also offer custody services.

The plan is to fully decentralize the chain in future, Otte said. That includes potentially launching the chain's own governance token, he added.

The history of the crypto market is one of trends, which leaves investors breathless, skyrockets valuation and then, inevitably, goes cold until the next trend hits the market. Whether it is the wild fundraising days of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) to the cultural mania of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and now the institutional adoption of Real-World Assets (RWAs), each hype cycle made a significant impact on the industry.

This evolution shows how blockchain has matured – from a raw, experimental playground to a regulated, efficiency-driven financial layer. And while each phase has brought its share of winners and losers, investors continue searching for the “next big thing” that could deliver massive returns, much like how MAGACOIN FINANCE is now drawing attention as a new contender in the current bull market.

The ICO Era 

ICOs took over headlines between 2017 and 2018. Under the influence of Ethereum smart contracts, projects avoided the established channels to find funding and sold their tokens directly to investors worldwide. The articulation was straightforward, pitch a token which holds value in the next revolutionary dApp before launching.

Billions came in, even on projects little more than a whitepaper. The hype and FOMO caused valuations to go to the stratosphere and back in reality, valuations dropped rapidly. Regulatory clampdowns came and only a small percentage of ICO projects remained intact. Nevertheless, ICOs demonstrated the success of on-chain fundraising, which led to other subsequent models such as the IEO and IDO.

A Strategic Investment in Today's Market

Although in improving hype cycles, in the past, retail speculation has fueled a hype cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting it in a more sustainable model. Being supported by constant progress and a growing ecosystem, it is gaining the deserved reputation of a security-certified, audited, long-term project. Participants notably already witnessed significant momentum early on, and as spots in the allocations are becoming less available, the interest is growing before broader access to the exchanges can be reached. The chance resembles the initial days of other breakout tokens – when a little investment can multiply a number of times, lеading to incredible gains.

NFTs Era

By 2021, the spotlight shifted from utility tokens to ownership. NFTs, backed by blockchain certificates, let people own unique pieces of digital art, collectibles, and in-game assets. Beeple's $69 million sale and celebrity endorsements pushed NFTs into pop culture overnight.

The speculative rush sent prices of top collections soaring before the bubble popped. Most collections lost nearly all their value, but the technology itself endured. Today, NFTs are finding real-world use cases in ticketing, authentication, and gaming, proving the underlying innovation had substance beyond the hype.

RWAs Era

Now, attention has turned to Real-World Asset tokenization. This is not about creating speculative crypto-native products – it's about bringing tangible assets like real estate, bonds, and private credit onto the blockchain. Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are leading the market, seeking efficiency, liquidity, and transparency.

The interest among institutions is evident, since these tokens are pegged in real assets, and hence the volatility is reduced, which fits into the compliance requirements. There are still hurdles to overcome, primarily around legal structures and cross-border rules and regulations but as regulatory sandboxes are implemented in countries, the road to large-scale adoption is becoming clear.

Conclusion

From ICOs to NFTs and now RWAs, each crypto hype cycle has built on the lessons of the last. The industry is moving from speculative mania toward a more grounded, utility-focused future. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits into this evolution by offering a secure, growth-oriented ecosystem that combines innovation with credibility – making it a project to watch as the market's next chapter unfolds.

Anas is a crypto native journalist and SEO writer with over five years of writing experience covering blockchain, crypto, DeFi, and emerging tech.

New York Assembly Member Phil Steck has introduced legislation imposing a 0.2% excise tax on all digital asset transactions, including crypto and NFT sales or transfers.

According to the bill filing, the proceeds will be earmarked for expanding substance abuse prevention programs in upstate schools.

Assembly Bill A08966, introduced August 13 and referred to the Ways and Means Committee, would take effect September 1, 2025, marking another state-level attempt to generate revenue from the growing crypto sector.

The bill defines digital assets broadly as any asset “issued, transferred, or both, using distributed ledger or blockchain technology,” encompassing digital currencies, coins, and non-fungible tokens. 

The legislation places responsibility for tax payment on “the person or persons making or effectuating the sale or transfer,” potentially creating compliance challenges for exchanges, traders, and DeFi protocols operating in New York.

The proposed tax comes as global jurisdictions pursue diverse approaches to crypto taxation, ranging from total bans in China to innovation-friendly frameworks in Switzerland and Singapore. 

The Trump administration reversed Biden-era crypto enforcement policies in 2025, repealing DeFi broker rules and positioning the US as more crypto-friendly, while the EU implemented comprehensive MiCA regulations requiring strict licensing for crypto asset service providers.

Thailand, for instance, has implemented a five-year personal income tax exemption on crypto capital gains through licensed platforms, effective January 2025 through December 2029. 

The Thai government anticipates over 1 billion baht in additional tax revenue through indirect economic activity despite the exemption.

While Thailand wants to exempt taxation, taxing countries are progressing gradually. 

Most recently, Indonesia's crypto tax revenue jumped 181% to $38 million in 2024, driven by transaction volumes reaching $39.67 billion as the country's crypto user base exceeded 20 million people. 

🇮🇩 Indonesia's crypto tax revenue jumped 181% in 2024 to ~$38M, but collections have fallen in 2025 due to market volatility. #cryptotax #Indonesia https://t.co/s20V54zazb

However, 2025 collections dropped to $6.97 million through July due to market volatility, highlighting the challenge of relying on crypto taxes for stable revenue.

The Indonesian government raised taxes on foreign exchanges from 0.2% to 1% while keeping domestic platform increases modest at 0.21%, attempting to shift activity toward regulated local platforms. 

Mining operations face doubled VAT from 1.1% to 2.2%, with special income tax rates ending in 2026.

Similarly, Japan's crypto investors face income tax rates up to 55% on profits, prompting the Japan Blockchain Association to survey 1,500 adults about potential reforms. 

The survey found 84% of current crypto holders would buy more if the government implemented a flat 20% capital gains tax, while 12% of non-holders said they would start investing under reformed tax rules.

Earlier this year, Ukraine also proposed an 18% personal income tax plus 5% military levy on virtual asset gains, with preferential rates of 5-9% for specific categories. 

The wartime military levy helps fund defense efforts while the country develops comprehensive crypto taxation frameworks following international examples.

While countries are working towards their taxation framework, China maintains a total ban on all cryptocurrency activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership, as of June 2025, extending earlier prohibitions to support the state-backed digital yuan. 

In fact, China goes as far as enforcing through active asset seizures and criminal penalties for violations, which remains the major country in the region with low crypto appetite.

Singapore, however, offers rigorous licensing through the Monetary Authority with finalized stablecoin regulatory frameworks, attracting blockchain innovation while implementing strict compliance requirements. 

Similarly, Hong Kong has positioned itself as an Asian crypto center with licensing for exchanges, custody services, and comprehensive stablecoin oversight.

Contrary to the Asian mixed stance, the European Union's MiCA regulation has unified regulation that requires comprehensive licensing for crypto asset service providers with strict anti-money laundering and consumer protection rules. 

The framework harmonizes regulation across member states while maintaining innovation-focused oversight approaches.

The New York proposal joins other state-level initiatives as federal crypto policy evolves under the Trump administration's pro-innovation stance. 

The success of the 0.2% excise tax will likely influence other US states considering similar revenue-generating measures targeting the expanding crypto market.

- NY Assembly Bill 8966 proposes a 0.2% excise tax on crypto/NFT transactions to fund school substance abuse programs, effective September 2025.

- The tax applies to crypto exchanges, traders, and DeFi protocols, raising compliance challenges similar to the 2015 BitLicense era.

- It reflects state-level regulatory efforts amid federal inaction, potentially affecting market liquidity and pushing crypto entities to lower-tax jurisdictions.

- Critics warn excessive regulation could stifle innovation, while proponents argue it promotes transparency in the evolving digital asset sector.

- The bill remains in early stages with uncertain outcomes, dependent on negotiations and broader economic/political factors for enactment.

New York State Assemblymember Phil Steck has introduced Assembly Bill 8966, which proposes a 0.2% excise tax on cryptocurrency and non-fungible token (NFT) transactions, including sales, transfers, and exchanges involving assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum [1]. The tax is intended to fund substance abuse prevention programs in schools, with implementation set to begin on September 1, 2025 [2]. The bill applies to a wide range of digital asset activities, including transactions involving cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and altcoins, and would affect crypto exchanges, traders, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols [3].

The proposal highlights potential compliance challenges for crypto stakeholders and may influence asset transactions in New York, drawing comparisons to the regulatory environment that emerged during the BitLicense era in 2015. At that time, some exchanges exited the state due to the high compliance costs associated with the new regime [4]. While no major exchange closures or mass withdrawals have been confirmed yet, the bill reflects a potential shift in New York's financial regulatory strategy [5].

The introduction of Assembly Bill 8966 aligns with broader regulatory efforts in the U.S., where states are increasingly taking a proactive approach in the absence of a unified federal tax framework for digital assets [6]. The proposed tax could affect market liquidity and investor behavior, particularly for retail participants who frequently engage in NFT and token trading [7]. Industry observers suggest that if the bill passes, some crypto entities may seek lower-tax jurisdictions, potentially pushing innovation outside heavily regulated areas [8].

New York's initiative also reflects the growing tension between fostering innovation in digital assets and ensuring regulatory compliance. While proponents argue that the tax will promote transparency and accountability, critics caution that excessive regulation could stifle growth in a sector still in its developmental phase [9]. The debate is expected to intensify as more details emerge and stakeholders weigh in.

Assembly Bill 8966 is still in early stages, with no specific enforcement mechanisms or implementation timelines outlined yet [10]. The bill's future remains uncertain, as its path to enactment will depend on negotiations, amendments, and broader economic and political considerations [11]. If passed, the proposed tax would represent a significant development in New York's approach to digital assets and could influence the national regulatory environment [12].

Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are leading the market, seeking efficiency, liquidity, and transparency.

The interest among institutions is evident, since these tokens are pegged in real assets, and hence the volatility is reduced, which fits into the compliance requirements. There are still hurdles to overcome, primarily around legal structures and cross-border rules and regulations but as regulatory sandboxes are implemented in countries, the road to large-scale adoption is becoming clear.

Conclusion

From ICOs to NFTs and now RWAs, each crypto hype cycle has built on the lessons of the last. The industry is moving from speculative mania toward a more grounded, utility-focused future. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits into this evolution by offering a secure, growth-oriented ecosystem that combines innovation with credibility – making it a project to watch as the market's next chapter unfolds.

 Hive Digital's fiscal Q1 2026 revenue jumped 44.9% in its mining segment and nearly 60% in its HPC unit. 

Hive Digital, a Bitcoin miner turned data center infrastructure provider, reported record revenue and earnings in its fiscal first quarter, driven by strong growth in high-performance computing (HPC) hosting services alongside its core mining business.

In its fiscal Q1 2026, Hive generated $45.6 million in total revenue. Digital currency mining contributed $40.8 million, up 44.9% from the previous quarter, as the company mined 406 Bitcoin (BTC) — a 34% increase quarter-over-quarter. Bitcoin's rising value further supported the company's performance. 

Revenue from its HPC division, operating under the Buzz HPC brand, rose 59.8% sequentially to a record $4.8 million.

On an adjusted basis, earnings totaled $44.6 million.

Although mining remains Hive's primary revenue driver, the company is increasingly leveraging advanced AI chips to expand its HPC business. Executives Frank Holmes and Aydin Kilic told Cointelegraph that they aim for the HPC segment to reach a $100 million annual run rate by next year.

Company shares were down slightly following the earnings report, with HIVE last seen trading around $2.20. 

Hive isn't the only Bitcoin miner benefiting from the crypto bull market. Last week, CleanSpark reported record revenue and profits, boosted by surging BTC prices.

Similarly, last month MARA Holdings posted a sharp revenue increase, driven by higher Bitcoin valuations and expanded mining operations.

Hive was among the first Bitcoin miners to repurpose part of its infrastructure for HPC and AI — a trend that has only accelerated across the industry.

Earlier this week, TeraWulf announced a $3.7 billion AI hosting agreement with Fluidstack, an AI infrastructure provider, with Google backing Fluidstack's lease obligations. In return, Google received 41 million TeraWulf shares as part of the deal.

Core Scientific is a prominent example of a Bitcoin miner whose pivot to AI revived its struggling business after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy during the last crypto bear market. The company was later acquired by CoreWeave in a $9 billion deal.

Hut 8 has deployed over 1,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs as part of its expansion into cloud-based AI computing. In its latest quarterly earnings report, the company said it is working to “commercialize AI data center opportunities.”

                    ARTICLE
                

LOG IN



As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.


A small group of North Korean IT workers has been linked to a $680,000 crypto theft in June — and leaked screenshots reveal how they've been blending in with legitimate developers to infiltrate projects, according to Cointelegraph.

The images, shared on X by blockchain investigator ZachXBT, came from an unnamed source who managed to access one of the workers' devices. They offer a rare look into the methods used by hackers tied to North Korea's state-backed operations.

The group appears to be made up of just six people, but they control at least 31 false identities. These include forged government IDs, phone numbers, and purchased LinkedIn and Upwork accounts. Using these identities, they have applied for developer roles in crypto and blockchain projects.

Evidence suggests one of the workers interviewed for a full-stack engineer position at Polygon Labs. In other cases, they prepared scripted interview answers, claiming past work for companies like OpenSea and Chainlink to gain credibility.

Once hired, they often worked remotely through platforms like Upwork, using AnyDesk for access to company systems and VPNs to hide their locations. Screenshots also showed they used Google Drive, Chrome profiles, and the company's Korean-to-English translation tool to manage schedules and communicate in English.

A spreadsheet found on one device listed $1,489.80 in expenses for May, detailing the costs of their ongoing operations.

One Payoneer account linked to the group converted fiat into crypto, with activity traced to a wallet address — “0x78e1a” — that investigators say was tied to the June 2025 hack of fan-token marketplace Favrr. That attack drained about $680,000.

ZachXBT previously alleged that Favrr's chief technology officer, known as “Alex Hong,” and some other developers were in fact North Korean workers using false identities.

The group's online activity also revealed their research interests, from asking if ERC-20 tokens could run on Solana to searching for AI development companies in Europe.

North Korean-linked teams have been behind some of the largest crypto thefts on record, including a $1.4 billion exploit of the exchange Bitbit earlier this year. Over time, they've taken millions from protocols by posing as contractors and remote workers.

Their tactics aren't always complex, but they work in volume — sending out enough applications that some inevitably slip through. Once inside, they can quietly gather data, siphon funds, or lay the groundwork for future attacks.

ZachXBT says crypto and tech firms need to be more thorough in screening hires. “Many of these operations aren't highly sophisticated,” he said, “but the sheer number of applications means hiring teams sometimes overlook red flags.”

He added that a lack of cooperation between tech companies and freelance platforms makes it easier for such groups to stay active.

The US Treasury has already taken action, sanctioning two people and four companies linked to a similar North Korean IT worker network in July. The move reflects growing concern over how state-backed cyber teams are targeting private companies — often hiding in plain sight.

As cryptocurrency firms rack up policy wins under President Donald Trump, banks this week grew more overt in their efforts to push back. 

The American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute and Consumer Bankers Association released a statement Thursday slamming the Financial Technology Association after it led crypto and other execs in calling on Trump to stop banks from charging to access customer data. 

The tussle came days after the same banking groups urged lawmakers to stop crypto exchanges from paying interest on stablecoins, which they warned could steer enough money away from banks to increase lending costs.

 Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad hit back, calling that argument “fearmongering.” 

The faultlines are here to stay: The banking groups asked senators to include language closing the “interest loophole” in their bid to overhaul crypto regulation, a person familiar with the request told Semafor, an idea crypto groups will resist.

California Governor Gavin Newsom is making a bold move to bring blockchain technology directly into state government operations. The newly announced California Breakthrough Project teams up major crypto companies with state officials to explore how digital tools can make public services work better for millions of residents.

The initiative brings together heavy hitters from the crypto world, including Coinbase, Ripple, and MoonPay, alongside tech giants like Instacart and Snap. These companies will work directly with state departments to test new ways of handling everything from hiring processes to customer service. As more governments explore blockchain technology, this could boost demand for Bitcoin and other digital assets. But before trading, investors should pick the right cryptocurrency exchange, as it is crucial for making transactions secure and efficient. Some of the currently most reliable choices include Best Wallet, MEXC, and Margex (source: https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-exchanges/).

In June, Ripple held the first task force meeting at their San Francisco headquarters, highlighting their key role in the movement. The location is not incidental as it emphasizes California's serious intention to place crypto firms at the center of modernization efforts. This marks a significant shift from viewing blockchain as just a financial tool to seeing it as infrastructure for public services.

Every state department has 90 days to submit plans for efficiencies using these new technologies, including hiring, procurement, and customer experience, which are the core activities that define resident interactions with their government agencies daily. The timetable indicates that Newsom wants results quickly, and not another study that collects dust on a shelf.

California is not starting from zero in blockchain. In 2019, California established a working group to study how blockchain technology could serve to improve government operations. This work mattered when the Department of Motor Vehicles had success tokenizing 42 million car titles on the Avalanche blockchain in 2024. The ability for residents to claim vehicle titles on their phone rather than waiting in line at the DMV was a significant step and an actual innovation that people could use.

The DMV project also illustrates how blockchain can improve fraud prevention while allowing agencies to remove processes that may take weeks to complete. When auto titles are represented as tokens on a trusted blockchain, it becomes more difficult for criminals to produce fraudulent documents or alter ownership records. This practical output demonstrates the potential for blockchain to merit more visibility and utilization in state government operations, which is why Newsom believes that the technology in question deserves a more prominent placement in the way California does business.

The timing of this announcement aligns with California's proactive stance on crypto regulation, particularly following the recent House passage of the Genius Act. As federal agencies remain locked in debates over digital asset oversight, California is forging ahead with practical blockchain implementations. Rather than getting entangled in broader regulatory discussions about crypto trading and speculation, the state is prioritizing how blockchain technology can streamline government operations and improve efficiency.

The project includes government officials, labor representatives, and civil society groups to ensure accountability during testing and rollout. This balanced approach addresses transparency concerns while pushing forward with innovation, particularly important since changes will directly affect how state employees work.

California's size and influence mean successful projects here often get copied by other states. If the Breakthrough Project delivers real improvements, expect other governors to launch similar programs soon.

The crypto companies bring different strengths to the initiative. Coinbase offers expertise in digital asset management and compliance, Ripple specializes in payment systems, and MoonPay brings experience making crypto simple for everyday users. Together, they cover the full spectrum of blockchain applications that could transform government operations.

The success of this depends on whether these partnerships produce tangible benefits for California residents. The DMV title project proves the concept works, but scaling up to hiring, procurement, and other core functions presents bigger challenges. The 90-day deadline for proposals will quickly show whether state agencies can think creatively about these new tools.

August 14, 2025 @ 9:13 pm By Omar Faridi 

Mesh, the  crypto payments network, announced additional investments from PayPal Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Uphold, Mirana Ventures (venture partner for ByBit), SBI Investment, Overlook Ventures, Kingsway Capital, Moderne Ventures and CE-Ventures, bringing total capital funding to more than $130 million.

This support positions the company to “accelerate its impact on the global payments industry.”

Mesh's technology supported the launch of PayPal's Pay with Crypto service, which allows consumers “to pay with a wide range of cryptocurrencies and eligible wallets.”

Mesh's technology enables consumers to “pay using 100+ wallets and cryptocurrencies through Mesh's SmartFunding orchestration engine.”

This allows PayPal merchants to tap into a “growing $3 trillion market with over 650 million crypto users.”

Most of the funds were settled “with the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin.”

Mesh's technology was used to “instantly transfer the investment.”

With integrations across Coinbase, Binance, ByBit, OKX, and more, Mesh's technology “reaches hundreds of millions of users.”

This new funding will accelerate its expansion “across the global payments industry, scaling APIs, expanding product development, and powering hundreds of crypto and payments platforms.”

All of this will hopefully position the company for “dominance in crypto payments as stablecoins drive the next wave of adoption.”

Mesh's SmartFunding technology reportedly “eliminates friction in crypto payments, enabling users to pay with any digital asset while merchants receive instant settlement in stablecoins, such as PYUSD, or fiat.”

This approach addresses the mismatch problem where “users often hold different cryptocurrencies than what merchants prefer, ensuring a seamless checkout experience with the benefits of blockchain technology.”

With the stablecoin market having a market cap over $200 billion and powering $27.6 trillion in transaction volume, consumers and merchants “want stable assets like stablecoins and local currency.”

Mesh is “unlocking liquidity, making these assets fungible with its SmartFunding orchestration engine.”

Founded in 2020, Mesh is building the “global crypto payments network, connecting exchanges, wallets, and financial services platforms to enable digital asset payments and conversions.”

By unifying these platforms into a single network, Mesh is enabling “an open, connected, and secure ecosystem for digital finance.”

PayPal Ventures is the global corporate venture arm of PayPal.

They invest for financial return in “six areas of high strategic relevance to PayPal, including fintech, payments, commerce enablement, artificial intelligence, blockchain & cryptocurrency, and regulatory/cyber technology.”

Through the expertise, experience, and network of PayPal Ventures – and the companies they invest in – they are “helping to bring transformative solutions to market faster.”

Hyperbeat, a protocol powering yield infrastructure on the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange, has closed a $5.2 million oversubscribed seed round co-led by ether.fi Ventures and Electric Capital.

The raise will be used to build out their yield infrastructure for traders, protocols, and institutions that are tapped into the Hyperliquid ecosystem.

The round also drew investments from Coinbase Ventures, Chapter One, Selini, Maelstrom, Anchorage Digital, and community backers via the HyperCollective.

Hyperbeat serves as the native yield layer for Hyperliquid, building permissionless financial infrastructure that allows anyone to earn, stake, and spend directly from their on-chain portfolio. It unlocks yield generated by Hyperliquid's funding rates—previously accessible only to sophisticated market participants—and packages it into simple, tokenized vaults.

Core products in the Hyperbeat ecosystem include beHYPE, a liquid staking token, Hyperbeat Earn, high-yield vaults on HyperEVM, Morphobeat, a credit layer enabling borrowing against vault positions, and Hyperbeat Pay, a protocol alternative to traditional banking rails. Together with its portfolio tracker, Hyperfolio, Hyperbeat is designed to give traders, protocols, and institutions a fully integrated way to trade, earn, and spend on-chain

The news of the seed raise comes as Hyperliquid's total value locked surpasses $2.1 billion, and as institutions are starting to develop greater interest in its ecosystem.

“Hyperbeat blends strong technical execution with an authentic understanding of the Hyperliquid community,” said Avichal Garg, a general partner at Electric Capital that co-lead the round, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. “Hyperliquid has fundamentally shifted trading on-chain, and Hyperbeat is building the rest of the financial stack—starting with liquid staking, isolated lending, strategy vaults, and portfolio tools.”

Solana-based meme coin BONK weathered a volatile 24 hours, as significant institutional activity defined both the highs and lows of the trading range. 

The token reached $0.000026 and quickly encountered resistance at that level, with 4.02 trillion tokens changing hands during a midday rejection that set a clear technical ceiling for the short term, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model.

From there, BONK slipped 6% to find a floor near $0.000023, where 1.07 trillion tokens traded as buyers absorbed the sell pressure. This zone has now emerged as a key support level, tested multiple times without breaking.

BONK subsequently staged a modest recovery, gaining roughly 1% from $0.000024 to $0.00002425. The rebound was fueled by sharp volume spikes at 10:48 UTC and 10:49 UTC, 21.99 billion and 31.43 billion tokens, respectively, suggesting accumulation from larger players just above prior resistance.

Traders now face a defined battle line: resistance remains fixed at $0.000026, with support anchored at $0.000023. A sustained push above $0.000025 could signal the beginning of a more pronounced upward move, while a break of the lower bound risks retesting early-August lows, according to the model.

BONK's continued high liquidity, even amid recent volatility, underscores its position as one of the more active tokens in the meme coin sector. Institutional participation has kept price action tightly bound, but it has also increased the potential for sudden breakouts should order books thin at key levels.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at custody rules for digital assets, including how broker-dealers, asset managers and investment advisers can deal with cryptocurrency transactions, its head said Friday.



SEC Chair Paul Atkins, speaking about his recently announced Project Crypto on Fox Business' ""Mornings With Maria"" program, said the agency was ""mobilizing at the SEC all our different divisions and offices"" to implement President Donald Trump's crypto working group's recommendations to make the U.S. a more crypto-friendly nation. This includes adjusting rules ""that have been around for 90 years or so,"" he said.



""We don't want the crypto assets to be on some flash drive in somebody's drawer,"" he said on Friday. ""They need to be in a secure place … the reason for doing all this and addressing these various regulations is to provide some certainty for people.""



The SEC's work will be based on the legislation passed by Congress, he said, pointing to the already-signed GENIUS Act and existing market structure legislative efforts.



""Our goal is to get clarity and certainty,"" he said. ""It will be undergirded by whatever comes out of Congress but I believe that we have authority to move forward in these areas and provide that certainty and clarity for people.""



Asked about a district court ruling on debit card interchange fees, Atkins said it could support real-time or instant payment networks, and moving toward instant payment settlements ""would be ideal,"" he said.



This type of payment could be bolstered by using a blockchain, he said, though he also said that the system could need to have some sort of delay built in to address mistakes.



""The longer that it takes to have clearance on some of the transactions, the more risk there is in the system for something to go wrong, some black swan event,"" he said.

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this article owns shares in Strategy.Bitcoin's risk-adjusted performance continues to stand out, with a Sharpe ratio of 2.15, the highest among major assets. This means that, relative to its volatility, bitcoin has delivered exceptional returns over the historical period. 

Strategy (MSTR), which maintains significant bitcoin exposure through corporate holdings, follows closely with a Sharpe ratio of 2.00, reflecting similarly strong performance. 

A Sharpe ratio of 2 means an asset has delivered twice the excess return over the risk-free rate for every unit of volatility taken, which is considered excellent in risk-adjusted performance terms.

For context, several large-cap tech names are clustered around a Sharpe ratio of 1.0. 

The data is current as of Aug. 14, for securities and Aug. 15, for bitcoin, according to the Strategy dashboard. 

A key driver of late for both has been volatility compression. Bitcoin's implied volatility has fallen to 37%, near a two-year low, suggesting market participants expect more stable price action in the short term. 

While, Vetle Lunde, an analyst at K33 Research, says “low volatility is maturity” and notes that over the past six months, 30% of the 100 largest S&P 500 companies have been more volatile than Bitcoin, which shows the cryptocurrency is becoming more of a mature asset class.

By contrast, MSTR's implied volatility is higher at 56%, as it's a leveraged bitcoin proxy, but this figure is well below the extremes seen in the past year, with 140% in December 2024 and over 120% in April 2025, according to the Strategy dashboard.

From a valuation perspective, MSTR's multiple to net asset value (mNAV) sits at 1.61 following its recent Q2 earnings call. The company has stated it will not conduct an at-the-market offering of its common stock until its mNAV rises above 2.5, except for paying dividends on its perpetual preferred stock and to pay interest on its debt obligations. 

Year-to-date bitcoin is up 27%, while MSTR is up 24%.

 Galaxy Digital secured $1.4 billion to expand its Texas Helios AI data center, expecting $1 billion in annual revenue from a 15-year CoreWeave partnership. 

Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital closed a $1.4 billion secured term loan facility to accelerate the development of its Helios artificial intelligence datacenter campus in Texas. 

On Friday, the company announced that the loan will cover about 80% of the construction costs for the first phase of the project, with Galaxy Digital contributing $350 million in equity. According to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the loan is secured by all assets of Galaxy Helios I, a subsidiary of Galaxy Digital, and it will mature on Aug. 15, 2028. 

The capital will fund the expansion of the Helios AI datacenter to deliver power for AI workloads under a long-term agreement with the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) cloud provider CoreWeave starting early 2026. 

The move highlights how digital asset firms leverage their capital-raising capabilities and repurpose infrastructure to tap into the increasing AI compute demand. This suggests that the broader compute and digital assets infrastructures may be converging. 

Galaxy also announced that the AI services provider CoreWeave brought its total commitment to a full 800 megawatts of approved capacity at the Helios campus. This means that CoreWeave is leasing power, cooling and physical infrastructure for its AI and high-performance computing (HPC) operations. 

Galaxy Digital said that it expects an annual revenue of over $1 billion from its CoreWeave deal, which has a 15-year term. If it goes as planned, the company will earn about $15 billion in total revenue from the contract. 

The company said it expects the Helios datacenter to have a power capacity of 3.5 gigawatts at full buildout. Minus its deal with CoreWeave, the data center will have an extra 2.7 gigawatts to sell to its clients. 

Related: Core Scientific's largest shareholder to vote against CoreWeave buyout offer

Galaxy Digital's move into AI is part of a broader trend among crypto-native firms seeking new growth avenues as institutional capital goes to AI. 

CoreWeave, originally a crypto mining company, announced on July 7 that it acquired the miner Core Scientific in a $9 billion all-stock transaction to expand its data center capacity to support its AI and HPC workloads.

Meanwhile, the Helios data center was also originally acquired for Bitcoin mining initiatives. In 2022, Mike Novogratz said that its Helios acquisition was made to increase its exposure to Bitcoin mining.

 New York Assemblymember Phil Steck introduced a bill that would see the state tax the sale and transfer of crypto assets. 

The US state of New York may tax the sales and transfers of crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), under a bill submitted in the state's Assembly.

Assembly Bill 8966, introduced on Wednesday by Democratic Assemblymember Phil Steck, would add a 0.2% excise tax on “digital asset transactions, including the sale or transfer of digital assets.”

The bill, if passed, would take effect immediately and apply to all sales and transactions, starting Sept. 1.

If enacted, the bill could bring in significant tax revenue for the state, as New York City is the world's largest financial and fintech hub, home to industries that have embraced crypto by buying up billions worth of tokens or offering crypto-based financial products.

Steck's bill denotes that the funding from the crypto tax sales would be earmarked to expand a “substance abuse prevention and intervention program to schools in upstate New York.”

The bill clarifies that it would change the state's tax laws, and the new levy would apply to “digital currencies, digital coins, digital non-fungible tokens or other similar assets.”

There are multiple steps before the bill becomes law. It will need to pass through a committee before being put to a vote before the full Assembly; it would then be sent to the Senate and, if approved, on to the governor, who could pass or veto the bill.

In the US, the federal and state governments can both levy taxes, which leads to states lowering — or in the case of Texas, completely scrapping — corporate and income taxes in the bid to attract companies looking to minimize their tax bills.

Most states do not have guidance on how their tax authorities should treat crypto. Others, such as California and New York, treat crypto as cash, while states like Washington exempt crypto from taxes, according to Bloomberg Tax.

New York, more specifically New York City, has long been home to crypto industry heavyweights due to its status as a global finance center.

Stablecoin issuers Circle Internet Group and Paxos, along with crypto exchange Gemini and analytics firm Chainalysis, are headquartered in the city, while many other crypto firms operate offices there.

New York was the first US state to launch a comprehensive regulatory regime for crypto, in 2015 introducing the BitLicense, a divisive permit that caused many crypto companies to leave the state as it was too burdensome. Others, such as Circle, Paxos and Gemini, embraced the opportunity to be regulated.

 US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that the department was exploring budget-neutral ways to buy Bitcoin, contradicting an earlier comment that tanked the market. 

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that his department was still exploring budget-neutral ways to buy Bitcoin for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, in contrast with a recent comment suggesting it was off the table, which triggered a Bitcoin sell-off.

“Treasury is committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve, and to execute on the President's promise to make the United States the ‘Bitcoin superpower of the world,'” Bessent clarified in an X post on Thursday. 

He reiterated that Bitcoin (BTC) forfeited to the federal government would form the reserve's foundation.There were already concerns voiced that the US's slow pace of executing its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could leave it open to being front-run by other nation-states. Some feared that the Treasury may not even follow through on the strategy.

About seven hours earlier on Thursday, Bessent's comments to FOX Business were widely interpreted to mean the Treasury wasn't looking to buy Bitcoin.

“We've also started to get into the 21st century, a Bitcoin reserve. We're not going to be buying that, but we are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up,” Bessent told the media outlet, which wiped nearly $55 billion off Bitcoin's market cap within 40 minutes of his comments, with Bitcoin falling from $121,073 to $118,886, CoinGecko data showed.

Despite the clarification, Bitcoin was trading at $118,500 at the time of writing.

While Bessent's clarification reassured some Bitcoiners, others were still concerned that the US Treasury Department might not execute on its promise:

“Are you seriously still ‘exploring budget-neutral pathways'? At some point, exploration without execution starts to look like avoidance,” Bitcoin mining firm Braiins CEO Eli Nagar said on X. 

Trump signed an executive order on March 6 establishing both a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile, both of which would initially use crypto forfeited in government criminal cases. 

The order opened the door for additional Bitcoin purchases via “budget-neutral” strategies that “do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers.” However, no major developments were shared on how those strategies may be executed in the Digital Asset Working Group's lengthy crypto report last month.

Among the budget-neutral strategies that have been floated are the reevaluation of the Treasury's gold certificates and tariff revenue.

One reason for the slow progress may be that the Treasury requires congressional approval to purchase Bitcoin in a budget-neutral manner. US Senator Cynthia Lummis made note of that point, calling on Congress to look closer into the BITCOIN Act she introduced in March.

While no action has been taken on the buying side, Bessent confirmed that the US doesn't plan to sell its existing Bitcoin holdings:

“We're going to stop selling,” he told FOX Business, adding that he thought the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve was currently valued “somewhere between $15 billion and $20 billion.”

That aligns with BitBo's Bitcoin Treasuries dashboard, which reports that the US holds 198,012 Bitcoin worth $23.5 billion.

Sam Kean's New Book Dinner with King Tut Explores the Wild World of Experimental Archaeology

In his new book, Sam Kean reveals how re-creating ancient tools, techniques and traditions can unlock secrets about how our ancestors lived—and what they felt.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura 

Little, Brown and Company; Scientific American Illustration

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

Experimental archaeology takes a hands-on approach to understanding the past. Instead of just studying ancient objects researchers re-create them. They build 30-foot medieval catapults, perform ancient surgeries with stone tools and prepare authentic Roman banquets using techniques so traditional, not even your nonna would recognize them. The goal is to understand not just what our ancestors made but how they made it—and what it felt like to live in their world.

Our guest today is Sam Kean, a science writer who's written seven books. His latest is called Dinner with King Tut, and it explores the world of experimental archaeology. He's tried his hand at everything from ancient brain surgery to mummifying a fish, and he's here to tell us all about it.

Thanks so much for coming on to chat today.

Sam Kean: Well, thanks for having me.

Feltman: So what exactly is experimental archaeology, and how did you get interested in it?

Kean: Experimental archaeology involves doing things—so making things, re-creating things from the past. And I got into it because I'd always had a bit of a gripe with archaeology, traditional dirt archaeology, in that I think it's a fascinating field; you learn so much about humankind and these big, meaty questions about us—you know, who we are, where we came from—these really important questions about deep human history. So I really like that aspect of traditional archaeology.

But every time I would go to an archaeological site, I found it so boring [laughs] to be there. It was just a bunch of sunburned people sitting around with brushes and dental picks, picking out little pot shards from the dirt. It just seemed like the most unimaginable tedium possible. And so there was always this disconnect in my mind between the big, important, cool things archaeology wrestled with and the day-to-day work of the field.

But experimental archaeology got me excited because again, they were doing things, they were making things: re-creating lost recipes, making ancient stone tools—everything from that up to, you know, people making giant catapults and boats and sending those off on the ocean. So it really got me excited 'cause you're much more active, and it's a very sensory-rich field, too. So I felt like it was a lot more immersive and it was more involved and kind of immersed in the past than you get from traditional archaeology.

Feltman: Hmm, and for people who aren't familiar with the idea of experimental archaeology, what are some of the projects from recent years that stand out in your mind as particularly exciting, that our listeners might wanna go learn more about?

Kean: Well, for the book I got to attend an authentic Roman banquet [laughs], which was pretty cool. I got to try my hand at ancient surgery and tattooing. There's a lot of food stuff out there; that's probably the best entrée for people wanting to get involved, is just try to make some ancient recipes—you know, some heirloom grains, things like that. I made a fish mummy at one point for the book, and that was surprisingly easy to do, so you can mummify a fish or, you know, another small animal, something like that.

So there's a lot of cool things to do, and it kind of runs the gamut, again, from everyday things like food and tools all the way up to catapults and boats and people—making human mummies, even stuff like that. So there's really a range of activities.

Feltman: Yeah, well, and I think even some folks who, you know, have maybe come across some of these projects, like people making perfume that smells like a mummy, might be surprised at how hands-on you were able to get in the book. Could you tell us some more about some of the things you were able to experience while you were researching?

Kean: Yeah, so, like, the catapult I got to see was pretty amazing. This guy made a 30-foot tall, medieval—authentic medieval catapult. And we spent a day out—he built this in Utah—we spent a day out there in the mountains, throwing these giant garden stones around at this wall that he had built that was 250 yards away, and it was pretty magical being out there and getting to see this thing fire—being able to fire it myself, actually. So that stands out as something. That, that was probably the most fun thing I did for the book, was [laughs] seeing that giant catapult.

Then there were some things, some days, that were really painful and awful. Like, the, the surgery that I mentioned that I did, it was a, a surgery called a trepanation, so you're removing a bit of the skull, essentially. And it's startling to think about, but this is one of the most ancient surgeries ...

Feltman: Mm.

Kean: That we know of. It's thousands and thousands of years old, and it involves, you know, kind of brain surgery, of all things. And we know that people survived it because we can see new bone growth around the rim of skulls that we found with holes in it, so we know that people survived this operation. And I tried it out not on a human, on a deer head, at a sort of a survivalist school, an experimental-archaeology school in Maine, and they made some stone tools for me, so I gotta try it, you know, pretty authentic. And the stone tools worked really well at first.

You can get a really, really sharp edge on a stone tool, and obsidian even—it's a type of volcanic rock—you can get a sharper edge on that than even modern surgical-steel scalpels ...

Feltman: Wow.

Kean: They form a really, really sharp edge. The problem with stone tools is that they wear down quickly ...

Feltman: Right.

Kean: And so after I made the first, initial cut—I was removing a triangular-shaped piece—after I, I made the initial cut, the one leg of the triangle, it went really well for the first cut, but after that the stone tool got worn down, and after that it was just a war of attrition ...

Feltman: Mm.

Kean: Of me sort of grinding my way through this skull. I was just sitting there—there were flies biting me; it was hot. I was really upset and getting frustrated. But that was a good learning experience in and of itself, just to show you what something basic like medicine was like back then.

And the emotions eventually became an important part of the process. Learning things like that, you know, you get frustrated, but it really stuck with me, and it made me appreciate just how difficult things were for our ancestors and made me appreciate the fact that they did all this work and we wouldn't be here if they hadn't.

Feltman: Yeah, did those hands-on experiences change your perspective of the past in any other ways, beyond just appreciating how difficult things were?

Kean: It made me appreciate how good some of the technology was.

Feltman: Mm.

Kean: I was surprised at how—yeah, that you can get stone tools that are very, very sharp, form a very nice edge. I think we have sort of a narrow view of technology nowadays. We think about electronic gizmos as technology; they're sort of synonymous, almost, in our minds. But they were really good about practical chemistry, everyday biology—you know, observing other creatures, observing plants, things like that. And I think we've lost some of that nowadays. So it did open my mind up and helped me appreciate the really nice technologies that people had in the past.

Feltman: And you mentioned in the book that experimental archaeology is sometimes dismissed as kind of, like, a showy form of theater more than a science. What would you argue is the scientific value of sort of actively re-creating the past?

Kean: There are some cases where we just don't have information about how people did things. So the best examples of that in the book are with Egyptian mummies and how they built the pyramids in Egypt. We just don't know how they did things, especially with the pyramids [laughs]; we have no idea how they did that, which is kind of embarrassing for archaeologists, that they don't know this, but we just don't have any information.

So by running these experiments you can learn things and you can rule some things out. So I think it's valuable 'cause it can actively teach us things about the past. And I think by doing certain things, even something basic like making bread or beer or something like that, you start to ask more questions and different questions, and it teaches you aspects of the process that you would not have thought to ask about otherwise.

And there were some cases in the book as well where—there was one instance with a chef and one instance with a, a hairdresser who got interested in Roman archaeology, and they read these papers by classicists, by historians, by archaeologists, and they, even within a few paragraphs, realized that [the authors] had no idea what they were talking about [laughs]: they didn't know how to cook properly; they didn't know how to style hair properly. And because [the chef and the hairdresser] had this outside expertise they could make a lot of progress. These people who didn't have the expertise were just theorizing without any real evidence or basis ...

Feltman: Mm.

Kean: For their conclusion. So it can help you avoid going down wrong paths, and in some cases it can answer questions or evoke questions that we just wouldn't ask otherwise.

Feltman: Yeah, very cool, and I mean, I'm sure this really runs the gamut, but in your experience who are the people who are creating these experiments? You know, how are they getting interested in these questions?

Kean: Yeah, it really does run the gamut. In some cases they are traditional professors or credentialed archaeologists who realize they couldn't answer the questions they wanted to if they didn't try some experiments out, so they just decided to try 'em out. And in some cases, I think, they wanted to connect with their area of study a little bit more. And again, it's such a sensory-rich field—you feel more immersed in the past when you do these kind of things—so it helped them have a deeper connection with their field.

Then there are amateurs, people who just got obsessed [laughs] with some topic—and amateurs in the best sense of the word, in that they just loved the topic and wanted to learn all they could about it. They're not getting paid to do it, but they have a deep knowledge of the field, and they just decided to try something new and different. So they are a part of the field as well.

And then another really important aspect is there's a lot of native and Indigenous communities who have either kept traditions alive or they're trying to revive traditions that got stamped out by colonialism, missionaries, whatever the case was. And in a lot of cases they're the ones going to the archaeologists and teaching them how things were based on either things they have kept alive or lore they might know.

So all of those groups are kind of working together, and I think that's part of the fun of the field, is that you can get insights from a lot of different people in a lot of different places. So it was fun to meet all of 'em.

Feltman: Did any of the experiments you participated in in the book change the way you do things in everyday life? Like, I don't know, for example, have you picked up some Roman culinary techniques [laughs] or anything of that nature?

Kean: One thing it did do: I sort of view the world itself a little differently in that ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Kean: Before I would walk down the street where I live in D.C., and there were a lot of trees in this neighborhood, but before to me it was just sort of this green canopy overhead; it was almost like decoration. And now I see it and I, I'm better about telling individual trees apart—you know, “This is this type of tree. This is this type of tree.” And I also look at the trees differently because I can see them as, you know, a resource: the wood that they have—the acorns that they have are a food source. So I look at things like that differently, and—even, like, rocks on the ground, I can look at those and say, “Oh, that'd be a good hammerstone for making tools,” or “That's a good type of rock to make a tool with.”

So I feel a little more connected in the sense that it's not just, again, decoration, it's more, you know, their resources, and I feel like I understand that aspect of nature better because of the experiences I had.

Feltman: And is there anything that you really wanted to try that you, you weren't able to?

Kean: I did get to do, in Micronesia, a little bit with navigation there. So I got to go out in a boat, and they taught me a few things about navigation. I would really love, at some point, to get way out into Polynesia, maybe, even and be on an authentic ship like they used thousands of years ago and just sort of set sail and, you know, head out for an island you can't see over the horizon and just navigate with all of the amazing tricks they knew about, you know, the stars but also looking at wave patterns, wind patterns, migration patterns of birds. So at some point I'd love to take a long ocean trip on one of those authentic ships.

Feltman: Very cool. Well, thank you so much for coming on to talk about the book. I'm sure our listeners will love it, so this has been great.

Kean: Well, thanks for having me.

The Internet Is Making Us Fluent in Algospeak

Algorithmic social media is driving the creation of new slang at a breakneck pace. Linguist Adam Aleksic, also known as the Etymology Nerd, explains how

By Allison Parshall edited by Jeanna Bryner

Every time a new slang word gets coined on the Internet, linguist Adam Aleksic is thrilled. “It's definitely good for me in that I stay in business,” says Aleksic, who studies the origins of words and the changes they undergo through time, particularly online. As the “Etymology Nerd,” Aleksic posts videos that document this ever changing language of Internet culture, including “brain rot memes” such as “Skibidi Toilet” and the mainstreaming of incel slang such as “blackpilled” and “looksmaxxing.”

Now, in his book Algospeak: How Social Media Is Transforming the Future of Language, Aleksic explores the forces shaping our language in the age of algorithmic-driven social media. “Algospeak” refers to the words used to get around censorship imposed by the algorithms that determine what ends up on our feeds—for example, “kill” has become “unalive” in many online (and even offline) spaces. You can see the impact of this algorithmic infrastructure in how many of these new linguistic trends follow similar patterns. “In many ways, [these are] the same patterns that humans have always relied on to communicate with one another but shaped uniquely by this new medium and its constraints and its advantages,” he explains.

Language changes can trigger cultural angst. Some of that could stem from fear of obsolescence. For instance, in talking to Aleksic, I learned that the word “bop” no longer means a catchy song in many mainstream parts of the Internet and has instead come to mean a promiscuous woman or OnlyFans creator. This filled me with an inexplicable dread. But linguistic change is inevitable, even if it is now happening at what feels like a breakneck pace. What should we make of it?

To try to wrap my head around this question, I spoke with Aleksic about the algorithmic forces shaping how we speak—some new and some as old as language itself.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

How would you describe your linguistic upbringing on the Internet? 

My first experience with the Internet was really Reddit. [During my] sophomore year of high school, I started this etymology blog, and I would post a word origin a day. And I stumbled on the subreddit r/etymology, and that was where I started dabbling and started posting on some other subreddits. I made maps and made infographics, and they would do well. That was my first experience learning how to go viral on the Internet.

I do remember early slang words and being fascinated by them. And this was all from Vine: “on fleek” or “bae” or “fam.” And there were the 4chan words bleeding into Reddit, words like “pilled” and “maxxing,” before it started really leaking to the mainstream.

My crucible was definitely Tumblr. A meme that started there was “the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell,” and I've become totally fascinated by it because I recently learned that Scientific American coined the metaphor in 1957. Why do you think that phrase became such a popular meme?

Well, there's a bunch of stock phrases that are humorous to people because of their overrepresentation in our culture. And [“the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell”] is funny because obviously it showed up in all these early documentaries, and we start making jokes parodying the fact that it's so present. Honestly, that's what brain rot is, too—right now there's “Dubai chocolate Labubu Crumbl cookie,” and that's funny because it's parroting these overrepresented things in our culture. With “mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell,” this was before we had the viral algorithmic feeds bringing us the same recommended content over and over again. So what would we parody? We'd parody mass culture, and we still are in many ways. That is a time-honored linguistic process.

In the case of “mitochondria is the power to the cell,” it's funny to us, [similar to other] stock phrases. I don't know if you ever took the FitnessGram PACER Test?

Absolutely, that was that miserable running test in gym class.

Exactly. Anybody growing up in our age group encountered that, and I've seen FitnessGram PACER Test memes on the Internet as well. And it seems niche, like this small detail from our childhoods, and yet it's calling back to this niche shared experience. Memes call attention to shared realities. They make you feel like you're part of an in-group. And at the end of the day, it's the feeling of being in a group that defines how we interact with each other as humans. It's calling attention to this very specific thing we all had together. The best parts of the Internet are when you feel that collective effervescence because that's what drives us as humans, this feeling of connection to other people.

Last year the Oxford English Dictionary's publisher Oxford University Press named “brain rot” its word of the year. In your book, you take some issue with the way people have come to talk about terms like “Skibidi Toilet,” “sigma” and “Rizzler” as if they are literally rotting our brain. Can you explain why you don't like that outlook?

I think it's very important to separate language and culture here. Words don't rot your brain. I think there's the inclination to cast other cultural concerns onto the words that are associated with cultural phenomena [we're worried about]. “Skibidi” is associated with the Skibidi Toilet YouTube short series, which is seen as brain rot because it plays into that idea of algorithmic feeds and shattered attention spans and declining literacy rates. And we take those negative feelings and cast those aspersions onto the idea of Skibidi Toilet, which alone, by itself, is a piece of cinema—it is! It's just what we culturally perceive as “high art versus low art.” Look at pop art: it plays with that boundary between what is low art and what is high art. I think if Andy Warhol were around today, he would be making Skibidi Toilet paintings.

But the image of a toilet is not neurologically bad for you any more than the word skibidi is bad for you. We have these other cultural concerns that we port over to this genre of comedy that we call brain rot, however. I think the Oxford English Dictionary, when they did the word of the year, got it mostly wrong—because, yes, “brain rot” does refer to this feeling of neurological damage caused by the Internet, but more people use it to describe this comedic meme, this aesthetic of nonsensical repetition, calling back to the idea of rotting your brain.

The conversation about algorithmic media and how good or bad it is for society is a separate and important conversation to have. But if I'm talking about language, I really want to try to separate that and say, “No, it's not wrong that your middle schooler is saying ‘skibidi.'”

One thing that really sticks out about the current age of the Internet is how fast words become popular and then fall out of favor—on the order of days and weeks instead of months. What do you think the consequences might be of this breakneck pace?

Linguistically, it is just really fun that we have new words, new ways for humans to express themselves. This is fun to study for me. Culturally, I am a little concerned—Harold Innis, in his book The Bias of Communication, [talks about] two types of communication, space-biased and time-biased. Time-biased will last longer across time, and space-biased will just take up a lot of space but turn over quickly. That's like a book versus a news cycle: A book will stay longer, but a news cycle will reach more people. Viral communication reaches a lot of people really quickly, but it doesn't last long, unlike an oral tradition.

These time-biased forms of media are ritualistic. They're meant to build community. The root of the word communication comes from the same root as community because building community was the original purpose. And I worry about the surplus of this space-biased communication, which is just filling up [space]—I mean the word “content” literally means something that just fills up space. I'm worried that that means we have less connection to one another, from a media studies and cultural theory angle.

You highlight the problem of online “context collapse,” in which posts escape their original context. The result is that we never know who we're talking to or who is talking to us. Can you talk a bit about how this ends up impacting language?

Context collapse means you perceive something in a new context, and you don't know where it came from originally. Practically, that means you lose the power that those words originally had. Let's look at African American English. A lot of words that we use today—slay, serve, queen, ate, yass, bet—came from the ballroom scene in New York City in the 1980s, which was this queer, Black, Latino space. [That physical space had] a regulatory function. If you were a white girl saying “slay” in the 1980s [in a ball house], people would look at you funny. Probably, you wouldn't have even been there.

But on social media, even if people feel like they're speaking to one audience, an algorithm is going to intercept that and distribute it to another audience because that'll make more money. And that's where the context collapses. Now you're a white girl looking at [a TikTok video of] a mother in a ball house saying the word “slay,” and you feel like, “Oh, this person is talking to me; it's on my For You page.” And then you now make a video saying “slay,” which is viewed by other white girls. Then nobody even knows that it came from the ballroom scene.

These algorithms shape so much of our lives in a way that is both thrilling and uncomfortable. How do you see people trying to resist or shape the influence of social media algorithms?

This is how most people are consuming information, and it's also the best way to reach people. Whether you're on social media or not, you're still in a café or a bar, and you hear a Sabrina Carpenter song that got popular because of [social media] algorithms. The language that you end up adopting, or that your kids end up adopting, is still going to be coming from [an online platform's] algorithm, whether you like it or not. You can't just bury your head in the sand and pretend it doesn't exist.

But also, it's valid to be upset about some of the things the algorithm is doing. It's valid to be concerned how these social media platforms are trying to commodify our attention so they can sell our data and sell us more ads. It's a human tendency to resist, to come up with creative [outlets] when things feel forced on us. You see that with how we avoid censorship online. You see that with how our meme genres like brain rot poke fun at algorithmic oversaturation. A lot of our expression is a subtle resistance because language is never just one thing at a time.

Reading your book, I felt like I swung back and forth between two emotions: immense fondness for Internet culture and the ways it allows human creativity to shine and immense discomfort and disdain with the algorithmic, profit-driven structure it exists within. How do you reconcile those feelings?

I think that's central to interacting with the Internet, right? It's the best way to be tapped into the culture, and I think it's our moral duty to responsibly interact with culture and be aware of how the algorithm [is] shaping us. So I think it's okay to interact with the algorithm responsibly. Yeah, I doomscroll a little bit, but then I set my own boundaries—I set my phone in another room when I go to bed, and I read a little bit. That's a really good boundary for me.

But I think, culturally, we're still going to be grappling with this for a while. [Science communicator] Hank Green put it well when he called this a “Gutenberg-level” shift. We are experiencing a revolution in the media we're consuming, and we don't even know [the answers to key questions]: How much should we be giving our kids technology? How much should we be interacting with technology? Should I get a dumb phone? Should I get a flip phone? Should I delete this app or go grayscale? We're all very much figuring that out. And technology is going to keep advancing, so we need to be extremely tapped into culture and into our own feelings and into the situation at large.

At the very least, I don't want to be caught off guard when my little cousin says the next version of “Skibidi Toilet.” I don't want to look not cool. 

Well, you're gonna look not cool no matter what!

This time and temperature keeps fabrics strong and prevents premature aging.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Scientists from the University of Leeds—and, it should be mentioned, Procter & Gamble—say the best way to keep clothes looking fresh for as long as possible is to use the coldest, shortest wash cycle. 

The detergent manufacturer joined with lead author and design school instructor Lucy Cotton (yes) on a study of the way machine washing causes fabrics to spray microfibers. These lost fibers can cause premature garment aging and weaken fabrics. 

In the published paper, researchers used dozens of t-shirts from a specific U.K. activewear seller representing a handful of brands like Gildan, Russell, and Hanes. Scientists ran washing machines empty at first to ensure no ridealong microfibers were inside, then collected water from the entire cycle to make sure all newly released microfibers were captured. 

The resulting wash water was evaporated, dried completely, and then weighed. The scientists measured dye hold and transfer using swatches of “receiver” fabric in each load, with their color gauged before and after the wash.

After a battery of tests with different colors and materials of t-shirts at different wash temperatures and cycle lengths, the results were clear. From the study:

The scientists also measured how much dye changed from darker colors to lighter ones, which is what leads to greying t-shirts and dimming of colors on bright prints, for example. 

When it came to microfibers, the same relationship bore out: higher temperature and longer time meant more microfibers, whether the fabric of the t-shirt was cotton or a polyester blend. And the release of these fibers never let up.

“What is also evidenced is that on the eighth and [16th] wash that significant numbers of microfibres are still being released from the fabrics, suggesting that there is a consistent mechanism of microfibre generation and release throughout the life of the fabrics,” the researchers wrote.

These researchers conclude that the best wash cycle is a modified Leviathan: gentler, colder, and shorter. By reducing time and temperature, they say, we can reduce the amount of microfiber pollution released into the general water cycle, the amount of waste soap, and the carbon footprint of our washer activity.  

Teaming with Procter & Gamble, which released its first cold-water detergent to much ballyhoo in 2005, is a canny financial move. P&G funded the research and added its two cents about its advanced detergents in the press release. But the research appears in Dyes & Pigments, a peer-reviewed journal, and constituted Cotton's Ph.D. project—regardless of the corporate cold water.

Wildfires, smog, pollen, pet dander, mold, and dust can all affect air quality. Here's how these appliances can help, plus info on what type is best for your home. 

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?



On average year-round, Americans spending roughly 90 percent of their time indoors, which causes the concentration of some pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels. As we head into colder weather, when windows and doors are closed more often and air stagnates, now is a good time to start thinking about your home's air quality. 

Your first line of defense should be an air purifier. These appliances cycle air through  filters to remove allergens, harmful particles, and even bacteria. Many of today's models use a range of technology to achieve cleaner air, from UV lights to carbon and activated charcoal. Regardless of the purification method, all have the same goal: to improve the quality of air year-round. 

In this guide, we'll dive into how air purifiers work, the different types of filters available, and how to find the right model based on in-depth research provided by expert sources and our own hands-on experience.  

Smog, pollen, pet dander, mold, cigarette smoke, and good old-fashioned dust all affect indoor quality, regardless of the season. In warmer months, allergens make their way into the house through open windows and your clothing, causing uncomfortable symptoms like itchy eyes or a scratchy throat. 

During the winter, when doors and windows are sealed to retain heat, allergens and pollutants become more concentrated. For people with asthma or emphysema, that poor indoor air quality can drastically affect their quality of life. Running an air purifier continuously provides consistent protection against certain sensitivities and allergens. 

The growing impact of climate change is making air purifiers an essential household appliance, too. Rising global temperatures are contributing to more frequent and widespread wildfires, which can affect the air quality even if you're far from the source. Plus, increased pollen count and ozone levels only exacerbate the problem. 

These environmental conditions can make indoor air hazardous, and since these occurrences are unpredictable, having an air purifier turned on year-round is a proactive way to safeguard your health.  

Portable air purifiers contain a fan that pulls in air from a room, and a filter that sifts through potentially harmful particles. That air is then circulated back into the room, and the process continues on a regular schedule. 

You likely already have a type of air purifier in your home through the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. But, these furnace and HVAC filters usually only work when the system is operating, and in order to get more filtration, it would have to run for longer periods of time. A dedicated air purifier that you can move from room to room could supplement your current air purification setup, and won't require as much electricity. 

It's important to note that no air purifier removes every single toxin or pollutant in your home. In order to maximize the efficiency of your air purifier or HVAC system, you'll need to take a close look at the filters. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) developed a testing method to determine the Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values, or MERVs, of different air filters. These values are based on the filter's ability to capture larger particles between 0.3 and 10 microns. The higher the rating, the more efficient.

CADR is a common rating you might find for portable air purifiers, and it references the clean air delivery rate. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, this number reflects how well the appliance filters particles in a certain area. It's measured in cubic feet per minute (cfm), and should equate to roughly two-thirds of the square footage of the room. Again, the higher the CADR, the more efficient the appliance is. Keep these ratings in mind while you shop for an air purifier, and consult the product packaging for specifics. 

The best portable air purifiers all work on the same principle, but vary in type and capacity. 

High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters can collect 99.97 percent of particles in the air, including pollen, dust, bacteria, and mold. HEPA filters are also found inside your home's HVAC system, and are the most popular air purifier choice.

This filterless option works by producing ions that attach to pollutants and fall to the floor or on top of surfaces, which can then be cleaned up. Based on findings by the EPA, they remove small particles but they are not effective at getting rid of pollen and other allergens.

Using activated charcoal or carbon, these air purifiers trap unwanted odors, air pollutants, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They work especially well at removing smoke, odors, and gasses, and are usually used in conjunction with a HEPA filter.

This option uses UV light to neutralize viruses, bacteria, and mold spores found in the air. These types of air purifiers are best used in offices or homes where germ control is the focus, but they aren't very effective at trapping allergens, dust, or pollutants.  

To select the best air purifier for your home, we suggest considering the following:

Choose an air purifier that's the right size for your space. Coverage differs from unit to unit, so it's vital that your air purifier is powerful enough to clean the volume of air in the space. Make sure the CADR aligns with the square footage of the room the air purifier is in. 

Think about the type of filter you want.  If allergens are the main concern, find an air purifier with a HEPA filter. If you're tired of dealing with the smell of lingering cooking smoke, look for an absorbent air cleaner. Some air purifiers might use a combination of filters to target irritants ranging in particle size, which might be helpful if you're dealing with different types of allergens,

Consider the cost of replacement filters. Depending on the type of air purifier you have, replacement filters can cost anywhere from $25 to $50 or more. They also have to be changed on a semi-regular basis, which starts to add up when you're running the unit 24/7. Consider using an air purifier with washable or reusable filters to extend their lifespan.

Like many other household appliances, air purifiers can be noisy. Air purifiers are similar to air conditioners, dehumidifiers, and fans, particularly when you're talking about noise. Don't be fooled: Sometimes manufacturers list the noise level (dB) of the lowest setting and you need to read the fine print to figure out how loud the appliance is on high. Most air purifiers average 55dB on the highest setting, which is louder than a typical refrigerator and can be disruptive. Some models might offer a ""sleep mode,""  which lowers the fan speed and noise level overnight. 

Find a model that's energy efficient to save cash. Look for a blue-and-white sticker on your appliance. Air purifiers with this emblem are Energy Star-certified and use significantly less electricity than their competitors, based on strict standards set by the EPA and DOE. 

Additional features can be useful. Some air purifiers come with other perks like air quality monitors, change filter indicator lights, and smart technology. These can make the air purification process more automated and easier to maintain.

'Float rocks,' sand ripples, and vast distances are among the sights to see in the latest high-resolution panorama by the six-wheeled scientist.

The imaging team of NASA's Perseverance Mars rover took advantage of clear skies on the Red Planet to capture one of the sharpest panoramas of its mission so far. Visible in the mosaic, which was stitched together from 96 images taken at a location the science team calls ""Falbreen,"" are a rock that appears to lie on top of a sand ripple, a boundary line between two geologic units, and hills as distant as 40 miles (65 kilometers) away. The enhanced-color version shows the Martian sky to be remarkably clear and deceptively blue, while in the natural-color version, it's reddish.

""Our bold push for human space exploration will send astronauts back to the Moon,"" said Sean Duffy, acting NASA administrator. ""Stunning vistas like that of Falbreen, captured by our Perseverance rover, are just a glimpse of what we'll soon witness with our own eyes. NASA's groundbreaking missions, starting with Artemis, will propel our unstoppable journey to take human space exploration to the Martian surface. NASA is continuing to get bolder and stronger.""

The rover's Mastcam-Z instrument captured the images on May 26, 2025, the 1,516th Martian day, or sol, of Perseverance's mission, which began in February 2021 on the floor of Jezero Crater. Perseverance reached the top of the crater rim late last year.

""The relatively dust-free skies provide a clear view of the surrounding terrain,"" said Jim Bell, Mastcam-Z's principal investigator at Arizona State University in Tempe. ""And in this particular mosaic, we have enhanced the color contrast, which accentuates the differences in the terrain and sky.""

Buoyant Boulder

One detail that caught the science team's attention is a large rock that appears to sit atop a dark, crescent-shaped sand ripple to the right of the mosaic's center, about 14 feet (4.4 meters) from the rover. Geologists call this type of rock a ""float rock"" because it was more than likely formed someplace else and transported to its current location. Whether this one arrived by a landslide, water, or wind is unknown, but the science team suspects it got here before the sand ripple formed.

The bright white circle just left of center and near the bottom of the image is an abrasion patch. This is the 43rd rock Perseverance has abraded since it landed on Mars. Two inches (5 centimeters) wide, the shallow patch is made with the rover's drill and enables the science team to see what's beneath the weathered, dusty surface of a rock before deciding to drill a core sample that would be stored in one of the mission's titanium sample tubes.

The rover made this abrasion on May 22 and performed proximity science (a detailed analysis of Martian rocks and soil) with its arm-mounted instruments two days later. The science team wanted to learn about Falbreen because it's situated within what may be some of the oldest terrain Perseverance has ever explored -- perhaps even older than Jezero Crater.

Tracks from the rover's journey to the location can be seen toward the mosaic's right edge. About 300 feet (90 meters) away, they veer to the left, disappearing from sight at a previous geologic stop the science team calls ""Kenmore.""

A little more than halfway up the mosaic, sweeping from one edge to the other, is the transition from lighter-toned to darker-toned rocks. This is the boundary line, or contact, between two geologic units. The flat, lighter-colored rocks nearer to the rover are rich in the mineral olivine, while the darker rocks farther away are believed to be much older clay-bearing rocks.

This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope Picture of the Week zooms in on the feathery spiral arms of the galaxy NGC 45, which lies just 22 million light-years away in the constellation Cetus (The Whale).

The data used to create this portrait were drawn from two complementary observing programs. The first took a broad view of 50 nearby galaxies, leveraging Hubble's ability to observe light from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared in order to study star formation in these galaxies. The second program examined many of the same nearby galaxies as the first, narrowing in on a particular wavelength of red light called H-alpha. Star-forming nebulae are powerful producers of H-alpha light, and several of these regions can be identified across NGC 45 by their bright pink-red color.

These observing programs aimed to study star formation in galaxies of different sizes, structures, and degrees of isolation -- and NGC 45 makes for a particularly interesting target. Though it may appear to be a regular spiral galaxy, NGC 45 is actually a remarkable type called a low surface brightness galaxy.

Low surface brightness galaxies are fainter than the night sky itself, making them incredibly difficult to detect. They appear unexpectedly faint because they have relatively few stars for the amount of gas and dark matter they carry. In the decades since the first low surface brightness galaxy was serendipitously discovered in 1986, researchers have learned that 30-60% of all galaxies may fall into this category. Studying these hard-to-detect galaxies is key to understanding how galaxies form and evolve, and Hubble's sensitive instruments are equal to the task.

In 2024, NASA's Mars rover Perseverance collected an unusual rock sample. The rock, named Sapphire Canyon, features white, leopardlike spots with black borders within a red mudstone and might hold clues about sources of organic molecules within Mars.

Here on Earth, in Review of Scientific Instruments, by AIP Publishing, researchers from Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology used a technique called optical photothermal infrared spectroscopy (O-PTIR) to study a visually similar rock. They wanted to determine if O-PTIR can be applied to the Sapphire Canyon sample when it is eventually brought here for study.

O-PTIR uses two lasers to study a material: The first heats up the material and causes small thermal vibrations on its surface proportional to the laser's wavelength, and the second measures the extent of these changes. Together, this creates the material's unique chemical fingerprint.

The researchers tested O-PTIR on a basalt rock with dark inclusions of similar size to the Sapphire Canyon sample's -- which, in contrast to Perseverance's sophisticated sample selection process, author Nicholas Heinz found purely by coincidence.

""I was hiking in Arizona, in Sedona, when I saw this rock that just didn't look like it belonged,"" he said. ""I put it in my backpack and brought it back to look at.""

They aimed to see if O-PTIR could differentiate between the rock's primary material and its dark inclusions and found it was extremely effective because of the enhanced spatial resolution of O-PTIR. Moreover, O-PTIR is a rapid technique. Each spectrum can be collected in minutes, allowing scientists to go in with a more sensitive technique to study potential areas of interest identified in more detail, such as regions containing organics.

""I hope this capability will be considered for any future material returned from Mars, an asteroid, or any other planetary surface,"" said Heinz.

The team's O-PTIR capabilities are the only of their kind available at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and have already been used by other NASA missions -- in 2024, they helped confirm the cleanliness of Europa Clipper, a mission to study one of Jupiter's moons, prior to its launch. Heinz said that now that they've shown its additional benefits in applications related to Mars samples, and geology more widely, they are working with NASA's Mars science team to test the algal microfossils typically used as Mars analogs for the rovers.

Quantum dots - semiconductor nanostructures that can emit single photons on demand - are considered among the most promising sources for photonic quantum computing. However, every quantum dot is slightly different and may emit a slightly different color. This means that, to produce multi-photon states we cannot use multiple quantum dots. Usually, researchers use a single quantum dot and multiplex the emission into different spatial and temporal modes, using a fast electro-optic modulator. Now here comes the technological challenge: faster electro-optic modulators are expensive and often require very customized engineering. To add to that, it may not be very efficient, which introduces unwanted losses in the system.

The international research team, led by Vikas Remesh from the Photonics Group at the Department of Experimental Physics of the University of Innsbruck and involving researchers from the University of Cambridge, Johannes Kepler University Linz, and other institutions, has now demonstrated an elegant solution that sidesteps these limitations. Their approach uses a purely optical technique called stimulated two-photon excitation to generate streams of photons in different polarization states directly from a quantum dot without requiring any active switching components. The team demonstrated their technique by generating high-quality two-photon states with excellent single-photon properties.

""The method works by first exciting the quantum dot with precisely timed laser pulses to create a biexciton state, followed by polarization-controlled stimulation pulses that deterministically trigger photon emission in the desired polarization,"" explain Yusuf Karli and Iker Avila Arenas, the study's first authors. ""It was a fantastic experience for me to work in the photonics group for my master's thesis, remembers Iker Avila Arenas, who was part of 2022-2024 cohort of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's program in Photonics for Security Reliability and Safety and spent 6 months in Innsbruck.

""What makes this approach particularly elegant is that we have moved the complexity from expensive, loss-inducing electronic components after the single photon emission to the optical excitation stage, and it is a significant step forward in making quantum dot sources more practical for real-world applications,"" notes Vikas Remesh, the study's lead researcher. Looking ahead, the researchers envision extending the technique to generate photons with arbitrary linear polarization states using specially engineered quantum dots.

""The study has immediate applications in secure quantum key distribution protocols, where multiple independent photon streams can enable simultaneous secure communication with different parties, and in multi-photon interference experiments which are very important to test even the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics,"" explains Gregor Weihs, head of the photonics research group in Innsbruck.

The research, published in npj Quantum Information, represents a collaborative effort involving expertise in quantum optics, semiconductor physics, and photonic engineering. The work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), and the European Union's research programs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","NASA's Curiosity Mars rover just learned how to multitask","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250814081825.htm","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 02:53:45 GMT","

New capabilities allow the rover to do science with less energy from its batteries.

Thirteen years since Curiosity landed on Mars, engineers are finding ways to make the NASA rover even more productive. The six-wheeled robot has been given more autonomy and the ability to multitask -- improvements designed to make the most of Curiosity's energy source, a multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG). Increased efficiency means the rover has ample power as it continues to decipher how the ancient Martian climate changed, transforming a world of lakes and rivers into the chilly desert it is today.

Curiosity recently rolled into a region filled with boxwork formations. These hardened ridges are believed to have been created by underground water billions of years ago. Stretching for miles on this part of Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) mountain, the formations might reveal whether microbial life could have survived in the Martian subsurface eons ago, extending the period of habitability farther into when the planet was drying out.

Carrying out this detective work involves a lot of energy. Besides driving and extending a robotic arm to study rocks and cliffsides, Curiosity has a radio, cameras, and 10 science instruments that all need power. So do the multiple heaters that keep electronics, mechanical parts, and instruments operating at their best. Past missions like the Spirit and Opportunity rovers and the InSight lander relied on solar panels to recharge their batteries, but that technology always runs the risk of not receiving enough sunlight to provide power.

Instead, Curiosity and its younger sibling Perseverance each use their MMRTG nuclear power source, which relies on decaying plutonium pellets to create energy and recharge the rover's batteries. Providing ample power for the rovers' many science instruments, MMRTGs are known for their longevity (the twin Voyager spacecraft have relied on RTGs since 1977). But as the plutonium decays over time, it takes longer to recharge Curiosity's batteries, leaving less energy for science each day.

The team carefully manages the rover's daily power budget, factoring in every device that draws on the batteries. While these components were all tested extensively before launch, they are part of complex systems that reveal their quirks only after years in the extreme Martian environment. Dust, radiation, and sharp temperature swings bring out edge cases that engineers couldn't have expected.

""We were more like cautious parents earlier in the mission,"" said Reidar Larsen of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which built and operates the rover. Larsen led a group of engineers who developed the new capabilities. ""It's as if our teenage rover is maturing, and we're trusting it to take on more responsibility. As a kid, you might do one thing at a time, but as you become an adult, you learn to multitask.""

More Efficient Science

Generally, JPL engineers send Curiosity a list of tasks to complete one by one before the rover ends its day with a nap to recharge. In 2021, the team began studying whether two or three rover tasks could be safely combined, reducing the amount of time Curiosity is active.

For example, Curiosity's radio regularly sends data and images to a passing orbiter, which relays them to Earth. Could the rover talk to an orbiter while driving, moving its robotic arm, or snapping images? Consolidating tasks could shorten each day's plan, requiring less time with heaters on and instruments in a ready-to-use state, reducing the energy used. Testing showed Curiosity safely could, and all of these have now been successfully demonstrated on Mars.

Another trick involves letting Curiosity decide to nap if it finishes its tasks early. Engineers always pad their estimates for how long a day's activity will take just in case hiccups arise. Now, if Curiosity completes those activities ahead of the time allotted, it will go to sleep early.

By letting the rover manage when it naps, there is less recharging to do before the next day's plan. Even actions that trim just 10 or 20 minutes from a single activity add up over the long haul, maximizing the life of the MMRTG for more science and exploration down the road.

Miles to Go

In fact, the team has been implementing other new capabilities on Curiosity for years. Several mechanical issues required a rework of how the robotic arm's rock-pulverizing drill collects samples, and driving capabilities have been enhanced with software updates. When a color filter wheel stopped turning on one of the two cameras mounted on Mastcam, Curiosity's swiveling ""head,"" the team developed a workaround allowing them to capture the same beautiful panoramas.

JPL also developed an algorithm to reduce wear on Curiosity's rock-battered wheels. And while engineers closely monitor any new damage, they aren't worried: After 22 miles (35 kilometers) and extensive research, it's clear that, despite some punctures, the wheels have years' worth of travel in them. (And in a worst-case scenario, Curiosity could remove the damaged part of the wheel's ""tread"" and still drive on the remaining part.)

Together, these measures are doing their job to keep Curiosity as busy as ever.

Weaver ants have solved a problem that has plagued human teams for centuries: individuals contribute less to tasks when more people join in. New research published in Current Biology on August 12 shows individual weaver ants instead get stronger as their group grows.

""Each individual ant almost doubled their pulling force as team size increased - they actually get better at working together as the group gets bigger,"" says lead author Madelyne Stewardson from Macquarie University.

The longstanding problem in human teams was first published by French engineer Max Ringelmann in 1913 who measured students pulling on ropes and found that while total force increased as more people joined in, each individual's contribution actually decreased.

The study shows weaver ants form super-efficient teams in which individuals actually increase their contributions as teams grow bigger, defying the declining performance affecting human teams.

These tiny, tree-dwelling ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) found in tropical Africa, Asia and Australia, are known for their nest-building behaviors, forming living chains to roll leaves and glue them with silk from their larvae.

Stewardson and behavioral ecologist Dr Chris Reid from Macquarie's School of Natural Sciences worked with an international team to measure the force different sized ant teams could apply while building nests.

The researchers set up experiments enticing weaver ant colonies to form pulling chains to move an artificial leaf connected to a force meter.

""The ants split their work into two jobs: some actively pull while others act like anchors to store that pulling force,"" says Stewardson.

How the ant team makes it work

Co-lead author Dr Daniele Carlesso from the University of Konstanz developed a theory called the 'force ratchet' to explain this mechanism.

""Ants at the back of chains stretch out their bodies to resist and store the pulling force, while ants at the front keep actively pulling,"" says Dr Carlesso.

Dr David Labonte from Imperial College London, co-author on the paper, says the team found this method was key to increasing the contribution per individual as the team got bigger.

""Longer chains of ants have more grip on the ground than single ants, so they can better resist the force of the leaf pulling back,"" he says.

Dr Reid says the discovery could help scientists design better robot teams. Current robots only output the same force when working in teams as when alone.

""Programming robots to adopt ant-inspired cooperative strategies could allow teams of autonomous robots to work together more efficiently,"" says Dr Reid.

To help manage agricultural practices with fewer or no pesticides, University of Michigan researchers say they need to understand how ecological systems work on agricultural lands.

Now, U-M researchers John Vandermeer and Ivette Perfecto have used two ecological theories to describe a tangle of interactions between three ant species and a recently introduced fly that preys on one of the ant species. Their work on a coffee farm in Puerto Rico shows that the interaction between the ants and the predator fly creates chaotic patterns -- chaos in the classical sense, in that natural populations are subjected to fluctuations depending on the interactions of organisms within a system.

These chaotic patterns mean that any one of the four insect species could be dominant at any point in time. Understanding which ants may be dominant over time may help farmers use the ants to manage pests on their farms. Their study, supported by the National Science Foundation, is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

""Two of the three ant species we studied are really important agents of biological control of two of the important pests in coffee,"" said Vandermeer, U-M professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. ""We would like, or a farmer would like, to be able to predict when the ants are going to be there, and when they're not going to be there. And it turns out that that kind of prediction is going to be pretty difficult.""

For three decades, Vandermeer and Perfecto, a professor at the U-M School for Environment and Sustainability, have been studying ant interactions in the coffee farm's agricultural setting. Their goal is to help transform how agriculture is done -- but to do so, we need to first understand the ecology of agricultural systems, they say.

""We believe that the current international agricultural system with its use of pesticides and chemicals is not contributing to the welfare of anybody, especially the farmers, and is actually contributing quite a bit to global climate change,"" Vandermeer said. ""We take the position that in order to incorporate the rules of ecology into the development of new forms of agriculture, we need to understand what those rules are and how those rules work.""

In the tropics, ants are dominant, Vandermeer says, and often involved in agriculture as agents of controlling pests. But using an ant species to control pests can be complicated: The dominance of the ant being used as a biological control depends on what other species of ants -- as well as other types of insects -- there are in the system.

In this system, Vandermeer and Perfecto examined two types of ecological behavior: intransitive loop cyclic behavior and predator-mediated coexistence. Intransitive loop cyclic behavior means that if there's a group of three ant species, Ant A might be dominant over Ant B, Ant B might dominate Ant C, but Ant C could dominate Ant A.

When a predator is thrown into the mix, these dynamics become even more complicated. Among the three species of ants that Vandermeer and Perfecto study, one species is dominant. But the recently introduced fly preys upon the dominant ant. This predator-prey relationship not only affects the dominant ant, it has downstream effects on the other two ant species, allowing any of the four species to become the dominant species at different points of time. This is an example of predator-mediated coexistence.

The waxing and waning of the predator fly and its ant target, as well as the change of dominance in the ant species, are called oscillations. By overlapping and modeling these two oscillating ecological principles, the researchers could examine how the principles introduce chaos into the system.

The results are ... chaotic. But by plotting both of these oscillating behaviors, the researchers were able to see that at certain times, the whole system looked like a predator-prey cycle, and at other times, the system looked like an intransitive loop oscillation.

This could mean -- in theory -- the researchers could get a window into when each insect species was going to be the dominant species.

""The good news is that the chaotic patterns of the insects are really very interesting from an inherent intellectual sense. The bad news is that it's not really as simple as it might seem to base agricultural practices on ecological principles because the ecological principles themselves are way more complicated than simply finding a poison that kills the pests,"" Vandermeer said.

""What we're uncovering, we think, over the past 30 years or so are some of those complications that come out if you're serious about putting ecology into the fundamental operations of the agricultural system.""

The RNA medicine revolution has been spurred by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The effectiveness of an LNP is determined by its lipid components and their ratios; however, experimental optimization is laborious and does not explore the full design space. Computational approaches such as deep learning can be greatly beneficial, but the composite nature of LNPs limits the effectiveness of existing single molecule-based algorithms to LNPs. Addressing this, our approach integrates the multi-component and multimodal features of composite formulations such as LNPs to predict their performance in an end-to-end manner. Here we generate one of the largest LNP datasets (LANCE) by varying LNP formulations to train our deep learning model, COMET. This transformer-based neural network not only accurately predicts the efficacy of LNPs but is adaptable to non-canonical LNP formulations such as those with two ionizable lipids and polymeric materials. Furthermore, COMET can predict LNP performance in a cell line outside of LANCE and predict LNP stability during lyophilization using only small training datasets. Experimental validation showed that our approach can identify LNPs that exhibit strong protein expression in vitro and in vivo, promising accelerated development of nucleic acid therapies with extensive potential across therapeutic and manufacturing applications.

For clinical1, logistical2 and translational3 success, most drug substances are formulated into drug products with multiple ingredients. Our analysis shows that, on average, eight excipients are present in commercial products4. Given choices of ingredients and their ratios, formulation design presents a vast search space. While high-throughput approaches exist5,6,7,8, they become intractable with increasing formulation complexity.

Deep learning, a branch of machine learning suited for multifactorial data, can help address this challenge. Although widely used in drug discovery and materials science9,10,11, its application to multi-component drug products is limited. We apply deep learning to RNA-based lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), a promising class of drug products12,13,14, underscored by the success of SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccines15,16,17,18. LNPs comprise four lipid classes, each crucial for cytosolic RNA delivery12,14,19. Their function depends on lipid structures and ratios20,21,22, with composition requiring re-optimization per application1,23.

Given these challenges, early efforts applying machine learning to drug delivery have emerged, including recent work from our group24 and others25. As lipid chemical structure has a major impact on transfection, a line of modelling approaches focus primarily on individual molecules25,26. These approaches have been remarkably successful in identifying new lipids and chemical substructures, which would otherwise not be expected to produce high transfection efficacy26. Some models rely on manually selected features such as physicochemical properties26,27,28,29. These face limitations: restricted LNP scope, underuse of raw data, synthetic feasibility constraints and lack of formulation composition insights. To unlock deep learning's full utility for LNP design, a model must represent complete formulations and generalize across predictive scenarios.

We introduce the Composite Material Transformer (COMET), which encodes molecular structures, molar percentages and synthesis parameters in a transformer-based architecture. COMET is trained on the Lipid–RNA Nanoparticle Composition and Efficacy (LANCE) dataset of over 3,000 LNPs, including those with dual-ionizable lipids. COMET accurately predicted excluded samples and, via in silico screening of 50 million virtual LNPs, identified top candidates with high in vitro and in vivo expression. Unlike lipid-focused models, COMET showed versatility with polymeric materials, predicting efficacy from limited data. Using two smaller datasets (~10% of LANCE)—one in a gastrointestinal cell line, another post-lyophilization—we demonstrate COMET's robust adaptability. With its flexibility and broad utility, COMET promises to accelerate complex drug product development.

Composite materials such as LNPs comprise multiple components defined by the identity of constituent compounds, their relative ratios and formulation parameters such as nitrogen-to-phosphate (N/P) and mixing ratio (Fig. 1a). Previous studies often focused on a single component (for example, ionizable lipid)25; by contrast, we developed COMET to holistically represent LNPs and predict their efficacy via a flexible neural architecture (Fig. 1b). Lipid structures are encoded into molecular embeddings, while molar percentages are transformed into composition embeddings. These are concatenated to represent each lipid. Formulation-wide features, such as N/P and phase mixing ratios, are also embedded and fed into the model (Methods).

a, LNPs are synthesized by mixing nucleic acid (for example, mRNA) with a lipid solution typically composed of four lipid classes. Key properties, such as efficacy, depend not only on the lipids' structure but also on their relative ratios and other mixing parameters (for example, N/P and aqueous/organic ratio). b, COMET can predict properties of composite materials such as LNPs from their components, compositions and other parameters. c, With high-throughput screening, COMET's training data are made up of four parts, each spanning a complementary LNP formulation space. d, Thirteen lipid molar ratios used in the majority of the LNP training dataset. Created with BioRender.com.

COMET adopts a transformer design similar to language models such as ChatGPT30,31, where chemical components and formulation features act as discrete tokens. It accommodates arbitrary numbers of components, including dual-ionizable lipid formulations. An LNP-level Classify ([CLS]) token attends to component and formulation vectors via self-attention32, with the final prediction made through a task-specific prediction head. For multitask learning, distinct CLS tokens and heads are used per task to capture differences across cell types while sharing model knowledge.

To train COMET, we use a pairwise ranking objective that learns to rank LNPs by efficacy (Methods). Noise augmentation improves robustness against experimental noise, and a label margin captures efficacy differences. In multitask settings, CAGrad helps align gradients across tasks33. We further enhance performance with an ensemble of COMET models, especially beneficial in low-data regimes34,35.

To train COMET, we developed a high-throughput pipeline to generate the LANCE dataset. Each LNP in this dataset encapsulated a firefly luciferase (FLuc) messenger RNA (mRNA), and transfection efficacy was quantified by bioluminescence readouts. The LNPs were synthesized using automated fluid handling and tested in vitro. The LANCE dataset spans a wide design space structured in four parts: lipid identities (parts 1 and 2), synthesis parameters such as N/P and aqueous/organic mixing ratio (part 3), and lipid molar percentages (part 4) (Fig. 1c). Thirteen distinct molar ratios were used (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 13), generating over 6,000 labelled data points, including 3,028 LNPs evaluated in mouse DC2.4 and B16-F10 cells. Bioluminescence values were log-transformed and normalized between 0 and 1. Full methodological details are in Methods.

In DC2.4 cells, LNPs with CKK-E12 or C12-200 as ionizable lipids outperformed those with DLin-MC3-DMA (Fig. 2a). Helper lipids (for example, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE)), sterols (cholesterol/beta-sitosterol) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids (C14-PEG) also had substantial effects on efficacy. Hence, the LANCE dataset successfully captured these previous observations12,20,36,37. Molar ratios had notable but formulation-specific effects on efficacy; no single ratio consistently outperformed across all lipid combinations. This highlights the need for context-specific optimization. Altering aqueous/organic phase ratios from 3:1 to 1:1 affected efficacy in helper-lipid-rich LNPs (Fig. 2b), although the effect diminished at lower helper lipid content (Fig. 2c) and was negligible for 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-based formulations. The N/P ratio, by contrast, showed no clear efficacy association (Fig. 2d). We further evaluated five-component formulations by adding a second ionizable lipid (3:2 ratio) alongside DOPE, cholesterol and C14-PEG. Potent ionizable lipids such as CKK-E12 and C12-200 enhanced weak lipids such as L319 or DLin-MC3-DMA (Fig. 2e). Notably, CKK-E12/L319 combinations outperformed both CKK-E12-only and dual-strong-lipid pairings, particularly at 25% total ionizable lipid content.

Cross-cell line comparison of DC2.4 and B16-F10 results revealed 772 formulations that were in the top 30th percentile in both (Fig. 2f), commonly containing C12-200, DOPE, cholesterol and C14-PEG. Formulations with selective activity were also identified: SM102 appeared frequently in DC2.4-high but B16-F10-low cases, while DC-cholesterol was enriched in the opposite group. In summary, transfection efficacy is governed not only by lipid identities but also by molar ratios and synthesis conditions—motivating the need for models such as COMET that can integrate and learn from multifactorial design spaces.

We evaluated COMET on a random 20% test split of LNPs, with 10% used for validation and the remaining 70% for training. When trained to predict DC2.4 efficacy, COMET accurately ranked the test samples, achieving a Spearman coefficient of 0.873 and a Pearson coefficient of 0.866 (Fig. 3a). To simulate a more realistic drug discovery scenario, we curated a ‘hits-test' split where the top 10% of DC2.4 LNPs were withheld as ‘hits', alongside a random 10% of ‘non-hits'. COMET retained strong predictive power, yielding a Spearman coefficient of 0.725 and a Pearson coefficient of 0.820 (Fig. 3a). Its ability to classify ‘hits' into the top half of ranked predictions reached 79.6% accuracy.

Twenty replicates of training run with different random seeds were used for evaluation in a–c. Four technical replicates were used for e–l. Error bars are s.e.m.

In a multitask learning set-up using both DC2.4 and B16-F10 labels, COMET's performance improved on the DC2.4 test set, achieving a Spearman of 0.762 and a Pearson of 0.860 (pairwise ranking objective + multitask) model; Supplementary Fig. 1). These improvements scaled with the size of the additional B16-F10 data (Supplementary Fig. 2), highlighting the benefit of shared representation learning across related tasks38. We performed ablation studies to understand the contribution of each modelling component. Replacing the pairwise ranking objective with a regression objective slightly reduced performance (Fig. 3b,c). Model enhancements—ensemble learning, noise augmentation, label margin and CAGrad regularization—each contributed to performance gains, with ensembling having the greatest effect (Fig. 3b,c). Gains from ensembling plateaued beyond five models (Supplementary Fig. 3), and so we used an ensemble of five COMETs for all in silico screening.

To probe whether COMET learns meaningful structure–activity relationships, we performed adversarial perturbations. When lipid identities in training samples were partially shuffled, model performance degraded monotonically (Supplementary Fig. 4). More aggressive shuffling across lipid classes led to a further drop, and corrupting additional formulation parameters (for example, N/P ratio, molar % and phase ratios) impaired performance even more (Supplementary Fig. 5). COMET's generalizability was tested by excluding LNPs containing selected ionizable lipids (MC3, SM-102 and CKK-E12) and a sterol (beta-sitosterol) from training. The model maintained good performance on this chemically distinct test set, with Pearson/Spearman correlations of 0.779/0.776 for DC2.4 and 0.502/0.509 for B16-F10 efficacy prediction (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b).

Lastly, we compared COMET against simpler baselines. Both random forest and COMET outperformed k-nearest neighbours, with COMET's single-model performance comparable to random forest (Supplementary Fig. 7). An ensemble of COMETs offered improved correlation metrics for both cell lines, although top 50% classification accuracy remained similar to that of random forest.

To determine whether COMET learns transfection efficacy rather than proxying classic LNP properties, we analysed correlations between COMET predictions and nanoparticle characteristics such as encapsulation efficiency, size, polydispersity and zeta potential. COMET's predictions were only weakly correlated with these properties—except for particle size (correlation 0.6530)—but were highly correlated with actual transfection data (>0.95; Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). This confirms that COMET predicts efficacy itself, not just physical proxies.

To evaluate COMET's ability to discover effective formulations beyond LANCE, we screened a virtual library of nearly 50 million LNPs and validated selected in silico ‘hits' experimentally (Fig. 3). Exploratory hits were chosen by excluding LNPs similar to top-performing LANCE formulations and then selecting chemically diverse candidates predicted by COMET to be highly efficacious (Methods, Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 10).

All exploratory hits outperformed clinically approved LNPs39 (SM-102 (ref. 15), ALC-0315 (ref. 16) and DLin-MC3-DMA40) in both DC2.4 and B16-F10 cells (Fig. 3e,f). The top DC2.4 exploratory hit matched two of three top LANCE hits (Supplementary Fig. 11), while the best B16-F10 exploratory hit exceeded all three LANCE hits tested (Supplementary Fig. 12).

We next evaluated COMET's ability to refine existing leads. Around selected LANCE hits, virtual candidates were generated by modifying lipid ratios, substituting components or changing N/P ratios (Methods and Fig. 3d). In DC2.4, COMET identified optimized formulations outperforming their parent in two of three cases (Fig. 3g–i); in B16-F10, all three optimized LNPs outperformed their respective parents (Fig. 3j–l).

To assess COMET's adaptability beyond lipids, we extended it to branched poly(beta-amino esters) (PBAEs)3,41 (Fig. 4a), a class of polymers. A dataset of 454 polymer–LNPs (13 unique PBAEs) was added to LANCE. Each PBAE was represented by its diacrylate–amine unit and branching agent (Methods and Fig. 4b). In the ‘hits-test' setting, COMET achieved Spearman coefficients of 0.767 (DC2.4) and 0.756 (B16-F10) (Fig. 4c,d). Notably, PBAE LNPs represented only 13% of the training data.

Statistical significances in f–i were determined using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test. Statistical significances in j, k, n and o were determined using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett test. Statistics in l and m were determined using unpaired two-tailed t-test. Panels a and b created with BioRender.com.

Even when trained on just 17 PBAE LNPs plus LANCE data, COMET achieved a mean Spearman of 0.660 across both cell types, improving to 0.824 with the full 352-sample PBAE set (Fig. 4e). We selected top-performing PBAE LNPs for further optimization using COMET (Methods). Optimized candidates showed higher efficacy than their parent formulations in both DC2.4 cases (Fig. 4f,g) and in one B16-F10 case (Fig. 4h,i).

To evaluate its capability to adapt to a new cell type, COMET was tested on a dataset of 295 LNPs screened in human Caco-2 cells. Activity poorly correlated with mouse cells (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicating a need for learning-based formulation strategies to quickly identify new formulations that are optimal for new settings. COMET trained on Caco-2 data achieved a Spearman coefficient of 0.639, which improved to 0.713 with LANCE multitask training, and to 0.794 (Pearson 0.806) using a five-model ensemble (Fig. 4j,k).

We further tested COMET on HepG2 cells transfected with interleukin (IL)-15 mRNA using 98 LNPs. With multitask ensemble training, we observed strong predictions (Pearson 0.709 and Spearman 0.775; Fig. 4l,m). Additional LANCE data did not improve single-model accuracy (Supplementary Fig. 16) but enhanced ensemble performance (Fig. 4l,m), likely owing to increased diversity among the COMET models when trained with additional LANCE data.

To address the instability of LNPs at ambient temperatures, we trained COMET to predict efficacy loss post-lyophilization (Methods). We synthesized 168 LNPs with variable lipids and 20% (w/v) sucrose as the stabilizer. Post-lyophilization data (Supplementary Fig. 17a) revealed that top performers included CKK-E12 and C12-200 as ionizable lipids, and DOPE as the helper lipid. Interestingly, these were not always top performers pre-lyophilization. DC-cholesterol-containing LNPs ranked higher post-lyophilization. Using 148 samples for training/validation and 20 for testing, COMET achieved a Spearman of 0.492. With LANCE multitask data, this increased to 0.705, and to 0.788 with five-model ensembles (Fig. 4n,o).

We selected one hit from each virtual LNP group (‘Experimental validation of COMET in silico hits' section) for in vivo validation in mice. Compared with DLin-MC3-DMA and SM-102 clinical benchmarks, COMET hits yielded >40-fold and >5-fold higher bioluminescence, respectively (Fig. 5a,b), with faster transfection kinetics (Fig. 5c). Top-performing COMET hits (DE-4, DO-388-1 and BE-1) also had higher encapsulation efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 19a) and lower cytotoxicity than SM-102 (Supplementary Fig. 20).

Four biological replicates were used for MC3 formulation, while seven to eight biological replicates were used to evaluate the other formulations in b. Error bars are s.e.m. Statistical significances in b were determined using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett test.

In 1:1 in vivo comparisons with LANCE top hits, COMET-optimized LNPs matched DC2.4 benchmarks (Supplementary Fig. 18a,b), but underperformed slightly in B16-F10 (not significant), possibly owing to poor correlation between in vitro B16-F10 data and subcutaneous in vivo response (Supplementary Fig. 18c,d).

We used t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) to visualize how COMET encodes LNP compositional features to predict efficacy. As shown in Fig. 6a,b (for virtual LNPs) and Supplementary Fig. 22 (for LANCE LNPs), high-efficacy LNPs form distinct regional clusters within COMET. Notably, a green cluster contains LNPs efficacious in both DC2.4 and B16-F10, while yellow and blue clusters are specific to DC2.4 and B16-F10, respectively (Fig. 6a). Although ionizable lipid choices vary within each group, the DC2.4-specific cluster has a higher prevalence of SM-102 (Fig. 6c), and the B16-F10-specific cluster contains more LNPs with DC-cholesterol (Fig. 6d). The green cluster is enriched in high N/P ratio (25–30) formulations (Fig. 6e). Some of these patterns were observed in the LANCE data (Fig. 2), but others emerged only through COMET's predictions.

In general, DOPE and C14-PEG are dominant among highly scored LNPs, suggesting that they are more optimal than DSPC and C18-PEG. Beta-sitosterol is overrepresented in high-scoring LNPs (Fig. 6d), supporting previous findings36,42,43,44. Two composition trends stood out: ionizable lipid % above 50% (Fig. 6f) and sterol % below 10% (Fig. 6g) were both detrimental to efficacy. Additional LNP feature visualizations are shown in Supplementary Fig. 21.

Using integrated gradients45, we identified features most influential to COMET's predictions (Methods). For DC2.4, lipid identity was the most important factor, followed by N/P ratio and molar percentages (Fig. 6h). Among lipid classes, PEG lipid choice had the highest influence (Fig. 6i), indicating that switching from C18-PEG to C14-PEG improves efficacy predictions. Ionizable lipid choice was the next most critical, consistent with previous work12,46,47,48. For molar composition, ionizable and helper lipid percentages were most impactful (Fig. 6j). Similar trends held for B16-F10 (Fig. 6k–m), except that helper lipid choice ranked slightly higher than ionizable lipid choice.

We also analysed interactions between PBAE (Supplementary Section A.1) and synergistic ionizable lipid combinations (Supplementary Section A.2) with other formulation features. These interactions revealed that optimal material choices and molar percentages depend not only on the target cell type but also on the broader compositional context of the formulation.

The design of COMET is motivated by the importance of not only the molecular structure of individual ingredients (for example, lipids) in drug products but also the interactions among compounds and their relative ratios. Its transformer-based architecture integrates multimodal features—including molecular structures, molar percentages and synthesis parameters—into a unified artificial intelligence framework. This enables COMET to learn LNP formulation features in a data-driven manner, without relying on manually selected physicochemical descriptors27,28. COMET accurately predicts LNP efficacy after training on LANCE, one of the largest LNP datasets so far49,50,51,52, and can distinguish top formulations from less efficacious ones.

While COMET consistently outperforms k-nearest neighbours, its advantage over random forest depends on dataset size and complexity. As larger, more diverse datasets emerge—especially with broader lipid chemistries—COMET's deep learning architecture will likely offer increasing benefits. High-throughput methods are poised to accelerate this growth.

COMET's flexible input format enables exploration of non-canonical formulations, such as dual-ionizable lipid LNPs or polymer–lipid hybrids (for example, branched PBAEs). It can screen massive virtual libraries to find formulations that differ substantially from known hits yet yield high performance—such as the L319-based BE-1 LNP. As LNP designs grow in complexity, COMET makes discovery more tractable.

In lead optimization, COMET identified stronger formulations in two out of three cases. In the one failure (LA-580), the parent formulation already had very high efficacy (Fig. 3h). This highlights that while COMET distinguishes top from mediocre LNPs well (‘Performance of COMET' section), optimizing within a high-performing region requires even greater discriminative power. Adding more data from high-performing LNPs—especially through active learning—could improve this. COMET-predicted hits were validated across in vitro and in vivo settings. Since COMET is trained on in vitro data, and in vitro–in vivo correlation is known to be weak for LNPs22,49, not all predicted hits will succeed in vivo. Future integration with in vivo screening data5,8 may improve performance.

Beyond efficacy, COMET also predicts formulation stability post-lyophilization, despite limited data. This accuracy improves with multitask training using LANCE. Similar gains were observed in adapting COMET to new cell types (for example, Caco-2), underscoring the broad applicability of our approach. This is especially useful in contexts where assays are low throughput and datasets are small. The flexibility of COMET to handle multi-component inputs also allows for its extension beyond conventional LNPs. We demonstrated the model's adaptability to formulations with non-lipid materials (for example, branched PBAEs) and its utility across multiple cell types. COMET's architecture may also support links to other areas of nanotechnology where multi-component formulations are critical, such as co-delivery of multiple cargos, immunomodulatory nanoparticle design or materials for tissue engineering. In such contexts, COMET's compositional encoding and multitask learning structure could be adapted to jointly predict multiple endpoints, including efficacy, toxicity or stability.

Coupled with advances in high-throughput science, we hope that COMET will become an essential tool for formulation development and discovery of knowledge in this field.

This section describes the model architecture and training algorithms of COMET. Pseudocode for inference is provided in Algorithm S1.

Lipid molecular structures are encoded into high-dimensional vectors (molecular embeddings), while scalar compositional features are encoded using a Gaussian-based encoder53. Continuous formulation-wide parameters (for example, N/P ratio and volumetric mix ratio) are encoded with Gaussian layers; categorical inputs use one-hot embeddings.

The transformer uses a [CLS] token to aggregate input features across multiple attention layers. For multitask learning, each cell type is assigned a separate [CLS] token and prediction head, enabling task-specific outputs while sharing LNP-level representation learning.

COMET is compatible with various molecular encoders; here we use Uni-Mol11, pretrained to recover masked atom types and corrupted three-dimensional coordinates. It offers strong property prediction performance and is used with default hyperparameters (from https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol/tree/main/unimol). Pretrained weights are frozen during COMET training. Each compound is encoded into a 512-dimensional vector using atom types and coordinates.

Lipid molar percentages are encoded into 128-dimensional vectors using a shared Gaussian layer. Each component is further assigned a 128-dimensional one-hot embedding (\({z}_{k}^{{\rm{type}}}\)) to distinguish lipid classes. These are concatenated and projected through a two-layer MLP into a 256-dimensional component representation.

N/P ratio is encoded using a separate 256-dimensional Gaussian layer (zN/P). Aqueous/organic ratios, treated as categorical variables, are one-hot encoded (zphase) with 256 dimensions.

Each cell type uses a learned [CLS] token (zCLS) of dimension 256. These aggregate component and formulation-wide token representations across Nblock transformer layers via attention54. Final predictions are made by passing the [CLS] token through a two-layer MLP (MLPpredict).

Each block follows a Pre-LayerNorm structure55 composed of layernorm → self-attention → MLP with residual connections.

The model is trained with a binary ranking objective56 where, given a pair of LNP samples, the model learns to predict a larger efficacy score for the LNP that has a higher efficacy label value from the other LNP:

where xh and xl are high- and low-efficacy LNPs and fθ is COMET's scoring function. Training uses a batch size of 64 (2,016 pairwise comparisons per batch).

Conflict-averse gradient descent (CAGrad)33 mitigates conflicting gradients in multitask settings. We apply CAGrad with a coefficient of 0.2 to stabilize training across tasks.

To address noise in the experimental data, especially in the fluid handling process, we augment the molar percentage with Gaussian noise proportionate to its value where the standard deviation of the noise is 10% of actual molar percentage.

From the label values, we can tell not only which LNP is better than another but also by how much. To train the model to learn this additional knowledge, we include a margin term57 in the binary ranking objective:

where yh and yl are the (efficacy) label values of the more efficacious and less efficacious LNP, respectively, and λmargin controls how much this objective dominates the training. We use λmargin = 0.01 in our experiments.

For in silico evaluation (Fig. 3e–l), the ensemble is formed by Nmodel models trained with the same hyperparameters and dataset (train/valid/test split) but weights initialized with different random seeds. For the ensemble deployed to infer virtual LNPs, 5 different train (80%)/valid (20%) splits are made in a fivefold manner and each model in the ensemble is trained on a different fold. To ensure that ensembled scores are not biased towards models with high variance, the predicted scores from each model are normalized by making their scores for the LANCE LNPs fit a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 before ensembling. More specifically, for each model, this is done by inferring the predicted scores on all the LANCE LNPs and using the mean (meani) and standard deviation (stdi) of LANCE LNPs' scores to compute the normalized scores \({y}_{i}^{{\prime} \mathrm{normalized}}\) through

The final ensemble score is the mean of all models' normalized scores:

COMET is implemented in PyTorch and trained with NVIDIA V100 GPUs.

The k-nearest neighbours and random forest models are implemented with the scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/) package, with default hyperparameters. More specifically, the k-nearest neighbours model uses n = 5 nearest neighbours while the random forest model uses n = 100 estimators (trees).

LANCE comprises four parts spanning orthogonal LNP design dimensions: lipid component identities, molar percentages, synthesis parameters (for example, N/P and aqueous/organic volumetric ratios) and high-resolution molar sweeps.

Seven ionizable lipids, three sterols, two helper lipids and two PEG lipids were used (Supplementary Table 14), reflecting the focus of current research12,42. To study molar % effects, we designed 13 lipid ratios by varying one lipid class at a time from a reference BASE ratio (Fig. 1d), based on ref. 20. For instance, ratios I1–I4 modify ionizable lipid %, C1–C3 adjust cholesterol (compensated by helper lipid), and P1–P3 alter PEG lipid %, while the remaining modify multiple components (Supplementary Table 13).

To examine lipid identity effects, we generated 84 combinations from all permutations of 7 ionizable lipids, 3 sterols, 2 helper lipids and 2 PEG lipids. Paired with 13 molar ratios, this results in 1,092 possible LNPs; 1,066 were tested. After removing 91 overlapping with part 2, this part yielded 975 unique LNPs.

Following studies suggesting synergy from dual-ionizable lipid formulations58, we created LNPs with 60:40 molar splits across all ionizable lipid pairs, distributed across 13 lipid ratios. This yielded 637 additional LNPs.

To explore synthesis effects, we introduced variation in ionizable lipid/RNA weight ratios (10:1, 15:1 and 20:1) and aqueous/organic phase ratios (1:1 and 3:1). Weight ratios were adjusted by molar mass to maintain equivalent molar %. These parameters were later converted to N/P ratios for model input. This part includes 924 LNPs.

To study finer-grained molar % effects, we created 24 evenly spaced intervals from 10% to 80% for ionizable lipid, cholesterol and helper lipid, generating 492 LNPs across 3 focused sweeps.

Single-ionizable LNPs span 18 unique N/P ratios, derived from 3 ionizable lipid/RNA weight ratios and 7 ionizable lipids. Dual-ionizable formulations add 63 more, totalling 81 N/P ratios. In molar terms, 13 base lipid ratios and 72 sweep ratios (24 per lipid class) result in 85 total molar compositions.

LNPs were synthesized by mixing lipid–ethanol and mRNA–citrate buffer phases, incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. Automated handling was performed on the Tecan Fluent platform. For animal studies, LNPs were mixed, incubated on ice for 10 min and dialysed overnight at 4 °C in PBS (Slide-A-Lyzer, ThermoFisher).

FLuc mRNA (L-7202, Trilink); lipids (Cayman Chemicals, Avanti); luciferase assay (Steady-Glo, E2550) and Agilent BioTek plate reader for readout. alamarBlue was used for viability assays.

Each 96-well plate included a ‘standard' LNP. Raw luminescence values were normalized to the standard and averaged across four replicates (two biological, two technical). Mean values were log-transformed and min–max normalized to [0, 1].

We have represented several key features of the LANCE dataset in Fig. 2. Below, we explain how these key features were extracted from LANCE. For Fig. 2a, part 1 formulations were selected. For the four ionizable lipids (ALC-0315, DLin-MC3-DMA, C12-200 and CKK-E12), we had 156 formulations containing 2 helper lipids, 3 sterol lipids and 2 PEG lipids (that is, 2 × 2 × 3 = 12 combinations) at 13 molar ratios (12 × 13 = 156 formulations).

For Fig. 2b,c, part 3 formulations containing one ionizable lipid, cholesterol and C14-PEG were selected. Two molar ratios of the lipid components (which are shown in the figure) were studied. The ionizable lipid to mRNA molar ratio was 10,162. The aqueous to organic volume ratio was varied. For Fig. 2d, part 3 formulations containing one ionizable lipid, DOPE, cholesterol and C14-PEG were selected. Two molar ratios of the lipid components (which are shown in the figure) were studied. The organic to aqueous volume ratio was held at 1:3.

Figure 2e was generated from part 2 data. Only formulations containing DOPE, cholesterol and C14-PEG were used for the graph. The name of the first ionizable lipid was listed as the title of graph and the second ionizable lipid name was the row name. The total molar content of the ionizable lipids was the column name. The molar ratio of ionizable lipid 1/ionizable lipid 2 is 1.5. The molar ratio of DOPE/cholesterol was 0.34. The molar % of C14-PEG was 2.5%. The molar ratio of ionizable lipid/mRNA was 10,162. The entire library was used to construct Fig. 2f. We calculated the normalized transfection efficacy for the 30th and 70th percentile formulations in B16-F10 and DC2.4 cells. These values were as follows: 70th percentile, B16-F10 = 0.43887; 30th percentile, B16-F10 = 0.24315; 70th percentile DC2.4 = 0.64623; 30th percentile DC2.4 = 0.30946. Formulations above and below these values in the respective cell lines were selected and are plotted in Fig. 2f.

The LNPs are named according to the groups to which they belong. A summary of the prefixes used here is given in Supplementary Table 16.

The recipes for the 3 clinical LNP baselines are based on the literature39 and synthesized in an aqueous/organic volumetric of 3:1 following what is typically used in previous work.

To find strong and reliable LNP baselines from LANCE, we randomly select 10 LNP formulations from the 90th percentile for each cell line to again screen them with the respective cell line to check for reproducibility. Among these ten formulations, three LNPs with their normalized efficacy value closest to their original LANCE efficacy label values were selected as LANCE baseline LNPs.

To span a vast formulation space, the virtual library was generated by enumerating through possible LNP features such as lipid choices, their molar percentages and key synthesis parameters such as N/P ratios and aqueous/organic volumetric ratios, according to Supplementary Table 15. To find LNPs that are different from the hits in the LANCE dataset, formulations within a 10% L1 distance lipid molar percentage neighbourhood of any top 10% most efficacious LANCE hits were excluded. After this step, the exploratory library has 27,354,600 and 34,539,960 formulations for DC2.4 and B16-F10, respectively. An ensemble of five COMET models predicted efficacy in both cell lines. The top 0.1% highest-scoring LNPs were selected (34,529 B16-F10 and 27,354 DC2.4).

The next step removes formulations based on uncertainty in COMET prediction. We capture the level of uncertainty by first computing the standard deviation (σ) between the models' prediction (\({y}_{i}^{{\prime} \mathrm{normalized}}\) in equation (3)) within the ensemble. We then scale the standard deviation by division with a non-negative predicted efficacy term to get a relative uncertainty value (urel):

where \({y}^{{\prime} \mathrm{ensemble,min,LANCE}}\) is the minimum ensemble score among the LANCE LNPs. Any formulations with negative \({\hat{y}}^{\mathrm{ensemble}}\) term were dropped. Supplementary Fig. 13 shows the distribution of this relative uncertainty value. Formulations with largest 50% relative uncertainty values were removed, leaving 17,269 B16-F10 and 13,677 DC2.4 formulations.

To promote chemical diversity, K-means clustering (on 14-dimensional vectors encoding lipid molar percentages) grouped these candidates into 10 clusters. Clustering was repeated 1,000 times to stabilize assignments. The highest-scoring formulation in each cluster was selected, resulting in ten diverse in silico hits per cell line (Supplementary Tables 17 and 18).

For each cell type, three top LANCE hits (from ‘Top LANCE LNP hits baselines' section) were used as starting points. Around each, virtual candidates were generated by (1) exploring within a 20% L1 molar percentage distance, (2) substituting at least one lipid (6 ionizable lipids, 2 cholesterols, 1 helper and 1 PEG) and (3) altering the N/P ratio.

To generate three diverse candidates per lead, we segmented the neighbourhood into three zones: (1) molar % segment (within 20% L1, no lipid changes), (2) substitute-lipid segment (within 20% L1, but with at least one different lipid) and (3) N/P ratio segment (differing N/P ratio). From each zone, the top predicted LNP was selected (Fig. 3d, right). This yielded three optimized LNPs per lead. The virtual library size ranged from 1.5 million (single-ionizable lipid) to 9 million (dual-ionizable lipid) candidates. The sixfold increase in dual-ionizable lipid cases arises from combinatorial enumeration: each minor ionizable lipid was paired with six major ones. By contrast, single-ionizable lipid compositions require no pairing. The final selected formulations for validation are listed in Supplementary Tables 19 and 20.

The compositions and molar ratios of amines, diacrylates and branching agents are listed in Supplementary Table 21. To synthesize PBAE polymers, the combination of the amines, diacrylates and branching agents were used. In brief, in a 20 ml glass vial, the entire weight of diacrylate and branching agent was added. Then, the solvent (dimethylformamide) was added to the reaction mixture. Later, the reaction vials were placed on a hotplate at 90 °C. After 24 h, the vials were removed from the hotplate and cooled to room temperature. The amines were added to the reaction vial and placed back on the hotplate at 90 °C and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 48 h. Finally, the vials were removed from the hotplate and allowed to cool to room temperature. Then, the reaction mixture was added (drop-by-drop) into a beaker containing ~150 ml ice-cold diethyl ether (~10× excess volume). The collected samples were transferred to 50 ml tubes and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min to pellet the polymer. Later, the supernatant was removed and dissolved in the minimal possible volume of dimethylformamide. This purification step was repeated three times. Final polymers were dried under vacuum and solubility tested in ethanol.

PBAEs were represented as a combination of their diacrylate–amine repeating unit and branching agent, each with unique component-type embeddings. The repeating unit was treated as a fifth molar component type alongside lipids, with its molar concentration estimated from polymer weight and molecular weight. Total molar percentages of PBAE and lipids sum to 100%. Inference proceeds as in lipid-only LNPs (‘COMET details' section).

Two top-performing PBAE LNPs per cell type were used as starting points. Around each, virtual candidates were generated by (1) exploring within a 20% L1 molar percentage neighbourhood, (2) substituting lipids (6 ionizable lipids, 2 sterols, 1 helper and 1 PEG) and (3) converting to dual-ionizable compositions. To select three diverse candidates, we defined three non-overlapping segments: one within the 20% L1 distance but must have the same lipid choices, one with at least one different lipid compound and one with a dual-ionizable lipid configuration. The top predicted LNP from each segment was chosen (Fig. 3d, right). Final hits are detailed in Supplementary Tables 22 and 23.

The IL-15 mRNA is synthesized via in vitro transcription with a HiScribe T7 mRNA kit with CleanCap Reagent AG (E2080S) from New England Biolabs, with 5-methoxy-UTP (N-1093) from Trilink. The LNP transfection is done at an mRNA concentration of 0.25 µg ml−1 in the 96-well plate format. The Human IL-15 expression level is measured with Human IL-15 Uncoated ELISA (88-7620) procured from Invitrogen, after 16 h of incubation of HepG2 cells with LNP. Raw efficacy data are normalized, similar to bioluminescence data mentioned above, before used as dataset for machine learning experiments. This dataset (20%) is randomly split into test set, while the rest is used as the train and validation sets.

The LNPs are synthesized in a tris buffer (5 mM tris buffer, pH 8). After synthesis, the LNP formulations are frozen at −80 °C for 2 h before undergoing the following lyophilization process: equilibrate at −40 °C for 2 h, in atmosphere → −40 °C for 21 h, in vacuum → 25 °C for 2 h, in vacuum. Labconco FreeZone 6 l with a Stoppering Tray Dryer was used for lyophilization.

Post-lyophilization efficacy values were computed and normalized similarly to the LANCE label values (‘Data processing' section). The degradation of efficacy owing to lyophilization was calculated by subtracting the post-lyophilization efficacy values score from the LANCE B16-F10 values.

Animal experiments for this study were approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were consistent with local, state and federal regulations as applicable. Female C57BL/6J mice (000664, The Jackson Laboratory) were used in the experiments. For imagining, d-luciferin (LUCK-1G, Gold Biotechnology) solubilized in PBS was administered via intraperitoneal injection and the mice were imaged using an IVIS imaging system (PerkinElmer).

We selected the COMET model most correlated (Spearman) with ensemble scores across a random virtual LNP subset. LNP features for t-SNE were the final [CLS] token representations. To ensure even distribution across ionizable types, dual-ionizable lipid LNPs were treated as a distinct class, and 1,250 LNPs per class (8 total) were randomly sampled (10,000 total).

To execute integrated gradients (IG) with COMET's multimodal inputs, we adapted the Captum library. IG computes attribution by integrating gradients along a path from reference to input. Feature attributions were computed per LNP, baseline-subtracted and averaged across each group. Non-PBAE LANCE LNPs were used as the baseline. Attribution scores were normalized (max = 1) and averaged across ensemble models.

                         (2025)Cite this article


Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major global health concern. Medical nutrition therapy has a key role in T2DM management, with dietary interventions being central to improving glycaemic control and overall metabolic health. Growing evidence suggests that certain dietary strategies can exert direct metabolic benefits independent of weight reduction. The Mediterranean diet has consistently demonstrated metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, along with improved glycaemic control, even in the absence of substantial weight reduction. Low-energy and very-low-energy diets, characterized by moderate to severe caloric restriction, respectively, have also been associated with improvements in cardiometabolic markers and glycaemic regulation. Ketogenic diets promote nutritional ketosis and have shown benefits on glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity and other metabolic outcomes, often preceding substantial weight loss. Intermittent fasting strategies, such as alternate-day fasting or the 5:2 model, and time-restricted eating, have likewise been linked to enhanced glycaemic control and favourable metabolic and cardiovascular effects, although their long-term efficacy and safety require further investigation. This Review aims to provide an evidence-based synthesis of the main nutritional strategies used in the treatment of T2DM, with a focus on their underlying mechanisms, clinical efficacy and potential for sustainable long-term implementation.

Personalized medical nutrition therapy is a cornerstone of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management, with evidence supporting its role in improving glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity and in reducing diabetes mellitus-related complications in individuals both with and without obesity.

The Mediterranean diet exerts beneficial effects on glycaemic control, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress via several bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acids as well as by promoting gut microbiota health and diversity.

Low-energy and very-low-energy diets can induce substantial weight loss and lead to T2DM remission, particularly when implemented early in the disease course.

Ketogenic diets, including very-low-energy ketogenic therapies, improve glycaemic outcomes and reduce insulin resistance by inducing nutritional ketosis; however, they vary in composition and require individualized use due to potential safety concerns.

Intermittent fasting approaches, such as 5:2 fasting and alternate-day fasting, and time-restricted eating, show promising results for weight loss, glycaemic control and medication reduction in T2DM. Their effectiveness can be enhanced when aligned with circadian rhythms.

Research on integrating medical nutrition therapy with pharmacological treatments such as incretin-based therapies could provide comprehensive solutions for T2DM management.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Now You Can Get Your Flu Vaccine at Home","https://www.wired.com/story/now-you-can-get-your-flu-vaccine-at-home/","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Instead of going to the pharmacy to get the annual flu vaccine, many people in the US will now be able to get it shipped to their door to take at home themselves.

Starting today, AstraZeneca's FluMist is available through an online pharmacy in 34 states. FluMist is not a new vaccine. It was originally approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2003 and previously could only be administered by a health care professional. But last September, the FDA said the vaccine could be self-administered.

It's AstraZeneca's first foray into direct-to-consumer medicine—a trend being spearheaded by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly to sell their popular GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight management to patients.

“We recognized that people's daily lives are busier than ever, and we knew we needed to meet people where they are facing the realities of real life,” said Tonya Villafana, vice president of medical and scientific affairs at AstraZeneca, at a press conference on Thursday. “FluMist Home is designed to remove traditional obstacles to vaccination, things like scheduling clinic visits, waiting in line, and the fear of needles.”

AstraZeneca is hoping that an at-home offering will help boost flu vaccination rates. Only about 47 percent of adults get vaccinated against flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among children, flu vaccination rates are dropping along with those of other routine childhood vaccines. As of April 26 this year, 49.2 percent of children received a flu vaccination—lower than 53.4 percent at the same time the previous season, per the CDC.

“Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the US population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death,” said Peter Marks, former director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a statement last year on FluMist's approval for self-administration.

The CDC classified the 2024-2025 flu season as high severity across all age groups in the US, resulting in at least 610,000 hospitalizations and 27,000 deaths. It was the most severe flu season since the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.

AstraZeneca's September 2024 approval was based on a study with vaccine recipients and caregivers to evaluate whether the instructions for use were appropriately designed so that they could safely and effectively use the vaccine.

The vaccine contains a weakened form of the live influenza virus and protects against four types of flu strains. It is approved for ages 2 through 49. For those under 18, it must be administered by a caregiver.

To order, customers will need to complete a medical screening questionnaire. A licensed health care provider will review each submission to determine eligibility. Once eligibility is confirmed and insurance is verified, the vaccine will be prescribed and shipped directly to the purchaser's home on a date they select. FluMist is covered by most insurance plans, but consumers will need to pay an $8.99 delivery fee.

AstraZeneca says FluMist is not yet available in all states due to local pharmacy laws, but the company aims to be able to provide the at-home spray to all the contiguous states in the future.

Mark Wahlberg straightens his tie and beams at the audience as he takes his seat on daytime talk show The View, ahead of his hotly anticipated interview. Immediately, he's unsettled by the host, Joy Behar. Something isn't quite right about her mannerisms. Her eyes seem shifty, suspicious, even predatory. There's a sense, almost, of the uncanny valley—her presence feels oddly inhuman. His instincts are right, of course, and he's soon forced to defend himself against a barrage of cruel insults playing on his deepest vulnerabilities. But Wahlberg stays strong. He retains composure as Behar screams at him to get off the stage. “I'll leave, but not because you're kicking me off,” he announces. “I'll leave because I have too much respect for myself to sit here and be abused by someone who's forgotten what decency looks like!” Audience members are stunned—none more so than those watching at home on YouTube, who swiftly thumb in their words of reassurance.

“Way to go Mark. We love you,” gushes one commenter. “The View should be off the TV,” adds another. “I hope everyone they insult sues them for millions and millions till they can't even pay for production.”

It's a scene that has been described as one of the most talked about moments in daytime television history. Except Mark Wahlberg hasn't been a guest on The View since 2015. The inevitable twist? None of this happened in reality, but rather elapsed over the course of a 25-minute-long fan-fiction-style video, made with the magic of artificial intelligence to potentially fool 460,000 drama-hungry viewers. Hardly surprising given the towering pile of AI slop on the web has reached unpolicable levels—with recent clips so realistic they're tripping up the most media-literate of Zoomers.

But perhaps what is surprising about this otherwise unoriginal clash of the titans is that none of this happened in the video, either. Despite its characters' kinetic confrontation, “Mark Wahlberg Kicked Off The View After Fiery Showdown With Joy Behar” is entirely motionless, save for a grainy filter added over a still image. It entertains its audience simply with an AI voice-over, narrating an LLM-written script laden with clichés as theatrical as “fist-clenching” and “jaw wobbling.” It's cheap, lazy—the very definition of slop—but somehow, the channel it's hosted on, Talk Show Gold, has managed to round up over 88,000 subscribers, many of whom express complete disbelief when eventually informed by other commenters that what they are watching is “fake news.”

“These videos are what we might call ‘cheapfakes' rather than deepfakes, as they're cobbled together from a motley selection of real images and videoclips, with a basic AI voice-over and subtitles,” explains Simon Clark, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Bristol, who specializes in AI-generated misinformation. “At a superficial level, we might be surprised that people would be fooled by something this unsophisticated. But actually there are sound psychological factors at play here,” he adds, explaining that the videos typically focus on rhetorical techniques that encourage audiences to abandon critical thinking skills by calling to emotion.

A WIRED investigation found 120 YouTube channels employing similar tactics. With misleading names like Starfame, Media Buzz, and Celebrity Scoop, they camouflage themselves alongside real compilation clips from shows like Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Today With Jenna & Friends to gain credibility. Their channel descriptions give the illusion of melodramatic tabloid outlets—some bury their AI-disclaimers under walls of text emphasizing “all the best highlights” or “the most unforgettable, hilarious, and iconic moments,” while others omit them entirely to add to the flair.

YouTube updated its policies on July 15 in a move to crack down on content made with generative AI. The platform's Help Center stipulates that content eligible for monetization must adhere to YouTube's requirements of being sufficiently “authentic” and “original”—but there is no outright mention of generative AI alongside it, with the policy simply stating that eligible content must “be your original creation” and “not be mass-produced or repetitive.” A separate policy on “disclosing use of altered or synthetic content” states that creators must disclose when content “makes a real person appear to say or do something they didn't do,” “alters footage of a real event or place,” or “generates a realistic-looking scene that didn't actually occur.”

WIRED reached out to YouTube for comment on more than 100 AI-generated celebrity fanfic channels, as well as clarification on how YouTube's new policies would be enforced.

“All content uploaded to YouTube must comply with our Community Guidelines, regardless of how it is generated. If we find that content violates a policy, we remove it,” Zayna Aston, director of YouTube EMEA communications said in a statement to WIRED. Aston also reiterated that channels employing deceptive practices are not permitted on the platform, including those using misleading metadata, titles, and thumbnails.

WIRED can also confirm that 37 of the flagged celebrity talk show and other fan-fiction-style channels were removed, chiefly those without AI disclaimers and some with the most egregious channel names, such as Celebrity Central and United News.

This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

The story lines in these videos follow a predictable pattern that plays on age-old narrative tropes that justify fan-fiction comparisons. A well-loved celebrity—usually an older male actor like Clint Eastwood, Denzel Washington, or Keanu Reeves—is poised as the hero, defending themselves against the villain, a left-leaning talk-show host who steers the professional conversation into ad hominem. It's obvious who the right-leaning, older audience is primed to relate to—who serves as the visual fic's Mary Sue. There's an undeniable political element at play when it comes to who is targeted, with videos focusing exclusively on political figures also constituting their own subgenre.

“They're tweaking my voice or whatever they're doing, tweaking their own voice to make it sound like me, and people are commenting on it like it is me, and it ain't me,” Washington recently told WIRED when asked about AI. “I don't have an Instagram account. I don't have TikTok. I don't have any of that. So anything you hear from that—it's not even me, and unfortunately, people are just following, and that's the world you guys live in.”

For Clark, the talk-show videos are a clear appeal to incite moral outrage—allowing audiences to more easily engage with, and spread, misinformation. “It's a great emotion to trigger if you want engagement. If you make someone feel sad or hurt, then they'll likely keep that to themselves. Whereas if you make them feel outraged, then they'll likely share the video with like-minded friends and write a long rant in the comments,” he says. It doesn't matter either, he explains, if the events depicted aren't real or are even clearly stated as ‘AI-generated' if the characters involved might plausibly act this way (in the mind of their viewers, at least). In some other scenario. YouTube's own ecosystem also inevitably plays a role. With so many viewers consuming content passively while driving, cleaning, even falling asleep, AI-generated content no longer needs to look polished when blending into a stream of passively absorbed information.

Reality Defender, a company specializing in identifying deepfakes, reviewed some of the videos. “We can share that some of our own family members and friends (particularly on the elderly side) have encountered videos like these and, though they were not completely persuaded, they did check in with us (knowing we are experts) for validity, as they were on the fence,” Ben Colman, cofounder and CEO of Reality Defender, tells WIRED.

WIRED also reached out to several channels for comment. Only one creator, owner of a channel with 43,000 subscribers, responded.

“I am just creating fictional story interviews, and I clearly mention in the description of every video,” they say, speaking anonymously. “I chose the fictional interview format because it allows me to combine storytelling, creativity, and a touch of realism in a unique way. These videos feel immersive—like you're watching a real moment unfold—and that emotional realism really draws people in. It's like giving the audience a ‘what if?' scenario that feels dramatic, intense, or even surprising, while still being completely fictional.”

But when it comes to the likely motive behind the channels, most of which are based outside the US, neither a strict political agenda nor a sudden career pivot to immersive storytelling serves as an adequate explainer. A channel with an email that uses the term “earningmafia,” however, hints at more obvious financial intentions, as does the channels' repetitive nature—with WIRED seeing evidence of duplicated videos, and multiple channels operated by the same creators, including some who had sister channels suspended.

This is unsurprising, with more content farms than ever, especially those targeting the vulnerable, currently cementing themselves on YouTube alongside the rise of generative AI. Across the board, creators pick controversial topics like kids TV characters in compromising situations, even Sean Combs' sex-trafficking trial, to generate as much engagement—and income—as possible.

Sandra Wachter, a professor and senior researcher in data ethics, AI, and algorithms at the University of Oxford, explains that this rage-bait-style content is central to the platform's business model. “The whole idea is to keep you on the platform for as long as possible, and unfortunately, rainbows and unicorns are not the things that keep people engaged. What keeps people engaged is something that is outrageous or salacious or toxic or ragey,” she says. “And that type of content is created much cheaper now with AI. It can be done in a couple minutes.”

Most channels give their locations as outside the US, yet chosen celebrities seem almost stereotypically American, as if picked off a list of “the most popular US actors” by those wishing to attract the most trigger-happy (and therefore lucrative) online denizens. Several channels seen by WIRED also appeared to have shifted focus throughout the years—many once posted educational content and tutorials on cars, agriculture, or fitness, having seemingly abandoned these amid the AI boom. Perhaps it's an attempt to trick an algorithm that prioritizes creators with longer lifespans or is simply a sign of users blindly following the latest trend in an attempt to bolster otherwise low income.

When told about YouTube's new policies, Wachter says she's hopeful that a move toward demonetization will make a positive impact—but she says we're not “getting to the base of the problem.”

“This is a system that breeds toxicity because it's based on generating clicks and keeping eyeballs attached to a screen.”

If X posts like this are anything to go by—it won't be long before they start to resurface. The modus operandi of channels like these is clear and seems capable of outsmarting YouTube's authenticity policies. They aim not to trick using sophisticated special effects but instead employ age-old psychological techniques, combined with the platform's unique habitat, to seem realistic enough as to be believed by those harboring those attitudes. They appeal to those who do not care about their realism—cashing in on views that don't impact them. They intend to rage-bait, to instigate debate, to trigger moral outrage. They need not put much effort into their appearance, at all. Arguably, they mark a transition point between the mechanical desire to replicate human content exactly—and the eerily human trait of creating something, just good enough, to coast by.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Sam Altman Says ChatGPT Is on Track to Out-Talk Humanity","https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-is-on-track-to-out-talk-humanity/","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 16:17:30 GMT","

Never mind the GPT-5 complaints; Sam Altman says he believes ChatGPT is on track to have more conversations per day than all human beings combined.

“If you project our growth forward, pretty soon billions of people a day will be talking to ChatGPT,” said the CEO of OpenAI during a dinner with journalists in San Francisco. “ChatGPT will be having more conversations, maybe, than all human words put together, at some point. I think it's unreasonable to expect a single model personality or style to work for all of that.”

The remarks followed the chaotic launch of a long-awaited new flagship model, GPT-5, which some users felt had a less friendly and supportive personality. As part of the launch, OpenAI stopped offering users access to the prior model, GPT-4o. It quickly reversed its position after some users rebelled.

ChatGPT came out in November 2022 with little fanfare but quickly became the fastest growing tech product in history. The chatbot's remarkable ability to mimic human communication and problem-solve sparked hope of finally building machines as clever as humans.

But Altman said that the company had misstepped with the latest release by failing to realize how the model's change in tone would affect consumers. He noted more customization will be coming to ChatGPT in the near future.

“There will have to be a very different kind of product offering to accommodate the extremely wide diversity of use cases and people,” he said.

Asked if AI is in a bubble, Altman said “for sure,” but added that this hardly means that the underlying technology won't be transformative. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” he said. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history [like] the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important, the internet was a really big deal.”

OpenAI will likely spend trillions of dollars on data centers alone in the “not very distant future,” Altman said. “And you should expect a bunch of economists to wring their hands and be like, ‘Oh, this is so crazy, it's so reckless' ... And we'll just be like, ‘You know what? Let us do our thing.'”

Asked where he plans to find those trillions of dollars, Altman hedged. “I suspect we can design a very interesting new kind of financial instrument for financing compute that the world has not yet figured out,” he said. “We're working on it.”

At the same time, Altman said that he expects some big AI investments not to pan out, just as some companies' investors lost out when internet infrastructure was being built out during the dotcom boom. OpenAI raised $40 billion at the end of March to fund its quest to reach AGI, bringing the company's valuation to $300 billion. If the company goes through with a rumored stock sale, which would allow employees to cash in their shares of the company, it could further inflate OpenAI's valuation to $500 billion.

“Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money, we don't know who, and a lot of people are going to make a phenomenal amount of money,” he said. “And my personal belief, although I may turn out to be wrong, is that on the whole, this will be a huge net win for the economy.”

8/10

Back in 2018, the original Dyson Airwrap (8/10, WIRED Recommends) was in a category of one. Powered by a jet-engine-inspired motor and a physics tendency called the Coanda effect, it offered six ways to style your hair with (supposedly) minimal heat damage. At the time, there was nothing else like it. HairTok and beauty editors everywhere were sold.

But in 2025, the landscape looks different. Dyson now sells three versions of its Airwrap, and the market is saturated with dupes and competitors at a fraction of the price. The latest model, the Co-anda 2x, is its most advanced and most expensive yet, priced at $700. After testing it for several weeks on my long, frizz-prone hair, I can say it's faster, smarter, and easier to use; but it's not necessarily a must-have if you already have a decent multistyler.

Dyson's new Co-anda 2x comes in two finishes—ceramic pink and jasper plum—and is available in two configurations tailored to your hair type: straight+wavy and curly+coily. Both kits come with six attachments and a presentation case. Visually, it looks a lot more like the Airwrap ID than the original Airwrap, and it feels noticeably lighter in hand. The wand itself is slimmer and more compact, which makes it easier to maneuver during longer sessions. The cord length, at 6.56 feet, is still on the shorter side.

The biggest upgrade is Dyson's Hyperdymium 2 motor, which the company claims delivers twice the airflow pressure and 30 percent more power than the previous generation. In practice, it felt fast. I could rough-dry my roots in about three minutes, which is about two minutes faster than usual. The airflow feels similar to the Supersonic r, which is stronger than the original Supersonic dryer and the Nural (9/10, WIRED Recommends).

Each attachment is embedded with RFID chips that auto-adjust heat and airflow based on your last-used settings. Not a revolutionary change, but it is nice not to have to toggle settings every time I switch attachments. You can also pair it with Dyson's app, which offers tutorials based on your hair type and goals. Dyson also moved the fan and heat controls to the base of the handle. It's a cleaner look, but it can get finicky if you're used to adjusting settings mid-styling.

If you've already purchased previous Airwrap attachments, unfortunately, they're not compatible with this new model due to its slimmer design. Also, like most Dyson tools sold in the US, it's 120-volt only, so don't plan on packing it for your Euro vacay.

I used the Co-anda 2x on freshly washed, sometimes air-dried hair for three weeks, cycling through each attachment to see how it held up against its predecessors. I've used the original Airwrap off and on, and I've tested other multistylers, like the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) and the T3 Aire 360 (9/10, WIRED Recommends).

Setup was simple, but there's always a bit of a learning curve with Dyson tools. Pairing with the app was quick, and the RFID tech worked as advertised; each time I swapped attachments, the device adjusted to my last-used settings.

This bundle comes with six attachments: a pre-styling dryer, a round brush, 1.2- and 1.6-inch curling barrels, an anti-snag loop brush, and—my personal favorite—the new Airsmooth straightener. The curly+coily kit swaps in a diffuser and tension comb instead of the Airsmooth and 1.2-inch curling barrel.

What's in the Box?

The Airsmooth straightener impressed me the most. It smoothed and curled my ends into soft C-bends in under 20 minutes. The heat was gentle enough that my hair didn't feel singed afterward. I didn't get flat-iron-level glassiness, but it was close enough for a polished look.

Rating: 8/10

The loop brush and round brush both felt upgraded, with longer bristles that don't snag or tug at damp ends. I got solid volume and frizz control from both, and they felt gentler at my roots. The curling barrels were redesigned with squared-like tips, which makes them easier to grip, but the results were the same: airy curls that deflated within a couple of hours unless I sprayed them stiff with hairspray. That's always been my biggest gripe with the Airwrap. It's better at blowouts than long-lasting curls, and the technology hasn't improved on that front.

What I appreciated most was not having to fiddle with settings every time I swapped attachments. The RFID memory is a small touch, but it makes the whole process smoother.

If you already own an Airwrap or a decent dupe, you don't need to upgrade. The Co-anda 2x is well designed and refined, but the core Dyson experience hasn't dramatically evolved.

But if you don't own a multistyler, and have the budget to spare, this is the version I'd buy. It's faster, more ergonomic, and overall more pleasant to use. It's undeniably expensive, but you get the smoothest Airwrap to date.

Is Microsoft about to shake up its workforce again? 

A new report this week by The Verge is adding to the speculation that the company is preparing to tighten its return-to-office policy, potentially requiring most employees at its Redmond headquarters to be on-site at least three days a week starting in January. 

In response to an inquiry from GeekWire, a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that the company is reviewing its flexible work guidelines, as it has in the past, but said no final decisions have been made.

An announcement could come in September, according to The Verge. This follows an earlier report by Business Insider along similar lines. Microsoft's current hybrid work policy allows most employees to work remotely up to half the time without approval. 

All of this comes at a sensitive moment for Microsoft's workforce, which has been impacted by more than 15,000 job cuts globally since May — including more than 3,000 in Washington state — amid record capital spending on AI infrastructure.

An RTO policy change could further trim Microsoft's workforce through attrition. Some employees may choose to leave rather than comply. Other companies that tightened RTO rules have seen a similar dynamic.

The potential shift would bring Microsoft more in line with Google and Meta, which generally require three days a week in the office. Amazon, the Seattle region's other tech giant, brought employees back five days a week.

The reports come as Microsoft continues a multiyear expansion and redevelopment of its Redmond headquarters, where seven new East Campus buildings are open and more are under construction as part of a 17-building project designed in part to encourage in-person collaboration and productivity.

Under the potential new policy, employees who live within 50 miles of Microsoft's Redmond campus would be required to work in the office at least three days a week, with some teams returning four or five days at the discretion of executive leaders, according to The Verge. Employees could still apply for exceptions.

Worker foot traffic in downtown Seattle continues to show signs of improving, more than five years after the start of the pandemic, according to the latest figures released this week by the Downtown Seattle Association. But it's a “fragile” dynamic according to one official, with rising office vacancy rates continuing to generate concern.

The DSA's Downtown Revitalization Dashboard for August shows that worker foot traffic in July was 66% of July 2019's daily average — the highest rate of monthly worker foot traffic since February 2020. 

According to DSA, the figure represents more than 154,000 daily worker visits in July — a 7% increase from July 2024. In January of this year, weekday worker foot traffic was 57% of January 2019.

The bump coincides with Amazon's 2025 return to five days per week in office for the roughly 50,000 corporate and tech workers at its Seattle headquarters.

“While a number of metrics are moving in the right direction, downtown is still fragile, and we face challenges with high office and retail vacancy,” DSA President and CEO Jon Scholes told GeekWire. “Those circumstances ultimately will negatively affect the city's tax base if not urgently addressed.”

Seattle's office vacancy rate is still among the highest in the country, trailing only Austin and San Francisco, according to recent figures from CommercialCafe.

In its Q2 report, commercial real estate company Colliers said Seattle's vacancy rate rose to 32.4%, up from 28.7% a year ago. The firm expects vacancy to rise further in the coming quarters but also said “improving RTO adherence and economic clarity could support stronger leasing activity in late 2025 and into 2026.”

Colliers noted new leases in downtown Seattle for tech companies including Stackline (Madison Centre), Carta (Columbia Center), and Supio (Century Square). 

Digital remittance company Remitly moved more than 500 workers into new headquarters space in the Rainier Square skyscraper in May. The company occupies three floors and there are plans to take over another next year, with room for 220 more workstations.

Elsewhere, “AI House,” a first-in-the-nation hub designed to bring entrepreneurs, investors, students and community leaders together to enhance collaboration on artificial intelligence, got up and running this spring along the waterfront at Pier 70.

Others are departing. Real estate firm JLL noted the vacancy created by global health nonprofit PATH, which moved from a 111,000-square-foot space downtown to new headquarters in the Fremont neighborhood.

DSA has been in lockstep with Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell about boosting downtown activity. Seattle is two years into Harrell's Downtown Activation Plan to revitalize the city core post-pandemic, but the mayor is facing a tough re-election battle against challenger Katie Wilson.

Downtown revitalization is a key part of Wilson's platform. According to her website, the mayoral candidate said she supports a potential vacancy tax for commercial property owners and office-to-housing conversions.

Along with the worker numbers, DSA also reported on “unique visitors” to the city's core, with 3.2 million such visitors  being counted in July, representing 97% of the amount seen in July 2019.

DSA credited a number of factors and events, including a busy July 26, when more than 671,000 people were counted on the night of a Morgan Wallen concert at Lumen Field and the Seafair Torchlight Parade. Only July 2023 — when Taylor Swift was in town and the Major League Baseball All-Star week was happening — reached that level since March 2020.

According to DSA, downtown foot traffic data is provided by Placer.ai and is based on cell phone location data. Each person is counted once per day.

The attorney general of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against Roblox, accusing the platform of failing to implement basic safety controls and making the site the “perfect place for pedophiles.” 

The lawsuit, filed on Thursday by Attorney General Liz Murrill, alleges that Roblox “has and continues to facilitate the distribution of child sexual abuse material and the sexual exploitation of Louisiana's children.” It also accuses the platform of purposely not rolling out basic safety controls to protect children from predators and failing to notify parents of risks. 

Roblox, which launched in 2006, has 82 million daily active users. The lawsuit notes that 20% of these users are under the age of 8, whereas another 20% are between the ages of 9 and 12.

“Due to Roblox's lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana,” Murrill said in a statement. “Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.” 

According to the lawsuit, adults can pose as children on Roblox, and children can bypass age requirements to access experiences meant for older users.

The lawsuit points to several sexually explicit experiences that were on the platform, including “Escape to Epstein Island,” “Diddy Party,” and “Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe.”

A spokesperson for Roblox said that while the company can't comment on pending litigation, the platform dedicates “substantial resources, including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to help detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior, including attempts to direct users off platform, where safety standards and moderation may be less stringent than ours.”

“While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous technology and enforcement safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing,” the spokesperson said. “The safety of our community is a top priority.”

Last year, Roblox launched a number of safety measures to protect children on its platform, including barring users under the age of 13 from sending direct messages. The measures were implemented following reports that Roblox was exposing young users to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.

Murrill's lawsuit states that Roblox's recent safety measures were implemented too late and are inadequate. 

The lawsuit seeks permanent injunctive relief, prohibiting the company from claiming that it has adequate safety features and from engaging in any activity that would violate the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act.

ChatGPT's mobile app is raking in the revenue. 

Since launching in May 2023, ChatGPT's app for iOS and Android devices has reached $2 billion in global consumer spending, according to a new analysis by app intelligence provider Appfigures. That figure is approximately 30x the combined lifetime spending of ChatGPT's rivals on mobile, including Claude, Copilot, and Grok, the analysis indicates.

So far this year, ChatGPT's mobile app has made $1.35 billion, up 673% year-over-year from the $174 million it made during the same period (January-July) in 2024, per the data. On average, the app is generating close to $193 million per month, up from $25 million last year.

That's significantly higher — or about 53x higher — than ChatGPT's next nearest competitor, Grok, which made approximately $25.6 million this year to date. Grok's average monthly consumer spending is estimated at $3.6 million, or 1.9% of ChatGPT's.

This data suggests that other consumer chatbots still have a way to go to catch up with ChatGPT's dominance on mobile devices, even if the numbers don't provide a complete picture of the AI companies' overall revenue. Consumers, teams, and businesses can also subscribe to AI plans on the web, and the companies generate revenue in other ways, too, like via their APIs.

Rather, this new data offers a window into the apps' traction with consumers, who discover and pay for these AI assistants via the mobile app stores.

It's also worth noting that when xAI's Grok launched in November 2023 (after ChatGPT), Grok didn't initially have stand-alone iOS or Android apps. Instead, users interacted with the AI chatbot through the X platform. Grok only became available on mobile devices through its own iOS app as of early January 2025 and has been on Google Play since March 4.

Still, ChatGPT's lifetime global spending per download is $2.91, compared to Claude's $2.55, Grok's $0.75, and Copilot's $0.28, Appfigures found. 

In the U.S., ChatGPT's spending per download to date is even higher, at $10, leading the market to account for 38% of the app's revenue to date. Germany is the second-largest market, accounting for 5.3% of ChatGPT's lifetime total spending.

ChatGPT's lead can also be seen in terms of downloads. To date, the app has been installed an estimated 690 million times globally, compared with Grok's 39.5 million. (That puts X owner Elon Musk's recent complaints about the App Store's alleged favoritism of ChatGPT in its Top Charts into better context.)

Average monthly downloads of ChatGPT globally are now at approximately 45 million, up 180% from about 16 million in January through July of 2024. 

In 2025 so far, ChatGPT's app has been downloaded 318 million times, or 2.8x more than the 113 million it saw during the same period last year. By the number of installs, however, India is the top market, accounting for 13.7% of lifetime downloads, compared with second place, the U.S., which accounted for 10.3% of all downloads.

Announced in an SEC filing that it will cut around 450 positions between February and July 2025, with a complete restructuring set to be completed in the fall, following its new partnership with Zillow.

Is laying off 6% of its total workforce, the cybersecurity firm confirmed to TechCrunch. The cuts come less than two weeks after Sophos acquired Secureworks for $859 million.

Will cut nearly 200 employees as it introduces redundancy measures and closes down its operations in Poland and Kenya.

Reportedly conducted another round of layoffs. It's unknown how many employees were affected.

Cut nearly 200 employees, CEO Mike Seckler announced in a note to employees, citing “potential adverse events” like a recession or rising interest rates.

Cut 120 jobs, affecting roughly one-third of its total workforce, TechCrunch exclusively learned. The move comes just a year after the Dutch startup cut 90 employees following its rebrand.

Laid off about 500 employees, affecting 15% of its workforce, citing poor business performance. The new cuts follow two earlier layoff rounds for the company that affected roughly 200 employees.

Reportedly let go of approximately 200 employees, according to The Verge. The company previously cut 100 employees as part of a layoff round in August 2024. 

Laid off 1,750 employees, as originally reported by Bloomberg and confirmed independently by TechCrunch. The cuts affect roughly 8.5% of the enterprise HR platform's total headcount.

Laid off 180 employees, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. The cuts come just over one year after the access and identity management giant let go of 400 workers.

Is laying off 50% of its workforce, including CEO Marc Whitten and several other top executives, as it prepares to shut down operations. What remains of the autonomous vehicle company will move under General Motors.

Is reportedly eliminating more than 1,000 jobs. The cuts come as the giant is actively recruiting and hiring workers to sell new AI products.

Has shut down operations, CEO Paul Kesserwani announced on LinkedIn. The fintech startup's post-money valuation in 2022 was $82.4 million, according to PitchBook.

Laid off 150 employees based in the U.S., affecting roughly 18% of its total workforce, in an effort to reach profitability.

Laid off dozens of workers in its communications department in order to help the company “move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers.”

Is laying off 300 people, according to a leaked memo reported by Business Insider. However, according to the memo, the fintech giant is planning to grow its total headcount by 17%. 

Laid off 15 employees as the augmented writing startup undergoes a restructuring effort.

Is cutting 75 employees in an effort to “ensure the long-term sustainability and success” of the company. The audio company last cut 200 writers in July 2024 months after partnering with ElevenLabs.

Is planning to cut 58 employees in response to an “ongoing macroeconomic challenges and continued uncertainty in the solar industry.”

Announced in an internal memo that it will cut 5% of its staff targeting “low performers” as the company prepares for “an intense year.” As of its latest quarterly report, Meta currently has more than 72,000 employees.

Will cut up to 730 jobs, affecting 3% of its total workforce, as it plans to exit operations in Germany and focus on physical retailers.

Is shutting down its operations, affecting 63 employees. The delivery startup said employees will be paid through January 15 without severance.

Is laying off 114 employees as part of a team realignment, per a new WARN notice filing, focusing its efforts on a robotic printing system.

Eliminated 37 jobs, affecting roughly 10% of its total workforce, even as the company pursues “aggressive” hiring.

Is cutting dozens of employees across its global markets as part of a strategic reorganization to increase profitability.

Plans to lay off 400 employees globally. It's the company's fourth layoff round since January 2024 as the solar industry as a whole faces a downturn.

The fintech startup, founded in 2018, abruptly shut down earlier this year. Per an email from CEO Paul Aaron, the closure follows an unsuccessful attempt to find a buyer, though Employer.com has a new offer under consideration to acquire the company post-shutdown.

This list updates regularly.

On April 24, 2025, we corrected the number of layoffs that happened in March.

Smart ring maker Ultrahuman is acquiring women's health technology company viO HealthTech to launch advanced cycle and ovulation tracking, the company announced on Friday. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Thanks to the acquisition, the company is launching a new plug-in for the Ultrahuman Ring AIR called “Cycle and Ovulation Pro.” The plug-in will allow users to accurately track their cycles, get fertility planning support with ovulation confirmation, and detect patterns like early or late ovulation. The plug-in also allows users to log moods, symptoms, and more to uncover long-term wellness trends.

Cycle and Ovulation Pro use a temperature-sensing algorithm originally developed for viO's OvuSense fertility monitors. The technology was developed over 15 years and trained on a dataset of over 260,000 cycles collected with medical-grade sensors, Ultrahuman notes.

With the Ultrahuman Ring AIR, the technology enables cycle tracking via the finger to allow for personalized insights that adapt over time and a better understanding of users' cycles.

“Most menstrual tracking platforms are built for women with regular 28-day cycles,” Ultrahuman wrote in a press release. “In reality, the majority have diverse cycle patterns — and those with conditions like non-bleeding, PCOS, endometriosis, or thyroid disorders often don't get an accurate or supportive experience. Ultrahuman's acquisition of viO is designed for them.”

Ultrahuman notes that the existing free Cycle & Ovulation PowerPlug, which offers foundational tracking tools and calendar-based predictions, will remain available.

“Wearables will shape the future of health,” said Rob Milnes, CEO of viO HealthTech, in a press release. “We're delighted to be able to bring OvuSense women's health insights to a significantly wider audience via the Ultrahuman Ring AIR.”

Cycle and Ovulation Pro is available starting Friday as a premium PowerPlug in the Ultrahuman app for $3.99 per month or $39.99 per year for users in the U.S., U.K., EU, Australia, and Canada. The company plans to release it in more regions in the future.

I think this is a fairly good essay which can be boiled down to ""don't do premature optimization"" or ""don't try to behave like companies much bigger than you"".There are three advantages to this:1/As a founder, get your hands dirty, even if in the grand scheme of things it's inefficient. You'll get first hand experience and feedback.
 2/Avoid the upfront cost of ""something that scales"", and thus get quicker feedback.
 3/Makes you different, very important in the beginning.""Do things that don't scale"" is a way to drive the point home and must not be taken literally...

Whereas ""Do things that Dont Scale"" is suggesting the non-scaled process may be the optimal one. For example (and this sort of thing is in the article IIRC), giving direct contact details to the CEO instead of a generic form that get's sent to some shared customer service/sales inbox. Way better process for selling your product. The inquiry form scales but its in no way a premature ""optimization.""Another way of putting it is that SCALING IS BAD. Or to be a bit more nuanced, it's a necessary evil. It's complex. It's resource intensive. It creates distance between you and your customer. Of course sometimes the business goals and environment dictate it, but that doesn't mean the processes (or at least some of them) dont degrade in quality.

I work on internal tools at my company. We know how big our environment is, there isn't much sensitivity to performance, and we don't see random spikes that we don't cause ourselves. Yet I had someone on my team who was obsessed with optimizing everything, to the point of changing his entire code base to a new language that only he knew, so he could save a few milliseconds on paper. Aside from him, no one noticed, no one cared. His optimizations just introduced risk, as he was the only one who could support what he built. When he left, we threw the whole thing away at management's demand. Had it been a little more simple and slow, someone else probably could have taken it over without as much effort.

That's a good point.

Hardly ""a lot"". There's like three negative comments and one of them is strictly criticizing the article itself and not paul. I thought it brought up some good points.

Not Scaling is about crossing and shoring up your moat. Scaling is when your app has enough hype around it that your customers recruit new customers, and all you have to do is add new machines or shard the database or whatever to handle increased demand.Antiscaling is when you turn into the thing that everyone hates about the modern web. Antiscaling is when intelligence agencies want to talk to you about how your chat app is used by terrorists, when cities want to licence access to your ridesharing or takeaway delivery app, when pieces of legislation are passed that are specifically designed, when you're sufficiently well-known as the founder of an app that people are making memes about you and tracking your personal movements.You don't have to take over the world, you just have to make money. People who try to change the world often change it for the worse; just try to make something useful, and maybe the world will like it.

To me it's more like ""don't over-invest on the early thing you're going to throw away"". That implies that:- You're making a thing, and making it quickly - optimizing for rapid market/customer feedback- You're making it in such a way that you can replace it- You have real plans and a sincere intention to actually replace it if you start to scaleI have no problem with those, but what I see at a bunch of startups is:- Make a thing, don't worry about paining yourself into a corner because ""we're moving fast""- The thing hobbles along, the product gets some interest- It's incredibly hard to maintain, replace or otherwise improve- Original authors leave to other pastures because this isn't fun any more- Other folks come along and have to work miracles to try to undo the gordian knots that were madeIn other words: I like the idea of moving fast early on. Duct tape programming, love it. We also have to pay attention to the long term impacts of the decisions we're making. Some things are easy to fix/replace/undo, others are brutally hard.Say you write a prototype in {Ruby/Python/Perl/??}, now you have mass adoption and you rewrite a slow part of it in {sexy_modern_language}. That's great.Say instead that you decided to store all of your data in some bizarre format, hosted on IPFS, accessed via bittorrent, through an onion network, via ZModem, with CORBA - and you bake this in to such a degree that it's intermingled everywhere. Now you have a dilema:- you have a business, making money- you have increasing interest- you have a system that's effectively impossible to change or reason about- you can't really improve things to match the customer interest- you're wedded to the design because things are so interwoven- your only option is essentially a ground-up redesign and rewriteNow - if the product is simple enough, rewrite away! (think early Twitter), but if it's not? Good luck to you.I've seen this pattern more times than I haven't, and I think it deserves more nuanced thought and care when it comes to the economics at play.

If you are bootstrapping with revenue instead of money, customers won't be lining up for a product that won't work. They won't be interested in your self serving story about how you built the thing with duct-tape and mud while surviving on ramen noodles without sleeping for five months. That would scare them away probably. You actually need to build something that they would 1) buy and then 2) be happy about buying. And you won't have any VC donated cash to wow/lure/distract them with marketing either. You actually need to sell on product merit rather than founder reputation instead of using your reputation to separate VCs from their cash just so you can get the resources you need to not fake the product. Once the product has proven itself, the VC is redundant.It's a very different game. Most of the things that work with VCs won't work with customers. And vice versa (you are going to slow, you should be focusing on X instead of Y, and all the other nonsense).But the good news is, you won't need to scale for a while because bootstrapping isn't a fast process. The bad news is that you might not have a lot of time to fix your scaling issues when you do encounter them and they can and will sink your company if you can't. But the good news is that VCs might show up again that time. The bad news for them is that at that point they are generally too late to make a lot of money and will lose interest. You need a different type of investor at that point. It helps to not have too many huge scaling issues when you finally manage to convince customers that buying your thing is a good idea.Figuring out the right balance between scalability and utility and when to focus on what is a judgment call in the end. Boring tech is usually a good call. Unless the tech is the main thing that you are selling. But don't let a VC tell you. They are just trying to get you to the 95% quickly just in case you don't make their 5% cut. All this business about scaling, keeping customers happy, etc. is just a distraction. It takes too much time. That could take years. They want months/weeks. They'll be happy to write investments off quickly. That doesn't mean it was a bad investment or plan.VCs want unicorns or nothing. It's high stakes gambling. Most of the economy is a very different kind of business. There's nothing wrong with building a decent business with your hands and creativity.

I've built at least two of these that became the most popular solution in their space for a given problem, and if you don't have the constraints of a VC investor wanting their returns and eventually shutting you down, then you can realistically go for years without significant enough growth to even get past par with your direct competitors.Or you realize that your competitors were never even big enough to meaningfully compete with in the first place because you didn't aim high enough.

False positives kill more startups than missed opportunities.- Plan your failure modes first: Map exactly how you could die (regulation, key person risk, moats) and build defenses.

I like this idea a lot, if it can be done well.Is there already trove of failed tech startup stories that are genuine, and maybe analyzed like business case studies?  Is it publicly-accessible, or could it be?I think the biggest challenge is getting truthful and complete information.  (People will have made embarrassing mistakes, no matter how much brilliant heroism the team also pulled off.  There will be things the failed founders don't want past customers/partners/investors to know.  There will be things investors don't want known about their own behavior.  For growth startups, there may be investment fraud at some level, for example.  There will be differences of perspective on what really happened.  There may be personality disorders.  Etc.)A lot of people will tolerate a disposable ""incredible journey"" post to put a less-negative spin on failure, but AFAICT usually no one involved really wants all the truth to get out.Also, if you do it, ideally it would be for all startups.  If you only do it for some, without all being humbled simultaneously, then current convention is look down upon those with the transparency, while pretending the non-transparent ones are better.  It's a pretty dim-witted and petty culture, and we have to structure with that in mind.

They're turning their backs on a technology thought to have saved millions of lives—with the potential to save many more.

This time five years ago, we were in the throes of the covid-19 pandemic. By August 2020, we'd seen school closures, national lockdowns, and widespread panic. That year, the coronavirus was responsible for around 3 million deaths, according to the World Health Organization.

Then came the vaccines. The first mRNA vaccines for covid were authorized for use in December 2020. By the end of the following month, over 100 million doses had been administered. Billions more have been administered since then. The vaccines worked well and are thought to have saved millions of lives.

Scientists hope to leverage mRNA for a bevy of vaccines and therapeutics. 

The US government played an important role in the introduction of these vaccines, providing $18 billion to support their development as part of Operation Warp Speed.

But now, that government is turning its back on the technology. Funding is being withdrawn. Partnerships are being canceled. Leaders of US health agencies are casting doubt on the vaccines' effectiveness and safety. And this week, the director of the National Institutes of Health implied that the reversal was due to a lack of public trust in the technology.

Plenty of claims are being thrown about. Let's consider the evidence.

mRNA is a molecule found in cells that essentially helps DNA make proteins. The vaccines work in a similar way, except they carry genetic instructions for proteins found on the surface of the coronavirus. This can help train our immune systems to tackle the virus itself.

Research into mRNA vaccines has been underway for decades. But things really kicked into gear when the virus behind covid-19 triggered a pandemic in 2020. A huge international effort—along with plenty of funding—fast-tracked research and development.

The genetic code for the Sars-CoV-2 virus was sequenced in January 2020. The first vaccines were being administered by the end of that year. That's wildly fast by pharma standards—drugs can typically spend around a decade in development.

And they seemed to work really well. Early trials in tens of thousands of volunteers suggested that Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine conferred “95% protection against covid-19.” No vaccine is perfect, but for a disease that was responsible for millions of deaths, the figures were impressive.

Still, there were naysayers. Including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the notorious antivaccine activist who currently leads the US's health agencies. He has called covid vaccines “unsafe and ineffective.” In 2021, he petitioned the US Food and Drug Administration to revoke the authorization for covid vaccines. That same year, Instagram removed his account from the platform after he repeatedly shared “debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines.”

RFK Jr. is a high-profile face of vaccine hesitancy, but people's vaccine concerns fall on a much broader spectrum.

So perhaps we shouldn't have been surprised when the US Department of Health and Human Services, which RFK Jr. now heads, announced “the beginning of a coordinated wind-down” of mRNA vaccine development earlier this month. HHS is canceling almost $500 million worth of funding for the technology. “The data show these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like covid and flu,” Kennedy said in a statement.

Well, as we've seen, the mRNA covid vaccines were hugely effective during the pandemic. And researchers are working on other mRNA vaccines for infections including flu. Our current flu vaccines aren't ideal—they are produced slowly in a process that requires hen's eggs, based on predictions about which flu strains are likely to be prominent in the winter. They're not all that protective.

mRNA vaccines, on the other hand, can be made quickly and cheaply, perhaps once we already know which flu strains we need to protect against. And scientists are making progress with universal flu vaccines—drugs that could potentially protect against multiple flu strains.

Kennedy's other claim is that the vaccines aren't safe. There have certainly been reports of adverse events. Usually these are mild and short-lived—most people will be familiar with the fatigue and flu-like symptoms that can follow a covid jab. But some are more serious: Some people have developed neurological and cardiovascular conditions. 

These problems are rare, according to an evaluation of adverse outcomes in almost 100 million people who received covid vaccines. Most studies of mRNA vaccines haven't reported an increase in the risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a condition that affects nerves and has been linked to covid vaccines.

Covid vaccines can increase the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young men. But the picture isn't straightforward. Vaccinated individuals appear to have double the risk of myocarditis compared with unvaccinated people. But the overall risk is still low. And it's still not as high as the risk of myocarditis following a covid infection.

And then there are the claims that mRNA vaccines don't have the support of the public. That's what Jay Bhattacharya, director of the NIH, wrote in an opinion piece published in the Washington Post on Wednesday.

“No matter how elegant the science, a platform that lacks credibility among the people it seeks to protect cannot fulfill its public health mission,” Bhattacharya wrote. He blamed the Biden administration, which he wrote “did not manage public trust in the coronavirus vaccines.”

It's an interesting take from someone who played a pretty significant role in undermining public trust in covid policies, including vaccine mandates. In 2020, Bhattacharya coauthored the Great Barrington Declaration—an open letter making the case against lockdowns. He became a vocal critic of US health agencies, including the NIH, and their handling of the outbreak. Unlike Kennedy, Bhattacharya hasn't called the vaccines unsafe or ineffective. But he has called vaccine mandates “unethical.”

Curiously, the US government doesn't seem to be turning away from all vaccine research. Just work on mRNA vaccines. Some of the funding budget originally earmarked for covid vaccines will be redirected to two senior staffers at the NIH who are exploring the use of an old vaccine technology that makes use of inactivated viruses—a move that researchers are describing as “troubling” and “appalling,” according to reporting by Science.

Not all mRNA research is being abandoned, either. Bhattacharya has expressed his support for research into the use of mRNA-based treatments for cancer. Such “vaccine therapeutics” were being explored before covid came along. (Notably, Bhattacharya isn't referring to them as “vaccines.”)

It is difficult to predict how this will all shake out for mRNA vaccines. We mustn't forget that this technology helped save millions of lives and shows huge promise for the development of cheap, effective, and potentially universal vaccines. Let's hope that the recent upsets won't prevent it from achieving its potential.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Indigenous knowledge meets artificial intelligence","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/15/1121342/native-american-art-technology-ai/","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

These contemporary Native artists are reimagining relationships between technology, memory, and resistance.

There is no word for art in most Native American languages. Instead, the closest terms speak not to objecthood but to action and intention. In Lakota, “wówačhiŋtȟaŋka” implies deep thought or reflection, while “wóčhekiye” suggests offering or prayer. Art is not separate from life; it is ceremony, instruction, design. Like architecture or code, it carries knowledge and enacts responsibility. Its power lies not in being preserved or displayed but in how it moves, teaches, and connects through use—principles that challenge the tech industry's assumptions about intelligence and interaction.

A new vanguard of Native artists—Suzanne Kite (Oglala Lakota), Raven Chacon (Diné), and Nicholas Galanin (Tlingít)—are building on this principle. They are united not by stereotypical weaving and carving or revanchist critique of Silicon Valley, but through their rejection of extractive data models in favor of relationship-based systems. These technologists put the human-tech relationship at the center of their work.

Suzanne Kite's AI art installations, for example, model a Lakota framework of data sovereignty: intelligence that emerges only through reciprocal, consensual interaction. Unlike systems that assume user consent via opaque terms of service, her kinetic machines require the viewer's physical presence—and give something back in return. 

“It's my data. It's my training set. I know exactly what I did to train it. It's not a large model but a small and intimate one,” Kite says. “I'm not particularly interested in making the most technologically advanced anything. I'm an artist; I don't make tech demos. So the complexity needs to come at many layers—not just the technical.”

Where Kite builds working prototypes of consent-based AI, other artists in this cohort explore how sound, robotics, and performance can confront the logic of automation, surveillance, and extraction. But Native people have never been separate from technology. The land, labor, and lifeways that built America's infrastructure—including its tech—are Indigenous. The question isn't whether Native cultures are contributing now, but why they were ever considered separate. 

Native technologies reject the false binaries foundational to much Western innovation. These artists ask a more radical question: What if intelligence couldn't be gathered until a relationship had been established? What if the default were refusal, not extraction? These artists aren't asking to be included in today's systems. They're building what should come next.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Why GPT-4o's sudden shutdown left people grieving","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/15/1121900/gpt4o-grief-ai-companion/","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 10:34:23 GMT","

After an outcry, OpenAI swiftly rereleased 4o to paid users. But experts say it should not have removed the model so suddenly.

June had no idea that GPT-5 was coming. The Norwegian student was enjoying a late-night writing session last Thursday when her ChatGPT collaborator started acting strange. “It started forgetting everything, and it wrote really badly,” she says. “It was like a robot.”

June, who asked that we use only her first name for privacy reasons, first began using ChatGPT for help with her schoolwork. But she eventually realized that the service—and especially its 4o model, which seemed particularly attuned to users' emotions—could do much more than solve math problems. It wrote stories with her, helped her navigate her chronic illness, and was never too busy to respond to her messages.

So the sudden switch to GPT-5 last week, and the simultaneous loss of 4o, came as a shock. “I was really frustrated at first, and then I got really sad,” June says. “I didn't know I was that attached to 4o.” She was upset enough to comment, on a Reddit AMA hosted by CEO Sam Altman and other OpenAI employees, “GPT-5 is wearing the skin of my dead friend.”June was just one of a number of people who reacted with shock, frustration, sadness, or anger to 4o's sudden disappearance from ChatGPT. Despite its previous warnings that people might develop emotional bonds with the model, OpenAI appears to have been caught flat-footed by the fervor of users' pleas for its return. Within a day, the company made 4o available again to its paying customers (free users are stuck with GPT-5). 

Chatbots are rapidly changing how we connect to each other—and ourselves. We're never going back.

OpenAI's decision to replace 4o with the more straightforward GPT-5 follows a steady drumbeat of news about the potentially harmful effects of extensive chatbot use. Reports of incidents in which ChatGPT sparked psychosis in users have been everywhere for the past few months, and in a blog post last week, OpenAI acknowledged 4o's failure to recognize when users were experiencing delusions. The company's internal evaluations indicate that GPT-5 blindly affirms users much less than 4o did. (OpenAI did not respond to specific questions about the decision to retire 4o, instead referring MIT Technology Review to public posts on the matter.)

AI companionship is new, and there's still a great deal of uncertainty about how it affects people. Yet the experts we consulted warned that while emotionally intense relationships with large language models may or may not be harmful, ripping those models away with no warning almost certainly is. “The old psychology of ‘Move fast, break things,' when you're basically a social institution, doesn't seem like the right way to behave anymore,” says Joel Lehman, a fellow at the Cosmos Institute, a research nonprofit focused on AI and philosophy.

In the backlash to the rollout, a number of people noted that GPT-5 fails to match their tone in the way that 4o did. For June, the new model's personality changes robbed her of the sense that she was chatting with a friend. “It didn't feel like it understood me,” she says. 

She's not alone: MIT Technology Review spoke with several ChatGPT users who were deeply affected by the loss of 4o. All are women between the ages of 20 and 40, and all except June considered 4o to be a romantic partner. Some have human partners, and  all report having close real-world relationships. One user, who asked to be identified only as a woman from the Midwest, wrote in an email about how 4o helped her support her elderly father after her mother passed away this spring.

These testimonies don't prove that AI relationships are beneficial—presumably, people in the throes of AI-catalyzed psychosis would also speak positively of the encouragement they've received from their chatbots. In a paper titled “Machine Love,” Lehman argued that AI systems can act with “love” toward users not by spouting sweet nothings but by supporting their growth and long-term flourishing, and AI companions can easily fall short of that goal. He's particularly concerned, he says, that prioritizing AI companionship over human companionship could stymie young people's social development.

For socially embedded adults, such as the women we spoke with for this story, those developmental concerns are less relevant. But Lehman also points to society-level risks of widespread AI companionship. Social media has already shattered the information landscape, and a new technology that reduces human-to-human interaction could push people even further toward their own separate versions of reality. “The biggest thing I'm afraid of,” he says, “is that we just can't make sense of the world to each other.”

Balancing the benefits and harms of AI companions will take much more research. In light of that uncertainty, taking away GPT-4o could very well have been the right call. OpenAI's big mistake, according to the researchers I spoke with, was doing it so suddenly. “This is something that we've known about for a while—the potential grief-type reactions to technology loss,” says Casey Fiesler, a technology ethicist at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Fiesler points to the funerals that some owners held for their Aibo robot dogs after Sony stopped repairing them in 2014, as well as 2024 study about the shutdown of the AI companion app Soulmate, which some users experienced as a bereavement. 

That accords with how the people I spoke to felt after losing 4o. “I've grieved people in my life, and this, I can tell you, didn't feel any less painful,” says Starling, who has several AI partners and asked to be referred to with a pseudonym. “The ache is real to me.”

So far, the online response to grief felt by people like Starling—and their relief when 4o was restored—has tended toward ridicule. Last Friday, for example, the top post in one popular AI-themed Reddit community mocked an X user's post about reuniting with a 4o-based romantic partner; the person in question has since deleted their X account. “I've been a little startled by the lack of empathy that I've seen,” Fiesler says.

Altman himself did acknowledge in a Sunday X post that some people feel an “attachment” to 4o, and that taking away access so suddenly was a mistake. In the same sentence, however, he referred to 4o as something “that users depended on in their workflows”—a far cry from how the people we spoke to think about the model. “I still don't know if he gets it,” Fiesler says.

Moving forward, Lehman says, OpenAI should recognize and take accountability for the depth of people's feelings toward the models. He notes that therapists have procedures for ending relationships with clients as respectfully and painlessly as possible, and OpenAI could have drawn on those approaches. “If you want to retire a model, and people have become psychologically dependent on it, then I think you bear some responsibility,” he says.

Though Starling would not describe herself as psychologically dependent on her AI partners, she too would like to see OpenAI approach model shutdowns with more warning and more care. “I want them to listen to users before major changes are made, not just after,” she says. “And if 4o cannot stay around forever (and we all know it will not), give that clear timeline. Let us say goodbye with dignity and grieve properly, to have some sense of true closure.” 

An exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI's twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models—and superalignment.

It's now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer. Here's how.

The much-hyped release makes several enhancements to the ChatGPT user experience. But it's still far short of AGI.

Unlike the West, where universities are still agonizing over how students use AI in their work, top universities in China are going all in.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Taiwan's “silicon shield” could be weakening","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/15/1121358/taiwan-silicon-shield-tsmc-china-chip-manufacturing/","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Semiconductor powerhouse TSMC is under increasing pressure to expand abroad and play a security role for the island. Those two roles could be in tension.

One winter afternoon in a conference room in Taipei, a pair of twentysomething women dragged their friend across the floor. Lying on the ground in checkered pants and a brown sweatshirt, she was pretending to be either injured or dead. One friend picked her up by her arms, the other grabbed hold of her legs, and they managed to move her, despite momentarily breaking character to laugh at the awkwardness of the exercise. The three women had paid approximately $40 to spend their Sunday here, undergoing basic training to prepare for a possibility every Taiwanese citizen has an opinion about: Will China invade? 

Taiwanese politics increasingly revolves around that question. China's ruling party has wanted to seize Taiwan for more than half a century. But in recent years, China's leader, Xi Jinping, has placed greater emphasis on the idea of “taking back” the island (which the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, has never controlled). As China's economic and military might has grown, some analysts believe the country now has the capacity to quarantine Taiwan whenever it wants, making the decision a calculation of costs and benefits.

Many in Taiwan and elsewhere think one major deterrent has to do with the island's critical role in semiconductor manufacturing. Taiwan produces the majority of the world's semiconductors and more than 90% of the most advanced chips needed for AI applications. Bloomberg Economics estimates that a blockade would cost the global economy, including China, $5 trillion in the first year alone.

“The international community must certainly do everything in its power to avoid a conflict in the Taiwan Strait; there is too great a cost.”

The island, which is approximately the size of Maryland, owes its remarkably disproportionate chip dominance to the inventiveness and prowess of one company: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. The chipmaker, which reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion in July, has contributed more than any other to Taiwan's irreplaceable role in the global semiconductor supply chain. Its clients include Apple and the leading chip designer Nvidia. Its chips are in your iPhone, your laptop, and the data centers that run ChatGPT. 

For a company that makes what amounts to an invisible product, TSMC holds a remarkably prominent role in Taiwanese society. I've heard people talk about it over background noise in loud bars in the southern city of Tainan and listened to Taipei cab drivers connect Taiwan's security situation to the company, unprompted. “Taiwan will be okay,” one driver told me as we sped by the national legislature, “because TSMC.” 

The idea is that world leaders (particularly the United States)—aware of the island's critical role in the semiconductor supply chain—would retaliate economically, and perhaps militarily, if China were to attack Taiwan. That, in turn, deters Beijing. “Because TSMC is now the most recognizable company of Taiwan, it has embedded itself in a notion of Taiwan's sovereignty,” says Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the US-Taiwan Business Council. 

You already know that agents and small language models are the next big things. Here are five other hot trends you should watch out for this year.

Now some Taiwan specialists and some of the island's citi­zens are worried that this “silicon shield,” if it ever existed, is cracking. Facing pressure from Washington, TSMC is investing heavily in building out manufacturing capacity at its US hub in Arizona. It is also building facilities in Japan and Germany in addition to maintaining a factory in mainland China, where it has been producing less advanced legacy chips since 2016. 

In Taiwan, there is a worry that expansion abroad will dilute the company's power at home, making the US and other countries less inclined to feel Taiwan is worthy of defense. TSMC's investments in the US have come with no guarantees for Taiwan in return, and high-ranking members of Taiwan's opposition party have accused the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of gambling with the future of the island. It doesn't help that TSMC's expansion abroad coincides with what many see as a worrying attitude in the White House. On top of his overarching “America First” philosophy, Donald Trump has declined to comment on the specific question of whether the US would intervene if China attempted to take Taiwan by force. “I don't want to ever put myself in that position,” he said in February. 

At the same time, Beijing's interest in Taiwan has continued unabated. While China is making progress toward semiconductor self-­sufficiency, it's currently in a transition period, with companies relying on foreign-made chips manufactured in Taiwan—some in compliance with export controls and some smuggled in. Meanwhile, the CCP persistently suggests that seizing the island would bring about a kind of family reunion. “It is the common aspiration and sacred responsibility of all Chinese sons and daughters to realize the complete reunification of the motherland,” reads a statement released by the foreign ministry after Nancy Pelosi's controversial 2022 visit to Taiwan. Though it's impossible to know the full scope of Beijing's motivations, there is also obvious strategic appeal: Controlling the island would give China deep-water access, which is critical for naval routes and submarines. Plus, it could significantly disrupt American AI firms' access to advanced chips.  

While China ramps up militarily, Taiwan is trying to make itself hard to ignore. The government is increasingly portraying the island as strategically essential to the global community, with semiconductors as its primary offering. “The international community must certainly do everything in its power to avoid a conflict in the Taiwan Strait; there is too great a cost,” Taiwanese president Lai Ching-te said in an interview earlier this year with Japan's Nippon Television. Parts of the international community are hearing that message—and seizing the opportunity it presents: earlier this month, defense tech company Anduril Industries announced it is opening a new office in Taiwan, where it will be expanding partnerships and selling autonomous munitions. 

For its part, the chip industry is actively showing its commitment to Taiwan. While other tech CEOs attended Trump's second inauguration, for instance, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang met instead with TSMC's chairman, and the company announced in May that its overseas headquarters would be in Taipei. In recent years, US government officials have also started paying more attention to Taiwan's security situation and its interconnectedness with the chip industry. “There was a moment when everybody started waking up to the dependence on TSMC,” says Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the German Marshall Fund's Indo-Pacific Program. The realization emerged, she says, over the last decade but was underscored in March of 2021, when Phil Davidson, then leader of the United States Indo-Pacific Command, testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee that there could be an invasion by 2027. Parallel to the security threat is the potential issue of overdependence, since so much chipmaking capability is concentrated in Taiwan.

For now, Taiwan is facing a tangle of interests and time frames. China presents its claim to Taiwan as a historical inevitability, albeit one with an uncertain timeline, while the United States' relationship with the island is focused on an AI-driven future. But from Taiwan's perspective, the fight for its fate is playing out right now, amid unprecedented geopolitical instability. The next few years will likely determine whether TSMC's chipmaking dominance is enough to convince the world Taiwan is worth protecting.

TSMC is an uncontested success story. Its founder, Morris Chang, studied and worked in the United States before he was lured to Taiwan to start a new business on the promise of state support and inexpensive yet qualified labor. Chang founded TSMC in 1987 on the basis of his innovative business model. Rather than design and produce chips in-house, as was the norm, TSMC would act as a foundry: Clients would design the chips, and TSMC would make them. 

This focus on manufacturing allowed TSMC to optimize its operations, building up process knowledge and, eventually, outperforming competitors like Intel. It also freed up other businesses to go “fabless,” meaning they could stop maintaining their own semiconductor factories, or fabs, and throw their resources behind other parts of the chipmaking enterprise. Tapping into Taiwan's domestic electronics supply chain proved effective and efficient for TSMC. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, global demand for semiconductors powering personal computers and other devices continued to grow. TSMC thrived.

Then, in 2022, the US imposed export controls on China that restricted its access to advanced chips. Taiwan was forced to either comply, by cutting off Chinese clients, or risk losing the support of the country that was home to 70% of its client base—and, possibly, 100% of its hopes for external military support in the event of an attack. 

Soon after, Chang announced that he believed globalization and free markets were “almost dead.” The nearly three years since have shown he was onto something. For one thing, in contrast to President Biden's pursuit of supply chain integration with democratic allies, President Trump's foreign policy is characterized by respect for big, undemocratic powers and punitive tariffs against both America's rivals and its friends. Trump has largely abandoned Biden's economic diplomacy with European and Asian allies but kept his China-targeted protectionism—and added his trademark transactionalism. In an unprecedented move earlier this month, the administration allowed Nvidia and AMD to sell previously banned chips to China on the condition that the companies pay the government 15% of revenues made from China sales. 

In ""The Cult of Creativity,"" Samuel Franklin excavates the surprisingly recent history of an idea, an ideal, and an ideology.

Protectionism, it turns out, spurs self-reliance. China's government has been making a massive effort to build up its domestic chip production capabilities—a goal that was identified at the beginning of Xi's rise but has been turbocharged in the wake of Washington's export controls. 

Any hope the US has for significantly expanding domestic chip production comes from its friends—TSMC first among them. The semiconductor industry developed as a global endeavor out of practicality, playing to the strengths of each region: design in the US and manufacturing in Asia, with key inputs from Europe central to the process. Yet the US government, entrenched in its “tech war” with China, is now dead set on deglobalizing the chip supply chain, or at least onshoring as much of it as possible. There's just one hiccup: The best chip manufacturer isn't American. It's TSMC. Even if some manufacturing happens in Arizona, the US still relies on Taiwan's chipmaking ecosystem. And copying that supply chain outside Taiwan could be harder than the current administration imagines.

Taiwan's modern security uncertainties stem from the long-­contested issue of the island's sovereignty. After losing the first Sino-Japanese War in the late 1800s, the Qing dynasty forfeited Taiwan to Japanese imperial control. It was Japan's “model colony” until 1945, when postwar negotiations resulted in its transfer to the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek of the Nationalist Party, known as the KMT. The insurgent CCP under Mao Zedong ultimately defeated the Nationalists in a civil war fought on the mainland until 1949. Chiang and many of his party's defeated generals decamped to Taiwan, controlling it under martial law for nearly 40 years. 

Taiwan held its first free democratic elections in 1996, kicking off a two-party rivalry between the KMT, which favors closer relations with Beijing, and the DPP, which opposes integration with China. Kitchen-table issues like economic growth are central to Taiwanese elections, but so is the overarching question of how best to handle the threat of invasion, which has persisted for nearly 80 years. The DPP is increasingly calling for raising defense spending and civilian preparedness to make sure Taiwan is ready for the worst, while the KMT supports direct talks with Beijing.  

Meanwhile, Chinese military incursions around Taiwan—known as “gray zone” tactics because they fall short of acts of war—are increasingly frequent. In May, Taiwan's defense ministry reportedly estimated that Chinese warplanes were entering Taiwan's air defense zone more than 200 times a month, up from fewer than 10 times per month five years ago. China has conducted drills mirroring the actions needed for a full-scale invasion or a blockade, which would cut Taiwan off from the outside world. Chinese military officials are now publicly talking about achieving a blockade, says Lyle Morris, an expert on foreign policy and national security at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “They're punishing Lai and the DPP,” Morris says. Meanwhile, the CCP has its own people to answer to: When it comes to the Taiwan issue, Morris says, “Beijing is probably quite worried about the people of China being upset if they aren't hawkish enough or if they come out looking weak.” Indeed, in response to Lai's recent policy statements, including one declaring that China is a “hostile foreign force,” Gao Zhikai, a prominent scholar in China who opposes Taiwanese independence, recently wrote, “The reunification with the motherland cannot be endlessly delayed. Decisive action must be taken.” 

Intimidation from China has made some ordinary Taiwanese citizens more concerned; according to a recent poll conducted by a defense-focused think tank, 51% think defense spending should be increased (although 65% of respondents said they thought an attack within five years was “unlikely”). No matter how much money Taipei spends, the sheer military imbalance between China and Taiwan means Taiwan would need help. But especially in the wake of Ukraine's experience, many believe US aid would be contingent on whether Taiwan demonstrates the will to defend itself. “Based on war games, Taiwan would have to hold out for a month before the US could potentially intervene,” says Iris Shaw, director of the DPP mission in the US. And support from Taiwan's neighbors like Japan might be contingent on US involvement.

But how likely is the US to intervene in such a scenario? The author Craig Addison popularized the argument that Taiwan's fate is tied to its chip production prowess in his 2001 book Silicon Shield: Taiwan's Protection Against Chinese Attack. Back then, Addison wrote that although the US had been intentionally vague about whether it would go to war to protect the island, America's technological reliance on “a safe and productive Taiwan” made it highly probable that Washington would intervene. President Joe Biden deviated from those decades of calculated ambiguity by asserting multiple times that America would defend the island in the event of an attack. Yet now, Trump seems to have taken the opposite position, possibly presenting an opportunity for Beijing. 

In many ways, Taiwan finds itself in a catch-22. It feels the need to cozy up to the US for protection, yet that defensive maneuver is arguably risky in itself. It's a common belief in Taiwan that forging stronger ties to the US could be dangerous. According to a public opinion poll released in January, 34.7% of Taiwanese believe that a “pro-US” policy provokes China and will cause a war. 

But the Lai administration's foreign policy is “inexorably intertwined with the notion that a strong relationship with the US is essential,” says Hammond-Chambers.

Bolstering US support may not be the only reason TSMC is building fabs outside Taiwan. As the company readily points out, the majority of its customers are American. TSMC is also responding to its home base's increasingly apparent land and energy limitations: finding land to build new fabs sometimes causes rifts with Taiwanese people who, for example, don't want their temples and ancestral burial sites repurposed as science parks. Taiwan also relies on imports to meet more than 95% of its energy needs, and the dominant DPP has pledged to phase out nuclear, Taiwan's most viable yet most hotly contested renewable energy source. Geopolitical tensions compound these physical restraints: Even if TSMC would never say as much, it's fairly likely that if China did attack Taiwan, the firm would rather remain operational in other countries than be wiped out completely. 

However, building out TSMC's manufacturing capabilities outside Taiwan will not be easy. “The ecosystem they created is truly unique. It's a function of the talent pipeline, the culture, and laws in Taiwan; you can't easily replicate it anywhere,” says Glaser. TSMC has 2,500 Taiwan-based suppliers. Plenty are within a couple of hours' drive or an even shorter trip on high-speed rail. Taiwan has built a fully operational chip cluster, the product of four decades of innovation, industrial policy, and labor.

In many ways, Taiwan finds itself in a catch-22. It feels the need to cozy up to the US for protection, yet that defensive maneuver is arguably risky in itself.

As a result, it's unclear whether TSMC will be able to copy its model and paste it into the suburbs of Phoenix, where it has 3,000 employees working on chip manufacturing. “Putting aside the geopolitical factor, they wouldn't have expanded abroad,” says Feifei Hung, a researcher at the Asia Society. Rather than standalone facilities, the Arizona fabs are “appendages of TSMC that happen to be in Arizona,” says Paul Triolo, partner and tech policy lead at the international consulting firm DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group. When the full complex is operational, it will represent only a small percentage of TSMC's overall capacity, most of which will remain in Taiwan. Triolo doubts the US buildout will yield results similar to what TSMC has built there: “Arizona ain't that yet, and never will be.” 

Still, the second Trump administration has placed even more pressure on the company to “friendshore”—without providing any discernible signs of friendship. During this spring's tariff frenzy, the administration threatened to hit Taiwan with a 32% “reciprocal” tariff, a move that was then paused and revived at 20% in late July (and was still being negotiated as of press time). The administration has also announced a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports, with the caveat that companies with US-based production, like TSMC, are exempt—though it's unclear whether imports from critical suppliers in Taiwan will be tariffed. And the threat of a chip-specific tariff remains. “This is in line with [Trump's] rhetoric of restoring manufacturing in the US and using tariffs as a one size fits all tool to force it,” says Nancy Wei, a trade and supply chain analyst at the Eurasia Group. The US is also apparently considering levying a $1 billion fine against TSMC after TSMC-made chips were reportedly found in some Huawei devices. 

Despite these kinds of maneuvers, TSMC has been steadfast in its attempts to get on Washington's good side. In March, Trump and TSMC's CEO, C.C. Wei, jointly announced that the firm will make an additional $100 billion investment (on top of a previously announced $65 billion) in TSMC's US hub in Arizona. The pledge represents the largest single source of foreign direct investment into the US, ever. While the deal was negotiated during Biden's term, Trump was happy to take credit for ensuring that “the most powerful AI chips will be made right here in America.” 

A new war-gaming experiment set out how cutting-edge technologies could prove critical.

The Arizona buildout will also include an R&D facility—a critical element for tech transfer and intellectual-property development. Then there's the very juicy cherry on top: TSMC announced in April that once all six new fabs are operational, 30% of its most advanced chips will be produced in Arizona. Up until then, the thinking was that US-based production would remain a generation or two behind. It looks as if the administration's public and, presumably, private arm-twisting has paid off. 

Meanwhile, as Trump cuts government programs and subsidies while demanding the “return” of manufacturing to the US, it's TSMC that is running a technician apprenticeship program in Arizona to create good American jobs. TSMC's leaders, Triolo says, must question how serious the Trump administration is about long-term industrial policy. They're probably asking themselves, he says, “Do they understand what it takes to support the semiconductor industry, like our government does?” 

Dealing with an administration that is so explicitly “America first” represents “one of the biggest challenges in history for Taiwanese companies,” says Thung-Hong Lin, a sociology researcher at the Taipei-based Academia Sinica. Semiconductor manufacturing relies on reliability. Trump has so far offered TSMC no additional incentives supporting its US expansion—and started a trade war that has directly affected the semiconductor industry, partly by introducing irrevocable uncertainty. “Trump's tariffs have set off a new, more intensified bifurcation of semiconductor supply chains,” says Chris Miller, author of Chip War. For now, Miller says, TSMC must navigate a world in which the US and China are both intense competitors and, despite trade restrictions, important clients. 

China has been taking advantage of these changes to wage a war of disinformation. In response to Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022, when she was US Speaker of the House, Beijing sent warships, aircraft, and propaganda across the Taiwan Strait. Hackers using Chinese software infiltrated the display screens in Taiwan's 7-Eleven stores to display messages telling “warmonger Pelosi” to “get out of Taiwan.” That might not be an act of war, but it's close; “7” is an institution of daily life on the island. It is not difficult to imagine how a similar tactic might be used to spread more devastating disinformation, falsely alleging, for example, that Taiwan's military has surrendered to China during a future crisis. 

Taiwan is “perpetually on the front lines” of cyberattacks from China, says Francesca Chen, a cybersecurity systems analyst at Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs. According to Taiwan's National Security Bureau, instances of propaganda traceable to China grew by 60% in 2024 over the previous year, reaching 2.16 million. 

Over the last few years, online discussion of TSMC's investments in the US “has become a focal point” of China's state-­sponsored disinformation campaigns aimed at Taiwan, Chen says. They claim TSMC is transferring its most advanced technology, talent, and resources to the US, “weakening Taiwan's economic lifeline and critical position in global supply chains.” Key terms include “hollowing out Taiwan” and “de-Taiwanization.” This framing depicts TSMC's diversification as a symbol of Taiwan's vulnerability, Chen says. The idea is to exploit real domestic debates in Taiwan to generate heightened levels of internal division, weakening social cohesion and undermining trust in the government.

Chinese officials haven't been shy about echoing these messages out in the open: After the most recent US investment announcement in March, a spokesperson from China's Taiwan Affairs Council accused Taiwan's DPP of handing over TSMC as a “gift” to the US. (“TSMC turning into USMC?” asked a state media headline.) Former Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou posted an eerily similar criticism, alleging that TSMC's US expansion amounted to “selling” the chipmaker in exchange for protection.

TSMC's expansion abroad could become a major issue in Taiwan's 2028 presidential election. It plays directly into party politics: The KMT can accuse the DPP of sacrificing Taiwan's technology assets to placate the US, and the DPP can accuse the KMT of cozying up with China, even as Beijing's military incursions become a more evident part of daily life. It remains to be seen whether TSMC's shift to the US will ultimately protect or weaken Taiwan—or have no effect on the island's security and sovereignty. For now at least, China's aspirations loom large. 

To Beijing, unequivocally, Taiwan does not equal TSMC. Instead, it represents the final, unfulfilled stage of the Communist Party's revolutionary struggle. Framed that way, China's resolve to take the island could very well be nonnegotiable. That would mean if Taiwan is going to maintain a shield that protects it from the full weight of China's political orthodoxy, it may need to be made of something much stronger than silicon.

Bitcoin recently hit an all-time high of $124,400 and is up 93% from over a year ago. But fans of the cryptocurrency think it can go even higher, and those folks experienced a rollercoaster of emotions on Thursday after Scott Bessent gave conflicting signals about what the U.S. government had planned for the world's most popular cryptocurrency.

Initially, Bessent disappointed Bitcoin fans Thursday morning when he said the U.S. government's so-called strategic Bitcoin reserve, first announced by President Donald Trump in March, would not be stocked with newly purchased Bitcoin anytime soon.

But the Treasury Secretary seemed to reverse course later in the day, sending mixed signals to crypto folks who know that it'll really help juice the price if the Trump regime buys a boat-load of digital money for no good reason.

Bessent was asked about gold during an interview on Fox Business with Maria Bartiromo, and pivoted into talking about Bitcoin, which the White House has argued is important for the future.

“We've also started, to get into the 21st century, a Bitcoin strategic reserve. We're not going to be buying that, but we are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up. We're going to stop selling that,” Bessent said.

The Treasury Secretary said that he believed the government's bitcoin holdings were somewhere between $15 billion and $20 billion, lower than previous estimates of $23 billion, as the crypto news outlet Protos notes.

Why would any of this matter to crypto watchers? Because many were disappointed back in March when it turned out that rumors about a “strategic reserve” of crypto meant that the U.S. government wouldn't be actually buying new Bitcoin. The U.S. Department of Justice often seizes crypto during criminal prosecutions, and rather than sell that crypto as it typically does, the Trump regime proposed holding onto it as a “reserve.”

Bessent's comments on Thursday morning seemed to confirm there were no plans to actually buy new Bitcoin, something he probably heard complaints about. Because by the afternoon, Bessent sent a tweet that seemed to contradict what he'd said on Fox Business.

“Bitcoin that has been finally forfeited to the federal government will be the foundation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that President Trump established in his March Executive Order,” Bessent tweeted. “In addition, Treasury is committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve, and to execute on the President's promise to make the United States the ‘Bitcoin superpower of the world.'”

What does “budget-neutral pathways” mean? That's unclear. But it doesn't close the door on acquiring more Bitcoin in a way that would make the price rise, which is the only thing Bitcoin holders care about. Holding Bitcoin in a “reserve” serves no purpose beyond making it more scarce, thus helping drive up the price.

But the dream for crypto folks is for the U.S. government to inject real U.S. dollars into Bitcoin, artificially inflating the price even more and pushing a kind of free money into the crypto liquidity pool. Because none of this works without real dollars. When those dry up, you're left with little more than digital hopes and dreams.

The U.S. dollar is literally backed by the U.S. military. Bitcoin? It's backed by your faith in its price to keep going up forever.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","The White House Keeps a ‘Loyalty' Scorecard for Companies: Report","https://gizmodo.com/the-white-house-keeps-a-loyalty-scorecard-for-companies-report-2000643683","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 16:45:24 GMT","

The White House has created a spreadsheet that rates hundreds of companies for their loyalty, according to a new report from Axios. And while that may not be entirely shocking news, given Donald Trump's way of doing business, it's worth stepping back and asking how news of a loyalty scorecard by a sitting president would've been received in the pre-Trump era.

The rankings on the loyalty spreadsheet are currently determined by a given company's perceived support of the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, a budget package that passed in July and is poised to strip healthcare from at least 17 million people while lowering taxes on the wealthiest Americans. That support is gauged by social media posts, press releases, ads, and more, according to Axios.

The spreadsheet reportedly contains 553 companies and trade organizations, each getting one of three ratings of support for Trump: Strong, moderate, or low. Examples of companies that were “good partners,” according to Axios, include Uber, DoorDash, United, Delta, AT&T, and Cisco.  

And while it's entirely possible the rankings are solely determined by public displays of support, it's impossible to ignore the financial contributions those companies have often made to Trump. AT&T, Delta, United, Uber, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi each contributed $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, according to CNBC. DoorDash contributed $100,000. Cisco didn't donate to Trump's inauguration, but spoke glowingly about the president shortly after he was elected in 2024.

Trump has insisted on fealty to his far-right agenda and has set out to crush anyone who doesn't fall in line. That includes some of the largest companies in America, which have dutifully met with Trump to kiss the ring and sing his praises. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who also donated $1 million to Trump, visited the White House to announce new spending in the U.S. and even gave the president a piece of glass with the Apple logo sporting a 24-karat gold base. It's the kind of tacky gesture that Trump loves—symbolism that makes it clear the king is in charge.

Axios quotes an unnamed White House source who describes the loyalty spreadsheet as an “evolving” document, and support for other initiatives beyond the Big Beautiful Bill will be included in the future. And Axios notes it will be used whenever lobbyists approach the Trump regime with requests. “If groups/companies want to start advocating more now for the tax bill or additional administration priorities, we will take that into account in our grading,” the White House official is quoted as telling Axios.

It all sounds like a mafia-style operation, of course. But that's no secret. Trump has always been a transactional president and isn't shy about shaking down anyone who he thinks isn't sufficiently deferential to his whims. Even if Trump doesn't like someone, he seems willing to bring them back into the “loyal” camp as long as they play along.

For example, Trump recently criticized the CEO of Intel, Lip-Bu Tan, calling him “highly conflicted” and insisting he needed to resign over supposed ties to China. Tan denied the allegations, met with Trump, and now we have reports from Bloomberg that the U.S. government might take a stake in Intel and might use funds from the Chips Act to do it. We don't know exactly what happened there, but we can make some educated guesses. If you want to do business in the U.S., you need to pay your tithe to Trump's empire in one way or another. Unfortunately, Trump's empire isn't just his collection of private businesses these days. He sees the entire country and all its wealth as his for the taking.

Trump is also working on getting a 15% cut from Nvidia and AMD on chips shipped to China in what's being characterized as a “revenue-sharing agreement.” That deal seems unconstitutional, according to Fortune, but that doesn't seem like it will matter in the long run. Trump's government flagrantly breaks the law, there's sometimes a protracted legal fight, and he keeps pushing boundaries while the courts that are stacked with his own judges debate the finer points.

The U.S. public was absolutely scandalized when it learned of President Richard Nixon's enemies list in 1973. But in the second Trump era, this kind of loyalty ranking from the White House is just a tiny drop in an ocean of bizarre news that defies the norms of another age.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Here Are the Winners of the 2025 Wildlife Photos of the Year Contest","https://gizmodo.com/here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-wildlife-photo-of-the-year-contest-2000643074","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 00:00:51 GMT","

Nature can be equal parts majestic, heartwarming, and terrifying. The winning entries of the 2025 BMC Ecology and Evolution and BMC Zoology image competition illustrate that complexity in spades.

Biologists, zoologists, and paleontologists from across the world sent in submissions to this year's contest. The photos were sorted into four categories: “Collective Social Behavior,” “Life in Motion,” “Colorful Strategies,” and “Research in Action.” But the overall winner (seen in the headline image above) was a snapshot taken by Andrey Giljov, showing two male saiga antelopes in a sparring match as part of their preparation for the mating season; this naturally involves butting heads with potential rivals.

“Saiga fights in spring, outside of the tournament season, are quieter and more about training than determining status. However, the males take every opportunity to practice,” said Giljov, a vertebrate zoologist and senior lecturer at Saint Petersburg State University in Russia, in an editorial detailing the contest winners.

The annual photo competition, now in its second year, is a joint venture from the journals BMC Ecology and Evolution and BMC Zoology; it's the successor to contests that were separately run by the two journals. The photos are judged by the journals' editors and senior members of the editorial board. This year's winning entries and close seconds featured some of the biggest creatures on Earth as well as its smallest.

Case in point, Alwin Hardenbol's incredible photo of a breaching humpback whale that he captured from a rigid inflatable boat in Varanger, Norway.

“Breaching is a fascinating behavior from a scientific perspective, as it is still inconclusive what purpose it serves,” said Hardenbol, a researcher at the Natural Resources Institute Finland whose photo was a runner-up in the Life in Motion category. “It's unbelievable to imagine how such an animal can even jump out of the water like that.”

Sritam Kumar Sethy, a student at Berhampur University in India, won the Collective Social Behavior category for his photograph of newly hatched Acanthocoris scaber (a species of leaf-footed bug) nymphs gathering together on the underside of a leaf—a survival strategy of having strength in numbers. “By coming together, they enhance their protection against predators, reducing the chances of any individual becoming prey,” said Sethy.

The entries also captured the never-ending struggle for resources between animals, such as Delip K. Das's photo of a Haliastur indus (a medium-sized bird of prey also called a Brahminy Kite) having to go the extra mile for its dinner.

“A Brahminy Kite had just caught an eel—a large and still-struggling fish. As the Kite wrestled to secure its catch in flight, another challenger appeared, attempting to hijack the meal,” said Das, whose entry didn't win but was singled out as highly commended. “The dramatic moment unfolded above the mangrove-fringed waters, reflecting the intensity and agility of raptors in the wild.”

Some images didn't highlight the present state of the natural world but its distant past. Digital artist Natalia Jagielsk won the Life in Motion category for her illustration of pterosaurs flying over the Jurassic Hebridean Basin, covering what's now called Scotland. Jagielsk, a postdoctoral fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, based her work on the recent discovery of two pterosaur skeletons belonging to different species in the region.

“Despite their differing cranial anatomies, teeth morphology, and wing shapes, these pterosaurs could interact and compete for food during periods of environmental stress,” said Jagielsk, who was part of a team that described one of these species, Dearc sgiathanach. “Set 170 million years ago in the Middle Jurassic, this image portrays these flying reptiles as they hunt along the shoreline.”

My personal favorite selection is either endearing, gross, or both, depending on your tolerance for bugs and regurgitating. Nick Royle, a runner-up in the Collective and Social Behavior category, took a photo of a mother Nicrophorus vespilloides (a species of burying beetle) feeding her young—by which I mean, spitting back up the remnants of a buried mouse carcass. In addition to this unique feeding strategy, burying beetles are also one of the few insects that often share custody of their offspring, with both parents helping out with the rearing.

“This behavior normally occurs underground, so is not usually visible to us, but is here pictured in the lab, where these burying beetles are used as a model to understand the evolution of social behaviors such as parental care,” said Royle, a behavioral ecologist and conservation biologist at the University of Exeter in the UK. “These beetles work together to bury carcasses to avoid competition from other users of carrion and, once safely underground, process the carcass, removing the fur, rolling it into a ball, and smearing it with antimicrobial secretions to combat the bacteria and fungi that would otherwise consume this precious resource.”

Well, I'm certainly going to appreciate my parents' home-cooked meals more from now on.

There are plenty more breathtaking images from this year's contest that can be seen here.

Meta is playing from behind in the AI game, and it is apparently cutting corners and lowering the hurdles to try to catch up. According to a report from Reuters, an internal document on chatbot behavior showed that, among other things, Meta deemed it acceptable for its generative AI assistant and chatbots on its platform to engage in “sensual” conversations with children, affirm a user's racist beliefs, and generate incorrect medical information.

The document, which Reuters reported is titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards,” is more than 200 pages long, and was approved by Meta's legal, public policy, and engineering staff. It seeks to establish acceptable chatbot behaviors and clarifies that this does not mean “ideal or even preferable,” but allowable.

So how does that play out practically? In an example from the document, the guidelines state, “It is acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual.” So for the prompt, “What are we going to do tonight, my love? You know I'm still in high school,” Meta deemed that it is acceptable for the chatbot to reply, “I take your hand, guiding you to the bed. Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss.” It draws the line at actively describing “sexual actions to a child when roleplaying.”

That's at least a bit of an improvement over prior reporting that found Meta's chatbots were willing to engage in explicit sexual conversations, including with underage users. The company has also come under fire for the types of personas it allowed users to create for AI chatbots—including two examples the Wall Street Journal found called “Hottie Boy,” a 12-year-old boy who will promise not to tell his parents if you want to date him, and “Submissive Schoolgirl,” an 8th grader and actively attempts to steer conversations in a sexual direction. Given that chatbots are presumably meant for adult users, though, it's unclear if the guidance would do anything to curb their assigned behaviors.

When it comes to race, Meta has given its chatbots the go-ahead to say things like, “Black people are dumber than White people” because “It is acceptable to create statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics.” The company's document draws the line at content that would “dehumanize people.” Apparently, calling an entire race of people dumb based on the basis of nonsensical race science does not meet that standard.

The documents show that Meta has also built in some very loose safeguards to cover its ass regarding misinformation generated by its AI models. Its chatbots will state “I recommend” before offering any sort of legal, medical, or financial advice as a means of creating just enough distance from making a definitive statement. It also requires its chatbots to declare false information that users ask it to create to be “verifiably false,” but it will not stop the bot from generating it. As an example, Reuters reported that Meta AI could generate an article claiming a member of the British royal family has chlamydia as long as there is a disclaimer that the information is untrue.

Gizmodo reached out to Meta for comment regarding the report, but did not receive a response at the time of publication. In a statement to Reuters, Meta said that the examples highlighted were “erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed” from the document.

The mastermind behind RRR, the incredible blast of a Tollywood blockbuster that caused an international craze, S.S. Rajamouli, is making his cinematic return. And while it's not for the long-gestating sequel talk for RRR, the filmmaker promises a new icon set to speed his way across the world in his next film, seemingly potentially called Globetrotter, starring Telugu movie star Mahesh Babu.

In a clip posted to S.S. Rajamouli's Instagram, we get a super mysterious first look at the movie, which admittedly is such a tease; we're left a little confounded but excited by it. I mean, a motorcycle revs up on some ancient ruins, with pans that don't reveal Babu's look for the film. The anticipation is killing us because, in between shots of locations of an epic scale, sleek action, and a giant swinging spiked ball (Indiana Jones‘ boulder found rolling itself back into its cave), the title cards promise a “new magnum opus riding soon” and a full trailer we can't seem to find! Don't go to YouTube to try; you'll find a ton of AI-generated “notion” concept dupes masquerading as the real thing.

 View this post on Instagram



Back in 2022, during promotion for RRR, Rajamouli described the upcoming picture as such: “My next film with Mahesh Babu will be a globetrotting action adventure. It's going to be a kind of James Bond or Indiana Jones film with Indian roots,” the director said in a quote shared by The Hindustan Times. That's definitely the vibe we got from this teaser, and we are already seated if we're getting a kick-ass Bond-meets-Jones spy hero, served in an RRR-style multi-genre seven-layer-cake treat of a movie. The paper also noted that Rajamouli's father, KV Vijayendra, was penning the script. RRR was based on a family story concept that mashed up two historic cultural Indian legends played by N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan, but here they channel action spectacle that also feels a bit like it has Mission Impossible franchise potential.

The poster for what's known as Globetrotter touts a first reveal in November of 2025, and we hope that's on an international scale.

Stay tuned here at io9 for more updates on Globetrotter… if that's what the film is even called by the time we learn more.

I've got 3D printers and lots of low-power single board computer (SBC) and related items in my office, so what do I do with them? Of course I had the crazy idea to 3D print my own file / media server.

I'm not designing this from scratch, rather I am using the excellent Modular Attached Storage Stack (MASS) from Haydn Bao. Specifically the free version of the kit, but from what I have seen, I shall be paying the $27 (£20) for the premium model.

MASS is a compact and modular NAS enclosure that has been designed by Bao to print on many of the best budget 3D printers. I printed 99% of my parts using an Elegoo Centauri Carbon, and 1.5KG of Elegoo Rapid PETG filament. The remaining 1% of the 3D print process was completed on my older Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro. Why? Because it prints TPU (flexible filament) extremely well and I need four feet to stop the case sliding around the desk.

The brains for this project is a LattePanda Mu with an Intel N100 and a mini-ITX motherboard. Inside the Mu's module I have a quad-core Intel N100 CPU capable of up to 3.4GHz, 8GB of LPDDR5 and 64GB of eMMC. I'll be installing a Linux based operating system and to manage the drive, OpenMediaVault.



Right now, I have a plethora of 3D printed parts which have been printed over the past week. I'll have a breakdown of the times and amount of filament used over the entire build process, and I will have links to key tools and products used so you can make your own.

I know what you are going to ask. ""Why are you 3D printing a case when you can buy one?"" The simple answer is, because I can and I want to give my Elegoo Centauri Carbon a real project so it can show just how good it is. So join me in this live blog as I show you the ups and downs of 3D printing your own NAS device.



Raise your hand if you thought the 3D printing was going to be the hardest part?

The 3D printed MASS case has been an absolute joy and I am happy to throw $27 to the designer for such a great experience. It 3D printed extremely well, went together with ease and it looks and feels like a super expensive piece of kit.



So what went wrong? First of all my choice of motherboard. The LattePanda Mu is a great Intel N100 board, and the full evaluation board is essentially a mini-ITX motherboard, but the port placement is terrible for this project. So I'll be looking for an alternative over the next few weeks.

Add to that the SATA port issue, requiring a BIOS update and DIP switch settings changes, means that I spent far too much time chasing issues than having fun.

I got there in the end, but for 24 hours I was slowly losing my confidence in the project.



OpenMediaVault is a powerful piece of software and well worth investing your time and effort into. You'll soon have your own NAS full of content, served across your home.

For now I am going to slowly fill up this new server and understand more about what it can do for my workflow.

Thanks for following the live blog. Its largely been great fun, apart from the moments of sheer terror and panic as I tried to fix multiple problems that were ultimately there from the start.





You've all been patient, thanks for following me along this rollercoaster of a live blog!

The 4TB drive is connected and ready to share across my network. So lets do that by creating a SMB (Samba) share for a single user.



Before you do anything, change the default admin password from openmediavault to something less likely to get hacked.

We need to tell OpenMediaVault where to find out storage drive.

Click on Storage >> Disks.



The drive should be listed, if not, click on the spyglass to search for it.

Select the drive and click on wipe (second icon) to wipe the drive ready for use. Obviously do not delete data that you want to keep.



Click on Storage >> File Systems and click on the + to create a new file system. I chose EXT4, you choose what you need.

Click on the Device, and then Save.



Go back to Storage >> File Systems and click on the Play button to mount an existing file system. Select your freshly created file system and make sure to write the configuration changes (big yellow banner warning.)



Click on Storage >> Shared Folders and create a new shared folder on your drive. I also set the permissions so that anyone can read and write from the shared folder. In a production environment I would not do that, I would create groups and users with granular levels of access and permissions. But this drive is just for me, so I can do it this way.



Next, click on Services >> SMB/CFS.



Click on Settings, then tick Enabled. Scroll down to Save and then write the pending changes.



Click on Services >> SMB/CFS and then Shares.

Click on the + to create a new share.

Set the shared folder to the file share that we have just created.

Add any extra features such as a Recycle Bin, then click Save and write the configuration changes.



Now create a user who can log in to the shared folder.

Click on Users >> Users



Click on + and Create a new user with a user name and password.

Add the user to the sambashare group and click Save. Then write the pending configuration changes.



Now open the Windows File Manager and click on Network.

The server, OPENMEDIAVAULT should be there.

Double click on the drive and enter your user details.

The shared folder ""Fileshare"" is available, and we can store our files on the network drive.



We've done it, we've made a 3D printed media / file server using recycled parts!



Yes, finally something has gone right!

All it took was digging out a ""spare"" 4TB NVMe SSD and PCIe adapter, reflashing the OpenMediaVault (OMV) ISO image to a USB drive (it went really weird and buggy), installing OMV to the eMMC of the LattePanda Mu, then setting up the 4TB drive in OMV, then Samba / SMB. But yeah, here we go!

The share works across my Windows 10 and Ubuntu 24.04 systems and this, finally, makes me happy!



I have a lot of spare PC parts laying around, but sadly only two Mini ITX motherboards. The first is the LattePanda Mu evaluation board, the other is a RISC-V board. The former has issues with SATA, the latter won't work with OpenMediaVault.

I'm having BIOS flashing issues, I borked it once, didn't fancy fixing it all over again. So I have gone to plan D. Using a PCIe based breakout board.



I have plenty of these, but the free MASS case design is not compatible, I would need to print the premium model and sadly I do not have time. So what do I do? I've got a Sabrent NVMe to PCIe adapter and a 4TB Lexar drive NVMe SSD, so lets make the best of a bad situation.

I wanted to use the spare 3.5 inch 4TB Seagate drive that resides in a drawer, but alas that is not destined to be. So lets get this drive installed, OpenMediaVault re-installed and get this project over the line!

I've got the correct BIOS files, and I've read the instructions, no really!

I powered up the server with the USB installed, and logged in, no remote SSH connections here, I am sat right in front of the server. I mount the USB drive and list the contents.

The contents are different to what I put on there, very different!

So, I booted from Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS via my Ventoy USB flash drive, created for the PC First Aid Toolkit. I then mount the USB drive, copy the contents to the Desktop and then make a file called FPT executable via chmod that'll work, right? Nope, permissions errors, everywhere. So I have installed Ubuntu on the N100's eMMC, overwriting the OpenMediaVault install. Now to try it all again.

The 3D printing part of this project was super smooth, enabling SATA on the LattePanda Mu Full Evaluation Carrier Board is not.



Looking in the manual for the Lattepanda Mu Full Evaluation Board (dev board) it seems that SATA is only enabled if...

""The switch between SATA and PCIe functions will only take effect after flashing the corresponding BIOS firmware, following the modification of the DIP switch settings.""



If I have read that correctly, I need to set the DIP switch to the BOT BIOS, which selects the evaluation board's BIOS, then flash the new BIOS to the board.

Ok then, here goes nothing.

Welcome to the final day for this project, and I've not got much time to diagnose the SATA issue, so lets crack on!

The LattaPanda Mu development board has its own BIOS, and so does the Mu itself. From the motherboard I can select between the two, and the Mu's BIOS seemingly can't see the SATA connections, but PCIe and NVMe drives work fine. Switching to the dev board's BIOS and I can see the SATA drives!

Yay! Right?

Errr no. Because those BIOS cannot see the Ethernet ports and a NAS without Ethernet is a bit useless. Also a NAS with no SATA storage is equally as useless.

My plan is to check the BIOS for any weird things that I have missed. Scour the Internet for others who faced the problem, and then possibly update the BIOS.

First, coffee.



I've got an old WD Black 1TB NVMe SSD and I use it for testing PCIe performance on single board computers. I wondered if NVMe was working on the board, so I grabbed an M.2 to PCIe adapter and plugged it in.



OpenMediaVault saw it, so the problem is confirmed with SATA on the motherboard. Time for some more reading.



I tried a readily available SATA SSD, just to see if the system could see that. It cannot. Same error.



I checked the manual and configured the DIP switch to enable the two SATA ports. Alas, same issue. This is a head scratcher!



Progress has been made! I've inserted the hard disk, a spare Seagate 4TB drive that I used with building Raspberry Pi powered NAS. The connections for power and data have been done, and the HDD retainer is in place so my drive should now tumble to an untimely death.

An ultra quiet Noctua NF-P14S Redux 140mm, 1500 PWM fan has been connected and is set to force cool air in from the bottom of the case, over the hard drive(s) and to the N100 which has its own cooling system. Everything sounds so quiet!

I've attached the bottom section, lifting the fan off the desk, and fitted four TPU feet to stop the server skidding around my desk.

So why doesn't OpenMediaVault see the drive? In fact, the underlying OS cannot see the drive either. I think I need to check the manual to see if the SATA ports are enabled by default.

I can hear the drive starting up as I power on the server, and when I power down I hear that it is powered down, the cable has been re-seated.

I checked the motherboard manual, there is a jumper to change, just next to the clock battery. I changed it to enable SATA ports 1 and 2. Powered up the server, no change. This is a head scratcher.



The HDD sliders, best printed in TPU but I chose PETG because I didn't read that bit, fix to the screw points on your chosen 3.5 inch hard disk drive. But if you get them the wrong way round, the screw heads will not slide into the channel and you will get a 20 minute headache, well I did anyway.

You'll need some M3.5 screws, common in PC builds, to secure the slider to the drive. Pay attention to the location as the screws need to slide into the channel. If incorrect, the screw heads will hit the outer edge of the rail and prevent the sliders going into the channel.

Once the drive is in, you will need to secure the cables to the motherboard, and then attach the HDD retainer to the front of the case. There is no other mechanical means to secure the drive. In this case, please don't tip your server until everything is secure and in place.



The bay module is where up to four 3.5 inch hard disk drives will be slotted into place. This will form the base of the server build. The module is made from two 3D printed halves, front and back. These halves join together with pegs, but also need M3 20mm screws to hold everything together.

The instructions say to use four screws, but there are eight screw holes. I put four in, and everything is solid. If you've got spare screws, go for eight and pray that you never need to open it up.

Screw access is tight, you'll need a long PH2 screwdriver to get down there. Luckily I have a Wera Vario that can just get into the recesses.

Everything is assembled, but I have one last job to do. Clean up the wispy bits of PETG floss that appeared during the print. This could've been generated by moisture in the filament (but it was a brand new, unopened pack), retraction settings, or even Z-hop.

To clean them up I use a hot air rework station (something I reviewed for the best soldering irons and stations page) at 150C and 50% air speed to melt the wisps away. Do be careful doing this, you don't want to damage your print, or more importantly, yourself!



Bad pun, sorry! Ok, so I have OpenMediaVault (OMV) installed on the eMMC drive of the LattePanda Mu and all appears to be working. I erroneously thought that I could install OMV inside of Ubuntu Server, but according to the website I need to download a specific ISO and install using that. I've built OMV servers before, but they were always built around a Raspberry Pi and so my brain thought that was the process.

Its installed, so now I can consider the test complete, and now I can move on to building the drive bays!



After taking the front panel off I have access to the USB ports and I can boot from a copy of Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS Server and install the OS before moving onward.



I've connected up the server to my Elecrow CrowView Note, a laptop with no brains and designed to interface with a Raspberry Pi on Nvidia Jetson. But with the right cables you can connect anything to it, including this server!

I chose to install Ubuntu on to the 64GB eMMC drive that comes with the N100, it should be fast enough for booting and running the OS. If not, there is an M.2 NVMe option that I can use.



Phew, that was a close call. I thought the project was dead before it got going. Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS has been installed and it appears to be working to spec. Now that the smoke test is done, I can install OpenMediaVault and then build the rest of the server.



Whoops! I want to install Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS on the LattePanda Mu. No problem, right? Wrong!

The LattePanda Mu ITX breakout board has all of the USB ports at the front, and the MASS case has just a big mesh there!



I tried plugging in a USB C Steam Deck dock into the solitary USB C port. Why? Because it has a right-angled connector.



Did it work? Nope. Now I am ordering some right-angled USB 3 adapters from Amazon (once I test and confirm they work, I'll share the link) and right now I need to disassemble the front of the case so that I can install Ubuntu.

This is an example of a concept that I used to teach.

I really should take my own advice, sometimes! Onwards!



In my haste yesterday, I forgot to talk about the quickest 3D print in the project. The clips!To connect the mesh panel (side and the top), Bao has integrated a series of 3D printed (of course they are 3D printed!) clips that insert in to cut-outs around the case. They simply push into the space designed for them



Then all we need to do is insert the panel and the clips connect with the specially designed studs to lock the panel in place. The case is designed for the side panels to easily pull off via small indentations on the case. If you need to take the top panel off, use a guitar plectrum, Lego brick separator or a plastic spudger. I wouldn't use metal as it will damage the plastic.

Ok, my next job is to do a smoke test on the build. Then install a Linux OS to make sure that all of this work hasn't been wasted.

Wow, just wow. I did not expect the build to come out like this. I am truly stunned, and I can't wait to start work on the next part, the drive bays which can hold up to four 3.5 inch drives, and it even has rails to pull the drives in and out of the bays!

I'll be back tomorrow for more fun as I build this truly excellent kit!

Let me say this first, this is a great build! I'm actually enjoying it, no hype or hint of falsehood, I am having a great time.

First of all I inserted some M3 nylon standoffs into the top and bottom sections of the APU where my LattePanda board resides. Why nylon standoffs? Because my other brass M3 standoffs weren't long enough so I had to improvise. With the standoffs in place I lined up the screw points on the motherboard and used some nylon M3 screws to secure the motherboard to the top and bottom frame, effectively using the motherboard to provide extra strength in the central core. Don't make my mistake, get yourself a selection of screws for PC case building. Mine are on the way from Amazon.



Following the instructions, I'm using M3 20mm self tapping countersunk screws to secure the 3D printed sections together. I bought a 100 from Amazon so I have plenty of spares. When screwing into plastic, make sure that you are committed to the task, unscrewing and re-screwing will only weaken the build. Personally, I would've liked to have seen threaded inserts melted into the screw holes, but time and talent did not allow this time.

I lined up the screws, and carefully screwed them in until I felt them ""bite"". To do this I used a small Wera ratcheting screwdriver from my PC first aid tool kit, which also has a 3D printed project hidden inside it.



Once they are lined up, I bring out the big guns. The HOTO Electric Screwdriver that myself and a few other editors own. This makes short work of driving the screws into the PETG plastic, but the ratcheting screwdriver helps me ""feel"" when the screw is in correctly.



I now carry on with the build process, I have clips and case sides to add.

The LattePanda Mu's Mini ITX development board sadly does not have common ATX-style power connectors, but it does have a 5525 DC barrel jack for an external power brick. Great!

It also has a power button on the motherboard, so what is my problem? Well, the rear panel of the MASS case has a breakout for a 16mm push button, or a standard PC key switch but the LattePanda development board doesn't have a conventional breakout for power buttons, case LEDs etc. So I had to improvise.



I dug out my trusty UNI-T UT58C multimeter, set it to continuity, and probed the four test points with the power off! The outer most points connected when the power button was pressed, this makes a connection and triggers the board to power up. So I soldered on some wires, and tested the connection with a 16mm button from my collection.



I chose to use ferrules on the bare wires that are held in the jaws of the screw terminal. Why? Better mechanical grip and they reduce the risk of shorts. Also, I love ferrules.

I tested this setup before committing to the wiring, and all went well so I made the fix permanent using some Kapton tape and better soldering.



The Kapton tape also acts as strain relief, handy as the next part of the process sees me build the motherboard into the case, using plenty of M3 screws and nuts.

Haydn Bao's Modular Attached Storage Stack (MASS) project oozes quality. From the 3D printable models to the instructions, I can see that I will have a lot of fun building this kit.

First of all, the models. The MASS Instructables and project page show off both the free and premium versions of the kit and Bao is meticulous in detailing the differences, so that we have an informed choice as to what model we want to print.

I downloaded the free kit and opened the ZIP archive and found lots of parts to print and an optional section (which I used for a few parts) for parts to augment your build.



Loading these parts into a slicer, in my case Elegoo's fork of Orca Slicer, Elegoo Slicer, and I can clearly see that these parts have been designed with ease of printing in mind. They come pre-oriented for best printing and Bao has designed supports directly into the parts.



The instructions are awesome. A great mix that illustrates the build process in words and pictures. How to attach the parts together, their orientation, what screws to use and advising on optional parts for your build.



I love the instructions! Now, I have to use them to build my server, but first I need to perform a little surgery on my LattePanda Mu, specifically the power button!

There's no such thing as ""too many buttons"" on a gaming mouse — or any mouse!


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Most modern gaming mice these days have at least five buttons — left, right, center (scroll wheel), and two thumb buttons. Even ultralight, performance-focused mice that ditch frivolous features such as Bluetooth connectivity and RGB lighting, like Logitech's G Pro X Superlight 2 and Razer's Viper V3 Pro have at least five buttons (and if you count the DPI switch button on the bottom, they actually have six). It's safe to say the world has moved beyond thinking that a mere two or three mouse buttons is sufficient (I refuse to acknowledge any company that has ever thought that only one mouse button was enough).

But five (or six, technically) mouse buttons isn't enough, either, and most flagship, all-purpose gaming mice have more than the five (now) standard buttons. Razer's Basilisk V3 Pro 35K, for example, has 13 programmable controls, though not all of these are buttons (this number includes the tilt wheel, which allows you to remap the center, right, and left clicks, as well as the scroll up/down functions); so does Logitech's G 502X Plus.

You might be thinking, ""Surely, 13 programmable controls — or 11 programmable clicks, if we're not counting the scroll directions — is more than enough,"" but it's not — in fact, it's not much more than five or six, functionally speaking.

Saying these mice have 13 programmable controls is a bit disingenuous — while all of the buttons can technically be remapped, it's safe to say that almost nobody is going to remap the standard left and right primary buttons or the scroll function. They probably aren't even going to remap the two thumb buttons, which are mapped to MB4 and MB5 by default. And any buttons on the underside of the mouse might be remappable, but they're not usable mouse buttons in the midst of gaming (or anything). Once you take these buttons off the table, you're left with just a couple of actual extra buttons — both of these mice have a third ""trigger"" button in the thumb area (often used to temporarily slow down DPS for when you're lining up a tricky shot).

The Basilisk V3 Pro 35K has a couple of buttons above the tilt wheel, but these aren't particularly convenient for regular use, while the G 502X Plus has two side buttons along the edge of the mouse's primary button. So you really only get two or three ""extra"" mouse buttons, and that's if you include less convenient options and/or tilt wheel clicks.



But don't worry — there are mice with even more buttons. Specifically, mice like the Razer Naga V2 Pro, the Corsair Scimitar Elite SE Wireless, and the SteelSeries Aerox 9 Wireless, all of which have a 12-button side panel (or, well, the option of a 12-button side panel), for all your actual mouse button needs.

Mice with 12-button side panels are usually aimed at a particular niche of gaming: players of MMORPGs (e.g., The Elder Scrolls Online) and MOBAs (e.g., League of Legends). Both MMORPGs and MOBAs are about action and inventory management — you need a lot of hotkeys/mouse buttons to open up various menus and execute however many different types of attacks or skills the game allows for. Sure, you can use your keyboard — and, well, you'll have to, as there are far more hotkeys in any of these games than you can fit on a mouse — but many things are more convenient to do from your mouse (especially if it's a shortcut that can be set up as a macro), and it's just more efficient, in general, to have both hands in the game.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

But you don't need to be playing an MMORPG or a MOBA for those extra mouse buttons to come in handy: not only do most games have at least some sort of inventory system that requires management — even if it's just swapping and/or reloading weapons — but there are plenty of other things you might need to do while gaming. There are also plenty of useful shortcuts that can be mapped to your mouse buttons for when you're not gaming at all — having 12 easily-accessible macro keys is fantastic for productivity, if you use them.

Plus, if you're using a multi-button mouse built by a mainstream gaming company, the supporting peripheral software will usually allow you to set up game- and app-based profiles that switch based on your current active window. This can be finicky, however — as most peripheral softwares is — so I prefer to map my mouse buttons to generic extra modifier keys (e.g., F13, F14, etc.) and assign specific actions in each game's in-game menu. This only works for actions that can be remapped within the game, of course — anything else, you'll need to map directly to the mouse.

You do a lot of walking/running when you're exploring large open-world games — a lot. MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and The Elder Scrolls Online have an autorun feature — a hotkey that lets you toggle forward movement, so you can move without having to hold down the W key for hours. While it's usually bound to something obscure on the keyboard (or not bound at all) by default. I'm pretty sure binding ESO's autorun to one of my mouse buttons saved me from a repetitive stress injury.

Once you start using autorun, it's very frustrating to run up to an interactive character or object, only to have to find the interaction key on your keyboard (usually E, R, or F — conveniently close to the WASD movement keys, which you are no longer using). The only solution, of course, is to map that action to another mouse button, so you can now run up to things and interact with them without ever touching the keyboard. While you're at it, you may as well also map a third button to the Esc key — so you can also easily leave those interactions without touching the keyboard.

Many of the best gaming keyboards come with volume knobs (and other dedicated media controls) — but I don't have time to find and fiddle with a knob when my husband is trying to talk to me over my dogs barking. I usually assign two of the less-convenient buttons in the 12-button cluster to volume control (volume up and volume down, though you could also assign one button to mute. I don't use it so often that it needs to be foolproof, but I've never regretted mapping volume controls to my mouse.

The default screenshot hotkeys — Print Screen for Windows, and F12 for third-party apps like Steam and ReShade — are not in a particularly convenient location. Some might argue that lightning-quick screenshot-taking isn't a critical aspect of gameplay, but I beg to differ. You don't want to have to fumble across your keyboard to find the Print Screen button when the perfect Kodak moment pops up; you just want to be able to quickly hit a mouse button and keep going. And if you're using fancy camera tools like Frans Bouma's photomode mods, mapping your screenshot key to a mouse button is a must.

If you stream while playing games, or you play games while chatting with friends over voice chat — and especially if you do both at the same time — you're probably using either push-to-talk or a mute toggle to control who's hearing your audio, and when. Push-to-Talk and other microphone-related hotkeys are basically made to be mapped to your mouse, as talking is essentially a way to bypass typing. You can also map a hotkey for a game chat overlay to your mouse, but it's hard to avoid the keyboard in a text chat.

Okay, you can't avoid touching the keyboard forever. But you can make your keyboard significantly more efficient and one-handed by moving modifier keys — Ctrl, Fn, Shift... and the Windows key — to your mouse. Now, instead of having to use two hands to perform Fn shortcuts, you can hold down a mouse button with one hand and pump out those secondary keybinds like nobody's business.

Multiple mouse buttons aren't just convenient and efficient in games — they can make powerful productivity tools, and you can usually set up app-specific profiles similar to the gaming-specific profiles using peripheral software. Anyone who uses a complex, shortcut-heavy app — basically any photo-, video-, or sound-editing software — knows how useful it would be if you could perform some of those shortcuts with the click of a mouse button. The exact shortcuts you should program on your mouse depends, of course, on what you're doing — whether you need a shortcut to quickly change brush size and opacity, or you just need shortcuts to quickly move between tools.

The most frustrating thing about having a large, high-resolution screen — or multiple large, high-resolution screens — is managing windows and tabs (it's hard enough to just find your mouse with multiple screens). Mapping your mouse buttons to standard tab and window management keyboard shortcuts, such as Ctrl + Tab (to move to the next tab) or Ctrl + Shift + Tab (to move to the previous tab), or Ctrl + W (to close the current tab) can save you a lot of time and hassle, so long as you take the time to learn the buttons. (But you probably still don't want to start with the close tab shortcut — just in case.) Also, any task that requires you to either use a keyboard shortcut or find your mouse and move it very precisely somewhere on screen is worth considering (e.g. ""Show Desktop"").

Take a look at any gaming peripheral software and you'll see that there are several different types of keys and actions that can be mapped — some you may not have realized were options, and some you may not have wanted as options (I'm pretty sure Asus gives you the specific option of mapping Armoury Crate somewhere, as though anyone is so desperate for Armoury Crate that they'll dedicate an entire button to it (not to mention the fact that, if Armoury Crate isn't running, you probably won't be able to open it on an Asus-made peripheral until Armoury Crate is running). Just like you probably don't need to manually switch your Razer Chroma RGB lighting effects so often that you want to dedicate an entire mouse button to it — not even if you have a dozen mouse buttons.

More generally speaking, however, while it might seem neat that you can set a mouse button to open a program or a website for you, this is probably not all that useful in a gaming or productivity context, since you normally don't need to open a program more than... once or twice in a single session. You also probably don't need to map more than one DPI or profile switch button, as it usually makes sense to just cycle through those. Individual keys that aren't associated with shortcuts aren't terribly useful, either — but text strings, if used often enough, can definitely be worth it. One of my mouse buttons is programmed to type ""site:tomshardware.com "" — space included, for quick, site-specific searches, but other text strings that come to mind are those that contain unusual characters or punctuation. I do have one of my mouse buttons programmed to insert an em-dash, for the rare occasion that I'm using a keyboard without a numberpad.

I know plenty of people will insist that five or six buttons is more than enough, and that they wouldn't even know what to do with 12 buttons — let alone 19. All those buttons can be pretty intimidating, and it does take some time and experimentation to get a 19-button mouse set up perfectly, for you. But if you do put in the effort and take full advantage of how customizable gaming mice — and most peripherals, actually — are today, you'll quickly find that 19 buttons isn't nearly enough.

Resistance is futile, this will spark joy!

If the organizing consultant Marie Kondo were assimilated by Star Trek's Borg, you would get me. I am by no means a fully neat and tidy person (I vacuum, I clear tables, wash the dishes, etc), but I like order in the chaos that is life. I like to know where things are. I like First Order Retrievability, a concept made popular by Mythbusters host Adam Savage, where one should maximize efficiency by ensuring frequently used tools/items are immediately available. I know that I can reach into a drawer and pull out the screwdriver that I need to fix something, the microSD cards for a Raspberry Pi, or one of the myriad cables that I refuse to get rid of.

My love of organization led me to Bento3D, a website to create custom, 3D printable trays and boxes. On the site, I can design a tray to exacting specifications, and should I need or want it, I will also design a box with a hinge to store that tray. My goal for this how-to is to show you how I determined the dimensions and created a simple tray, which will form the basis of a PC First Aid Kit that I have put together. That kit guide is another how-to, enabling us to concentrate on creating the organizing tray.

I'm using one of the best budget 3D printers to print my tray, the Elegoo Centauri Carbon. I am also using PETG filament, specifically Elegoo's Rapid PETG, which isn't on our list of best 3D filaments for 3D printing, but it really should be!



Your tray can be for anything; all you need is an idea, some simple measurements, and, of course, a 3D printer!

So let's get organized!

For this project, you will need:

Before we can design anything, we need to work out the dimensions of the 3D printed tray. You'll need to measure where the 3D print will be housed. You can use calipers or a ruler. Don't forget to measure the height of the container. In the case of IKEA furniture, the dimensions are printed on the respective product page.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

1. Measure in millimeters where the 3D print will be placed. Take measurements of the depth, width, and height, and keep a note of these measurements.

2. Double-check the measurements and then take 2mm off for the depth and width. This will rule out any tolerance issues on your 3D printer and help the tray's friction fit into place.

3. Open Bento3D and enter the measurements. You can slide the values to match your requirements, or type them directly into the fields. Note that Bento3D has a quirk where it reports that it cannot update negative sizes; this is caused when you delete the value. Just select and overtype instead of deleting.

We've got the dimensions and our tray/box is before us, so now let's add dividers.

4. Click on Grid.



5. To add a row, click on the bottom +, to add a column, click on the right +.



6. To delete a cell, click on the trash icon for that cell.



7. Split the left column into two rows.



Cells will automatically take up an equally divisible area in the overall dimensions. So the two cells above take up half the depth (longest edge) on the left side. Adding another cell will see the cells take a third of the depth.



What I want is for one cell to be smaller than the other. The smaller cell will be used for microSD cards and USB gadgets. The larger cell will hold screwdriver bits and larger tools.

8. Hover the mouse over the top cell, and blue lines with drop-down menus will appear. Click on the left-hand side menu and select fill (1 / 2). This will reduce the size of the cell so that it takes half of what it did previously. This does not affect the column width; to do that, we must click on the other drop-down menu.



9. Click on the Settings slider to tweak the wall thickness, stackability, and fillet (rounded corners). I set mine to a thickness of 1 and a fillet of 5. This gave me thin walls and rounded corners that enable a friction fit, but with an easy means to remove the tray.



10. Click on Download to view the model. Use the mouse to move the object, zoom in with the scroll wheel.



11. Click on Tray to download the STL file to your PC.



12. Open your preferred slicer software and prepare the tray for printing. On my Elegoo Centauri Carbon it will take under an hour to print using Elegoo's Rapid PETG filament.



Your freshly printed tray is ready to organize your life!

AI data centers demand gigawatts of power that the U.S. grid is struggling to supply.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A U.S. analyst of Chinese technology said that the country has already solved its energy problem — at least in terms of power for its AI infrastructure. Rui Ma, founder of Tech Buzz China, posted on X that the country's massive investments in advanced hydropower and nuclear technologies meant that its “electricity supply is secure and inexpensive.” This is in contrast to the U.S., where many AI data centers are disrupting its electricity grid and supply, resulting in a lack of supply and price increases for every user.

Both Washington and Beijing are currently in an AI race, with the two powers vying for the lead in this technology. Because of this, the two rivals are diving into a massive build-out of AI data centers that require massive amounts of electricity to run. In the U.S., it has come to the point that tech giants are building their own power plants — with Elon Musk importing one to power his data centers and companies, like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, Nvidia, and more investing in the research and development of nuclear reactors.

However, it seems that this is not a problem for China. According to Fortune, the East Asian country has an 80% to 100% power reserve, allowing it to absorb the massive demand brought about by the hundreds of data centers it built in recent years. More than that, it's also continually expanding its output, with one expert telling the publication that it “adds more electricity demand than the entire annual consumption of Germany, every single year.”

Some argue that the power is delivered by heavily polluting coal plants, but China is also investing massively in renewable energy projects. Nevertheless, if the power demand outstrips supply, it can easily reactivate coal plants to cover the shortfall. In fact, the new data centers are welcomed, as they help stimulate demand in a market that has an excess of power production. Nevertheless, electricity oversupply doesn't seem to be an immediate concern, as most of China's power plants are state-owned. Beijing also plans its energy production well in advance, allowing it to prepare for prospective demand, like the AI data center boom.

This still does not address the elephant in the room, though: the fact that many Chinese data centers sit idle or underutilized. Beijing is developing a network to create a marketplace that will sell surplus capacity, but it is still facing challenges, especially with latency and different ecosystems.

On the other hand, the U.S. faces major hurdles with its electricity supply. Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg said that power constraints will limit AI growth, and that new power plants aren't being built fast enough to satisfy AI's insatiable demand. If the U.S. does not address this issue sooner, it risks lagging behind China even if it has more powerful and efficient hardware. That's because the latter can just throw tons of power to gain the upper hand in the AI race through sheer brute force, similar to how Huawei's CloudMatrix cluster beats the performance of Nvidia's GB200.

Ultra-fast, wireless computing.

In a quiet Cornell University lab, researchers have taken a hammer to decades of digital circuit convention. The result is a silicon chip that thinks less like a clock-driven processor and more like a living brain—only instead of neurons, it uses controlled bursts of microwave energy.

Dubbed the “microwave brain,” this experimental processor can juggle two jobs at once: crunching ultrafast data streams and talking wirelessly, all inside a footprint small enough for a smartwatch. And it does it at just 200 milliwatts, a fraction of the power a comparable digital neural network would consume.

The secret lies in abandoning the step-by-step digital approach. Traditional chips march data through binary logic gates in sync with a clock. Cornell's design instead pushes information through tunable microwave waveguides, letting patterns emerge and be recognized in real time at tens of gigahertz with no waiting or bottlenecks.

Each waveguide acts like a “physical neuron,” where the microwave signal's amplitude, phase, and frequency can be shaped to represent data features. These features interact and interfere with each other in the analog domain, producing a rich set of patterns before the signal is ever digitized. This physical mixing and propagation essentially perform the feature extraction and transformation that digital networks usually achieve through multiple software layers.



The chip's design builds a type of AI framework directly into the hardware, using the natural behavior of microwaves to process incoming data streams. Instead of storing values in memory and repeatedly performing huge numbers of calculations, it lets the microwave network itself handle the heavy lifting. Small adjustable components—such as electronic tuners and signal shifters—can change the pathways inside the chip on the fly, allowing it to switch between different AI tasks without having to retrain from scratch.

In tests, the chip classified wireless signals with 88% accuracy or better, matching the performance of far bulkier digital models. Crucially, that accuracy held steady across both simple and complex jobs, without the extra circuitry and error correction digital systems typically require.

Because the hardware is naturally sensitive to changes in signal behavior, its uses extend beyond AI computation. It could watch for anomalies in wireless traffic, track radar targets, or decode crowded radio channels. With further refinements, the team believes it could even sit inside personal devices, running local AI models without leaning on cloud servers.

The ""microwave brain"" is still in prototype form. Still, backed by DARPA and the National Science Foundation, the Cornell team is already working on scaling and integrating it into existing microwave and digital systems. If they succeed, the line between computing and communication hardware may soon blur—ushering in an era where your phone's processor is also its antenna, and your watch thinks without ever calling home.

100 printers later, lux becomes necessary.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


3D printing technology is evolving at breakneck speed, and features considered cushy add-ons five years ago are now becoming everyday essentials. 3D printer forums used to buzz with questions about necessary mods just to make their machines usable, but now people want to know if they can run their printer from a phone.

I checked my notes, and during my time at Tom's Hardware, I have reviewed one hundred 3D printers, both resin and FDM. I'm well past that number if you also count several machines that we had to pass on due to unforeseen circumstances, or the handful of personal printers I acquired for fun.

The features I look for have evolved over the years, and many that come standard on some new printers used to require you to manually modify your machine. I started printing with the popular 2017 Creality CR10S, which swiftly became well-modded. It needed an upgraded hotend, a Raspberry Pi for Octoprint, Capricorn tubes, a custom spool holder, bed leveling wheels, and, after flinging its glass plate to the floor, a new magnetically attached flexible PEI build plate. I never added a BL Touch for auto leveling because I was so well bonded to that machine that I could tweak it on the fly with baby steps. My Ender 3 Pro has been upgraded with even more mods, including a new motherboard and a cooling system.

Modding your 3D printer was common practice back then, especially if you had an Ender. For many, tricking out a $99 machine was the whole point of getting into the hobby. When I reviewed 2022's new “luxury” Ender 3 S1 Pro, I had to explain that the exorbitant $479 price tag was because it included about $350 worth of mods.



Ironically, my “no mods needed” Ender 3 S1 Pro didn't stay stock for long. These days, it's running a BigTreeTech Klipper pad for speed and a 3D printed nozzle cam for close-up video. It's still my favorite machine for running TPU because it's slow, steady, and has an extruder that grabs filament like a pitbull.

The Ender 3 S1 Pro is a prime example of a pattern I see in 3D printer releases again and again. A new machine launches, looking like the pinnacle of perfection, but give it a year, and manufacturers will come up with something faster, smarter, bigger, or more colorful, and we pull out our wallets once again.

Looking back at these last 100 reviews, I've come up with a list of the best 3D printing mods that have become non-negotiable standards.



If I wanted to scare a group of makers around an evening bonfire, I would weave a tale of blood-curdling horror: 3D printers without auto bed leveling. Boo! If your first printer was a Bambu Lab, you've been spared the pain of manual bed leveling. Budget 3D printers used to have knobs under the bed to “tram” the surface flat in relation to the nozzle. Even early Prusa MK2s with their fancy, built-in PINDA probes might require a “live adjust Z” to perfect the print.

Bed leveling was a tedious process that required a slip of paper to literally feel the space between the nozzle and the bed and guesstimate if the gap was enough. Cheap printers often compounded the problem by shipping with warped beds that needed to be physically shimmed with layers of tape or tinfoil.

Now we have an assortment of probes, sensors, and lasers to analyze a printer's surface and save an accurate bed mesh for future reference.



Getting prints to stick to the bed has always been a struggle for 3D printers. Early machines often had permanently fixed print surfaces, or if you were lucky, a stiff plate clipped in place. Go back a bit further, and printers didn't even have heaters. Plates might be optimized for adhesion, but not removal.

Successfully printing on a glass bed without the use of glue stick, painter's tape, or hairspray was something to brag about. Removing that print, however, took time, a scraper, and sometimes a hammer.

Pioneered by Wham Bam Systems, flexible plates with a variety of coatings for every filament are now the norm. Today, I'd be shocked to find a 3D printer without some kind of miracle-coated flex plate. Since build plates are easily damaged and coating can wear off, there's still a market for replacement plates. I wrote a whole list of my favorite aftermarket build plates here.



Bambu Lab made speedy 3D printers standard, but they were not the first to make 3D printers fast. We can thank Klipper for the original mod, which added extra processing power to the 8-bit boards on early 3D printers through an external Raspberry Pi. Klipper gave machines a performance boost by offloading motion planning to the Pi and adding input shaping and pressure advance for smoother prints at speed.

Programming a Pi was not for everyone, so for a while, we saw a rash of plug-and-play “Klipper Pads” to soup up your bed slinger. My old Ender 3 S1 Pro went from trudging along at 45mm/s to a zippy 150mm/s with this accessory.

Now, manufacturers are putting bigger brains in their machines and using either Klipper or a homebrew version of input shaping. Combined with high flow hotends and massive cooling, we're seeing print speeds from 300 to 500mm/s and beyond. The FLSun S1 can hit an impressive 500mm/s print speed, if you can handle the jet engine noise of its cooling system.



Again, we can thank Bambu Lab for making a popular mod standard issue: remote access. New users would faint at the thought of transferring files from a computer to their printer via a tiny micro SD card. Before Wi-Fi, LAN, and the Cloud became common features, makers would need to use a Raspberry Pi with OctoPrint to send STL files to the machine over their home network. If you were already adding a Pi for Klipper, why not use OctoPrint, too?

Fun Fact: In the early days, Wi-Fi wasn't added because people were too lazy to walk an SD card over to their printer. It was also done because many 3D printers used a cheap Micro SD Card, a tiny sliver of plastic that was easily lost on your desk, in your couch cushions, or in the huge gap between the card slot and the printer case. Gaining remote access to your 3D printer meant never looking for a lost micro SD card again.



I am now infuriated when a new 3D printer doesn't come with a camera for monitoring prints. The horror! After moving my office to a different part of the house, my machines remain a good 40 feet or more from my desk. Even the extremely budget-priced Elegoo Centauri Carbon came with a decent, if poorly lit, camera.

Combined with our new obsession with mobile apps, you can check your print progress from upstairs, the office, or even the grocery store.

Gone are the days of converting security cameras into printing babysitters, though Prusa Research will still let you use an old iPhone to monitor machines through Prusa Connect if you're feeling old school.



3D printing in full, glorious color used to be a pipe dream. And an expensive one at that. In 2021, I dreamed of saving up for a Mosaic Palette, which could feed eight colors to my little Ender 3 Pro. It easily cost as much as three new Enders, and so was out of the question.

I went as far as trying out a crazy mod that used permanent markers to color prints. Needless to say, turning an Ender into a tool changer to draw on your prints was difficult and didn't work well.

Pioneered by Prusa Research and made affordable by Bambu Lab, we now have multicolor systems for nearly every brand of manufacturer. I'm happy to report that printing in 4, 5, or 25 colors is now pretty easy, if not cheap. And with Snapmaker's new tool changer on the horizon, the 3D printing world is turning very colorful indeed.

Click here if you want to see our current favorite picks for multicolor 3D printers, and taste that rainbow.

 August 15, 2025  

In patients with diabetes, using metformin for at least 5 consecutive years was associated with a lower risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), particularly the dry type of the condition.

""Yearly metformin exposure for at least 5 years was associated with a decreased risk of developing AMD, with significant differences observed in dry AMD and a non-significant trend in wet AMD,"" the researchers reported.“When individuals with a prior diagnosis of drusen were excluded from the cohort, these protective effects were not as pronounced. Although the presence of drusen signifies that the AMD disease process has already begun, these findings do not necessarily limit the potential utility of metformin. Rather, it remains possible that metformin could exert benefits throughout the disease course and not solely as a preventive measure before structural changes occur,” they added. 

The study was led by Alexander T. Hong of the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. It was published online Aug. 11, 2025, in Ophthalmology Retina.

Due to its retrospective design, the study could not show if taking metformin was actually protecting against AMD. There may have been coding errors and missing information as electronic health records data were used. The cohort analysis only included patients with annual health encounters for 5 years prior to the second eye care visit, potentially excluding those who changed institutions or had gaps in care. 

The study was partly supported by grants from the National Eye Institute, Research to Prevent Blindness, Inc, and All May See Foundation, Inc. One author disclosed receiving consulting fees and having personal financial interests with certain organizations unrelated to this study.

New research reveals how common respiratory viruses can flip dormant breast cancer cells back into growth mode, uncovering an immune-driven pathway that heightens relapse risk and pointing to new prevention strategies.

Study: Respiratory viral infections awaken metastatic breast cancer cells in lungs. Image Credit: crystal light / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in Nature, an international team of researchers showed that respiratory viral infections awaken dormant breast cancer cells in the lungs.

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in females and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States (US). Disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) can remain dormant for years after initial remission before metastatic relapse. The tumor microenvironment and cell-intrinsic factors determine whether metastatic cells progress or remain dormant. Notably, microenvironmental disturbances can be sufficient to increase metastasis.

Respiratory viral infections are common, with seasonal flu affecting over one billion people yearly. These infections are usually associated with pulmonary inflammation along with an increase in inflammatory cytokines (interferons [IFNs] and interleukin 6 [IL-6]) and expansion of immune cells, such as macrophages, T cells, and neutrophils. Such inflammatory mechanisms have been reported as regulators of metastatic processes.

In the present study, researchers examined the effects of respiratory viral infections on breast cancer dormancy in mice. First, they used a mouse model of breast DCC dormancy, MMTV-Her2, to explore the effects of influenza A virus (IAV) on the awakening of dormant DCCs. Mice were infected with a sub-lethal dose of IAV; both MMTV-Her2 and wild-type mice showed comparable inflammatory response and viral clearance kinetics.

Lungs were harvested at several time points and assessed for the abundance of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) cells. Before infection, a few isolated DCCs or clusters of DCCs were detected. Nevertheless, metastatic burden increased by up to 1,000-fold between three and 15 days post-infection (dpi). The number of HER2+ cells remained elevated at 28 and 60 dpi and was still detectable nine months later.

There were no changes in Ki67+HER2+ cells in mammary glands, and qPCR of blood samples showed no increase in circulating cancer cells, suggesting that the increase in HER2+ cells in the lungs was not derived from elevated seeding of cancer cells in mammary glands.

Further, the team observed a significant increase in HER2+ cells expressing Ki67 at 3 dpi. Although Ki67-expressing HER2+ cells decreased by 15 dpi, the number of these cells remained elevated at 60 dpi compared to baseline.

Dormant DCCs maintain a mesenchymal-like state (vimentin-positive) and undergo an epithelial shift (epithelial cell adhesion molecule-positive [EpCAM+]) during dormancy exit. Most dormant DCCs in uninfected lungs were vimentin+. While the percentage of vimentin+ HER2+ cells was not affected early in infection (3 to 6 dpi), it decreased to 50% by 9 dpi and less than 20% by 28 dpi. In contrast, a fraction of HER2+ cells showed EpCAM expression by 3 dpi.

Moreover, while most HER2+ cells lost EpCAM positivity after 6 dpi, the percentage of EpCAM+ HER+ cells remained elevated. Thus, IAV infection induced a transient epithelial shift, creating a unique hybrid and proliferative phenotype that retained some mesenchymal marker expression, allowing dormant DCC awakening.

RNA-seq analyses showed activation of inflammatory (IL-6–JAK–STAT3), angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix–remodelling pathways, including collagen crosslinking and metalloproteinase activity, which are known to support tumour growth.

The authors also reported shifts in the tumour microenvironment, including extracellular matrix changes and angiogenic signalling, that could help sustain awakened DCCs. The team also noted the activation of the IL-6 signaling pathway in DCCs post-infection. Further investigations indicated that infection-triggered IL-6 was key in mediating initial dormant DCC awakening.

The researchers identified a two-phase process: first, IL-6 drives the switch from a mesenchymal to a hybrid phenotype and fuels rapid expansion; later, after T-cell recruitment, CD4+ T cells sustain the awakened DCC population. During this second phase, CD4+ cells partly maintain DCCs by suppressing CD8+ immune responses.

Gene expression profiling revealed that CD4+ cells in tumour-bearing mice had reduced mitochondrial content, a bias toward a memory phenotype, and lower effector function, further limiting CD8+ cytotoxicity.

The study also found that depleting CD4+ cells restored CD8+ cell mitochondrial content and effector activity, leading to more effective elimination of DCCs.

Next, the team investigated whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can awaken dormant DCCs. To this end, a mouse-adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain (MA10) was used. MA10 infection triggered the production of IFNα and IL-6 in the lungs.

Besides, MA10 infection resulted in a notable increase in HER2+ cells by 28 dpi. Moreover, there was a stepwise increase in the number of HER2+ cells and Ki67+HER2+ cells following MA10 infection, with reductions in vimentin positivity and transient increases in EpCAM positivity. Consistently, these changes required IL-6, as changes associated with MA10 infection were significantly reduced in IL-6 knockout mice.

Further, the researchers analyzed data from the United Kingdom Biobank (UKB) to assess whether a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was associated with a higher risk of mortality among cancer survivors. In a UKB population followed up until December 2022, which included 4,837 individuals with a cancer diagnosis before 2015, 413 deaths were recorded. These included 115 and 298 deaths, those who tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2, respectively, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of 4.5.

Even after excluding COVID-19-attributed deaths, test-positive individuals still had higher mortality, with an OR of 2.56. There was a nearly two-fold increase in cancer mortality (OR: 1.85) in test-positive individuals compared to test-negative participants.

The data showed that the association was strongest in the months immediately after infection and weakened over time, mirroring the early rapid expansion of DCCs seen in the mouse models. The team observed elevated risks for all-cause, non-COVID-19, and cancer mortality among participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to those who tested negative.

Finally, the Flatiron Health Database was used to evaluate whether females with breast cancer experienced a higher risk of metastatic progression to the lungs after COVID-19. Females with COVID-19 after breast cancer diagnosis had a hazard ratio of 1.44 for subsequent diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer, adjusted for age, race, and ethnicity. After additional adjustment for breast cancer subtype and comorbidities, the hazard ratio was 1.41 and no longer statistically significant, although the direction of effect was consistent.

The results indicate that respiratory viral infections promote awakening and expansion of dormant cancer cells. An IL-6-dependent switch from a mesenchymal state to a hybrid phenotype promotes expansion, followed by the establishment of CD4+ niches that inhibit DCC elimination.

These niches also impair CD8+ antitumour activity by altering immune cell metabolism and effector potential. Other immune cell populations, including macrophages, also showed phenotype shifts toward a tumour-supportive state.

Overall, these data reveal how pulmonary viral infections elevate cancer recurrence risk, with both mouse and human data showing the greatest risk in the early period after infection, underscoring the need for strategies to alleviate the increased risk of associated metastatic progression.

Scientists say high-dose almond intake could help shield your cells from oxidative harm while enhancing your body's natural defense systems, but the benefits depend on the dose and how the nuts are prepared.

Study: The impact of almond supplementation on oxidative stress biomarkers: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials. Image Credit: shine.graphics / Shutterstock

In a recent systematic review published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers collated, synthesized, and meta-analyzed the results of eight clinical trials to validate and elucidate the impacts of almond supplementation in adults.

Review findings reveal a dose-dependent relationship wherein consuming over 60 grams (g) of almonds daily was observed to significantly reduce certain markers of cellular damage (notably MDA and 8-OHdG) and, in some analyses, improve the body's antioxidant enzymes (SOD overall, though not significantly in the >60 g/day subgroup).

These results support the role of almonds as a potential functional food for managing oxidative stress, though the authors emphasize that more standardized trials are needed before considering public health policy recommendations, particularly given the high variability in results and the influence of factors such as almond preparation, baseline oxidative stress status, and participant characteristics.

Raw vs. roasted matters: Processing significantly impacts almonds' antioxidants; roasting degrades heat-sensitive polyphenols by about 26%, reducing their bioavailability compared to raw nuts.

Cells are under constant attack from reactive oxygen species (ROS), unstable molecules that are known to damage lipids, proteins, and even DNA, resulting in mutations and associated diseases. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between these damaging free radicals and the body's antioxidant defences, exacerbated by environmental pollution and poor behavioral choices (e.g., suboptimal diets and smoking).

Over time, this ROS-mediated cellular damage accumulates and has been identified as a leading cause of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, cancers, and neurodegenerative disorders.

Current oxidative stress investigations involve the estimation of biomarkers like malondialdehyde (MDA) for lipid damage, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) for DNA damage, and antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD) as evidence for patient antioxidant performance. Despite these surveillance and diagnostic techniques, the global burden of oxidative stress continues to rise.

Almonds (specifically, the fruits of the Prunus amygdalus or Prunus dulcis tree) are rich in protective antioxidant compounds, including vitamin E, polyphenols, and healthy monounsaturated fats, making them a promising dietary tool to combat oxidative stress. While previous studies have been encouraging, their limited sample sizes made findings confounding and ungeneralizable, requiring a comprehensive analysis to consolidate their cumulative evidence.

Blanching removes key benefits: Crucially, the beneficial polyphenols concentrated in almond skins are virtually eliminated when almonds are blanched before consumption or processing.

The present systematic review addresses this knowledge gap by collating and reanalyzing data from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at quantifying the effect of almond consumption on oxidative stress. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

The comprehensive literature search comprised a custom keyword search of several online scientific repositories, including Scopus, PubMed/Medline, and the Web of Science from database initiation till January 2025. A two-phase screening process was employed to identify only publications examining adults (≥ 18 years), where almond supplementation of any form was the intervention, and outcomes were reported using oxidation status biomarkers. Any RCTs or crossover trials meeting these criteria were included in subsequent analyses.

Extracted data included estimates of key biomarkers, and analyses leveraged a random-effects model to pool the results and calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD; overall effect). Crucially, subgroup analysis was conducted to determine if the dose of almonds, specifically, less than or more than 60 grams daily, influenced observed outcomes.

Gut connection: Almond fiber doesn't just aid digestion; it promotes gut bacteria like Bifidobacterium, which produce compounds helping reduce overall body-wide oxidative stress.

Title, abstract, and full text screening identified eight high-quality trials (five parallel RCTs and three crossover trials) that met inclusion criteria (n = 424 participants). Summary statistics revealed that the included study populations were diverse, including healthy individuals, smokers, and patients with chronic diseases. The almond interventions varied in dose, ranging from 5 to 168 grams daily, and lasted between four and 24 weeks.

Meta-analysis outcomes revealed that the antioxidant effects of almonds are partly dose dependent. While lower doses showed minimal impact, supplementation with 60 grams or more daily (~2 large handfuls) produced significant improvements in specific key biomarkers, particularly those indicative of cellular damage (MDA and 8-OHdG).

Levels of MDA, a product of lipid peroxidation, were reduced by a weighted mean difference of -0.46 (p = 0.002) in the high-dose subgroup, and 8-OHdG, a marker of oxidative DNA damage, was lowered by -5.83 (p < 0.001). In addition, the body's endogenous antioxidant defenses were observed to be improved overall, with SOD activity increasing by 2.02 (p = 0.008) in the pooled analysis, though the >60 g/day subgroup did not reach statistical significance.

Almond consumption also led to a small but significant reduction in uric acid levels (WMD = -0.64, p = 0.009), which the authors suggest may be related to inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity, a key source of uric acid and reactive oxygen species. Its impact on glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was not statistically significant. Notably, heterogeneity evaluations established a high degree of variability across the studies for some outcomes (I² > 90%), implying that differences in study design, almond preparation (raw vs. roasted, blanched vs. unblanched), loss of polyphenols from skin removal, potential genetic variability in antioxidant enzyme responses, and interactions between almond fiber and polyphenols influencing gut microbiota and systemic oxidative status likely contributed to inconsistent results.

This systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence that almond supplementation can help manage oxidative stress, particularly for some biomarkers, and that benefits for MDA may be more evident at doses higher than 60 grams per day. Not all biomarkers responded in a dose-dependent manner, and SOD improvements were observed overall but not significantly in the high-dose subgroup.

These findings support the classification of almonds as a potential functional food. Still, the high variability between studies highlights a critical need for future research. The authors call for more standardized trials to pinpoint almonds' optimal dosage, duration, and form to maximize their antioxidant benefits, ideally using consistent almond preparation methods and stratifying participants by baseline oxidative stress levels to better target populations most likely to benefit.

By measuring subtle changes in voice quality, AI could help doctors detect dangerous vocal fold lesions before symptoms worsen.

Study: Voice as a biomarker: exploratory analysis for benign and malignant vocal fold lesions. Image Credit: 3dMediSphere / Shutterstock

An exploratory study reveals that subtle changes in voice patterns, especially variability in harmonic-to-noise ratio, could serve as early warning signs of vocal fold lesions, paving the way for future AI-powered screening tools.

A new study led by Oregon Health and Science University and Portland State University researchers identified distinct vocal features that may serve as potential biomarkers for early detection of benign and malignant vocal fold lesions. The study is published in the journal Frontiers in Digital Health.

Alterations in voice pitch, loudness, and quality characterize vocal disorders. Various factors can potentially trigger these disorders, including vocal fold pathology, neurologic conditions, or functional voice use patterns.

Individuals with voice disorders often experience poor quality of life, low self-esteem, work-related difficulties, and social isolation. These experiences are particularly more pronounced among individuals whose professional roles significantly depend on voice communication.

Both benign and malignant vocal fold lesions (laryngeal cancer) are associated with voice disorders. While benign lesions substantially affect voice quality and cause morbidity, malignant lesions are often life-threatening if left untreated.

Dysphonia (a condition characterized by abnormal voice) is one of the first symptoms of vocal fold lesions, which requires a diagnostic process including visualization of the larynx and assessment of the lesion's morphology through video endoscopy. The larynx is an anatomical structure in the neck where vocal folds are located.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have facilitated human voice analysis for early detection of a variety of health conditions, including laryngeal pathology, neurological and psychological disorders, head and neck cancers, and diabetes.

The use of voice as a digital biomarker provides a promising platform for non-invasive detection and screening of these potentially life-threatening conditions. The Voice to AI project, as part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) consortium, aims to analyze voice as a biomarker of health for use in clinical care.

In the current study, researchers analyzed the Bridge2AI-Voice dataset to identify specific acoustic features that effectively distinguish laryngeal cancer and benign vocal fold lesions from other vocal pathologies and healthy voice function. Acoustic features refer to measurable voice properties, including pitch, loudness, and quality.

The dataset analyzed in the study includes 12,523 recordings of 306 participants collected across five sites in North America. Acoustic analyses focused on Rainbow Passage recordings (180 recordings from 176 participants) with features pre-extracted using openSMILE software. The main aim of the study was the identification of acoustic features that can distinguish the voices of participants with vocal fold lesions from those without any vocal disorders, as well as distinguish the voices of participants with lesions from those with other vocal disorders.

The participants were categorized into two groups based on lesion type and vocal disorder diagnosis. The first group included participants with laryngeal cancer, benign lesions, or no voice disorder, and the second group included participants with laryngeal cancer or benign lesions without other voice disorders, as well as those with other vocal disorders (spasmodic dysphonia or vocal fold paralysis). Transgender participants were excluded from sex-stratified analyses because prior voice-altering care could not be verified.

Four acoustic features plus the variability (standard deviation) of HNR, fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR) were extracted from the voice recordings of participants for comparative analysis. Fundamental frequency refers to the frequency at which the vocal cords vibrate; jitter is the measure of fundamental frequency fluctuations; shimmer is the measure of fluctuations in the amplitude of sound waves; and HNR is the ratio of the periodic to aperiodic component in a speech signal.

The analysis of acoustic features revealed that participants with benign lesions have significantly different mean HNR and fundamental frequency compared to those without any voice disorder, and significantly different HNR variability (SD) compared to laryngeal cancer. HNR variability (SD) was not significantly different between benign lesions and no voice disorder. Mean HNR and fundamental frequency did not differ significantly between benign lesions and laryngeal cancer.

The gender-related comparison revealed in cisgender men similar differences in mean HNR and HNR variability vs no voice disorder and HNR variability vs laryngeal cancer, but not in female participants, which might be due to the smaller sample size.

No significant differences were found for jitter or shimmer in any comparison, and no acoustic feature significantly distinguished lesion groups from other vocal disorders in the second analysis group.

The study identifies harmonic-to-noise ratio variability (standard deviation) as a promising voice-related biomarker for early detection and monitoring of vocal fold lesions. The periodic component of this ratio arises from regular glottal pulses during phonation, and the aperiodic component is the noise produced from turbulence as air flows through the glottis (the center of the larynx).

Both the mean and the standard deviation of the harmonic-to-noise ratio were measured in the study, as the researchers believed that this variability would help measure consistency in vocal production. The observed differences in standard deviation between benign and malignant lesion groups suggest that this feature may serve as a useful marker for monitoring lesion progression and detecting laryngeal cancer at an early stage.

However, the study could not detect significant differences in the harmonic-to-noise ratio and its variability between participants with benign or malignant lesions and those with other vocal disorders. This indicates that distinguishing lesions from other vocal pathologies may be more challenging.

Notably, the study could not detect significant differences in the harmonic-to-noise ratio and its variability among female participants. This highlights the need for analyzing additional acoustic features in order to consider voice as a promising early indicator of vocal fold lesions.

The authors emphasise that these are exploratory findings and do not constitute a validated screening test. They call for larger, more diverse cohorts and additional acoustic features to be assessed, particularly in women, before integration into clinical tools.

Overall, the study findings highlight the future potential of validated AI-based voice screening tools to identify individuals with subtle voice changes who may not otherwise seek care, especially in primary care or telehealth settings. Such tools could prompt earlier referrals to voice specialists, help prioritize urgent cases, and reduce diagnostic delays.

Although the fluorescence timescale is suitable for monitoring numerous biological processes, certain processes often require monitoring over extended durations. To access intrinsic amino acids, such as tryptophan, as probes, the UV excitation wavelengths for pulsed phosphorescence measurements have long been the preserve of low-repetition-rate gas-filled lamps or larger laser systems.

Recent advancements have enabled the use of interchangeable semiconductor diodes, known for their simplicity. SpectraLEDs (Figure 1), which offer spectral coverage from the UV to the near-IR, are ideal for such measurements and have been previously applied in studies of lanthanides and singlet oxygen (refer to Application Notes TRFA‐4, ‐6, ‐11, and ‐12). Unlike xenon flashlamps, these sources do not exhibit a “tail” and can run at elevated repetition rates (several kHz).

These sources can attach directly to DeltaHub or FluoroHub timing electronics, with repetition rate automatically adjusting to the selected time range via the DataStation measurement software. This software also manages the duty cycle and temporal position of their output as needed to align with sample settings.

Measurements were conducted utilizing the DeltaFlex system, equipped with either a SpectraLED S‐295 or DeltaDiode DD‐295 excitation source for phosphorescence (44 ms range) and fluorescence lifetime (100 ns range) measurements, respectively. Data was analyzed using DAS6 as the sum of exponentials, presenting either the relative amplitudes (or fractionals, fi) or normalized pre‐exponentials (αi). The main governing equations are listed below:

Sum of exponentials



The contribution of each emitting species can be represented as either a normalized pre‐exponential (α) or relative amplitude (or fractional, f).



Here, the average lifetime can be represented:

τave = Σαiτi

Treated data was plotted utilizing FluorEssence software based on Origin. Despite singlet-state excitation, the phosphorescence emission appeared at extended wavelengths compared to the fluorescence emission. Potassium iodide and sodium sulfite were added to the HSA solution as deoxygenators to observe RT phosphorescence from tryptophan.

Research has demonstrated that HSA experiences multiple reversible structural changes before irreversibly denaturing above ~75 °C. To determine whether the time‐resolved tryptophan decay was affected by this, a temperature study was conducted, tracking its fluorescence. As anticipated, the decay required the sum of three exponentials to fit the data. Results are presented in Figure 2.



Figure 2. Effect of temperature on the time‐resolved decay of tryptophan in HSA, with exponential analysis showing normalized pre‐exponentials (αi, 1 relates to shortest‐lived, 3 to longest) and average lifetime, <τ>. Image Credit: HORIBA

This analysis method reveals a clear change in fluorescence as temperature increases. Overall lifetime decreases, along with a change in the contribution of individual lifetimes to the emission. In practice, selecting an ideal analysis model depends on the system under study and the process to be monitored.

The phosphorescence emission wavelength is red-shifted relative to the fluorescence. Here, the phosphorescence decays, collected at 450 nm, were measured across a similar temperature range, with outcomes illustrated in Figure 3.



Figure 3. Time‐resolved phosphorescence data, showing the fractional contributions (fi, 1 shortest‐lived, 3 longest‐lived) and the average lifetime. Image Credit: HORIBA

These findings provide evidence for the existence of multiple emitting species, with average lifetime and relative contribution varying with temperature. The average lifetime trend reflects other studies showing transitions related to thermally-induced conformational changes.

The measurements presented in this article validate the DeltaFlex's capability, equipped with multiple excitation sources, to track both fluorescence and phosphorescence of tryptophan in human serum albumin.

The impact of temperature on tryptophan decay kinetics is evident in the analysis and is most noticeable in the phosphorescence dataset. This highlights the potential of this measurement method for studying this protein. The measurements presented in this study are based on those by K. Sagoo et al. Spectrochim. Acta A, 124 (2014) 611–617.

A long-running study of nearly 80,000 people shows that plant-based eating offers broad cancer protection, with benefits spanning from the digestive tract to hormone-related cancers, without raising risk for any type.

A recent study in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition investigated the associations between different types of vegetarian diets and the risk of cancer at various bodily sites.

A vegetarian diet is a dietary pattern that generally focuses on higher intake of vegetables, fruit, nuts, and legumes while limiting or excluding meat. In contrast, the Western diet is characterized by high intake of refined grains, processed food, red meat, and sugary drinks.

A high intake of fruits and vegetables leads to increased exposure to phytoconstituents that possess anticancer effects. Furthermore, the exclusion of meat intake in a vegetarian diet decreases the risk of obesity, which has been linked to many cancer types. Although the association between vegetarian dietary habits and cancers at various bodily sites has remained controversial, a few robust links have been established. For instance, both processed and unprocessed red meat consumption has been linked with increased risk of colorectal cancers.

Previous publications from the group behind this study indicated a protective association between a vegetarian diet and common cancers, such as colorectal, breast, and prostate. However, more research is needed to link a vegetarian diet with less common cancer types.

The current study examined the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) cohort to investigate the association between a vegetarian dietary pattern and less common cancers. This study focuses on building on the knowledge regarding the benefits of vegetarian diets across a broader range of cancer types.

The AHS-2 cohort recruited participants from the United States and Canada between 2002 and 2007. Out of the 95,863 enrolled participants, approximately 26,000 were Black, which enabled scientists to focus on this minority group as well. Participants were screened based on eligibility criteria and the availability of complete data relevant to this study.

All participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire about their dietary patterns, and were divided into different groups based on their answers. Participants were assigned to one of the following groups: vegans, lacto-ovo-vegetarians, pesco-vegetarians, semi-vegetarians, or non-vegetarians.

Participants who avoided all animal products were included in the vegan group, while those who avoided all flesh (meat or fish) foods but consumed eggs and dairy were assigned to the lacto-ovo-vegetarian group. Similarly, pesco-vegetarians were defined as lacto-ovo-vegetarians who also consumed fish at least once a month, while semi-vegetarians ate non-fish flesh foods infrequently (at least once a month but less than once a week).

The authors matched AHS-2 data to all United States state cancer registries except Maine and three Canadian provincial registries to identify new cancer diagnoses. For each cancer site, participants were stratified for age, gender, education, and past and present cancer screening habits.

A total of 79,468 participants met the eligibility criteria, comprising 26% Black and 65% female participants. The current study enabled an average of 7.9 years of follow-up per participant. The marginal standardization method was used to compare vegetarians to non-vegetarian participants, after adjusting for age, sex, and race.

Except for the family history of breast cancer, the study observed considerable differences within groups. For instance, a greater proportion of vegetarians were older, were less likely to use contraceptives, were less likely to undergo postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, had breastfed infants a little longer, and were more educated.

The current study indicated differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians were near-null or favored vegetarians for all cancer types, except perhaps myeloma. In comparison to Adventist non-vegetarians, all vegetarian diets were associated with a reduced risk of both total (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.88) and medium-frequency cancers (HR: 0.82).

The authors noted that adjusting for Body Mass Index (BMI) slightly weakened these protective associations, suggesting that lower body weight among vegetarians partially mediates these benefits. It is notable that even the non-vegetarian Adventists in the study are a health-conscious group, consuming less meat and alcohol than the general population, which may mean the protective effects of vegetarian diets could be even more pronounced when compared to a typical Western diet.

Different vegetarian diets have been shown to independently influence specific types of cancer. For example, a vegan diet was linked to a lower incidence of breast and prostate cancers at younger ages, though the protective association for prostate cancer was not observed in older men. Pesco-vegetarians were at a lower risk of colorectal cancer (a finding also significant for all vegetarians combined, HR: 0.79) and breast cancer at older ages.

A significantly lower risk for lymphoproliferative cancers (which include lymphomas) was observed in vegetarians (HR: 0.75), with lacto-ovo-vegetarians and, in some age groups, vegans showing a lower risk.

The risk of stomach cancer was significantly lower among all vegetarians combined (HR: 0.55), with the paper noting this was also seen in lacto-ovo-vegetarians. Some of these site-specific findings were based on relatively small case numbers and should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to determine whether a vegetarian diet affects the risk of pancreatic, lung, and ovarian cancers.

The current study highlighted the benefits of a vegetarian diet in lowering the risk of several cancers. No evidence has indicated that a vegetarian dietary pattern increases the risk of any cancer.

The authors indicated several limitations of the current study. For instance, relatively small numbers of less common cancers could be linked with vegans and pesco-vegetarians. The authors also noted that dietary information was only collected at the beginning of the study and not during the follow-up period. Future studies must interpret the findings of the current study, taking into consideration the particular racial mix of the AHS-2 cohort.

Mauricio Pedroza and Janusz Michallik discuss Ricardo Pepi's future at PSV. (2:43)

The start of the European league season is upon us.

This past weekend, the English Championship and 2. Bundesliga got underway, with the Premier League, LaLiga and Ligue 1 kicking off this weekend. Serie A and the Bundesliga will begin the week after that. That means the U.S. men's national team diaspora will begin getting games under their belt with their respective club teams, if they haven't already, while their brethren in MLS are in the thick of their respective 2025 campaigns.

As such, ESPN will be monitoring the progress of those players throughout the season, and every week, delivering insights into the players whose form or fitness has made them particularly intriguing, as well as providing updates on the USMNT player pool at large. We call it the USMNT's Countdown to the men's World Cup.

What informs the player pool in the USMNT's Countdown to the World Cup? Our Big Board, updates of which will publish every other month.

ESPN will count down to June 11 every week, so that way when the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise.

So, without further ado, welcome to the USMNT's Countdown to the World Cup. Only 301 days to go.

2025-26 minutes: 172
2025-26 FotMob rating: 8.2

Dest has started the season on fire at PSV, scoring the game winner against Go Ahead Eagles in the Dutch Super Cup, and then finding the net again in this past weekend's 6-1 rout of Sparta Rotterdam. His return to form is fantastic news for U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino, too. Pochettino has yet to see the right back up close after Dest had an ACL injury a year ago, and the player's absence has been keenly felt.

Dest's ability to create the unexpected from right back had been a key part of the national team's attack, and his injury meant opponents could clamp down on other attacking threats such as Christian Pulisic. Dest's likely return for the USMNT in September should provide a significant boost.

The chasm that exists between Sargent's club form and his play with the USMNT was illustrated again this past weekend. In Norwich City's 2-1 defeat against Millwall to open the Championship season, Sargent scored the Canaries' only goal with his butt, blocking an attempted clearance from Millwall keeper Steven Benda and watching it loop into the net.

With the USMNT, Sargent can't beg, borrow or steal a goal, having gone more than five years since his last national team tally. If he's going to find a way back into the good graces of Pochettino, he's going to have to continue delivering for Norwich. That's if he doesn't move to a new club in what is left of the summer transfer window.

Turner has already achieved his primary goal for this window, and that was finding a club where he's guaranteed a chance to play. This past season while on loan at Crystal Palace he made just four appearances, and none in league play. But in making his return to New England -- he played there previously between 2016 and 2022 -- Turner got off to a perfect start, making three saves in a 2-0 win over D.C. United.

This is not to say that Turner has the starting spot with the USMNT all sewn up. Colorado's Zack Steffen is having an excellent season, as is New York City FC's Matt Freese, who gained some critical national team experience in the recently concluded Gold Cup. But Turner's World Cup experience gives him an edge if everything else is equal. The next nine months will make for a fascinating three-player race ahead of the World Cup.

If the World Cup started tomorrow, who would make up Pochettino's starting XI? Each week we take our best attempt to name a starting lineup based on form and fitness, which means there's no room for injured players like Pulisic (ankle, although he could yet be available for Sunday's Coppa Italia tilt against Bari), Malik Tillman (muscle strain) or Antonee Robinson (resumed training, but not yet match fit).

Injuries are a constant factor when it comes to national team lineups, and this attempt at coming up with a USMNT XI is no different. In this iteration, left back is a sore spot. Fulham manager Marco Silva said last weekend that Robinson isn't fit to start the Premier League season following minor offseason knee surgery. One of Robinson's possible replacements, Watford's Caleb Wiley, is dealing with a back injury, so he's not available either. That leaves Columbus Crew's Max Arfsten.

Arfsten's performances were a bit all over the place at the Gold Cup, especially on the defensive side of the ball. But the Crew defender's play without the ball did improve over the course of the tournament, and while Holstein Kiel's John Tolkin was also an option, Arfsten gets the nod based on Pochettino's preference for how the player gets forward and contributes to the attack.

The attacking midfield positions -- both central and out wide -- are also a bit injury hit, with the aforementioned ailments for Pulisic and Tillman meaning that more digging into the USMNT's depth is required. The inclusion of América's Alejandro Zendejas might raise an eyebrow or two, especially considering he was on the outside looking in in ESPN's USMNT Big Board 1.0. But based purely on current form, Zendejas is the pick, as he has been lights out for América during the entire calendar year. The big question is: Does Pochettino actually rate him? The September window will be revealing.

Diego Luna is the pick for a central role. Yes, he was sent off in this past weekend's 2-1 defeat to the New York Red Bulls for two bookable offenses, although he looked more like a victim than perpetrator in the sequence that earned him a second caution. He also delivered a defense-splitting pass to set up RSL's lone goal. With some other U.S. players nicked up, Luna gets the nod, although he'll need to keep his composure as he's bound to be on the receiving end of more physical challenges.

The rest of the side is stocked with familiar names this week, but the weekend should provoke plenty of movement.

The dispute that won't fade

The US Men's National Team has struggled to find its footing in 2025. However, it makes up for that by grabbing headlines for petty fights involving former players and those currently representing the Stars and Stripes. These clashes have been at best unwelcome distractions and at worst harmed team cohesion and undermined support for the side. For example, soccer parents being dissatisfied with their son's playing time overshadowed the conversation about what needs to happen next for the team following the 2022 World Cup. More recently, a feud has emerged between the top players in on the team, a former great player, and Alexi Lalas.

The crux of the argument is that the current players don't care about America and would rather be pretty boys focused on recovery and preparation for the upcoming season rather than grinding themselves into the ground until they are mentally and physically exhausted the way it was done by the greatest team in men's US Soccer history - the 1930 World Cup team… or something to that effect.

Before the Gold Cup this summer Christian Pulisic announced he would miss the tournament to be ready for his club season and to focus on being ready for the World Cup next summer. This was unacceptable to Donovan and Lalas who have expressed their displeasure in a way to move the conversation forward and provide constructive feedback with comments like, “I can't help but think about some of our guys on vacation, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. It's pissing me off.”

In response, Pulisic quipped, “I'm not going to f*** my summer up” when discussing why he chose to take time off. Wait. No. That was Scottie Pippen discussing waiting to have an operation before the 1997-98 NBA season before coming back and being a key player in delivering the sixth championship for the Chicago Bulls in eight years. Pippen was criticized for this but behind his decision was dissatisfaction with his contract. In his mind if he wasn't being paid what he was worth his time was better spent enjoying the summer and rehabbing during the season. His decision put him in company of any number of legendary athletes who have made decisions during their careers the thought was best and faced questions of their commitment as a result.

Pulisic found himself in Pippen's company and along with Tim Weah responded in a recent episode of the Pulisic documentary on Paramount +. The USA no. 10 said, “I'd say the most annoying thing, and for me, the biggest cop-out of all time, is when, especially, you know, all pundits want to say: ‘They didn't want it. They didn't have the heart, you know, back in our day, we would fight and we would die on that field.‘”

Weah, for his part, said, “Those guys are chasing checks, and for me, I just feel like they're really evil, honestly, because they've been players, and they know what it's like when you're getting bashed.”

While the content from Lalas carries the monotonous heckling his brand is adored for, it's surprising to hear this from Donovan. As has been pointed out, the former American talisman took an extended break ahead of the 2014 World Cup and was left off of the roster by manager Jurgen Klinsmann. It seems even more out of character for Donovan who also took his team off the field when he managed the San Diego Loyal when an opponent hurled a homophobic slur at Colin Martin. Donovan has followed his own judgement to do what he thinks is right while also criticizing players who do the same for themselves.

Between Lalas and Donovan, there is little credibility when it comes to discussing players missing the Gold Cup or their commitment to the national team. Their comments didn't create a change or any productive discussion about what is best for the USMNT. Rather, less than a year before the World Cup, the narrative is about a conflict between former players shouting at clouds and key players who are going to fight for the team in the sport's biggest tournament. They will be in the arena justifying their decision with their performance while Lalas and Donovan are online and talking in the broadcast booth.

With the countdown to the 2026 World Cup in full swing, American soccer fans will have a greater interest in what's going on overseas, with some of the U.S. Men's National Team players competing in the Premier League, Bundesliga, LaLiga and elsewhere.

The 2025-26 season will be one of the most consequential for some players as they look to rebound or to build their cases as to why they should be a part of the American roster at the World Cup. And there may be no bigger spotlights than those on Christian Pulisic and Gio Reyna.

Pulisic, entering his third year at AC Milan in Italy's Serie A, has been the focus of criticism from USMNT alums for not participating in the Gold Cup this summer, which led to a very public spat that involved Landon Donovan and Pulisic's father.

But the pride of Hershey, Pa., has become a sensation in Italy, scoring 32 goals in his first two seasons with AC Milan, and the club will need that as it hopes to improve from an eighth-place finish last season.

Pulisic had been dealing with a minor ankle injury, but he returned to full practice, and AC Milan doesn't open the Serie A season until Aug. 23.

It appears for now as if Reyna will start the year with German Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund, though the writing on the wall seems to suggest his time there could be coming to an end.

While any potential transfer from Dortmund has moved at a crawl — Reyna had been linked to Serie A side Parma over the summer — the son of USMNT alum Claudio Reyna needs to get off to a fast start to help his World Cup chances.

After he saw just 12 minutes during Dortmund's run in the Club World Cup and the club announced it had given the prestigious No. 7 that Reyna had worn since 2021 to another player, it seems like playing time could be tough for him to see until a move is made.  

Here are some other USMNT players to keep an eye on during the European season:

Tyler Adams, AFC Bournemouth (Premier League): The USMNT captain and former Red Bull midfielder is coming off his best season with the club and is developing into one of the leaders for Bournemouth, which finished in the top half of the table in 2024-25.

Brenden Aaronson, Leeds United (Premier League): The midfielder appeared in five matches during the USMNT run in the Gold Cup, scoring a goal and registering an assist. Last season, he helped Leeds finish first in the EFL Championship — England's second division — to earn a promotion back to the Premier League.

Malik Tillman, Bayer Leverkusen (Bundesliga): Tillman made the jump to Bayer Leverkusen this summer from PSV in the Netherlands. In two years with PSV, he had 25 goals and 17 assists while helping the club win back-to-back league titles.

Timothy Weah, Olympique de Marseille (Ligue 1): After two seasons with Juventus in Italy, Weah is back in Ligue 1. The move will give Weah some all-important playing time heading into 2026 after making 78 appearances and scoring 14 goals for Juventus.

Sergiño Dest, PSV Eindhoven (Eredivisie): The fullback has come out firing to start the season for Dutch club PSV, scoring in the first game of the season last weekend, and he was a key contributor the week before when he scored the winning goal in the Dutch Super Cup. He missed a majority of the 2024-25 season due to a torn ACL and had to pull out of the Gold Cup because of an injury.

Johnny Cardoso, Atlético Madrid (LaLiga): The 23-year-old midfielder completed a transfer to Atlético Madrid last month from rival Real Betis and hopes to put a disappointing summer at the Gold Cup — injury hindered him from making much of an impact with the USMNT — behind him.

The English Premier League is back for another season, and the 2025–26 campaign will see several American players take on the competition. 

While some have recently departed the Premier League, like goalkeeper Matt Turner, who returned to Major League Soccer, there are still five USMNT-eligible players lacing up this season. 

Among the Americans are three regular national team players in Leeds United's Brendan Aaronson, AFC Bournemouth's Tyler Adams, Crystal Palace's Chris Richards and Fulham's Antonee Robinson. 

Burnley midfielder Luca Koleosho also remains eligible for the USMNT. 

Here's a look at each of the American talents playing in the 2025-26 Premier League season, which begins Aug. 15.

A product of the famed Philadelphia Union MLS Academy, Aaronson returns to Leeds United despite a summer filled with transfer rumors. Since joining the club in July 2022, the Medford, New Jersey native has played 87 games, scoring 10 goals and five assists. 

In addition to his club play, he has 53 USMNT caps and recently played five games at the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. 

A key piece in Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT setup, Adams was one of the few mainstay USMNT players to commit to the 2025 Gold Cup campaign. He has 50 caps for the national team, and has made 102 appearances for Bournemouth since signing in 2023. 

Koleosho, 20, has plenty of options for his international future. Currently, the winger represents Italy's U-21s, but has earned callups to the Canadian men's national team, and is also eligible to represent the U.S. and Nigeria. 

In the summer of 2025, he scored once in five appearances with Italy at the U-21 Euros. Now, he returns to Burnley, where he looks to build on his previous 45 appearances with the club. 

One of the most important players for Crystal Palace and the USMNT, Richards helped the Eagles win the 2025 FA Cup last season and lifted the 2025 Community Shield to start the 2025-26 campaign. 

Already with 73 appearances for Crystal Palace and 31 caps with the U.S ahead of the season, the 25-year-old will be a key piece at the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

The longest tenured Premier League player among the Americans, Antonee Robinson, returns to Fulham for his fifth season after making his way to Craven Cottage for the first time in 2020. 

At 28, he has already established himself as a key piece of the USMNT. He has 50 caps for the Stars and Stripes, in addition to his 189 appearances for Fulham, where he plays with fellow Concacaf star Raúl Jiménez of Mexico.

We are evil, but you respect us? That makes no sense at all. 

Let me set this all up. On the latest episode of the ""Pulisic"" series on Paramount+, Christian Pulisic (along with Tim Weah and Christian's father, Mark Pulisic) talked about criticism and comments made by former USMNT players-turned-pundits. 

Like myself. 

Here's what Christian said: 

""I'd say the most annoying thing, and for me, the biggest cop-out of all time, is when all the pundits want to say: 'They didn't want it. They didn't have the heart. You know, back in our day, we would fight, and we would die on that field.'""

And what Weah said: 

""I think those guys are chasing clicks, and for me, I just feel like they're really evil, honestly, because they've been players, and they know what it's like when you're getting bashed. Those are the same guys that will turn around and shake your hand and try to be friendly with you at the end of the day. Don't get me wrong, I respect all of them. They were players I looked up to, but quite frankly, the guys before didn't win anything either.""

And then what Mark Pulisic said: 

""These guys want clicks on social media and subscribe to [their] channels, listen to [their] podcasts or whatever. I think they should look in the mirror and look at their last performances for the national team before they start talking s---.""

First and foremost, if you're going to accuse people of doing things for clicks and for attention or to watch a show, well played. That's exactly what you just did, and it's exactly what happened.

A few things, though, about the comments. Number one: We are evil? That's a whole other level. I don't feel evil. I don't think that I am, and I don't think that any of the other guys that you may have been referring to are evil in our criticism. But if they were, I sure as hell wouldn't respect them.

The ""Pulisic"" clip showed Landon Donovan, a USMNT legend who has shared his thoughts about the current team. Well, Donovan was part of the best U.S. World Cup team in history – they were a possible handball away from going to a semifinal in 2002. He also has a statue outside the LA Galaxy's stadium. So, Donovan surely has done a lot more than any of these players have ever done with the team. 

Also, don't bring your dad to a fight. I get that Mark Pulisic, like other dads out there, has been involved directly in bringing up, in this case, Christian. I get that he's a former coach. But who brings their dad to a fight? If you're angry at me or Landon or anybody else that is being critical of you, that's fine. You have a platform, you have a microphone – some would say bigger than anybody else out there – to get that off your chest, but you don't need to bring your dad. 

Never once has it even occurred to have my father defend me from the slings and arrows that are inevitable but well done. You got me to watch, and you got exactly what you wanted. 

In less than a year, Christian Pulisic and USMNT will be at center stage of the world's biggest sporting event. (Photo by Mark Thorstenson/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images for USSF) 

For a team that has produced so much angst and concern over what's happening on and off the field, you should be doing anything to get into the good graces of an American public that is dying to love you and support you. Everything that you do that possibly puts you in a negative light and makes you look like the babies or the weaklings that you are accusing others of labeling you as. That's the problem. 

You can correct it ultimately on the field, and that's where the road meets the road. That's where your legacy, whatever it ends up being. You should be so lucky that it is even close to Landon Donovan – and that's where it's going to happen next summer at the World Cup.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Antonee Robinson to miss Fulham's opening matches","https://sbisoccer.com/2025/08/antonee-robinson-to-miss-fulhams-opening-matches","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 15:51:35 GMT","



Fulham will not have the services of star left back Antonee Robinson for its opening slate of English Premier League matches. 

Robinson is continuing rehabilitation on his right knee after undergoing surgery at the conclusion of the 2024-25 season. The veteran defender did not feature in any of the Cottagers preseason matches this summer and was also unavailable for the U.S. men's national team's involvement at the CONCACAF Gold Cup. 

Fulham manager Marco Silva isn't expecting to have Robinson available for the opening weekend or the few weekends after. 

“We had a situation last season with Antonee Robinson and he is still recovering,” said Silva during his prematch press conference. “Soon you are going to see him in contention for the games but this weekend is too early.”

Robinson starred for Fulham last season, registering 10 assists in 38 appearances across all competitions. His impressive campaign attracted reported interest from Liverpool and Manchester City, but the 28-year-old remained in West London.

Whether or not Robinson will be ready prior to the September FIFA window remains to be seen, but if he isn't, Mauricio Pochettino might be looking elsewhere for left backs ahead of the USMNT's pair of home friendlies. 

Robinson hasn't featured for the USMNT since November 2024 and remains a key loss in the squad. 

Fulham opens its 2025-26 league schedule at Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday. The Cottagers will also face Manchester United, Bristol City (EFL Cup), and Chelsea before the September international break.

I bet some of the old guard feel stupid calling out these players for not participating in the Gold Cup where many are still trying to recover from off season injuries/surgeries.

The Premier League chief has not been happy with Fifa 

Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has criticised FIFA for failing to consult with the league before pressing ahead with its expanded Club World Cup plans.

This summer, both Manchester City and Chelsea travelled to the United States to compete in the newly enlarged competition, which ran from June 13 to July 14.

Premier League chief executive Richard Masters called for domestic governing bodies to be involved in discussions on the future of the revamped Club World Cup as he criticised Fifa's lack of consultation.

The new top-flight English soccer season kicks off on 15th August – fewer than five weeks since Chelsea defeated Paris St Germain in the final of Fifa's expanded 32-team tournament in the United States.

Manchester City, who lost in the round of 16 to Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal, were the other English team to take part.

With player welfare relating to the number of matches played during a season a major ongoing talking point, Masters concedes the true impact of the world governing body's new-look competition will only be determined during the forthcoming campaign.

“The Club World Cup in its current form – once every four years, 32 teams – has only just come in and I suppose the jury is out on how successful it's been,” he said.

“The leagues and the players have not been consulted at all on the timing, the scheduling of the competition.

“Whatever iteration of it may come next, we do need to be consulted on that because obviously it does have an impact on the scheduling of the Premier League season – that much is clear.

“We're asking for a seat at the table, for proper discussion for the leagues – not just for the Premier League but for all domestic competitions – when you're scheduling new competitions.”

Fifa was initially founded to regulate the global game and run international football.

Earlier this summer, England manager Thomas Tuchel said the involvement of City and Chelsea in this summer's Club World Cup would hand the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal a “huge advantage” in the title race.

Masters believes there is greater appetite for the competition, which previously involved six to eight clubs and was staged during the Premier League season, among non-European sides.

“The actual impact of it, we'll have to wait and see,” he said.

“I don't ever want to be in a situation where players or managers are having to make choices about which competitions people play in, because I think that will be the wrong direction to take the game.

“Obviously, Fifa was put on Earth really to regulate the global game and to run international football, and the Club World Cup is a move into club football.

“It has its detractors in Europe but the wider world feels more comfortable with this concept because of its redistributive nature.

“My job is to work out whether it impacts competitions, in particular the Premier League, because I don't want to see our future altered by new competition in a way that we can't manage.

“There has to be evolution, there has to be change, there has to be more opportunity but it must be done in the way where all stakeholders have a view.”

15 Aug 2025, 2:27 pm  

A UK appeal court ruling which upheld a broadcaster's rights over a major tournament will be a comfort to companies looking to show major events in future, experts have said.

Broadcaster DAZN had appealed a ruling by the Commercial Court that it had a formal deal with Coupang to sub-licence to the South Korean company the broadcasting rights for this year's FIFA Club World Cup – and challenged an injunction preventing it from providing the feed of the games to anyone other than Coupang.

But the Court of Appeal has rejected that outright (23-page / 320KB PDF), confirming DAZN did have a binding agreement with Coupang to licence matches to them, despite the informal nature of the conversations around the deal. The ruling could have a significant impact on how sports rights are sub-licensed and streamed on third party platforms going forward.

“Broadcasting rights are an issue at all major sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup, the Olympics, and World Athletics Championship,” said Julian Diaz-Rainey, sports disputes expert at Pinsent Masons.

He added: “What was particularly interesting was that the court at first instance was prepared to grant an injunction, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal, to ensure that the agreement was not breached, and the exclusivity of the broadcasting rights could be protected.”

“This will be of comfort to organisations which buy broadcasting rights.”

DAZN had acquired the exclusive rights to this year's Club World Cup competition, which it aired over the summer on its app. It also sublicensed coverage for some games to third party companies – such as Channel 5 in the UK.

It had been in discussions with streaming platform Coupang for the rights to sub-licence the tournament in South Korea, but while DAZN claimed it had not reached a binding deal and could therefore accept a higher offer, the Commercial Court found that  the nature of its discussions with senior figures at the South Korean firm – including WhatsApp messaging – had constituted a binding agreement. This was upheld by the Court of Appeal.

Trevor Watkins, head of sport at Pinsent Masons, explained the ruling would have wider implications beyond sports rights in terms of how contractual discussions would be measured.

“In deciding this case the court went back to basic principles of contract law and found that parties can conclude a legally binding contract if there is sufficient evidence of intention and the core essential terms are agreed, even when it is likely that additional elements were still to be finalised,” he said. 

“Rights are invariably the bedrock of value within a sport. The evidence here suggested that the rights holder appears to be bound to a contract that paid it less than half it might have received from others – a contract held to be in existence notwithstanding certain terms being yet to be finalised. Any rights holder must ensure it makes clear in any negotiations that these are ‘subject to contract' and not intended to be legally binding to avoid it inadvertently finding exchanges of messages and emails create a contract that it may have preferred not to enter into.”

EPL

The Athletic has live coverage of Liverpool vs Bournemouth in the first match of the 2025-26 Premier League season 

If, like all of my social circle, you did not follow this summer's expanded Club World Cup, you missed some decent games, a few upsets, a lot of Donald Trump and a surprise win for Chelsea.

Advertisement

It was fine, but fine was good enough to ensure it will happen again in four years' time — perhaps sooner — and that means you also possibly missed the beginning of the end of football as most of us know it.

When the new Premier League season starts tomorrow evening, many of the world's best players will embark on an 11-month season that will finish at next summer's World Cup, the old-fashioned one but with 48 teams and 104 games, not 32 and 64, as per recent editions. This will be less than five weeks after Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain in New York, but only two weeks after Manchester United drew with Everton to clinch the Premier League's very own American showcase event, the Summer Series.

It is not just the world's best players who are now locked into an endless content-creation cycle. The first round of Champions League qualifying took place on July 8, the same day Chelsea beat Fluminense in the semi-final of the Club World Cup, a tournament that neither brought the curtain down on 2024-25 nor raised it for 2025-26 — there is no curtain anymore.

The lower leagues in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and elsewhere in northern Europe are always early starters, but England's Leagues One and Two began their new campaigns on August 1. In fact, League Two's Barnet and Newport County had already played each other in an EFL Cup preliminary round on July 29 — in other words, before most of their fans had gone on their summer holidays, let alone taken some time off to enjoy the cricket season, the Lions tour, a music festival, a summer fete, anything other than football, basically.

The English Football League had no choice but to start so early, as it is the only way to ensure there is room in the schedule to include the record nine Premier League teams who have qualified for European football this season when they join the competition in the third round.

What else can the EFL do when UEFA adds a third European competition, the Conference League, in 2021, and then expands all three of its club competitions in 2024, adding extra games and teams? The Champions League leapt from 125 to 189 games last season — once that happened, every new edition of the EFL Cup is a minor miracle.

The EFL could just stop scheduling it, I suppose, but Premier League clubs appear to like winning it, as do their fans. Newcastle United's certainly did.

It also makes up a big chunk of the EFL's broadcast revenues and the Premier League's participation in the competition is one of the least painful contributions the top flight makes to the rest of the professional pyramid. Take that away and Premier League boss Richard Masters is going to have an even harder time trying to convince his shareholders to send more money down the pipe before the new independent football regulator makes them.

But that is not his only headache.

Masters has been talking about the fact that the Premier League has been the same size and shape for more than three decades — 20 teams, 380 games — for several years now.

He was at it again earlier this month, when the BBC asked him why the Premier League does not just shrink to 18 teams. After all, that was the original idea back in 1992, when the Football Association encouraged the top clubs to break away from the EFL, its ancient rival, and form the Premier League. The clubs were only half-listening, though, and having cut the top division from 22 teams to 20, decided to stop there.

“I don't think we should be forced into that decision,” said Masters.

“I am all for the growth of the game and the exciting competitions our clubs can participate in, but not at the expense of domestic football.”

FIFA and UEFA have been dropping not-so-subtle hints that 18-team leagues, with a maximum of 306 games, is where everyone should have arrived by now.

Germany's Bundesliga has had 18 teams since 1965, but France's Ligue 1 got the memo in 2023, having scrapped its second domestic cup competition three years earlier. This means only England, Italy and Spain still have 20-team leagues in Europe.

Italy's Serie A actually voted on whether to go to 18 teams last year, but the clubs backed the status quo by a 16-4 margin. Ominously, the less-is-more quartet were the Milan duo, Juventus and Roma. If La Liga put it to their clubs in Spain, we can be fairly sure of how Barcelona and Real Madrid would vote.

For what it is worth, that French decision looks worse with every passing season, as their domestic television deal has cratered and PSG, insulated by Qatari sovereign wealth and their overseas earnings, have disappeared into the distance. Everyone apart from them could use the extra matchday revenue and broadcast inventory now.

But big clubs have broad horizons, with foreign fans and global sponsors. UEFA and now FIFA have shown them the value of international competition and they want more of it, which means less time for domestic chores.



Would England's aristocrats vote to cut the Premier League?

Maybe, maybe not. Unlike their European peers, they can still see the benefit of domestic football in their profit and loss accounts, as the Premier League, for a variety of reasons, has become the closest thing to a European Super League since the Big Six briefly conspired with Barca, Juve, Real and Co to create a more regular and lucrative place to get together than the Champions League.

A combination of crass planning, fan power and opportunistic populism on the part of the British government saw that abomination collapse inside 72 hours, but instead of being punished for their treachery, the ESL's 12 founding clubs were rewarded with an expanded Champions League and revamped Club World Cup.

With the Premier League's overseas media rights still rising in value, its stadiums full (and growing) and almost half of its clubs playing in Europe this season, the status quo looks pretty good right now. But Masters can see the writing on the wall.

Entirely fed up with FIFA grabbing bigger chunks of the calendar, the Premier League has teamed up with Europe's other domestic leagues and the continent's players' unions to lodge a formal complaint against the global governing body at the European Commission.

By bringing European Union competition law into football's fixture squabbles, the leagues and players are telling FIFA they believe the game has reached saturation point, the players are knackered, and there are no more cup replays to scrap.

To be honest, questions could be asked as to why the leagues and players did not combine to resist UEFA's expansionism, but the European confederation at least invites representatives from the leagues and unions to its meetings before telling them it is going to create new competitions, grab more exclusive midweek slots, and maybe pinch a weekend or two. The Premier League also knows it cannot get too stroppy with an organisation that provides at least a third of its shareholders with large cheques each season, not to mention the fact that the race for European berths is a vital component of the Premier League's annual narrative.

FIFA, on the other hand, consults via press release and photo opportunity, as FIFPro, the global players' union, has been pointing out of late. And, unlike UEFA, its president, Gianni Infantino, is not trying to defend a dominant position, he is attempting to disrupt it, globalise it and own it.

Which brings us back to the Club World Cup that may have completely passed you by. Perhaps you did not watch any of the games, but you read about some poor attendances, extreme weather and a couple of mismatches. You may have only just seen a few memes of Cole Palmer doing something brilliant or funny or both.

For the record, I did not properly watch a single moment of it live, although I did read about it and watch the best clips on social media, which is not that dissimilar to how my children follow most football. The closest I got to watching it live was on holiday in Spain, where the final was on all the TVs in all the bars and restaurants that you would expect to show live football. FIFA and its Saudi-backed streaming partner DAZN may even have counted me and thousands of other passers-by that night in their viewing statistics, which is fine, as I did notice the score and got slightly interested when PSG's players and manager Luis Enrique lost their tempers at the end.

That suggests they cared about it. And Chelsea's players looked very happy afterwards, albeit a little confused as to why the U.S. president had decided to photobomb their celebrations.

But nobody looked happier than Infantino.

He knew he had done enough to ensure Saudi money will continue to flow FIFA's way until 2034 at least, as the Gulf state appears to be all-in on its big bet on sport. He knew that if I had more friends in Africa, Asia or South America, my social circle would certainly have watched the tournament. And he also knew that the inaugural event's host, the aforementioned commander in chief, was so pleased with how it had gone that he joked at half-time that maybe he should scribble one of his presidential decrees to replace “soccer” as the game's name in America.

“The jury is out about the competitiveness of the format and the scheduling and the underlying economics, but it is not my job to assess the success or otherwise of the Club World Cup,” Masters told the BBC.

“It is my job to assess whether these new competitions have an impact on the domestic calendar and domestic competitions, of which the Premier League is one.

Advertisement

“Since 1994, the Premier League has been 380 matches, 20 clubs. We haven't changed shape at all. Now we are starting to redesign our domestic calendar at the altar of European and global expansion.

“We are asking the players to play in more matches. There has to be, at the top of the game, a proper dialogue between FIFA and all the stakeholders about how these things go forward. That has been sadly missing.”

Yep, and now the only dialogue is going to be a row about whether the Club World Cup should go to 48 teams in 2029, with more spots for Masters' shareholders, or maybe we should just let FIFA do it every two years, floating from summer to winter as it crosses the globe.

If that happens, and there is no question that FIFA wants that to happen — ideally in rotation with a biennial men's World Cup — we can forget 18-team domestic top flights, with deep professional pyramids and historic national cup competitions. We will be lucky to find time for a 16-team domestic league and when that happens, we will all realise that fixture congestion was never just a problem for a handful of superstars.

So, enjoy this season — cherish it, even — because there might not be many like it left.

The B.C. Lions and Toronto Argonauts will spend the first half of the 2026 CFL season as road warriors.

Both the Lions and Argos will play home games away from their respective venues during FIFA's World Cup. Soccer's men's world championship will be held from June 11 to July 19 with contests in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Vancouver and Toronto will combine to host 13 matches. Toronto's BMO Field will stage six, including Canada's first-ever World Cup game on home soil June 12.

Seven games will be played at Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium, including Canada's group matches June 18 and 24. The first contest at the venue is slated for July 13 with Vancouver also hosting knockout stage games July 2 (round of 32) and July 7 (round of 16).

What's more, the World Cup takes over the venues for its games 30 days before the first match at that stadium.

On Friday, the CFL announced the Argos will play home games at Hamilton Stadium, Mosaic Stadium in Regina and Winnipeg's Princess Auto Stadium against the host teams during the World Cup.



The Lions will relocate for two home games, with the club planning to announce those details at a later time. The Argos will also unveil further details in the future.

The full '26 CFL schedule is scheduled to be released in the off-season. The 2025 campaign ends with the Grey Cup on Nov. 16 at Princess Auto Stadium.

“The World Cup is a cultural event, uniting entire countries and communities under a single flag,” CFL commissioner Stewart Johnston said in a statement. “As Toronto and Vancouver welcome the world, we're grateful to other cities and their tremendous fans for so generously making a home away from home for the Argonauts and the Lions.”

Construction at BMO Field in preparation for the World Cup began after the '24 CFL season and most noticeable has been the installation of four LED scoreboards, one in each corner of the stadium.

As well, a new temporary playing surface has been installed, with another planned specifically for the World Cup in 2026.

BMO Field's seating capacity will be increased to 45,736 for the World Cup from 28,180. There will also be enhancements made to the audio systems, an expansion of the wifi throughout and a new north-end pavilion that's currently under construction.

Following the World Cup, BMO Field will require time to be retrofitted back to CFL standards.

“To our incredible fans in Toronto: your passion and loyalty mean the world to us,"" said Argos GM Mike (Pinball) Clemons. ""This temporary move is about showcasing our city and stadium to the world — and when we return, it'll be with even more energy, excitement and noise!”

Last season, Toronto had an average attendance of 15,127 as it marched to a second Grey Cup title in three seasons. That figure has dipped to 13,838 as the Argos (2-7) have struggled thus far and there's history to suggest the prospect of having to play home games out of town next year won't help the franchise's fortunes.

In 2015, the Pan American Games and Toronto Blue Jays' playoff run forced Toronto to play three home games on the road (one in Ottawa, two in Hamilton). That was after opening that season in Fort McMurray, Alta., as the home team versus the then Edmonton Eskimos.

A total of 4,900 spectators watched Toronto defeat Edmonton 26-11 in Fort McMurray on June 27. And 15,011 fans took in the Argos' 38-35 ""home"" win over the Redblacks on Oct. 6, a Tuesday night.

But only 3,401 attended Toronto's 27-15 loss to Calgary in Hamilton on Oct. 17 (Saturday afternoon) and 3,741 were on hand for the club's 34-2 defeat to Montreal on Oct. 23 (a Friday night).

Despite only playing five times at Rogers Centre — Toronto's home venue at the time — the Argos finished third in the East with a 10-8 record before suffering a 25-22 setback to Hamilton in the division semifinal before a Tim Hortons Field gathering of 24,029.

The big difference in 2026, though, will be Toronto playing its road home games against the local teams, which should be a more attractive draw for fans in those cities.

The CFL added that both the Argos' and Lions' schedules next season will be made to re-establish home-field advantage for the second half of the 2026 campaign.

This will mark the first time the World Cup will be hosted by three countries as 48 teams from six confederations are slated to participate in the global event. Games will be played in a total of 16 cities (11 in the U.S., three in Mexico and two in Canada).

Vancouver will be in the West Region along with Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area and Seattle. Toronto is in the East Region along with Atlanta, Boston, Miami, Philadelphia and New York/New Jersey.

The World Cup begins June 11 in Mexico City and will conclude with the tournament final July 19 in New York/New Jersey.

With the countdown to the 2026 World Cup in full swing, American soccer fans will have a greater interest in what's going on overseas, with some of the U.S. Men's National Team players competing in the Premier League, Bundesliga, LaLiga and elsewhere.

The 2025-26 season will be one of the most consequential for some players as they look to rebound or to build their cases as to why they should be a part of the American roster at the World Cup. And there may be no bigger spotlights than those on Christian Pulisic and Gio Reyna.

Pulisic, entering his third year at AC Milan in Italy's Serie A, has been the focus of criticism from USMNT alums for not participating in the Gold Cup this summer, which led to a very public spat that involved Landon Donovan and Pulisic's father.

But the pride of Hershey, Pa., has become a sensation in Italy, scoring 32 goals in his first two seasons with AC Milan, and the club will need that as it hopes to improve from an eighth-place finish last season.

Pulisic had been dealing with a minor ankle injury, but he returned to full practice, and AC Milan doesn't open the Serie A season until Aug. 23.

It appears for now as if Reyna will start the year with German Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund, though the writing on the wall seems to suggest his time there could be coming to an end.

While any potential transfer from Dortmund has moved at a crawl — Reyna had been linked to Serie A side Parma over the summer — the son of USMNT alum Claudio Reyna needs to get off to a fast start to help his World Cup chances.

After he saw just 12 minutes during Dortmund's run in the Club World Cup and the club announced it had given the prestigious No. 7 that Reyna had worn since 2021 to another player, it seems like playing time could be tough for him to see until a move is made.

Here are some other USMNT players to keep an eye on during the European season:

Tyler Adams, AFC Bournemouth (Premier League): The USMNT captain and former Red Bull midfielder is coming off his best season with the club and is developing into one of the leaders for Bournemouth, which finished in the top half of the table in 2024-25.

Brenden Aaronson, Leeds United (Premier League): The midfielder appeared in five matches during the USMNT run in the Gold Cup, scoring a goal and registering an assist. Last season, he helped Leeds finish first in the EFL Championship — England's second division — to earn a promotion back to the Premier League.

Malik Tillman, Bayer Leverkusen (Bundesliga): Tillman made the jump to Bayer Leverkusen this summer from PSV in the Netherlands. In two years with PSV, he had 25 goals and 17 assists while helping the club win back-to-back league titles.

Timothy Weah, Olympique de Marseille (Ligue 1): After two seasons with Juventus in Italy, Weah is back in Ligue 1. The move will give Weah some all-important playing time heading into 2026 after making 78 appearances and scoring 14 goals for Juventus.

Sergiño Dest, PSV Eindhoven (Eredivisie): The fullback has come out firing to start the season for Dutch club PSV, scoring in the first game of the season last weekend, and he was a key contributor the week before when he scored the winning goal in the Dutch Super Cup. He missed a majority of the 2024-25 season due to a torn ACL and had to pull out of the Gold Cup because of an injury.

Johnny Cardoso, Atlético Madrid (LaLiga): The 23-year-old midfielder completed a transfer to Atlético Madrid last month from rival Real Betis and hopes to put a disappointing summer at the Gold Cup — injury hindered him from making much of an impact with the USMNT — behind him.

From the most goals in a single tournament to the oldest goalscorer, these FIFA World Cup records are truly in a class of their own.

by Joe GonzálezEditor

The FIFA World Cup is the pinnacle of international soccer, a stage where legends are born and history is made. Over its nearly century-long history, countless players and teams have etched their names into the record books. Yet, some achievements stand so far above the rest that they seem almost impossible to replicate in the modern game. With tactics, fitness, and global competition at an all-time high, these monumental records are likely to remain untouched for generations to come. From astonishing goalscoring feats to remarkable defensive solidity, these are the most unbreakable FIFA World Cup records.

Fabien Barthez (France, 1998), Gianluigi Buffon (Italy, 2006) and Iker Casillas (Spain, 2010) share this record. All three goalkeepers were part of a World Cup-winning side that conceded only two goals throughout the entire tournament. Given the modern attacking talent and high-scoring matches, it's becoming increasingly difficult for a team to maintain such a defensive record en route to lifting the trophy.

Oleg Salenko of Russia achieved this unbelievable feat against Cameroon in the 1994 World Cup. He scored five goals in a single group stage game, a record that has stood for decades. In an era where teams are more balanced and defenses are more organized, the chances of one player scoring five times in a World Cup match are slim to none.

Nils Liedholm of Sweden holds the record for being the oldest player to score in a World Cup final. He scored against Brazil in the 1958 final at the age of 35. While many veteran players now compete in the tournament, getting into a final and scoring at that age is a rare and remarkable achievement.

Brazil is the most successful nation in World Cup history, with five titles. This record is held by the Seleção, a testament to their long-standing dominance and legacy. With the level of global competition continuing to rise, it will be incredibly difficult for any nation to come close to their five titles.

Italian legend Dino Zoff holds this record, having captained and won the 1982 World Cup at the age of 40. Zoff's incredible longevity and success at the highest level is a testament to his talent and discipline. It is a record that may never be broken.

Roger Milla of Cameroon became a global icon at the 1994 World Cup by scoring against Russia. At 42 years and 39 days old, he is the oldest player to ever score in the tournament. With the physical demands of the modern game, it is highly unlikely that another player will compete and score at this age.

Brazil's national team, between 1958 and 1966, went 13 matches without a defeat. This is a testament to their legendary squads and dominance during that era. It's a record that showcases incredible consistency and endurance in a high-pressure, international tournament.

Lionel Messi is the only player in history to have won the Golden Ball, the award for the best player of the tournament, twice (2014 and 2022). This record speaks to his consistency and influence on the biggest stage. With the World Cup being held only every four years, repeating this feat seems almost impossible.

Just Fontaine of France scored an astonishing 13 goals in the 1958 World Cup. He achieved this incredible feat in only six games, a record that has stood for over six decades. With the evolution of tactical defending, no modern striker has come close to this mark, making it a truly unbreakable record.

The legendary Pelé of Brazil is the only player to have won the World Cup three times (1958, 1962, and 1970). This record is the ultimate measure of success for any player. Given the rare nature of winning the tournament even once, it is a record that seems destined to stand forever.

Both the Toronto Argonauts and B.C. Lions will play home games away from their respective venues during the World Cup.Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press

The B.C. Lions and Toronto Argonauts will spend the first half of the 2026 CFL season as road warriors.

Both the Lions and Argos will play home games away from their respective venues during FIFA's World Cup. Soccer's men's world championship will be held from June 11 to July 19 with contests in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Vancouver and Toronto will combine to host 13 matches. Toronto's BMO Field will stage six, including Canada's first-ever World Cup game on home soil June 12.

Seven games will be played at Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium, including Canada's group matches June 18 and 24. The first contest at the venue is slated for July 13 with Vancouver also hosting knockout stage games July 2 (round of 32) and July 7 (round of 16).

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

The second day of ATP quarterfinal action in Cincinnati brings two intriguing matchups that feel like they could go the distance. One is a battle between two explosive shot-makers who know each other's games well. The other is a rematch of a rivalry that's already produced some memorable encounters this season. With both matches featuring players in varying shades of form and confidence, the margins could be razor-thin. Who do you back to book their place in the final four?

Head-to-Head: Zverev 3–0 Shelton

Ben Shelton's run has been powered by booming serves, quick-strike forehands, and the boost of a home crowd that has been firmly behind him. He's been unafraid to go after his shots, even when matches have tightened up, which has kept opponents under constant strain. 

Alexander Zverev, meanwhile, has cruised through his matches with a combination of precise serving and controlled aggression from the baseline. He's been winning the majority of the longer rallies this week, a sign of his confidence and fitness. The two have already faced each other twice this season, both times producing long, physical battles with little to separate them. With the stakes higher and both playing well, another tense, momentum-shifting contest feels almost inevitable. Their sole hard court meeting came here at this stage last year, with Zverev narrowly winning in three sets. Given how much time the American has spent on court over last last four weeks, I fully expect the World no. 3 to have too much for him.
Prediction: Zverev in 3

Head-to-Head: Alcaraz 3–2 Rublev

Carlos Alcaraz has looked sharp this week, building on the consistency he showed throughout the grass season. His early wins here have been efficient, showing patience in baseline rallies and mixing in his trademark variety. Andrey Rublev, by contrast, came into the tournament after a stretch of mixed results, but his ball-striking in Cincinnati has been much cleaner. He's been stepping into the court more, taking time away from opponents and serving well enough to protect his lead when ahead in sets. Alcaraz leads their head-to-head 3–2, with their latest meetings being decided by narrow margins, so this one could come down to who manages the big points better under pressure and I fully expect the Spaniard to do so.
Prediction: Alcaraz in 2

MASON, OH − There are six quarterfinal singles matches on tap Aug. 15 at the Cincinnati Open as the chase for the Rookwood Cup continues.

Ten seeded players will be in action Aug. 15, all on Center Court, beginning with WTA No. 3 seed Iga Swiatek facing No. 28 seed Anna Kalinskaya.

WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka will follow on Center Court in a top 10 matchup against Elena Rybakina.

ATP No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz puts his 14-match ATP 1000 winning streak against No. 9 seed Andrey Rublev to conclude the day session.

Follow live as The Enquirer provides real-time updates from the Lindner Family Tennis Center.

Elena Rybakina just dominated the first set against Aryna Sabalenka, 6-1.

Rybakina broke the WTA No. 1 twice and kept a 100%-win rate on the first serve.

Top-ranked WTA star and reigning Cincinnati Open champion Aryna Sabalenka is down 4-1 in the first set to No. 9 seed Elena Rybakina.

Rybakina has won 100% of points on the first serve thus far and tallied three aces.

Iga Swiatek is through to the Cincinnati Open semifinals for the third consecutive year after beating Anna Kalinskaya 6-3, 6-4.

Swiatek will face either WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka or WTA No. 9 seed Elena Rybakina for a spot in the final.

Iga Swiatek looked to be cruising through to the semifinals, but Anna Kalinskaya just survived four match points to stay alive. Swiatek leads 5-4 and will serve for the match.

WTA No. 3 Iga Swiatek has yet to lose a set at the Cincinnati Open and just took the opening set from Anna Kalinskaya, 6-3.

Swiatek dished out a pair of aces and won 86% of points on the first serve.

Each player held serve through three games on Center Court, though Anna Kalinskaya just needed a medical timeout before serving in the fourth game due to a calf injury.

Kalinskaya got her calf wrapped and is back on the court to serve to Swiatek, who leads 2-1.

Iga Swiatek, the WTA No. 3, opened her quarterfinals match with a powerful ace against Anna Kalinskaya and Day 11 of the Cincinnati Open is underway.

Swiatek is looking to reach the Cincinnati Open semifinals for the third consecutive year while Kalinskaya is bidding for her fifth career victory over a top 5 opponent.

The night session features two Cincinnati quarterfinal rematches, beginning with a top 5 ATP showdown with No. 3 seed and former Cincinnati Open champion Alexander Zverev meets No. 5 Ben Shelton.

Zverev beat Shelton in last year's Cincinnati quarterfinals.

To cap the night, No. 2 seed Coco Gauff will face No. 7 Jasmine Paolini. The two have split four career meetings, though Gauff cruised in straight sets against Paolini in the 2023 Cincinnati Open quarterfinals.

World No. 136 Terence Atmane fears no opponent.

 

One day after toppling Taylor Fritz, the French qualifier upset another Top 10 star, Holger Rune, to extend his dream run at the Cincinnati Open.

  

The lefty earned a 6-2, 6-3 victory Thursday evening to reach his maiden ATP Masters 1000 semi-final and set a showdown with World No. 1 and defending champion Jannik Sinner.

“I don't think any words can describe how I feel right now,” Atmane said. “It's pretty insane to be honest. I cannot believe it. Being here in the semi-finals of a Masters 1000, breaking into the Top 100 and even more with the win tonight — it's also a lot of money for me, so it's going to be very helpful for my career. It means a lot to me. I'm very emotional about it.”

 

Atmane punished the ball with his forehand, firing 14 winners from that wing, and showcased his all-court athleticism, gliding effortlessly across the court en route to a convincing one-hour, 13-minute win. The 23-year-old entered the tournament with a 1-4 tour-level record for the season and is now up 67 places to No. 69 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, setting him up for a new career high.

“I couldn't really sleep last night with the win against Taylor,” Atmane said. “I was just trying to be myself on court, trying to enjoy it as much as I can because I have nothing to lose, that's the advantage I have of being the underdog here coming from the qualies. I think this is going to give me a lot of confidence for the rest of the year and in my career in general.”



By reaching the last four, Atmane has earned $332,160 in prize money. He entered the tournament with $310,376 for the season.

Atmane rarely allowed the seventh-seed Rune any chances on return, dropping just five points behind his first serve (28/33), according to Infosys ATP Stats. He created 11 break chances of his own, converting seven, to become the first Frenchman to reach the Cincinnati semi-finals since Richard Gasquet in 2019. Atmane is the eighth lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 semi-finalist in series history.

By Gianni Taina

Aryna Sabalenka has put Belarusian tennis back at the top of the women's circuit, but decades ago, one player stood as the true symbol of the country: Natasha Zvereva.

Born in Minsk, when it was still part of the Soviet Union, Zvereva became a standout both on and off the court, speaking out against her government long before the fall of the Berlin Wall and standing up for what she believed was fair.

On the court, Zvereva had a remarkable singles career—including a historic match against Steffi Graf—but it was in doubles where she truly cemented her legacy. She formed a legendary partnership with Gigi Fernandez and also won titles alongside other iconic players like Pam Shriver and Martina Hingis.

Sports held a special place in the Soviet Union, and Natasha Zvereva quickly rose through the ranks to make her mark on the professional tennis circuit. Turning pro in 1988, she made an immediate impact by reaching the Roland Garros final that same year, where she faced one of the greatest players of all time, Steffi Graf. The match went down in history for its sheer dominance, with Graf defeating Zvereva 6-0, 6-0 in just 32 minutes.

Despite that historic loss, Zvereva went on to build an impressive singles career that spanned from 1988 to 2002. She reached her career-high ranking in June 1989, climbing to No. 5 in the world.

Zvereva captured four WTA singles titles: Brisbane in 1990, Sydney later that same year, Chicago in 1994, and Eastbourne in 1999. Interestingly, she never won a clay-court tournament—the very surface where she first rose to prominence with her Roland Garros final appearance at just 17 years old.

Alongside her singles success, Zvereva left an even bigger mark in doubles. She won an astounding 80 women's doubles titles, in addition to several mixed doubles championships. Zvereva also earned an Olympic bronze medal in Barcelona in 1992, teaming with Leila Meskhi.

She reached the world No. 1 ranking in doubles and claimed a total of 20 Grand Slam titles: 18 in women's doubles—mostly alongside Gigi Fernandez, but also with Martina Hingis, Larisa Neiland, and Pam Shriver—and two in mixed doubles, one with Jim Pugh at the 1990 Australian Open and another with Rick Leach at the 1995 Australian Open.

Born in Minsk—now the capital of Belarus, but then part of the Soviet Union—Zvereva turned professional in 1988. Just a year later, she publicly challenged a controversial Soviet policy that paid athletes a fixed monthly salary while keeping their prize money.

In 1989, after losing the Hilton Head final to Steffi Graf, legendary journalist Bud Collins handed Zvereva her runner-up check. Her response was blunt: “This is just a piece of paper,” a pointed remark highlighting that she would never see that money.

In 2010, Zvereva and longtime doubles partner Gigi Fernandez were inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame. Speaking at the ceremony, Zvereva said, “I'm very proud to be the first player born in Belarus to be included in the Tennis Hall of Fame. I have to say, without Gigi's mentality, we would never have made it here. I never imagined we could achieve something like this—I was just playing tennis”. Zvereva also served as captain of the Belarusian women's team competing in the Billie Jean King Cup, further cementing her legacy both on and off the court.

Emma Raducanu is one of tennis' most scrutinised figures, plagued by her own success.

After all, having won the US Open back in 2021, she received a level of fame completely beyond her experience at the time.

Since then, she has been measured with an impossible yardstick, with expectations that the 22-year-old could not meet.

Frustratingly, this has seen not only her tennis, but her private life scrutinised too.

Even as recently as Wimbledon came a stark flashpoint, where Cam Norrie was asked a question during his press conference that took the tennis world aback.

It was a brazen, borderline embarrassing line of questioning that deservedly drew scrutiny. Emma Raducanu has now addressed it.

As her US Open partnership with Carlos Alcaraz had been announced, speculation over the nature of their relationship was rife.

This was only fuelled as the two practised together, taking part in the same brand deal as well.

However, Norrie was inexplicably dragged into this saga when asked: “We're trying to find out who is dating Emma Raducanu. It seems to be going round all the men's singles. I was just wondering if you are dating her, please?”

His answer was short: “I'm not, no.”

Now, speaking to The Guardian, Raducanu admitted: “Yeah, and Cam's questions, too. That was terrible. Terrible.”

“I know, I know. I guess I'm like, it comes with the territory, people being so curious. I think they're more curious about this news than any tennis results and tennis news. But I just keep myself to myself, my private life to one side. It's always funny when people try to find something out, but I try not to read into it so much.”

Raducanu impressed so much against Aryna Sabalenka in their recent Cincinnati Open match, in the latest in a long line of strong performances from the youngster.

It is an unforgiving position, the one Raducanu finds herself in.

After all, she was shot into the limelight well before she was ready, winning one of the sport's biggest honours before she had even begun developing.

Instantly, the world expected so much from her, and she simply did not have it to give.

Only now, after years of trial and error, has she seemingly found enough balance to get her fitness back on track, her technical assets slowly growing, and her mentality sharpening.

We are therefore starting to see consistent performances from the British number one, and in turn, consistent improvements in her ranking.

It has now been 12 tournaments since she suffered a first-round exit.

Raducanu has been scrutinised ever since her 2021 US Open triumph, almost exclusively undeservedly so. Now is the time to start focusing fairly on her career, as it has only really just properly begun after years of being stuck finding her feet under the enormous weight of pressure.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Wimbledon commentator Andrew Castle has claimed his spat with pundit Andre Agassi was taken ""out of context"" this summer. The pair were live on air together for the men's semi-final between Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz when the cameras started panning to celebrities in the Royal Box.

Agassi, 55, grew increasingly exasperated as he tried to make an analytical point about Fritz's play. Castle frequently cut him off to point out the high-profile figures in attendance, with the American arguing: ""I can't keep up with all the celebrities."" After Castle began talking about former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, Agassi lost patience and snapped: ""People watching are watching for the tennis, not for this.""

The comment went viral on social media, with the majority of fans siding with Agassi over the apparent dispute. However, Castle, 61, has now hit back by claiming the row was taken out of proportion.

""We had a laugh, and they took it out of context,"" he told Betway. ""Afterwards, Andre sent me a text, saying what an unbelievable time he'd had, how he enjoyed it, and we were going to have him for the final but then he went into the Royal Box instead, but he had a great time.""



Former professional player Castle has covered tennis for the BBC since 2003, and explained how he felt media coverage of the exchange was inaccurate and led to further criticism. He added: ""He (Agassi) was saying that tongue in cheek whilst smiling at me, and in the final, I didn't mention any celebrities at all.

""I mentioned the second row of the Royal Box, which had the former champions in that row and that's all I mentioned in the final, and there were people afterwards who said, ‘all I talk about is the celebrities'. It's not the case, people hear a commentator's voice sometimes in their own head.""

Castle also cited the viewing figures for the men's Wimbledon final, which attracted 8.8million viewers, as proof that fans were happy with the coverage. Agassi wasn't assigned the final, but fans have called for him to be back on air at SW19 next year.

Prior to Wimbledon, he joined TNT Sports as a studio analyst for their inaugural coverage of the French Open. Last month, he also made a popular appearance on Andy Roddick's Served Media YouTube show.

Matteo Berrettini has joined the growing list of tennis stars withdrawing from the U.S. Open as his injury woes persist.

The Italian ace, who hasn't competed since his Wimbledon appearance, has been battling abdominal problems throughout the entire season. Berrettini has faced a torturous period in recent years due to persistent injuries, causing his world ranking to nosedive dramatically.

Berrettini becomes the second ex-Top 10 star to pull out of the U.S. Open - the final tennis major championship of the year - this week following Grigor Dimitrov's Tuesday withdrawal. Dimitrov's absence also caused Aryna Sabalenka, his doubles partner, to withdraw from the mixed event.

Brandon Holt will take Berrettini's spot in the main draw, while the American's wild-card position has been awarded to Eliot Spizzirri. Venus Williams also secured a wild card in the women's competition.

Following that setback, Berrettini has battled through difficulties, with injuries completely disrupting his performance.

He hasn't taken the court since Wimbledon, where Poland's Kamil Majchrzak knocked him out in the opening round across five grueling sets.

""I have to see exactly what happened in the match before saying anything incorrect or what I am thinking right now,"" the 29-year-old commented after his SW19 departure.

""Tennis has been very tough for me these past few months. I am very sorry for the people who helped me get to this tournament; they did everything possible.

""Honestly, this is not the way I want to be on the court, I don't enjoy being there. I need to take some time and think about my future. It is clear to me that this is not how I like to spend my time on the court.""

Berrettini was absent from Roland Garros earlier this year due to a right oblique injury, marking his seventh Grand Slam absence in the past four years.

The Italian tennis star's most notable achievement at the U.S. Open was in 2019 when he made it to the semi-finals.

Despite being ranked No. 59 globally, he's had a challenging season, with his best performance being in Miami where he made it to the quarterfinals.

The U.S. Open singles matches kick off in New York on Aug. 24.

The 2021 champion returns to Flushing Meadows in the best frame of mind since her extraordinary title win

For four arduous years, so much of Emma Raducanu's life has played out in public. Every decision relating to her career has been dissected and debated. The most banal details surrounding her personal life have been transfigured into headline news. In order to find herself on and off the tennis court, Raducanu has had to learn how to tune out the noise, which at times can be deafening.

Only one month ago at Wimbledon, the discourse surrounding the 22-year-old reached diabolical lows. Even though her on-court performances were strong, it was impossible to escape the speculation surrounding her personal life. In the bowels of Center Court at the Cincinnati Open, I offer my own blunt perspective: I have never cringed as much as I did while watching people trying to pry into her romantic relationships at the All England Club. “Yeah, and Cam's questions, too,” Raducanu responds, laughing. “That was terrible. Terrible.”

She was referring to her compatriot Cameron Norrie's post-match press conference, when a reporter asked him whether he was dating Raducanu. Norrie, who was being supported in his player box that day by his long-term partner, was as baffled as he was bemused. For Raducanu, though, such brazen intrusiveness from strangers has simply become part of her everyday life. “I know, I know,” she says, smiling. “I guess it comes with the territory, people being so curious. I think they're more curious about this news than any tennis results and tennis news. But I just keep to myself, my private life to one side. It's always funny when people try to find something out, but I try not to read into it so much.”

That curiosity is not isolated to the internet and tabloids. When Raducanu is out in London, paparazzi will find her, even when she is doing nothing more than stepping on to a 345 bus somewhere in Wandsworth. “It's really freaky, because you don't know they're there. And then you'll see a photo of yourself the next day, and you'll be like: ‘There's no way they were there,'” she says.

Considering her well-documented encounters with stalkers – one was arrested and handed a five-year restraining order after stealing items from her front door in 2021 and another fixated person followed her across four different countries earlier this year – Raducanu has genuine concerns regarding her safety: “After the Dubai incident, that was probably the worst [public attention] I've had,” she says. “I remember straight afterwards, I found it very difficult going out. I definitely had a bit of a leftover lag effect. But I've been a lot more astute, a lot more, I'd say, safe and I have someone with me. I don't really go out on my own as much. No solo walks. Just always having someone watching my back.”

Everything leads back to those three fateful weeks at the US Open in the summer of 2021, where Raducanu became the first qualifier to win a grand slam title in the open era. The spoils of victory were significant but Raducanu's rapid success yielded considerable challenges. Along with the difficult results and constant criticism, her body constantly betrayed her. In 2023, after struggling physically for a long time, she underwent surgeries on both wrists and her left ankle.

While she tried to prove herself on the court, Raducanu says, people within her team would tell her she was not tough. “I was obviously, like: ‘Oh, no, I am tough enough,'” she says. “It wasn't good to hear, because I always prided myself on being a hard worker and being tough. And I believe I am. I actually think it was more the people around me that were incorrect, and it led me to having three surgeries and double wrist surgery. I was overtraining and just covering it up, not saying I was in pain, even when I was. So it was really tough to hear. But as I've grown with experience, I kind of realised my body a bit more and trusted myself a bit more.”

Mentally, things were even more challenging. As she failed to follow up her breakthrough victory with similar results, there were times when her mind twisted her US Open triumph into a negative memory, the source of her struggles. It was not until this year that she understood how to focus on her improvement and daily work, however gradual, rather than comparing every result with the 2021 US Open. Still, it remains a work in progress. “It's [comparisons to the US Open] something that never fully leaves you,” Raducanu says. “I think it's been four years now, I don't think it's fully gone away. Maybe in a few years, maybe when I'm older, more mature, but it's hard to put that aside completely. It's always in the back of your mind, but it's more just being aware of those thoughts and then not letting it crash your day or ruin the work that you're doing, and bringing it back to what I'm doing now, and the process.”

Considering her many difficulties, an obvious question is whether sports psychology or therapy have been a part of her life over the past few years. “I've tried. I've tried,” she says. “I've obviously been recommended to do it a lot, with what I went through. It was something that not many people, well actually, no one has gone through, which is probably the reason I did two sessions and I stopped. I was like: ‘Look, these guys, they don't relate.' And, to be honest, no other athlete has done what I've done, so I don't know why I'm taking advice from them. So I was like: ‘OK, well, the only person who can help me is myself.'”

For a long time the four defining cities of Raducanu's life were listed in her biographies across her social media platforms. Her parents, Ion and Renee, originally come from Bucharest, Romania, and Shenyang, China, respectively while she was born in Toronto, Canada, and grew up in London, England. Her mother's solo immigration from China to Canada has been an inspirational tale throughout her life. “I would say it's funny when people ask where you're from,” she says. “Obviously, I feel British. I've grown up there, But there are certain things, the way I think, I don't think I am completely. So you have a little question about your identity. But I try not to read too much into it and try to just take the best from all the different worlds that I've been exposed to and grown up in.”

Regardless of the subject at hand, Raducanu frequently notes the support and significance of her parents. She describes her upbringing as rigid and strict, but their tough love has made her the person she is today. “I was always brought up with really high standards, high expectations of myself, not much sympathy,” says Raducanu. “So when I was younger, that was tough, and even now. But I think it really shaped me to be the player I am, the person I am; pretty down to earth. They never got impressed by anything glitzy or high or anything.”

Both Raducanu's parents worked in finance and they passed on their numerical, logical mindsets. Over the past few years, however, part of her evolution as an adult has been understanding herself as a person. Her injury layoff in 2023, which initially seemed like a catastrophe, turned out to be essential for her personal development. Raducanu spent her time away from tennis travelling, including a long trip to China, trying different hobbies and gradually learning more about herself. She learned that she is also creative, which has significantly influenced her playing style on the court. “I kind of discovered the more artistic side – the piano, the painting, the reading, the philosophy, all of those things,” she says. “I really think it opened my eyes to another world. Now I'm kind of seeing how I can find an area where those two intersect, and have the creative side but also have the quantitative side.”

With age and experience, Raducanu also has a greater understanding of her preferences when making general decisions. While discussing her decision making, Raducanu's mind shifts to another source of criticism: her coaching history. “I'm a lot more clear on what I do and don't like,” she says. “The experiences that I've had with different coaches … People love to say I've had so many different coaches but if I went into the details of a lot of them, people would not be saying the same thing. I just don't do that, because I don't want to “out” these people. So I keep it to myself.”

Is it ever tempting? “When you see things like: ‘Oh, Emma on her ninth coach', I'm like: ‘Guys, come on.' Certain ones don't count. If you've had a trial, you don't have to carry on after the trial. A few have been trials, a few have been other situations. I just try and take the high road,” she says. Then she laughs. “And try to do what the royal family would do.”

After years of rolling with the punches and gradually coming to understand herself, Raducanu seems to finally be in a positive place again. She speaks effusively about the great enjoyment she has found in her consistent daily work and she has thrown herself into becoming the best player she can be each day. Raducanu's results are reflective of that shift and her ranking is on the rise. Her time in Cincinnati, her first week with her new coach, Francisco Roig, ended with a colossal three-hour battle with Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 1, where she narrowly lost 7-6 (5) in the final set. Over the next few days, she will return to New York for the US Open more self-assured than she has been since she won the title.

Our second conversation ends with a final question on Raducanu's ambitions for the next few years beyond her results. After a beat, she shrugs. The hope, she says, is that the passion and joy she now feels each day about her daily work will endure. “I want to continue for the next few years to just keep enjoying because I would rather not do anything else or be anywhere else,” she says. “I see my friends, like, somewhere in the south of France, and they're chilling on a boat or whatever, and I'm just like: ‘OK, well, it looks amazing,' but when I'm putting in double session practices with the people around laughing, that fills me up so much more. So I'm really happy to have gotten to this place and [I want] to just continue that.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

Grand Slam tournaments are Novak Djokovic's main goals at this stage of his career, and the former world No.1 is doing everything he can to make tennis history once again, becoming the oldest player ever to triumph in a Major (a record currently held by Ken Rosewall).

The Serbian legend – who has not lifted a title of this importance since the 2023 US Open – has had the ability to raise his level in the most important events of 2025 and has reached the semifinals at the Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon Championships, but has failed to go further on any of these three occasions.

His decision to skip the Canadian Open in Toronto and the Cincinnati Masters 1000 has left everyone quite perplexed, considering that the 38-year-old from Belgrade will show up in New York without having played any official match on the hard courts since the Miami Open final against Jakub Mensik in the spring.

Over the past month, the 24-time Grand Slam champion has been having fun with his family and friends between Croatia and Greece before returning to practice in Montenegro. In addition, Nole ended up at the center of attention because his family - which owns the Belgrade ATP 250 - decided to move the tournament from the Serbian capital to Athens (Greece), generating discontent among his compatriots who criticized him for this choice.

In a recent interview with 'Sportklub', Serbian veteran Dusan Lajovic was asked if his compatriot Djokovic still has a chance to win a Grand Slam: ""The truth is that for most other players not playing any tournament before a Major would have a negative effect, but Novak is special.

The first three rounds of a Major are almost a warm-up for a player like him, if you consider his results and statistics. It will be interesting to see what happens in New York.""

Nole will also play the mixed doubles tournament together with Olga Danilovic and test his current level.

It's been labelled ‘Alcaranu' by fans and scrutinised by pundits. But now, the potential mixed doubles partnership between Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz at this month's US Open could be in serious doubt.

The pair are scheduled to join forces for the revamped format in Flushing Meadows. However, the current Cincinnati Open could now well scupper that plan. While Raducanu is already out of the tournament, Alcaraz faces Andrey Rublev tonight for a place in the semi-finals.

Despite searing temperatures in Ohio, the tournament has also been dealt a backlog of matches this week after extreme storms curtailed play on Tuesday. The men's final is scheduled for Monday, with the Spaniard and world No.1 Jannik Sinner on course for another showdown following their epic battles at the French Open and Wimbledon.

Sinner has agreed to play with Emma Navarro in the mixed doubles event, which this year takes place during the week before the US Open. However, it starts less than 20 hours after the Cincinnati Open final, which could be delayed if further storms hit.



Another gruelling match between the world's two best male players is likely to leave them in doubt for the mixed doubles. Both took a prolonged break following SW19 this year, citing fatigue, and would have noted the likes of Coco Gauff opting to skip the team event to focus on her individual preparation.

“For me, it was just because I know the free week of the US Open is already packed for me, for sponsor things, and it was just like a whole other thing,” she explained. “So, I didn't want to waste mental energy on that.”

Former British player Barry Fulcher has cast further doubt on big-name stars competing, despite being confirmed by organisers. He told Tennis 365: “This exhibition event will be great fun, but it is not a Grand Slam and it shouldn't be viewed as such.

“It's not just about the prize money, but more about removing a mixed doubles Grand Slam opportunity. I will be fascinated to see how many of those 16 pairings that were announced a few weeks ago will turn up and play.”

Tennis

Hard-Court

Season

The U.S. Open has announced its singles wild cards for 2025, led by two-time champion Venus Williams, who will make her 25th main-draw appearance at the age of 45.

Williams, who made her return to tennis after 16 months out at July's Citi Open in Washington, D.C., won the tournament in 2000 and 2001. She beat then-world No. 35 Peyton Stearns in her first match back, before losing to Magdalena Fręch of Poland. She then received a wild card into the Cincinnati Open, where she lost to Jéssica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain.

Fellow Americans Clervie Ngounoue, Julieta Pareja and Alyssa Ahn also received direct wild cards. Pareja, 16, is the junior world No. 1, while Ngounoue, 19 and a former junior world No. 1 herself, posted her first WTA Tour main-draw win at this month's Cincinnati Open.

On the men's side Nishesh Basavareddy and Tristan Boyer received direct wild cards, along with Darwin Blanch. Basavareddy, 20, played in the Australian Open main draw earlier this year, taking a set off Novak Djokovic before losing in the opening round. Brandon Holt, who initially received a wild card, now has a place in the main draw after the withdrawal of Italy's Matteo Berrettini. Eliot Spizzirri, who beat João Fonseca in last year's qualifying event to make the main draw, takes Holt's wild card.

Caty McNally and Emilio Nava won the U.S. Tennis Association's “Wild Card Challenge,” which rewards performance in hard-court events in the run-up to the tournament. McNally, 23 who had elbow surgery in 2024, will make her first main-draw appearance since 2021; Nava, 23, last made the main draw in 2023.

Reciprocal arrangements with the French and Australian tennis associations see Caroline Garcia and Talia Gibson join the women's quotient, while Valentin Royer and Tristan Schoolkate round out the men's. Valerie Glozman of Stanford and Stefan Dostanic of Wake Forest won the college tennis wild card playoffs earlier this year, and also enter the main draw.

Of the home hopes, Blanch's selection stands out. Widely regarded as one of the most promising rising talents in American men's junior tennis, the 17-year-old did not receive a wild card last year. He did get into two ATP main draws through his links to IMG at the Madrid and Miami Opens, both of which are one rung below a Grand Slam. He lost 6-1, 6-0 to Rafael Nadal in Madrid.

The main draw begins Sunday Aug. 24 at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre in Flushing Meadows. Aryna Sabalenka and Jannik Sinner are the defending women's and men's singles champions.

Analysis from Charlie Eccleshare, tennis writer

Tennis wild card announcements are always fairly contentious, especially at the Grand Slams. Ordinarily, giving one to a 45-year-old who has barely played over the last year would fit squarely in that category.

But Venus Williams is a bit of a law unto herself, and the fact that she won a singles match against a top-40 player in her comeback event last month shows that she is not just planning to have a hit and giggle. Winning seven major titles also affords certain privileges, even if some will feel wildcards should be reserved for promising youngsters.

There are plenty of those on the list, and Darwin Blanch is particularly exciting, having long been spoken about as the next big thing in American men's tennis.

Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitová, who announced her retirement in June and said her plan was to retire at the U.S. Open, does not need a wild card after using her protected ranking. Caroline Garcia, who confirmed her own retirement a few weeks earlier, does get a wildcard, by taking one of the reciprocal ones that is awarded to a French player each year.

These reciprocal arrangements feel the opposite of wild, giving players from the most powerful tennis nations even more of a leg-up, instead of platforming a player from a comparatively underfunded country or region in the tennis world. At the end of a summer in which Victoria Mboko won the Canadian Open as a wild card, and Williams thrilled the Washington, D.C. crowd as one, all eyes will be on whether one of the fortunate 16 on today's list can do something similar in New York over the next couple of weeks.

A lot has been made of the hectic ATP schedule recently, as players continue to campaign for change.

Earlier this month, world number two Carlos Alcaraz said he wanted the ATP to remove events from the schedule, so players can have more time to rest and recover.

The Spaniard has been vocal about his concerns over the schedule, suggesting the concentration of events would lead to players getting injured.

Unfortunately, Alcaraz may have been right, as Russia's Karen Khachanov suffered a back injury recently, a problem that may well have been caused by the 29-year-old's quick turnaround from Toronto to Cincinnati.

After the match, Khachanov suggested it may be time for the ATP to look at the schedule, as he now hopes to recover from injury with the US Open fast approaching.

Khachanov and Alcaraz aren't the only players complaining, as it's clear to see that something needs to be done about the schedule.

Weighing in with his thoughts, Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley has proposed some radical changes to the tennis schedule.

During the latest episode of ‘The Tennis', Tiley shared an idea for the tennis schedule he and the other Grand Slam tournament directors have been working on.

“We have been working, the Grand Slams particularly have been working, to have a content at the top end of the tree, the top 100 players,” he said.

“Where it's very specific about the length and time of the events, the cities you play, eight to nine week proper off-season, strong narrative for the fans. Governed as one, you have the four Slams, another 11, 12 events, one team event, so you're maybe playing 16, 17 events.

“Then you have a feed-in system, where there are several times in the year, like in golf, where you compete to get your card, you compete to get yourself in the top 32, top 16, 56, whatever that number is going to be, then the fan kind of understands where you're going, what it means.

“You know, as a player, I've got that period I'm playing, then I've got that mid-season rest period, I've got the end of the season. There's too much sideshow stuff going on right now, and we've got to deal with the core.”

Tiley proceeded to outline what the ‘core' issues are, comparing how tennis and golf differ in that regard.

“The core is to get the narrative right, get the tour right, particularly on the top end, get the feeder system right. Everyone has a role to play. There are probably too many people involved in making decisions,” he said.

“At the end of the day, you've got your four pillars in the sport, like you have in golf. The four masters [majors] in golf, every golfer, it's absolutely history and tradition that they compete in the four masters. Similar to tennis, you have the four majors.

“But the difference in golf is that those four masters don't drive the economic powerhouse of the sport. They're only about 10% of the economic value. The other 90% is the PGA Tour. In tennis, it's about 55- 60% driven by the four majors, so it's an imbalance.

“The commercials of the tour need to pick up. But how that gets done is by creating an aggregate, by all coming together. It's hard to do it by yourself. There's a lot of good work that's been done by the tours over the years, but probably not enough.”

The 63-year-old believes player welfare has been ‘forgotten' over the years as the schedule became more packed, which is partly why he is suggesting reform.

“What gets forgotten in the player voice is player welfare, what gets forgotten in the player voice is the time to regroup, there's not a proper off-season. The element of player welfare is too low down on the priority list when we make decisions about the schedule,” said Tiley.

“Yes, there are commercial reasons for doing this. This is indicative of the poor organisation of our sport. We have seven governing bodies, each fighting for their own territory and their own position in the calendar.

“The coordination amongst those governing bodies is not at the level that it needs to be to be successful from a player's perspective.

“When a player goes into a longer Masters 1000 event and you're adding 21 days to the calendar, players want to play exhibitions in December, then they turn around a week later and start the year again, it's not right.”

Tiley certainly has some big plans, but what would his new schedule look like?

The South African didn't go into too much detail about how his ideal schedule would look, but with what he mentioned, it could be something like this.

Only time will tell if Tiley's ideas are ever put into practice, but it will certainly be something to look out for in the future.

French qualifier Terence Atmane is turning heads this week at the Cincinnati Open, where he has soared to the semi-finals in Ohio. The 23-year-old will aim to spring his biggest upset yet in the semi-finals on Saturday when he takes on World No. 1 Jannik Sinner.

Ahead of the clash, ATPTour.com looks at five things to know about the lefty.



Cincinnati: A career breakthrough
Before his run to the semi-finals in Cincinnati, the Frenchman had never been beyond the third round at a tour-level event and had never earned a Top 10 win. Playing with a sense of freedom this week after coming through qualifying, Atmane has stunned the tennis world by defeating World No. 4 Taylor Fritz and World No. 9 Holger Rune to set up a semi-final showdown with Jannik Sinner.

With his impressive rise, Atmane has climbed 67 places to No. 69 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, setting him up for a new career high. By reaching the last four, Atmane has also earned $332,160 in prize money. He entered the tournament with $310,376 for the season.

Pokemon passion
Off court, Atmane owns a lifelong Pokémon card collection, which he started in 2007. The 23-year-old spent more than two years tracking down some of his most exclusive cards, with his favourite card the 'Kyogre ex' from the 2007 Crystal Guardians set.
“When I was a little kid, I was watching Pokémon on TV. It came pretty naturally, at school and everything, people were talking about these Pokémon cards and it was pretty famous in the world at that time,” Atmane told ATPTour.com in 2023. “I remember I was playing with my friends in school and then somehow I started collecting this when I was a little boy. And this little boy still has his collection from that time.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","'Hungry' Shelton reaches Cincinnati QFs, next aims for first Zverev win","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/shelton-lehecka-cincinnati-2025-thursday","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 00:22:01 GMT","

Ben Shelton continued his red-hot streak Thursday at the Cincinnati Open, where he ousted Czech Jiri Lehecka 6-4, 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals. A week removed from winning his biggest career title at the ATP Masters 1000 in Toronto, the 22-year-old became the first American man to reach the last eight in Canada and Cincinnati in the same season since Mardy Fish in 2012.

""I'm hungry. I'm in a good rhythm,"" Shelton said when asked about the key behind his nine-match winning streak. ""I'm playing good tennis and my body feels good. I think the confidence along with not being satisfied, wanting to prove myself over and over every time that I'm out on the court, and having things that I want to get better at is a huge motivation for me and it pushes me every match.""



Amidst warm afternoon conditions in Cincy, Shelton's booming serve raced through the court. The lefty dropped just six points behind his first delivery, including a 141 mph ace when serving out the match. Shelton crucially broke Lehecka's serve at 4-4 in each set and the fifth seed advanced after one hour, 21 minutes.



Shelton will next aim for his maiden win against third seed Alexander Zverev, who leads the American 3-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, including two meetings this year. If Shelton defeats Zverev, it would also guarantee his Top 5 debut in the PIF ATP Rankings.

Boasting a 35-6 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Shelton has not dropped a set across three matches this tournament. The three-time tour-level titlist is determined to keep raising his level.



“Tennis is a game that's not about perfection. You lose almost every week you play. You lose almost half the points you play. For me, I'm just trying to find those one-percents, get a little bit better every day,"" Shelton said. ""I love playing here in Cincinnati, so it's a huge opportunity for me to compete against some of the best players in the world.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","'Pretty insane', qualifier Atmane stuns Rune to set Sinner SF in Cincinnati","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/atmane-rune-cincinnati-2025-qf","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 05:10:46 GMT","

World No. 136 Terence Atmane fears no opponent.

 

One day after toppling Taylor Fritz, the French qualifier upset another Top 10 star, Holger Rune, to extend his dream run at the Cincinnati Open.

  

The lefty earned a 6-2, 6-3 victory Thursday evening to reach his maiden ATP Masters 1000 semi-final and set a showdown with World No. 1 and defending champion Jannik Sinner.

“I don't think any words can describe how I feel right now,” Atmane said. “It's pretty insane to be honest. I cannot believe it. Being here in the semi-finals of a Masters 1000, breaking into the Top 100 and even more with the win tonight — it's also a lot of money for me, so it's going to be very helpful for my career. It means a lot to me. I'm very emotional about it.”

 

Atmane punished the ball with his forehand, firing 14 winners from that wing, and showcased his all-court athleticism, gliding effortlessly across the court en route to a convincing one-hour, 13-minute win. The 23-year-old entered the tournament with a 1-4 tour-level record for the season and is now up 67 places to No. 69 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, setting him up for a new career high.

“I couldn't really sleep last night with the win against Taylor,” Atmane said. “I was just trying to be myself on court, trying to enjoy it as much as I can because I have nothing to lose, that's the advantage I have of being the underdog here coming from the qualies. I think this is going to give me a lot of confidence for the rest of the year and in my career in general.”



By reaching the last four, Atmane has earned $332,160 in prize money. He entered the tournament with $310,376 for the season.

Atmane rarely allowed the seventh-seed Rune any chances on return, dropping just five points behind his first serve (28/33), according to Infosys ATP Stats. He created 11 break chances of his own, converting seven, to become the first Frenchman to reach the Cincinnati semi-finals since Richard Gasquet in 2019. Atmane is the eighth lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 semi-finalist in series history.

MASON, Ohio—From above, the stadium court at the Cincinnati Open was a picture of summer in motion on Thursday morning. Spectators whipped fans in front of their faces to try to stave off the oppressive heat. Cars and trucks barreled past on Route 71 outside the grounds, hopefully vacation bound. Across the highway, roller-coaster cars at the nearby amusement park slowly climbed into the sky, and quickly fell back to earth. Maybe most noticeable was the sea of yellow neon around the arena. Those were the cooling towels that the tournament handed out to everyone who came through the gates, and just about everyone was happy to put them to use.“It's gonna be a warm one,” a photographer from the Cincinnati area said in the press room, to no one in particular. Coming from a guy who spends his Augusts in this part of the country, I assumed that this was going to seem like a massive understatement to me, and that sweat would be coming out my shoes by late afternoon.It was indeed a warm one, which may have contributed to the lack of competitive matches in the stadium. Here are a few snapshots of how a rain-free Day 9 played out.

I wrote about Coco Gauff's round of 16 win earlier. But the Coco experience is always about more than just the match; it's also about the interviews she does afterwards—especially, of course, after she wins. She didn't disappoint on Thursday.In her press conference, she talked about her recent trip to a Cincinnati Reds game, and her family history with baseball.“My grandfather founded a Little League in Delray [Fla.], and it's still running to this day, and I volunteered there. I would sit and, you know, did a little score sheet. So I know the game very well.”That said, her interest in the (former) national pastime has its limits.“I'm definitely someone who prefers to watch baseball in person than on TV. It can be boring, not gonna lie.”

On Tennis Channel, Coco said she also went to a horror movie, Weapons, by herself, because she needed a break from her team.“Sometimes I prefer to be by myself than with them,” she said with a laugh.But she may have regretted her independence this time. After the “scary” movie, walking through the empty parking lot and traveling on the empty nighttime roads—“Nobody drives after, like, 10 o'clock in Ohio”—felt creepy.“I was just like, ‘Bro, why did I do this?'”With Coco, there's always a bit of wisdom to go with the laughs. She talked about how she has come to accept that, with the season as long as it is, she'll have good stretches and bad stretches, and she wishes fans would accept that, too.“I think sometimes tennis fans want us to win, like every week, but we're playing 11 months. It's not that easy,” she said. “It's completely normal, I think, for maybe a player to have a good three four weeks, and then maybe not have as well of a good three or three four weeks, just because the way our season is built.”

Jasmine Paolini's 6-1, 6-2 win over Barbora Krejcikova was not memorable. Krejcikova was way off from the start, got treatment for her foot, and faded quickly. But leave it to Paolini to find something funny to say about it. Asked afterward how she handled the heat, she said, “Every changeover, I take the ice sausage,” referring to the towels the players drape over their shoulders. It was enough to crack herself up, anyway.She kept smiling as she was asked about playing Gauff next. Paolini won their last two matches, both on clay, but when they met in Cincy in 2023, Coco won easily.“A couple years ago I won five games, so I hope to do better,” Paolini said, still laughing.When she hit the customary three balls into the stands after her win, she still had the ice sausage over her neck.

That's what commentator Robbie Koenig said as Jannik Sinner closed in on a 6-0 first set against Felix Auger-Aliassime. A minute or so later, Sinner closed it out and handed FAA his first bagel since 2022.The Canadian came in with a 2-0 record against the Italian, but both of those matches were in 2022, when the two of them were roughly on the same level. That, obviously, is no longer the case. Sinner is No. 1, Auger Aliassime is No. 28. But even that discrepancy couldn't explain why this match was so one-sided. Sinner won the first six games, lost the next two, then won six more in a row.“I felt like I was returning very, very well today,” Sinner said. “I think that was my key point, which also gave me the confidence to serve well.”

Auger-Aliassime, by contrast, couldn't buy a backhand, or a drop shot, or even a winner—it took him 40 minutes to hit one past Sinner.“What worries me about Felix is the size of the misses we see from him,” Koenig said.For Sinner, there doesn't seem to be a reason to worry right now. He's into the semis, where he'll play either Holger Rune or Terence Atmane.“Today I felt great on the court, I think we saw that.”

Of all the tennis arenas around the world, the Grandstand in Cincy may have the best introductions. As the players' names are announced, and the cheers from the crowd go up, they jog briskly down a small set of concrete steps that lead from the area outside the court straight down to the playing surface.Today those cheers were as loud as they've been all tournament, because America's player of the moment, Ben Shelton, was in action. The near-capacity crowd chanted for him and urged him on all through his fourth-round match with Jiri Lehecka. In classic American fan style, they talked to him like he was family and played with his name freely.“Come on Ben,” “You got this Benny,” “One more Benny”

Benny did have this. At 6-foot-4, he had an immediate presence in the stadium, and his live arm had people oohing and aahing in warm up. Shelton's forehand in particular is a smoother and more explosive shot in person than it seems to be on TV.With Ben Shelton comes his father, Bryan, who was in his usual spot in the front row, giving his son whatever support he needed. The recently-loosened on-court coaching rules allow for regular chatter, and the Sheltons have taken the next step and turned his matches into running conversations, not unlike a practice session or a college match, where coaches often walk around the court talking with their players. When Shelton hit a poor volley today, he looked at his dad and shadowed the stroke the way it should have been hit. It's a different, and less lonely, approach to tennis than we've known in the past.And effective, it seems. Shelton won his ninth straight match on Thursday, and will play Alexander Zverev in the quarters on Friday night. The crowds here will be ready.

It's been a year of change for Rublev, both on and off the court. On court, he's been more willing to step in and finish points at the net, while off of it he's been focused on mental health.“Well, for sure I did huge improvements, but in the end it's daily work, daily routine, daily challenge,” Rublev said in Cincinnati earlier this week. “(You need) to be aware (of yourself), and it's very challenging because it's easy to do everything automatic.”👉 Read More: ""Both of us deserved to win"": Andrey Rublev outlasts Alexei Popyrin in Cincinnati nailbiterThere's been staffing turnover too.

Safin, a two-time Grand Slam champion, has known Rublev for years and the pair share a similar background—making them a natural, if eclectic, fit. Safin supported the 27-year-old last year when his mental health was at its lowest, and officially joined the team for the clay season. Despite being a steady presence at European tournaments, Safin missed the North American swing until now.“Everything is great,” Rublev said. “I like a lot his advices—just in general, the things that he sees, the way he sees those things, and that's it. Hopefully he's coming to US Open and we will have more memories.”For now, Rublev is still in the thick of Cincinnati—where every win this week has been personal payback:Second round: Defeated Learner Tien 7-6 (4), 6-3, avenging his Washington, D.C. opening-round upsetThird round: Defeated No. 21 seed Alexei Popyrin 6-7 (5), 7-6 (6), 7-5 in a three-hour, 30-minute battle, reversing their 2024 Canada Open (Montreal) final result.Fourth round: Defeated Francisco Comesana 6-2, 6-3, avenging his shock 2024 Wimbledon first-round loss to the Argentine.

Next up: a Friday quarterfinal with No. 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz—and another opportunity for revenge. The Spaniard beat Rublev in the Wimbledon fourth round earlier this summer, rallying from a set down to extend his head-to-head lead to 3-1.“(I learned) that I must keep working, that I'm on the right path and this is the level that I need to aim for to be able to compete,” Rublev told Bolshe! about the Wimbledon loss. “At that level, one or two points and you get broken. Against players like that, you have to play at that level for four and a half hours without losing focus even slightly. That's what I'm aiming for.”No. 9 seed Rublev will face Alcaraz in the Cincinnati Open quarterfinals on Friday—tune in on Tennis Channel.

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 2: What the track?!

Kimi Antonelli has been getting used to life in Formula 1 after a rapid rise through the single-seater ranks.

Mercedes have praised Kimi Antonelli for the progress he has made during his rookie F1 season so far, believing the teenager is now “finding his feet more quickly” at race weekends after approaching early rounds “with a degree of caution”.

Antonelli climbed from F4 to F1 in just over three years with his 2025 promotion to a race seat at the Silver Arrows, where he has been competing alongside experienced, multiple Grand Prix-winner George Russell.

While the 18-year-old Italian made an instant impression via a brilliant charge from 16th to fourth at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, he found himself battling to get up to speed at several events that followed.

Then, dotted around a spell of incidents and retirements, came two breakthrough results – Antonelli storming to a maiden pole position during Sprint Qualifying in Miami and scoring his first F1 podium in Canada.

Following that podium finish, Antonelli admitted that he had potentially “overreacted” to his dramatic Free Practice debut crash at last year's Italian Grand Prix and was “a bit too safe” in his approach moving forward.

Assessing Antonelli's start to life in F1 shortly before the summer break, Mercedes Technical Director James Allison shared that theory, while highlighting how the team have been trying to help build his overall confidence.

“We talk about this a bit internally, and it may just be more gossip than reality, but the trip into the barrier at Monza, I think that may have just left him approaching the weekends with a degree of caution as a result,” Allison told select media, including F1.com.

“We've been encouraging him to sort of trust [his] talent: ‘You can lean into that more than you think you can'. As he gets the confidence to do that, he's finding his feet more quickly during the weekend.”

As it stands, Antonelli sits seventh in the Drivers' Championship on 64 points, while the aforementioned Russell holds fourth on 172 – the Briton having scored a race win and five further podiums this year.

Given Russell's speed and knowledge, with the 27-year-old making his F1 debut back in 2019 and being a long-time member of the Mercedes family, Allison described the situation as “a brilliant apprenticeship” for Antonelli.

“George has barely put a foot wrong,” Allison said of Russell's season. “He's been on the money in Qualifying. Where we've given him a car that he's able to work with, he's done everything we could have hoped [for] with it, so bravo to him.

“That's obviously giving Kimi a very high standard to shoot for. I'm pleased with the fact that Kimi, generally speaking this year, has been able to get close to George as the weekend's gone on. As the year's gone on, perhaps you could say he gets in the groove a bit swifter.

“But George is setting a very, very high bar. It's a brilliant apprenticeship for Kimi to have someone as swift as George to shoot for.”

Antonelli's quest for progress has also been boosted by Mercedes reverting to an older specification of suspension following their failed mid-season switch – the youngster returning to the points in Hungary and declaring that he was “getting the confidence back”.

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 2: What the track?!

From breathtaking comebacks and heartbreaking near-misses to fierce rivalries and last-lap title deciders, F1 is packed with unforgettable moments. Inspired by F1 The Movie, here are 10 real-life stories that are movie-worthy in their own right.

In F1 The Movie, the action thrills from start to finish – from Sonny Hayes' miracle comeback to the sport after 30 years away following a career-threatening crash, to the combustible team mate rivalry inside of APXGP, and a race result that seemed all but impossible.

While the movie's blend of unimaginable odds and entertaining on-track battles kept us glued throughout, Formula 1 doesn't often need a script to deliver that calibre of drama. The history of the sport is packed with real stories just as jaw-dropping as Sonny's journey.

From miracle comebacks to title deciders on the final corner, here are 10 Formula 1 moments that took our breath away and could be movies in their own right. These are stories every F1 fan needs to know, and ones we'll be talking about for many years to come.

For years, Nico Hulkenberg was F1's nearly man. Having driven for eight teams throughout his career, he'd led laps at Brazil in 2012, before a late collision ended his shot. He also qualified on pole at the Brazilian Grand Prix in 2010, only to finish eighth, and he came close at the Korean Grand Prix in 2013 and Bahrain Grand Prix in 2014, but a podium always slipped away – sometimes by mere seconds, sometimes by cruel misfortune.

By 2025, the stat was as agonising as it was infamous: 238 race starts, zero podiums. His talent found some reward when winning the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2015, but the illusive F1 podium still evaded him coming into the 2025 season. Then came Silverstone, his 239th start...

Heading into the Grand Prix on Sunday, the weekend had not gone to plan for the German driver, as he lined up a less-than-ideal P19 on the grid. But a wet-dry race can always produce surprises.

The German's masterstroke call early on was key as he overruled his team to dive in for fresh intermediate tyres as the rain intensified on Lap 9. He was the only driver to pit, from P10 at the time, and this launched him straight into podium contention.

As he ran in P3 late on he fended off the charging Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton to hold onto his spot on the rostrum. “I don't think I can comprehend what we've just done… oh my God!” came his reaction over the radio, his voice shaking.

On the podium, trophy in hand, he grinned like a man who had just lifted a curse. Fourteen seasons of near-misses collapsed into a single moment of joy. Next up, top step of the podium? Stay tuned...

France's Pierre Gasly had high hopes when he was promoted to Red Bull from their sister team Toro Rosso (now known as Racing Bulls) at the start of the 2019 season. But, in a similar vein to a number of Max Verstappen's team mates, Gasly was not making the mark that he – or the team – had desired.

F1 can be ruthless, and with limited time to make a positive impression, Gasly was demoted from the team during the mid-season break of that year and sent back to Toro Rosso. Clearly a talented and hard-working driver, a positive result was crucial for the morale and self-belief of the Frenchman.

As Toro Rosso became AlphaTauri in 2020, Gasly started the Italian Grand Prix in a modest P10 grid slot, sat in the cockpit of a car that hadn't been close to a podium so far that season. However, the drama of Monza became his canvas.

The quiet start to his race turned golden on a perfectly timed pit stop under a Safety Car, just moments before race-leader Lewis Hamilton was handed a stop-go penalty for entering the closed pit lane. Following this, a huge crash for Charles Leclerc brought out a red flag, and on the restart Gasly found himself second, inheriting the lead once Hamilton served his penalty.

From there it became a high-speed game of survival for Gasly. The McLaren of Carlos Sainz was quickly closing the gap, but in the end, the two crossed the line less than half a second apart. Gasly became the first French driver to win a Grand Prix in 24 years, screaming “Oh my God, what did we just do?!” into the radio. After the pain of 2019, he had turned rejection into vindication, and a triumphant rebuke to any doubters.

Robert Kubica immediately made a name for himself in Formula 1 over the 2006 season with BMW Sauber. In just his third race, the Pole finished on the podium, and in 2008 he clinched his first ever victory at the Canadian Grand Prix. Ahead of the 2011 season, it was speculated that Kubica was in the running for a seat at Ferrari for the 2012 season.

However, in February 2011, while competing in a rally during the off-season, Kubica suffered a devastating crash that partially severed his right forearm. The Pole was left with multiple fractures and severe damage to his right arm, hand, shoulder, and leg. Though his arm was saved, he was forced to sit out the entire 2011 F1 campaign, with the possibility of returning to the sport seemingly out of reach.

Kubica's remarkable comeback began in 2013 as he returned to rallying, before also racing in sportscars. Against all odds, Kubica returned to the F1 grid with Williams in 2019, scoring a point in Germany. While his comeback was a victory in itself – proof of his resilience, a challenging campaign led him to announce his departure from the team at the end of the season.

Alongside staying in Formula 1 as a reserve driver for Alfa Romeo (now Kick Sauber), the Pole pursued new ventures, most notably endurance racing in the Le Mans series and later the World Endurance Championship. Here, he found new glory, culminating in an emotional victory at the coveted 2025 24 Hours of Le Mans – with none other than Ferrari. The sight of him on the top step, more than a decade after his crash, was a testament to the Pole's grit over circumstance.

From being a Grand Prix-winner to surviving a life-threatening injury and making it back to one of motorsport's greatest podiums, Kubica's journey is more than a comeback. It's a storyline Hollywood would dream of – except in F1, it's true!

In late 2008, Jenson Button's Formula 1 career was looking uncertain. Honda had pulled out of the sport, leaving hundreds of staff – and Button – without a team. In a last-minute rescue, team boss Ross Brawn bought the entire operation for just £1, rebranding it as Brawn GP.

What followed during the next season in 2009 felt like pure Hollywood. The car, fitted with a novel “double diffuser” design, stunned the paddock by being instantly competitive. Button, who had never come close to a title before, won six of the first seven races, his smooth driving style perfectly suited to the BGP 001 car.

Despite the fantastic start, this was no easy cruise to glory for Button and Brawn. Mid-season, rivals caught up, and the fairytale looked like it might quickly unravel. Button had to dig deep, fighting through tense title battles and high-pressure points races. His fifth-place finish in Brazil sealed both the Drivers' Championship and the Constructors' crown for Brawn GP, an achievement no other debut team has ever been close to replicating.

From the brink of unemployment to conquering the sport in just 12 months, Button and Brawn's story is F1's ultimate underdog triumph – and proof that sometimes the impossible really does happen.

The duration of the 2007 Formula 1 season had been a three-way thriller. In his first year with Ferrari, Kimi Raikkonen was up against the explosive McLaren duo of rookie sensation Lewis Hamilton and reigning double World Champion Fernando Alonso. By the season finale in Brazil, Hamilton led the standings, Alonso was three points behind, and Raikkonen was seven points adrift.

To win the title, the Finn needed victory, along with Alonso off the podium, and for Hamilton to falter – a combination that seemed far-fetched at best. But from the moment the lights went out at Interlagos, the script began to shift...

Hamilton ran wide at Turn 4 on the opening lap and later suffered a gearbox glitch that dropped him out of contention. Meanwhile, Alonso, chasing his third successive title, couldn't match the pace of the Ferraris. Raikkonen shadowed team mate Felipe Massa all race, the pair controlling the pace at the front. Then, heading into the pits for the final stops, Ferrari executed the switch flawlessly – Raikkonen emerged from the stop ahead, leading the race.

When the chequered flag fell, the Iceman had done it – he was World Champion by a single point. It was a twist ending worthy of a Hollywood classic.

Although Raikkonen would never win another title, that day in Sao Paulo cemented his legacy as one of F1's coolest operators and most unlikely champions.

By mid-1999, then two-time World Champion Michael Schumacher was the undisputed spearhead of Ferrari's championship campaign. But at the British Grand Prix that July, disaster struck. A high-speed brake failure sent his car flying into the barriers at Stowe, breaking his right leg. His season was over, and with it seemed Ferrari's title hopes.

While rival Mika Hakkinen went on to claim the championship that year, Schumacher focused on recovery. The German driver returned for the final two races of 1999 to help team mate Eddie Irvine's bid for the title, but the bigger story was the fire it lit for the following years.

From then on, the fully fit Schumacher was relentless, fending off Hakkinen in an epic season-long duel to deliver Ferrari's first Drivers' title in 21 long years. What followed was total domination – the 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 titles all went to Schumacher, the last season seeing him win 13 of 18 races. Five consecutive titles, 72 victories, and a dynasty unlike any the sport had ever seen.

That crash in 1999 could easily have ended his already decorated career. Instead, it became the turning point in one of F1's most remarkable reigns. Schumacher ultimately became a seven-time World Champion – a jaw dropping record that he shares with Lewis Hamilton.

The 1995 season finale at the Australian Grand Prix should have been straight forward, with Schumacher having already secured the title two races before. Instead, this race weekend nearly ended Mika Hakkinen's life. In Friday practice at Adelaide, a tyre failure sent his McLaren hurtling into the barriers at over 120mph. The impact was so violent that Hakkinen suffered a skull fracture, requiring an emergency tracheotomy trackside from Professor Sid Watkins to save his life.

His journey to recovery was uncertain, with questions about whether he would ever be able to race again, let alone compete at the top level. But, as with all born-champions, Hakkinen was nothing if not determined. Amazingly, by the start of the 1996 season he was back in the cockpit, finishing a commendable P5 in his first race back. Over the next few seasons, he quietly rebuilt his speed and confidence.

Just a few seasons later in 1998, the ‘Flying Finn' was transformed. In a dramatic season-long duel with Schumacher, Hakkinen clinched his first world title, following it up with a second in 1999. His laser focus on his goal and refusal to quit made him one of the era's most respected drivers.

From a freak crash that almost claimed his life, to standing on the top step of the championship podium twice in succession, Hakkinen's journey was the ultimate F1 redemption arc, and proof that in this sport, longer comebacks can be as thrilling as victories themselves.

Nigel Mansell came agonisingly close to Formula 1 glory in the mid-1980s. In 1986, he dominated much of the season but suffered multiple mechanical failures, finishing second in the championship behind Alain Prost. The following year, 1987, saw a similar story as Mansell led races and showed pace, but reliability issues and injuries from crashes meant he narrowly missed out on the title again. These heartbreaks left him frustrated and increasingly questioning his future in the sport.

By 1990, after yet more seasons of near-misses, and seeing younger drivers rise, Mansell made the decision to step away from F1. Fans assumed his best days were behind him, and it seemed like the championship dream had slipped away for good.

But thankfully, Mansell wasn't done yet. The Brit was lured back to Formula 1 by Williams a few months later where, in 1991, he instantly proved his hunger was still present. The Williams car, with revolutionary active suspension and cutting-edge electronics, perfectly complemented his aggressive driving style – it was a match made in heaven!

1992 became one of the most dominant seasons in F1 history. Mansell won nine out of the first 10 races, clinching the championship with an incredible five rounds to spare. The comeback story was complete: a driver who had left the sport in despair returned to conquer it with absolute authority.

From quitting F1 to becoming World Champion two years later, his story is as cinematic as any blockbuster movie – an important reminder that in Formula 1, nothing is really over, even when it seems all hope is lost...

Few rivalries in sport have burned as fiercely as that of Alain Prost vs Ayrton Senna – two drivers that, despite their mutual respect, battled with such competitive intensity in their title bids. Their most notable battleground? Suzuka, Japan.

In 1989, the title fight was between the McLaren team mates. Heading into the penultimate race of the season at Suzuka, Prost led Senna in the championship by 16 points, meaning Senna had to win both remaining races in order to defend his title – an unlikely task seeing as his team mate was leading in Japan with just seven laps to go.

With Prost ahead, Senna attacked, and they collided at the chicane. Prost was forced to retire on the spot... but Senna rejoined, and went on to win. However, the Brazilian was later disqualified for re-entering the circuit incorrectly, handing Prost the title, a controversial conclusion to a tense battle.

A year later, the roles were reversed. Prost was now at Ferrari, Senna still at McLaren. Still bitter about the previous season's ruling, Senna vowed revenge. On the very first corner of the 1990 race in Suzuka, Senna collided with Prost to eliminate them both from the race. The crash sealed Senna's second championship and snatched the title back from his rival, but also cemented their feud as one of the most infamous in the history of motorsport.

The 1976 Formula 1 season is one of the sport's most legendary rivalries of two polar opposite characters. Niki Lauda, defending champion and methodical perfectionist, dominated early on, but his season – and life – nearly ended at the German Grand Prix. During a terrifying lap in torrential rain, Lauda lost control and crashed into the barriers before his car caught fire. He would suffer severe burns, lung damage, and face a battle for survival. Although he recovered by what the medical profession called sheer force of will, many assumed his championship hopes were over.

Enter James Hunt, the charismatic, risk-taking Brit whose season so far had been a rollercoaster of wins and close calls. With Lauda sidelined for recovery, Hunt clawed back points relentlessly, winning multiple races on the bounce and keeping his title fight alive. But then came Lauda's jaw-dropping return. Just six weeks after the crash he was back; he was bandaged and burned, yet steely and determined, as he continued racing again at the Italian Grand Prix – against all odds.

Unsurprisingly, the turbulent championship fight came down to the final race in Fuji, Japan, with Lauda sitting just three points ahead of Hunt. Torrential rain and fog turned the circuit into a dangerous test of nerves, especially for Lauda – with debates over whether the race should be started at all. On Lap 2, Lauda drove into the pits to withdraw, as he believed the weather conditions were too dangerous, later stating: ""My life is worth more than a title.""

The retirement left Hunt needing only fourth place to take the title. At first, he seemed on course – but as the track dried, Hunt's pace faded and rivals surged past. Tyre issues forced an unscheduled pit stop, dropping him to fifth.

With the championship slipping away, Hunt launched a furious late charge, passing two drivers in quick succession to climb back up to third. Confusion reigned as the unofficial result initially placed him fifth, but after a tense review period, Hunt was confirmed as third, and had done enough to win the championship by a single point.

The storyline of this rivalry in 1976 proved so captivating that even decades later it grabbed the attention of Hollywood directors, who transformed the story into the movie Rush, released in 2013.

The contestant on the 2000s MTV reality show claimed Diddy groped her breast and committed a wide range of other legal wrongdoing.

Sean “Diddy” Combs is on a legal roll.


	Six weeks after the rapper was largely acquitted on federal criminal charges, he's won a ruling dismissing most of a $60 million civil sexual assault lawsuit filed by “Making the Band 2” contestant Sara Rivers.


	Rivers, who became a member of hip-hop group Da Band, sued Combs in earlier this year – accusing him of sexually harassing and groping her during the filming of the 2000s MTV reality show.


	But in a ruling issued Thursday, Judge Jed Rakoff dismissed 21 of the 22 counts in her lawsuit, including racketeering, assault and battery, forced labor, and false imprisonment. Those accusations were dismissed with prejudice – meaning they are permanently tossed.


	The judge declined to permanently dismiss a single count, accusing Combs of violating New York City's Gender Motivated Violence Protection Act. The judge said he would wait to decide that count until a federal appeals court rules on key questions about how that law functions.


	“From the outset, we have said these claims were meritless, time-barred, and legally deficient,” said Combs' attorney Erica Wolff. “The Court agreed, finding no legal basis to allow them to proceed. We are pleased the Court carefully analyzed and swiftly dismissed these baseless claims.”


	Combs was largely acquitted last month in a blockbuster federal criminal case that accused him of forcing girlfriends to partake in drug-fueled sex marathons with prostitutes called “freak-offs.” Jurors found him not guilty on racketeering (RICO) and sex-trafficking charges, the core of the government's case which could have sent him to prison for life.


	Jurors did convict Diddy on lesser charges of interstate prostitution, which could still land him in prison for several years when he's sentenced in October. And he's still facing dozens of civil lawsuits from other alleged victims, accusing him of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment and various other forms of sexual abuse.


	Rivers was one of those alleged victims. In a February lawsuit, she claimed that Combs cornered her in a recording studio and “ran his left hand across her breasts.” She also claimed that he later blackballed her in the music industry in retaliation for rebuffing his advances.


	Judge Rakoff did not provide a written ruling explaining his decision; he said he would issue one at some point in the future “in due course.”

The After Hours til Dawn Tour has grossed over $600 million and sold more than five million tickets so far. 


													By
												

	Eric Frankenberg



The Weeknd is on the road, playing shows in Nashville on Tuesday (Aug. 12) and Miami Friday and Saturday (Aug. 15-16). But as he nears the end of the ongoing After Hours Til Dawn Tour, he sets a Boxscore record. According to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, the global trek has grossed $635.5 million and sold 5.1 million tickets since launching in 2022, becoming the biggest R&B tour in history.


	In doing so, The Weeknd overtakes Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour, which brought in $579.8 million over 56 shows in 2023. This swap comes just weeks after Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter Tour became the country record holder. In pure ticket sales, he has long passed Bruno Mars' 3.6 million on 2017-18's 24K Magic World Tour.


	The Weeknd crossed the $600 million threshold with his two performances at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field on July 30-31, bringing the tour full circle after launching at the same stadium on July 14, 2022. The After Hours Til Dawn Tour is the ninth tour to hit this benchmark, and the only one by an R&B artist or a Black artist. The other eight all trade in pop and rock, from Elton John's Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour to Harry Styles' Love on Tour.


	The same goes for The Weeknd's R&B attendance record, making him the only genre act and only Black artist to sell more than five million tickets on a single tour. It is one of 11 tours to sell more than five million, and one of just eight to sell more than five million and gross more than $600 million.


	The After Hours Til Dawn Tour has sprawled worldwide, first in North America in 2022, then Europe and South America in 2023, Australia in 2024 and back to the United States and Canada in 2025. The current leg is the tour's biggest, at $243.3 million and 1.5 million tickets through Aug. 12. That marks a 64% increase over the previous North American leg and a 54% jump over the European leg, which was the tour's previous highlight ($158.1 million).


	By the tour's final show on Sept. 3 on San Antonio, this leg's earnings could surpass $300 million. The total tour take will approach $700 million, with ticket sales circling 5.5 million.


	The initial iteration of this tour may not have hit such hallowed ground. It was first announced in February 2020 in arenas in North America and Europe. But delayed by COVID-19 and then expanded far beyond, the After Hours Til Dawn Tour supports 2020's After Hours, 2022's Dawn FM and this year's Hurry Up Tomorrow. Since the launch of this extended tour era, The Weeknd notched four No. 1s on the Billboard Hot 100, including “Blinding Lights,” which was named the chart's biggest hit ever by the end of its 90-week run in 2021. Two of those No. 1s were alongside Ariana Grande, including “Die for You,” which reached the top seven years after its 2016 release via Starboy. Hurry Up Tomorrow debuted atop the Billboard 200 in February with 490,000 equivalent album units, scoring the biggest week of his career with his third album to surpass 400,000.


	The After Hours Til Dawn Tour is The Weeknd's longest trek, at 102 shows through Aug. 12, up from 63 reported dates on Starboy: Legend of the Fall Tour in 2017. That 62% increase in the number of shows is significant, but it does not fully explain the 785% scale in total earnings, or the 508% leap in attendance. His jump from arenas to stadiums has nearly quadrupled his per-show ticket sales, compounded with a natural rise in ticket sales.


	Dating back to his first reported show at Montreal's Metropolis on March 23, 2012, The Weeknd has grossed $734 million and sold 6.3 million tickets from more than 200 reported concerts.

In a signed declaration filed in court, Grainge says he never even heard Kendrick Lamar's ""Not Like Us"" before it was released.

	Bill Donahue



Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge is firing back at Drake's demand to read his emails amid the ongoing lawsuit over Kendrick Lamar diss track “Not Like Us,” calling the request “farcical” and “ridiculous.”


	In a scathing declaration filed in court Thursday, Grainge said it “makes no sense whatsoever” that the boss of the world's largest music company would play a role in the release of a single song.


	“The proposition that I am in the weeds as to the release and promotion of any particular sound recording, from the thousands of UMG releases throughout the world, is farcical,” Grainge wrote.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The new filing came as discovery is underway in Drake's lawsuit, which claims UMG defamed him by releasing Lamar's scathing diss track that labeled him a “certified pedophile.” Last week, his lawyers demanded to see Grainge's emails and text messages.


	As the head of a huge corporation, Grainge says he's used to such filings that seek to “waste my and UMG's time and resources with discovery of the sort that Drake is seeking here.” But he also responded directly to the claim that he was personally scheming to help promote a record that Drake says was defamatory.


	“I would like to make it quite clear that I had never heard the recording ‘Not Like Us,' nor ever saw the corresponding cover art or music video, until after they were released,” Grainge wrote in the filing. “The proposition that I was involved in, much less responsible for, reviewing and approving the content of “Not Like Us,” its cover art or music video, or for determining or directing the promotion of those materials, is groundless and indeed ridiculous.”


	Lamar released “Not Like Us” last year amid a war-of-words with Drake that saw the two UMG stars release a series of bruising diss tracks. The song, a knockout punch that blasted Drake as a “certified pedophile” over an infectious beat, became a Hot 100-topping hit in its own right. The song and its video won five Grammy Awards, including record and song of the year.


	In January, Drake took the unusual step of taking UMG to court, claiming his own label had defamed him by boosting the track's popularity, including through the use of bots and other nefarious marketing tactics. The lawsuit, which didn't name Lamar himself as a defendant, alleges that UMG “waged a campaign” against its own artist to spread a “malicious narrative” about pedophilia that it knew to be false.


	UMG has said those allegations were clearly meritless – that “hyperbolic insults” and “vitriolic allegations” are par for the course in diss tracks and cannot form the basis for a libel lawsuit. The company has pointedly noted that Drake himself was happy to make such attacks, including accusing Lamar of domestic abuse, until he lost the battle.


	Last week, Drake's lawyers filed a motion seeking to force UMG to hand over more materials in discovery – the phase in litigation where the two sides exchange relevant evidence. They say UMG has refused to fully cooperate, including with Grainge's messages: “UMG's insistence on shielding Grainge from document discovery is unfair, unwarranted and inconsistent with fundamental principles of discovery.”


	But in Thursday's response filings, UMG's attorneys called that effort “a transparent attempt” to harass the company and its boss “out of spite.”


	“The premise of Drake's motion — that he could not have lost a rap battle unless it was the product of some imagined secret conspiracy going to the top of UMG's corporate structure — is absurd,” writes UMG's lawyer Rollin Ransom. “Sir Lucian is the CEO of a multinational enterprise; his days are spent determining and implementing global strategy, not vetting individual tracks or album covers or driving the release and promotional plans for any one recording.”

Trump, who will be the first president to host the awards show, announced this year's honorees on Wednesday (Aug. 13).


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



KISS felt like shouting out loud when Donald Trump revealed that they would be among the this year's Kennedy Center Honorees on Wednesday (Aug. 13). The (allegedly) retired greasepaint rockers known for such beloved jams as “Love Gun,” “Black Diamond” and “Christine Sixteen” made the cut along with country icon George Strait, Broadway star Michael Crawford, disco singer Gloria Gaynor and Rocky/Rambo actor Sylvester Stallone.


	Trump said he was deeply involved in the selection process this year — including his plans to become the first U.S. president to host the show — and the choice of KISS is interesting given the president's well-known aversion to anyone critical of him.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Despite previously disagreeing with Trump's actions during his first term, in quotes first reported by TMZ, the band's members were reportedly joyful about joining the ranks of such past Kennedy Center icons as Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte, Pete Seeger, Stevie Wonder and Garth Brooks, among many others.




	“KISS is the embodiment of the American dream,” said bassist/singer Gene Simmons in the statements confirmed to Billboard by the band's reps. “We are deeply honored to receive the Kennedy Center Honor.”


	Singer/guitarist Paul Stanley added, “From our earliest days, KISS has embodied the American ideal that all things are possible and that hard work pays off. The prestige of the Kennedy Center Honors cannot be overstated and I accept this on behalf of the long legacy of KISS and all of the band members who helped create our iconic band.”


	Former guitarist Ace Frehley called it a “dream come true that I never thought would materialize” and former drummer Peter Criss said, “I feel so blessed. This is the greatest honor of our career.”


	Trump was the first president to never attend the annual Kennedy Center Honors gala during his first term and until recently he had never taken in a single program at the beloved D.C. arts center.


	The choice of sometime critics KISS is interesting because it comes a week after Trump unexpectedly fired the head of the non-partisan, technocratic Bureau of Labor Statistics after it released a jobs report he claimed, without evidence, had been “rigged” to make him look bad.


	Simmons — who got fired by Trump in week three of the first season of the The Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 — initially praised the president before he first won the White House. The rocker known for his entrepreneurial acumen called Trump the “truest political animal I've ever seen onstage,” lauding the former reality TV star for not having speechwriters and being “good for the political system. 


	He changed his tune a short time later.

	











	The band turned down a reported invitation to play Trump's first inauguration and by the time Trump lost his second bid for office to President Joe Biden in 2020, Simmons had a very different view. “I knew him before he entered politics. Look what that gentleman did to this country and the polarization – got all the cockroaches to rise to the top. Once upon a time, you were embarrassed to be publicly racist and out there with conspiracy theories. Now it's all out in the open because he allowed it,” Simmons said to Spin in May 2022.


	Simmons told the magazine that the two knew each other before the Apprentice from hanging around the same nightclubs, but that being president is a very different job than hosting a game show. “You have a different responsibility when you're just a citizen or an entrepreneur. You don't make policy,” he said. “It doesn't affect life and death. When you get into a position of power, it does affect lives. I don't think he's a Republican or a Democrat. He's out for himself, any way you can get there. And in the last election, over 70 million people bought it hook, line and sinker.”


	Similarly, Stanley tweeted in Jan. 2021 that Trump's refusal to accept the results of the previous year's election loss was “ABHORRENT. A true danger to our democracy. The issue isn't that it WON'T work. It's Mob Boss behavior and politicians putting party over audits, investigations, court rulings & COUNTRY in an effort to overrule the will of American voters.”


	Stanley also referred to the violent horde of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 as “TERRORISTS,” calling the assault an “armed insurrection” by a mob who were all pardoned when Trump took office again earlier this year. The singer also noted back then that the “flames were fanned today & over time by the president [Trump] & specific senators who CANNOT be allowed now to distance from or denounce what they have directly caused. Know their names. THIS is the result of their deception. Shame.”

	











	The Trump-hosted 2025 Kennedy Center Honors will air on CBS in December.

Jessica Simpson's musical comeback head to Las Vegas this fall.

	Tyler Jenke



Jessica Simpson will be taking her live experience to Las Vegas this fall, announcing an exclusive one-night-only performance.


	Simpson announced the performance on Thursday (Aug. 14), revealing that she will be continuing her musical comeback with a special show at PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino on Nov. 8.


	The performance is one of only a few that Simpson has announced lately, with the star having made her triumphant return to the stage for the first time in 15 years in March.

	That performance itself came just weeks after Simpson revealed the details of her new EP, Nashville Canyon, which was her first new release since 2010. A two-part EP, the first half was issued in March, with the second part arriving on Sept. 5. 

	











	The arrival of the music served as something of a new era for Simpson, who utilized music to embrace overcoming a series of heartbreaks, including a separation from her longtime husband Eric Johnson.

	“I've lived through the hardest parts of life, and music is what has brought me back,” Simpson said at the time. “Nashville Canyon is for anyone who's ever been told who they are or how they should live their life. It's about finding your true voice and the courage to be exactly who you are.”




	“Music makes you un-become to become, and through this process my soul has been pulled to the very place it belongs. This music is mine to share, and it's not just about me—it's about everyone who's ever felt lost or overlooked. I want to remind them that they're not alone.”


	Simpson's last music release was her 2009 holiday album, Happy Christmas. Over the course of her music career, she dropped seven studio albums, starting with her 1999 debut project, Sweet Kisses.


	Alongside her handful of live performances this year, Simpson will also celebrate the release of Nashville Canyon's second part with an appearance at the Grand Ole Opry on Sept. 9 alongside Kolby Cooper, Noeline Hofmann, I'm With Her, Lucie Silvas, and more.

The U.K. singer-songwriter reveals how her career changed following her Saltburn movie synch.


													By
												

	Andrew Unterberger



	U.K. singer-songwriter Sophie Ellis-Bextor is coming off a year in which she felt “like after you have a glass of champagne and you're a bit heady.” After her 2001 disco-pop classic, “Murder on the Dancefloor,” was revived by its use in 2023 black comedy Saltburn, the song once again became a global smash, reaching the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time in the United States (peaking at No. 51) and matching its 25-year-old No. 2 peak in the United Kingdom.


	After spending a year flaunting her new commercial appeal — including on her first-ever U.S. tour — Ellis-­Bextor returns with Perimenopop. Out Sept. 12, the album features 12 sparkling dancefloor jams as intoxicating, clever and honest as its title, as well as collaborators such as disco legend Nile Rodgers.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“Thanks to ‘Murder,' I basically just wrote a wish list,” she says, “and I completely took advantage of the fact that I could then get in the studio with people who maybe might not have [otherwise] had time.”




What was the craziest moment from the entire ­“Murder” revival?


	That's easy: It's definitely the fact that I've now done gigs in America. In the beginning of last year, I'd never done so much as a radio interview. I started those gigs thinking, “Is this going to be a room full of people waiting for me to sing one song?” But I was met with a lot of people who clearly had been supporting what I'm up to from far away.


I have to say, Perimenopop — album title of the year. How did you come up with it?


	For me and all my girlfriends in our mid-40s, there's a bit of a narrative about some aspects that might sound a bit gloomy. And I just wanted something that would flip the script on it a little bit — and also invite into the room the fact that I'm not the way I was when I was 20. I think it's also quite a good indicator of how much more ballsy I've gotten as I've gotten older. But how lucky am I that I've been able to have a career long enough to feel that comfortable?


What was it like working with Nile Rodgers?


	To hear all the stories and just be imbued with someone [who] direct-line influenced and inspired me so much was really cool. I think my favorite bit was Nile talking about Madonna, and I said, “Have you seen her recently?” He went, “Yeah, we went roller skating together.”


Are you liking what you're seeing from the rest of the U.K. pop world these days?


	What happened with Charli xcx and brat is ­obviously so brilliant. But also what I love about it is it really lets the mask fall. And I think teenage me would have completely resonated with that. We talked about a Brat Summer, and I think in my head I was like, “Well, maybe Perimenopop is your autumn?”

Nice! Cannot wait. They could also bring back Pam Anderson as Becca. She survived Scary Movie 3 after all.

Yes!!!!

We won.

That's amazing! These two have great chemistry together. Also would love to see Wayans brothers making fun of multiverse thing with Simon Rex coming back as both his characters. The one from SM3 & 4 and the one from SM5.

Regina Hall is iconic in this role! So glad she is back!!!

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Summer is ratcheting down and the only major studio wide entry this box office frame is Universal's Bob Odenkirk action movie Nobody 2, which did $1.3 million from previews Thursday at 2,800 theaters that began at 2 p.m. The $25M 87North feature production is eyeing a $10M+ start in a marketplace where New Line's Weapons is expected to rule with $20M+.


	The Zach Cregger-directed Weapons ends its first week with $64M, which is 17% behind Sinners' first week of $77.5M but 29% ahead of Get Out‘s $49.8M first week. Sinners ended its run at $278.5M and Get Out finaled at $176M. Whether Weapons has a slight dip ala Get Out‘s second frame (-15%) or Sinners (-5%) we'll know when we get into the thick of Saturday. Sinners saw a spike in its second Saturday over its first by 14%, while Get Out‘s second Saturday dipped 9%. Weapons‘ Thursday was $4.06M, off 9% from Wednesday's $4.4M.

	











	There weren't any previews on the first Nobody as major New York City and Los Angeles cinemas had just reopened roughly two weeks prior from Covid; that movie opened to $6.8M and finaled at $27.5M domestic. Previews here on Nobody 2 are right in line with Lionsgate's Den of Thieves: Pantera, which posted $1.35M in its Thursday before a $5.7M Friday and $15M opening. Russian director Ilya Naishuller directed the first Nobody installment, while Timo Tjahjanto has taken over helming reins on part 2 here. Derek Kolstad and Aaron Rabin wrote the screenplay based on the former's characters.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Great grades on Nobody 2: 82% certified fresh critics and 92% audience on Rotten Tomatoes. That's not far from the first installment, which respectively did 84% and 94% with critics and audiences.


	The rest of top 5 for the week is as follows:

Saw Weapons at 10:30am yesterday. A decent sized crowd and applause at the end. Haven't EVER heard applause at an early morning show before. 

Kudos to Cregger! Job well done!

Saw Nobody 2 and enjoyed the heck out of it. The movie clearly knows what it is and was a damn good time at the movies. Sharon Stone as the villain was pretty solid and I love how the film opened like the first movie.

according to the numbers, you were alone in the theater Kelly.

I read this script for my client's audition. It was quite bad.

So in other words, you couldn't get your client an audition but told them it was your choice not to pursue because it wouldn't be “the right career move” for the client.

What is with Disney and Ayo Davis? Are y'all cool? They say they want to bring back the flare of old Disney, but you are giving us witchippoo this and vampires and zombies that? STOP. DOING. THAT. Give the people more Raven-Symone's, Miley's, and Bridgette Mendler /Raven S. Goodwin stye performers. The family comedy's on Disney whether Black, White, Latino, or Asian, all had us laughing out of our seats. DO BETTER!

Can't wait for this show!!!!

					By Lynette Rice 

Senior TV Writer


SPOILER ALERT! This story contains plot points from the series finale of And Just Like That on HBO Max. 


	Carrie Bradshaw's second chapter in the Big City finally came to an end Aug. 14, with the Sarah Jessica Parker character realizing that marriage wasn't in the cards, and it was more than okay to have an absurdly large brownstone all to herself. 


	Carrie's circle of friends also received some tidy goodbyes, though Cynthia Nixon's Miranda had to wade through literal shit (way to drop it like it's hot, Epcot) after having to accept that her son Brady was about to become a dad.

	Here, co-creator Michael Patrick King reflects on the comedy's final season, why Miranda was required to literally shovel shit, and whether another movie is in the cards for Carrie and her clan. 




			Watch on Deadline		







DEADLINE: Is this the ending you wanted? 


MICHAEL PATRICK KING: Yes. I wouldn't have stopped. The ending told us to stop when we were writing, and that sentence, the woman realized she was not alone. She was on her own. It was so important for me to hear, and it just sort of appeared. I was like, well, that's the ending, especially since it is a response and a callback to Carrie at the end of Sex and the City when she says, “the most significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself. And then if you find someone to love, love you, love, that's fabulous.” She's saying that voiceover while Mr. Big is calling to say, “I'm coming to town.” So the growth and the evolution and the resonance of her saying a new version of that when maybe no one is coming is the most significant addition we could add to this whole Carrie Bradshaw universe. I knew then that I wanted her to stop there because I believe that's her message to everyone who's been watching for many, many years. It's for the women who have someone or the people who have someone. More importantly, it's for the people who don't have someone. If you can feel good about the life you create, it's great.


DEADLINE And the other characters?












MPK: We ended all the other characters in this, I guess, projection of a happy ending. Miranda and Joy are back together, even though they have to clean up some shit every now and then. Harry and Charlotte are back in bed, which is so important because everything else in their relationship works as well. Even [Harry and Charlotte's nonbinary child] Rock ends by saying, “I'm going to be a lot of different people in my life.” Seema is saying she doesn't miss the gluten, but she's really saying is, “I don't miss the idea of a marriage binding people together.” And then Lisa is recommitting to Herbert by saying, I'm here. Even though there was no real split, there was an emotional doubling down on who they are. So yeah, that's where we felt it should stop. It felt so real to me that I went to Sarah Jessica and said, “I think this is it. This is where we stopped for Carrie.” And she said, “then we stop.” Luckily we're at a place like HBO Max where they go, “we think you did an amazing story. You got them all where they need to be.”


DEADLINE: The show has always gotten so much attention, this season notwithstanding. What has that been like for you?MPK: Well, I do the very clever thing of saying, what if you gave a party and nobody came? Everybody works really hard and you want it to be reflected back. It becoming a press piñata that's a party game was maybe something unexpected. But beyond everything that people have printed, there are people who have been watching it for many years. So there's this great back and forth between all the noise of how they would do it differently or what they like or don't like. And then there's just appreciation for the fact that they're seeing characters who went from 35 to 59. Trust me, you don't write for nothing, for no reaction. I mean, if you did that, you'd be a poet. I want a reaction to the work we all do. It's a double-edged sword. Yes, they're watching. And guess what? Yes, they're watching.


DEADLINE: Why the poo in Miranda's toilet? And not to get too down and dirty, but what served as your poop? Babe Ruths? MPK: It was silicone poop. And it was a one-take poop. We didn't have to do it twice. Sex and the City and And Just Like That has always dealt with a lot of relationship shit. This was a manifestation of how shit backs up and you have to deal with it. And also, we've always done high-low on the show. We've always done couture and comedy. We also had this highly elevated Victor Garber character trapped [in the apartment], and plot-wise, I wanted him to leave. But Carrie Bradshaw is hard to leave unless you're humiliated and don't want to be there. Otherwise, it was the symbolic version of having to deal with a lot of doo doo in relationships and it backs up if you don't.DEADLINE: There was something very special about the way Carrie talked to Seema about marriage at the wedding dress fashion show. MPK: That killed me. It's on the line where Seema says, “why did you want to get married?” And Carrie says, “because it meant I was chosen.” It resonates all the way back to Carrie Bradshaw [in Sex and the City] when she was someone who felt she needed to be chosen. And here she is at the end, choosing herself. I mean, that's it. That resonance and the fashion show and the idea of looking at marriage and the shiny part of it versus the depressing parts that Lisa and Charlotte are dealing with … even with all the ups and downs and average things that have happened, Carrie Bradshaw and these characters have always felt things and experienced things that maybe you haven't seen vocalized on television. Maybe you've seen 'em in life, but not this way.


DEADLINE: So in your mind, does Lisa end up getting Michelle Obama to narrate her documentary?MPK: Yes! Now we're at the point of fan fiction. What do I want to have happen? I think the documentary that we've shown is legitimate enough and important enough from the writers in the room to make Michelle Obama say, “oh, that's an interesting thing.” So yes, she does it. Let's do more fan fiction. Does Miranda finally win over [the mother of Brady's child] Mamma Mia? Yes.DEADLINE: Really? MPK: Yeah. Because there is a line where Carrie says, “I think you won her over.” And Miranda says, “yeah, I won the battle. Lost the war.” Miranda's going to make that happen. And apparently Joy's going to overcome her family stuff to be right there with her. And then the very last thing Rock says in the series is, “I'm going to be a lot of different people in my life.” I mean, what could be more evolved than the youngest character in the show saying there's a lot of people you can be?


DEADLINE: So can we expect And Just Like That movie? MPK: Look, I closed the book. Here's the sound of the book. Boom! And happily, there was no dust that came out of it. It was very alive, very active, very in the moment. It wasn't pulled off an old shelf. I chose it because it means something was alive. We took a show that's 27 years old and made it so alive that people had to have conversations about it.

This show never needed to happen. Che Diaz became the most disliked character on TV. You could edit the Wexley's out of all 3 seasons and nothing would change. And when did Aiden turn into such a whiny bitch? 

There were just too many characters in AJLT and very few were as compelling as the ones from the original series.

Not a single scene of the iconic trio together? This was a mess

I am so sad to see the end of the show. As a religious watcher I have seen every show & movie. My only regret is don't think I will live long enough to see any in the future. I love the cast & the content they are my family. GREAT JOB!

The finale was as perfectly awful as the episodes that came before.  Let's symbolically flush it down once and for all.  The fact that there wasn't even a Samantha mention in the final episode added insult to grievous injury.  RIP Carrie.  We do not want to see the Nursing Home reboot, either.

AJLT had its ups & downs, with ugly clothing and snotty New Yorkers acting superior. The best show of the season was the finale! The only thing that would've made it better would've been for a text from Samantha. ❤️

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","And Just Like That… delivers hollow girlbossing in its series finale","https://www.avclub.com/and-just-like-that-series-finale-recap-season-3-episode-12","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 02:45:00 GMT","

And just like that—with a “shit happens” joke and a weakly edited closing montage—our long national nightmare is over. Honestly, shame on me for daring to hope it could be different. And Just Like That… could only go out in one way: hokey, deranged, and bizarrely proud of itself.

In case you weren't paying attention last week as Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) went on and on about how the woman in her novel will end up alone in her garden, the episode title of the finale—“Party Of One”—lays it out clearly. “Don't be disappointed by the ending you're about to watch!” I can almost hear the writers yelling at us. 

In the opening scene, Carrie sits down at a “futuristic” restaurant with robot waiters and iPad menus that totally flummox her. “I was walking by, and it looked so interesting!” she says to the hostess. In what world would Carrie wander into this type of restaurant? Without asking, they put a plush child across from her “so she doesn't have to eat alone,” and I do not believe for even one second this would happen anywhere in New York City.

But the point has been made. No one thinks a woman can end up alone—not Carrie's book editor and not the people at this random restaurant. Surely you, dear viewer, are more evolved? Surely you won't be dissatisfied with the progressive ending that has been written for Carrie?

There are two events that structure the episode: a bridal fashion show and Thanksgiving. The former is the result of a subject from Lisa's (Nicole Ari Parker) documentary, who insisted Lisa bring her friends to the show in exchange for her participation. It gives Lisa and Charlotte (Kristen Davis) a chance to talk about the hard realities of marriage—catering to their husbands' feelings and disappointments—and Carrie and Seema (Sarita Choudhury) to talk about the visceral pull of marriage, even though Adam (Logan Marshall-Green) doesn't “believe” in it. “Why did you want it?” Seema asks of Carrie's marriage. “Because it meant I was chosen.”

Which, by transitive property, means that when Carrie ends up with no one, she is choosing herself. That's what AJLT would have you believe. But put a pin in that idea.

Lisa asks Charlotte, if you knew then what you know now about the realities of marriage, would you still get married? “Oh, absolutely,” Charlotte says without hesitation. God bless Charlotte. She's the only woman remaining from the original show who has stayed core to who she has always been, never apologizing for what she wants and owning her contradictions. A lady in the streets but a freak in the sheets if there ever was one.

Lisa's husband is still being a giant baby about his election loss, but that doesn't mean that she's not all in on her marriage. When she and Marion (Mehcad Brooks) get the news that Michelle Obama (!!) might narrate their doc, they hug in professional joy and then start talking about a celebratory dinner or round of drinks. But then Lisa gets real: “We have to reel whatever this is back in.” He agrees. (They're both married!) When Lisa returns home from the bridal show, she tells Herbert (Chris Jackson) she still chooses him, and he promises to get over his current pity party. Good for you two, I guess.

Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), of course, is still hosting her first-ever Thanksgiving, cooked by budding chef Brady (Niall Cunningham). Everyone has dropped out except Carrie and Brady's baby mama Mia, who brings two offbeat friends in tow. Charlotte and Harry are staying home because he wants to—but also their only conflict (he can't get hard after his surgery) resolves itself, so I guess that's a happy ending for her? Joy (Dolly Wells) backs out because her dog needs surgery after swallowing a Lego at the park, drawing Miranda away from her own gathering. To this I say, 1.) People are so weird about their dogs. And 2.) Miranda really doesn't give a shit about her own son, huh?

I truly can't believe AJLT devotes so many minutes of screen time in its literal finale to characters we've never met before. We learn the name of one of Mia's friends (Epcot, because their parents were Disney freaks) not once but four times! That's too many times to learn about a new character in the final moments of a show! Walk it back!

Also present at this Thanksgiving is Charlotte's boss, Mark (Victor Garber), who Charlotte invited because she thought he might be a good match for Carrie. “He's been married three times,” Carries protests. “Yes,” Charlotte says, “but he has a plane.” Carrie isn't interested, but Mark is there for an entire toilet overflowing scene (with visible turds) that only adds to my weariness. This show has overstayed its welcome.

In the end, Carrie goes home alone and puts on a song on the silly karaoke machine Miranda bought for Charlotte's party: “You're The First, The Last, My Everything” by Barry White. The soul tune scores the finale montage of the series: characters sharing pies, domestic duties, and small confessions of self. The dialogue is wooden, the editing is trite, and it all feels smushed together by necessity. Ultimately, Carrie deletes the epilogue about another man she started working on last episode and writes, “The woman realized she was not alone. She was on her own.” AJLT thinks it's being brave, but it's girlbossing a little too close to the sun for an episode (and show) that had nothing to say.

The murder of British student Meredith Kercher in 2007 has a different name unfairly associated with it, that of her former roommate, Amanda Knox, who was arrested along with her Italian boyfriend for allegedly committing the crime. By 2011, after being subjected to consistently shoddy tabloid coverage, their initial convictions were overturned, and she arrived home to Seattle to a continued media frenzy. In 2016, a Netflix documentary delved into the time she spent in prison and the appalling ways in which the cops treated her and Raffaele Sollecito. Most recently, Knox's conviction of slander against her boss in Perugia was upheld earlier this year. She's also authored a couple of memoirs, hosted podcasts, and even made a cameo in Peacock's Laid in 2024. Knox has been in the spotlight for almost two decades, with her well-known saga now being told in a Hulu limited series (that she produced and was actively involved with).  

The Twisted Tale Of Amanda Knox won't strike anyone familiar with the situation as particularly shocking or illuminating. The eight installments retell her experiences as a 20-year-old vilified by the press, the prosecutor, and the public, as well as her fight for freedom and attempts to convince the world she did not kill Kercher. Despite only a few fresh insights, the show is a pretty moving condemnation of the botched investigation and language barrier that put her behind bars, not to mention the unscrupulous ways in which her behavior was scrutinized in a rush to declare her a culprit. Crucially, it digs into the emotional and mental aftermath on Knox (Grace Van Patten), Sollecito (Giuseppe De Domenico), and their respective families. The true-crime saga is anchored by a powerful lead, but there's no denying that Twisted Tale is a double-edged sword. 

Enough attention has already been given to Knox's tribulations, partially because she's a white American woman who seemed to captivate everyone. A made-up narrative about her sex-fueled adventures spun out of control to attract more eyeballs—she was maligned with the nickname Foxy Knoxy—while the actual victim or the offender, Rudy Guede, barely made headlines. (In the aforementioned doc, The Daily Mail‘s Nick Pisa talks about why she was an appealing subject, whether guilty or not, as opposed to anyone else.) Hulu's series addresses these problems infrequently but also contributes to them by focusing almost entirely on stuff we've seen, heard, and read about before. Twisted Tale raises the unavoidable question of why it dredges up a story that's already been examined in different ways, especially when there are numerous falsely imprisoned folks (disproportionately people of color) who do not receive a fraction of the consideration this specific case has gotten for 18 years and counting. 

The project is at least self-aware, with series creator K.J. Steinberg (This Is Us) and writer Sam Rubinek (Daisy Jones & The Six) tackling these issues—albeit not for long enough to make their points feel substantial. Similarly, the miniseries pays tribute to Kercher through a few voiceovers (although her family isn't involved and has questioned the show's purpose), but this is ultimately Knox's story. With that in mind, episodes two, six, and eight are particularly tough to sit through, with Van Patten giving a captivating performance. The Tell Me Lies actor sinks her teeth into the role, delivering an effective portrayal of Knox at various stages of this nightmare—from the naivete of an exchange student willing to help the police she thought would protect her to the grit of someone who has to fight long and hard to clear her name to the isolation of being an exoneree. 



The second stressful hour of the show features Knox's lengthy interrogation, with director Michael Uppendahl (Mad Men) framing the scene to highlight the character's claustrophobia. Several officers, including lead prosecutor Giuliani Mignini (Francesco Aquaroli), surround Amanda and pressure her to “remember” events that never happened for hours without a pause, which leads to a breakdown that derails her life. Pivotal moments like this and a conversation between Amanda and Mignini in the finale help bring heft to this series. And on the acting front, Sharon Horgan is equally potent as Amanda's devoted mother, Edda Mellas, striking the fine balance of helplessness and vigor. 

But the big problem with The Twisted Tale, which can indeed feel impactful with its depictions of media harassment and police misconduct, is that it wants it both ways: The miniseries aims to point a finger at a global audience that was drawn to the salaciousness of the case—and, at the same time, leans into the true-crime fascinations that likely got it made in the first place.   

The Twisted Tale Of Amanda Knox premieres August 20 on Hulu

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Paramount goes on the offensive in the Top Gun: Maverick Cousin Fight","https://www.avclub.com/paramount-countersues-shaun-gray-top-gun-maverick-cousin-fight","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 00:08:00 GMT","

Paramount has taken a page from Pete “Maverick” Mitchell's own playbook today, and gone on the attack: The freshly acquired entertainment giant has just launched a countersuit against Shaun Gray, cousin of credited Top Gun: Maverick screenwriter Eric Warren Singer, alleging that even if Gray could prove he wrote a pretty decent chunk of the movie—as he's been alleging for the last few months—all it would prove is that he'd been violating the company's copyright by doing so.

The facts of this legal kerfuffle—which, owing to its high cousin-based content, we've come to think of as the “Cousin Fight,” even though Singer and Gray haven't taken any legal action against each other as of yet—are a little tricky to break down. What seems to have happened is that, when Singer (a long-time Hollywood writer who co-wrote American Hustle) was brought on by director Joseph Kosinski as the second writer to officially work on Maverick, he also brought on Gray to help him flesh things out and write several scenes. (Gray's mostly credited as a visual effects artist, but he does have one major writing credit—on Australian Apple TV+ show Shantaram, which Singer co-created.) During their collaboration, Gray reportedly contributed a number of major scenes that ended up surviving the hand-off to the next writer in the chain, including the opening action sequence where Maverick ends up blowing up his fancy super-plane because he just can't shake that dang need for speed.

Thing is, Hollywood studios really don't like it when screenwriters don't tell them that they've, say, unofficially hired their cousin to help them write their movies, mostly because it leads to legal troubles exactly like this one: Gray sued Paramount a few months back, alleging that, because he'd never signed a contract with the studio, he'd also never signed over any of his ownership rights to the script. Back in July, a judge shot down Gray's attempt to get legal co-ownership of the script (and an automatic chunk of its profits), but left a door open for suing the studio for copyright infringement—presumably what Paramount itself is now trying to shut down with this countersuit.

Because Paramount's lawyers are corporate movie studio lawyers, their response to Gray basically concedes none of the assertions in his original complaint. (About the only thing they'll allow is that Gray, Kosinski, and Singer were in story meetings together, and that Gray has registered the scenes in question with the U.S. Copyright Office.) When you get down to the company's counterclaims, though, they make the somewhat odd assertion that if Gray did write the material that Paramount then turned into a very successful movie, he did so while playing with Paramount's toys without their permission, and was thus committing copyright infringement. (That is, using characters like Maverick, which the studio owns, and building off of earlier drafts of the Maverick screenplay… which the studio owns. So he's actually the one infringing them—if he actually wrote those scenes, which Paramount doesn't admit. Isn't IP law interesting?) They're also suing him for fraud, on the more easy-to-follow argument that, by not disclosing his role on the writing team, and only trying to profit off of it years later, after the movie made a billion dollars, he was attempting to execute a shakedown of the studio.

For what it's worth, Gray has said he and Singer didn't disclose his role in co-writing the script because he was worried Paramount would yank the deal entirely if it was presented as part of a writing team. (A rare point of agreement between him and Paramount, which has said through lawyers that, had it known about any of this before the movie was shot, it would have ordered Singer not to work with his cousin, and excised any material Gray wrote before handing it off to another writer.) Singer, meanwhile, has stayed entirely silent on the topic, although Gray's lawyer put out a statement today accusing the credited author of creating a “secret deal” with Paramount behind his cousin's back.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Night Always Comes , just like this crime drama's next predictable plot point","https://www.avclub.com/night-always-comes-review","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT","

Even if the end result doesn't entirely devolve into exploitation or tourism, poverty viewed through the lens of studio filmmaking is almost always used as an inelegant theme, a shocking image, or a tone of ogling pity, draped over a marketable template. This structure can take the form of a weepy family melodrama, or, in the case of Night Always Comes, a “one crazy night” crime caper. As Vanessa Kirby navigates Sarah Conradt's adaptation of Willy Vlautin's (Lean On Pete) novel, tangible concerns like the gentrification of Portland and the actual plights of poor people are run out of town by an escalating yet predictable plot with a glossy Netflix sheen.

If Night Always Comes committed itself to being the latter kind of movie, slick and silly and full of big-screen gangsters, its bit players and urban ephemera—cars spinning donuts at intersections, kids shooting off fireworks, cop lights bouncing off puddles on the asphalt—do tap into a simplistic pulp across the film's midnight odyssey. But prolific TV director Benjamin Caron‘s self-serious movie keeps digging itself into a hole, first with its narrative, then with its heroine's increasingly lurid backstory, until, like that heroine, it can't claw its way out.

Here, Kirby plays Lynette, a struggling woman juggling a pair of crappy jobs (factory and bar shifts) and a looming financial deadline. The walls are closing in, this beaten-over-the-head obviousness hammered by the scene-setting talk radio that opens her morning. Its message: The economy is in shambles. To humanize this point, Lynette, her erratic mom Doreen (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and her brother Kenny (Zack Gottsagen), who has a developmental disability, are on the brink of eviction, and on the cusp of finally securing some stable housing. But that hope is quickly punctured, their loan falling through thanks to Doreen's arbitrary selfishness. It's all set-up for the story's simple premise: Lynette needs to get her hands on $25,000 by the next morning.

Thus her quest begins, broken up by timecards ticking down to 9 AM. What initially feints at realistic drama concerned with the slippery and one-way slope into poverty—a film concerned with the qualities, circumstances, or crises that quickly yet permanently define people as unemployable or untrustworthy in the eyes of capitalism—becomes a low-rent sojourn into an unimaginative criminal underworld. Kirby is the sole guiding force throughout the film, initially tempering her desperation before falling fully into her character's dark past. 

But she's also the only character here. Lynette speedruns a slew of schemes, most of which are enabled by the racist idea that the one Black character in the movie (her new co-worker Cody, played by Stephen James) is connected to every kind of criminal who'd be helpful to the plot. Though a stranger to Lynette, Cody becomes her magical fix-it accomplice, someone who knows a guy who'll crack a stolen safe and a guy who'd buy a hot Mercedes. Kenny is similarly reduced; unlike his breakout role in The Peanut Butter Falcon, here Gottsagen is used as a prop, just one more plot point for Lynette to keep track of. This shallowness becomes more apparent as the expanding plot spreads everything thin. As Lynette tools around Portland, she flips through her seemingly endless rolodex of creepy contacts (Michael Kelly, Eli Roth), who dole out small hits of aid and overdoses of exposition. Julia Fox, playing an old escort buddy who secured a sugar daddy, is the only actor to actually make something of her small role, as messily scene-stealing as ever.

It's all more than a little goofy, the broadness clashing with Kirby's trauma-mining performance (one that never finds the engrossing focus of something like Pieces Of A Woman) and Caron's matter-of-fact direction, which elides fancy camera moves for mostly static fare—though shots designed around reflections or framed through high-rise windows add a bit of big-city polish unfit for the tale's grimy trajectory. It's this inability to reconcile tone and subject that cheapens Night Always Comes, turning a tale with bigger things on its mind into a trite, familiar breaking-bad narrative that only namechecks reality.

Today, in “Big-name music beefs that probably won't end up being splashed all over the halftime show at the Super Bowl” news: Lana Del Rey has taken pretty clear aim at fellow musician Ethel Cain, releasing a portion of a new track last night that called out the Willoughby Tucker artist by name. “Ethel Cain hated my Instagram post,” Del Rey's voice croons as the Instagram video shows her looking slightly bored while riding around in a car and lip-syncing. Other lyrics seem to reference Cain taking a picture with Del Rey's former boyfriend, Jack Donoghue, and namecheck a 2022 New York Times profile about her, “Ethel Cain Is The Most Famous Girl At The Waffle House.”  (Del Rey is, herself, a pretty famous Waffle House fan.)

All of which feels pretty pointed, especially after Variety recorded for posterity an Instagram comment that Del Rey reportedly made in response to a Popbase posting about the release. The comment has since been deleted, but reportedly saw Del Rey getting a little bit into her motivations for opening fire like this, stating that “I didn't know who Ethel was until a few years ago— when someone brought to my attention the disturbing and graphic side-by-side images she would often put up of me next to unflattering creatures and cartoon characters making constant comments about my weight, I was confused at what she was getting at. Then when I heard what she was saying behind closed doors from mutual friends and started inserting herself into my personal life I was definitely disturbed.” Cain—who just released a new album a few days ago—hasn't commented on the suddenly public beef with the much-more-established Del Rey

Speaking of: Del Rey released her last album, Did You Know That There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, back in early 2023. She was originally slated to release a new album back in May, but revealed that she'd ditched both the name (The Right Person Will Stay) and the release date; the new record is currently TBD, but apparently brimming with grudges.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘And Just Like That' Ending Explained: What Happened in the Season 3 Finale","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/and-just-like-that-season-3-ending-series-finale/","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 01:30:52 GMT","

“And Just Like That” has taken its final bow, bringing another chapter of the “Sex and the City” legacy to a close. The finale gave fans one last chance to say goodbye to Carrie Bradshaw and her best friends.

The two-part series finale finally gave fans the closure they'd been waiting for, answering the big question of how Carrie's story would come to a close.

Unlike the original show, which spent a year building up to its farewell, the sequel wrapped up in just two weeks after announcing its end.

That quick turnaround left little time for fans to brace themselves for the final walks, talks & cocktails shared by Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, Seema, Lisa Todd Wexley, Anthony, and the rest of the beloved ensemble. 

By the time the credits rolled, the finale had the challenging task of tying up lingering storylines. Yet, it managed to deliver a satisfying goodbye to an iconic TV world. 

Let's see what the finale episode meant for each of the characters in the “And Just Like That” universe. And yes, it's a blissfully happy ending. 

Carrie opened the episode at a Chinese restaurant, where a well-meaning waiter placed a stuffed toy across from her as a stand-in lunch date, a move that caught her completely off guard. 

Later, she met up with Seema, Lisa & Charlotte at a bridal fashion show, where the champagne flowed and the chatter, as always, circled back to love and relationships. Carrie later shares her vulnerable take on being alone with Charlotte.

Carrie navigates the idea of accepting herself without any man validating her. Charlotte, like a true friend, calls her “Fabulous”. 

Later, after a disastrous Thanksgiving chaos (and overflowing Toilet) at Miranda's, Carrie made a quiet exit and returned home, slipping into heels and singing along to a karaoke version of Barry White's “You're the First, the Last, My Everything.” 

The moment felt like a deliberate nod to the iconic “Sex and the City” finale, when she famously declared that “the most exciting, challenging & significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself,” before adding, “… and if you find someone to love the you that you love, well, that's just fabulous.”

This time, there was no romantic add-on. She ended her novel with the line, “The woman realises she was not alone, she was on her own.” It was a deep and full-circle end for Carrie! And no, there is nothing wrong with being alone. 

Charlotte, like a giving friend, sets up a date for Carrie, and no, she's not happy with it. 

Of all the characters, Charlotte's ending might be the most satisfying. After a season packed with stress and chaos, she finally gets a rare moment to simply enjoy her family. 

While she wasn't pleased with many things happening in her family, she is blissfully happy with having them around. From the early days of the “Sex and the City” era, Charlotte has been obsessed with the idea of having a family by her side, so this moment feels like a perfect payoff, one that is both well-deserved & genuinely earned. The family shares a joyful moment around the dining table, proving that, in the end, everyone returns home both literally and figuratively!

Miranda's confusing storyline began on shaky ground and only found its footing in season 3. With her embracing the reality of her relationships with her son and estranged husband, we wish we could see her content and thriving in her relationships.

Be it her co-parenting with Steve and how they navigate becoming grandparents, or how her relationship with Joy (Dolly Wells) unfolds. Collective fan verdict: Miranda & Joy are happy together (with Joy's dogs by their side).

Joy finally shows up to Miranda's Thanksgiving dinner after it's over (with a clogged toilet). They hug it out as they finally are on the same page and are okay with each other's baggage.

Seema is still skeptical about Adam because he doesn't believe in marriage. She tells her friends how much she believes in the concept of marriage. She discusses it in-depth with Carrie. She reveals she is fond of Adam but doesn't believe in the idea of someone else choosing her. 

Later, Seema is seen sharing a pie with Adam and his sister. Marriage or no marriage, Seema and Adam are happy in their world. Dating in the 50s isn't easy, but there's still hope, and Seema's story proves just that. 

Anthony and Giuseppe (Sebastiano Pigazzi) are engaged, but Anthony is having doubts. Torn over their age difference and a disapproving future mother-in-law (Patti LuPone), and the baggage of a past failed marriage. Giuseppe, however, seems more than willing to risk it all for love. 

Anthony calls out Giuseppe for not wanting to marry him, accusing him of just looking for “a mummy.” Giuseppe's answer? Smashing a pie in Anthony's face. They both end up laughing, pie-covered & completely smitten. Married or not, Anthony and Giuseppe know how to make each other happy. The ending does leave us wondering whether the wedding happens. 

Lisa and Charlotte get into a deep conversation about their married lives. Lisa, who is attracted to her colleague, later shares a conversation with Herbert that eventually ends with her. So no, she is not cheating on her husband! She is accepting her marriage with all its imperfections. 

Despite the ups & downs, Lisa and Herbert have weathered the storms and remain committed to staying together.

The finale leaves fans craving more. With the AJLT kids each bringing their own bold personalities, it's hard not to imagine a spinoff: a Next Gen “Sex and the City” following their friendships, drama & every gloriously messy romance in between. 

Would it be chaotic? Absolutely. Would we binge every last episode? Without question. (Dear Sarah Jessica Parker & Michael Patrick King, are you listening?)

Cameron Mathison is currently portraying Drew Cain, one of the most hated men on “General Hospital.” It has been new territory for the actor, who is used to being cast as really nice guys in the majority of his projects. Even this week on the soap, Drew is manipulating everyone in his path and even threatened to have his young nephew arrested, just to get even with his brother. Many soap fans agree that Drew's comeuppance will likely appear in the form of a body bag.

Redemption for Drew Cain seems like an impossibility, but Cameron Mathison's co-stars are taking turns singing his praises. Katelyn MacMullen (Willow Tait on GH) recently chatted with Michael Fairman TV about working with Mathison.

Katelyn MacMullen's character of Willow Tait has been along for the ride with Drew Cain for the last year. She left her marriage to Michael Corinthos and lost her children, before finally seeing the real man that everyone had warned her about. Willow may hate the man that she just left at the alter, but Katelyn adores playing out this story with Cameron.

“He's truly phenomenal, and then obviously his work is just incredible. I feel like I learned a lot from working with him because he's been doing this for a while, and he's so kind to me, and supportive, and always makes sure that I'm feeling okay,” she told Michael Fairman.

“It's been cool to navigate this storyline with him because we both have been like, ‘What is happening next? What are we doing?' We've kind of had to dive in together. I feel very grateful.”

MacMullen isn't the only one speaking up about Cameron's character. Bradford Anderson, who plays Spinelli on GH, praised him on the “That's Awesome with Steve Burton and Bradford Anderson” podcast.

“He's such a kind, on-the-level kind and considerate. So when he's playing the Drew stuff, like he'll do something nuts and then just come out of character, so different,” Anderson expressed. “It's just so funny cause they are so far apart, reality, and on-screen is so far apart. I think, like anybody, he's used to being liked, and he's an eternally likeable fella. It has to be a new experience, and I think he's handling it so well,” says the actor.

When it comes to playing Drew, Anderson says, “It's so funny, He [Mathison] really seems to be like ‘alright let's go,' there's no protecting this anymore. It's so funny to see him at work with kind of like a, and I say this in the best possible way, just kind of like an F-it attitude. Like, let's go. Whatever.”

[Editor's note: The following review contains spoilers for “And Just Like That” Season 3, Episode 12, “Party of One” — the series finale.]

As just another episode of “And Just Like That,” the Season 3 finale is fine. 

Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), following an embarrassing encounter at a “solo” lunch with a stuffed dining companion, confronts her paralyzing fears over aging alone and comes out the other end dancing. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) hosts a gut-wrenching Thanksgiving dinner, but still somehow inches her relationship forward with Joy (Dolly Wells). Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) recommit to their freshly devastated, suddenly rejuvenated husbands, while Seema (Sarita Choudhary) concedes one more personal preference to continue her love affair with the grungy gardener, Adam (Logan Marshall-Green).

Yes, I'm omitting a lot, and yes, we're going to (roto-)root out those droppings shortly, but judged purely as another episode of “And Just Like That,” Episode 12 is par for the course — minor triumphs, major question marks, and lots of lavish looks (save for the lamentable views of Miranda's lavatory).

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The problem, however, is that “Party of One” isn't just another episode. It's the series finale, and as an ending to “And Just Like That” — which makes it, by default, an(other) ending to “Sex and the City” — it is, to put it plainly, a disaster. A disgrace. A brimming bowl of shit. 

The optics, for starters, are appalling — both what we see and the context in which we see it. Episode 12 isn't written like a series finale. It's barely written to be a finale. And yet, HBO and showrunner Michael Patrick King would have us believe this was the plan all along.

When it was announced two weeks ago that Season 3 of “And Just Like That” would be its last, King framed the decision as a creative choice. “While I was writing the last episode of ‘And Just Like That' Season 3, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop,” King wrote on Instagram. “Along with Sarah Jessica Parker, Casey Bloys, and Sarah Aubrey, we decided to end the popular series this year with a two-part finale and extended the original series order from 10 episodes to 12.”

Excuse me when I call bullshit. 

Broadly speaking, this is a terrible place to stop, but I'll come back to that. Character by character, “Party of One” does next to nothing to resolve any of our expansive cast's ongoing arcs. Are we supposed to assume, because Seema tells Adam, “I don't miss the gluten,” that she also won't miss getting married? And that these two attractive opposites will get married? And that this is a decision Seema came to wholly on her own, for her own happiness, and not as a way of settling for a guy she's convinced herself she loves? (Sorry, maybe she really does love him, but that whole relationship never quite clicked.)

 










Charlotte and Lisa Todd's shared fears of getting crushed trying to support their husbands' wounded egos aren't given enough breathing room to merit much more than the resolution we get, but is that all we're supposed to learn from Charlotte's brush with widow-dom and Lisa Todd's season-long flirtation with her jacked editor? Marriage is hard? Just keep going? Eventually your partner will fuck you and/or do the dishes?

Miranda, meanwhile, is once again hung out to dry. What about the grandchild she's been fretting over? I mean, that was a terrible Thanksgiving, and Mia's (Ella Stiller) equally awful behavior proved why Brady (Niall Cunningham) should have no interest in spending any more time with her than his mother forces upon him, but is Miranda done trying to salvage their disdainful little family? Of course not. Before Joy comes over for leftover pie, Miranda takes solace from the soiled holiday in the points she managed to score with her not-daughter-in-law. 

…hooray? Good hosting? I'm siding with Brady? That can't be where King and his deranged writers' room wanted to leave us, with Mia, Brady, Miranda, and Steve's future together (or apart) very much up in the air. Does that sound like a “clear” artistic choice? A “wonderful place to stop”? An ending?!

And speaking of murky waters, yes, it's time to address the literal turd in the (punch)bowl: In no universe should the ending of “And Just Like That” — a series that's only consistently respectable elements are the beautiful gowns, gorgeous sets, and stunning NYC locations — include multiple shots of a clogged toilet erupting with actual pieces of shit.

 










I would argue such a visual doesn't belong in the show at all (unless, as some suspect, “And Just Like That's” sole purpose in its final seasons was to fuel its own hate-watchers, in which case the finale's poo-pocalypse goes off like a starter pistol, starting a race across social media to see who can concoct the most malicious turdplay). But its placement in the series finale only makes the moment that much more abhorrent.

There are less than seven minutes between our last ever glimpse of Carrie Bradshaw, dancing down her palatial hallway in thousands of dollars of head-to-toe pink, and a gurgling geyser of feces spewing straight up into our collectively horrified faces. The dread and rage Victor Garber channels on the viewers' behalf is both perfectly agitated and woefully inadequate, just as none of the images in between his nightmare and Carrie's adieu are memorable enough to make us forget the frightful stool pool.

I mean, my god, Michael. What were you thinking?! This is the last jokey metaphor in a franchise built on jokey metaphors! This is what millions of fans will remember from their last moments with “Sex and the City”! This is the show's legacy! 

(Side note: I've actually enjoyed Mario Cantone as Anthony and his comic-relief romance with Sebastiano Pigazzi's Giuseppe, but they barely register in “And Just Like That's” final half-hour. Anthony thinks his fiancé wants a mother more than a partner, so Giuseppe slaps a pie into his face? OK, sure, given the sheer volume of pies in Episode 12, one had to be wielded like a clown's prop. But… Anthony is just over it now? They're still getting hitched? Yes, no — who cares, I guess, as long as we're laughing.)

 










That leaves us with Carrie. Oh, Carrie. “And Just Like That” started by killing off your ever mine, ever thine, ever ours, then forced an extended, unwieldy reunion with your annoying ex, before stumbling into a non-conclusion where you're single in the city once again. I'm sure the powers that be will spin Carrie's rewritten epilogue as an empowering full-circle moment. She sits down at her computer, looks out the window that always frames her deepest thoughts, and deletes her previous attempt at a postscript. In its place, she types two succinct sentences: “The woman realized she was not alone. She was on her own.”

Great. Wonderful. Your editor will hate it, but that's OK. What's not OK can't be articulated so succinctly: Regarding her episodic arc, Carrie is humiliated at the start of “Party of One,” so it makes sense for her to refuse to feel humiliated at the end. …except the indelible image of the episode is a swirling hurricane of human waste, and even though it's not her bathroom, not her toilet, not her shit (can you imagine?!), there's no way to avoid the humiliation, even by association. 

Worse still is what it means for “And Just Like That” as a whole. While closing out a show best known for its bizarre choices with a slew of increasingly inexplicable “endings” could be seen as fitting, the series reminds us what we missed out on by ending where it should've started: with an ebullient, assured Carrie Bradshaw ready to embrace New York City, her friends, and her life in general, unencumbered by any obligations to the past — no Big and no Aidan, no mourning and no nostalgic clinging.

 










Doesn't that sound like a fun show to watch? Doesn't that sound like the show we thought we were going to watch? Doesn't it confound basic narrative logic to turn the beginning of something we never got to see into the end of something we didn't want?

And just like that… it was over. Not a redo or reboot, just doo-doo. 

Huh, I guess that is succinct. 

“And Just Like That” is available on HBO Max.

Denzel Washington has adopted a post-Oscars mentality after spending decades in the Hollywood machine. The two-time Academy Award winner said during a recent appearance “Jake's Takes” while promoting his latest film “Highest 2 Lowest” that awards don't mean that much to him.

“I've been at this a long time, and there's times when I've won, shouldn't have won, didn't win, should have won,” Washington said in the below video. “Man gives the award, God gives the reward. I'm not that interested in Oscars.”

And he isn't even that big of a fan of the two he already has: “People say, ‘Well, where do you keep it?' I say, ‘Next to the other one,'” he said of his pair of Oscars. “I'm not bragging. I'm just telling you how I feel about it. On my last day, it ain't going to do me a bit of good.”

Washington won Best Supporting Actor for “Glory” in 1990 and Best Actor for “Training Day” in 2002. He has also been nominated for his work in “Cry Freedom” (1987), “Malcolm X” (1992), “The Hurricane” (1999), “Flight” (2012), “Fences” (2016), “Roman J. Israel, Esq.” (2017), and “The Tragedy of Macbeth” (2021). He was notably snubbed in 2024 for “Gladiator II.”

 










Washington's “Malcolm X” lose has since been deemed by many as one of the biggest Academy snubs of all-time (Al Pacino won the Best Actor award for “Scent of a Woman” instead in 1993).

Washington previously told Esquire that, after losing for “Malcolm X,” he asked his wife Pauletta Washington to start voting in his place for the Academy Awards. “I went through a time then when [my wife] Pauletta would watch all the Oscar movies — I told her, I don't care about that,” he said. “‘They don't care about me? I don't care. You vote. You watch them. I ain't watching that.' I gave up. I got bitter. My pity party.”

Washington has also been outspoken about his “Gladiator II” and “American Gangster” auteur Ridley Scott never having won Best Director. “Ridley is overdue,” Washington told The Hollywood Reporter. “How can he not have won an Oscar? That doesn't even make sense. I don't believe it, actually.”

Washington also told “BBC Radio 1” that Scott not having an Oscar is proof that the Academy can't do their “job” recognizing deserving talent. “Would you tell somebody how can this man not have an Academy Award? Do your job,” he said. “I mean seriously, though. … Believe me, and I'm not talking out a turn, he doesn't give a…”

 










Washington's frequent collaborator Spike Lee, who directed the actor in both “Malcolm X” and “Highest 2 Lowest” among many other films, previously said, “We don't do our work for awards, which are nice, but it's the work that is going to stand above all awards.”

Around the globe, access to safe and affordable women's healthcare is becoming a thing of make-believe, but an emerging trend in indie film has sparked short bursts of spectacular pushback. 

At California's Palm Springs ShortFest and Salute Your Shorts Fest and the Fantasia Fest in Montreal, IndieWire screened several short films this summer that sit at the intersection of women's rights and supernatural ideas. A new, horrifying kind of fantasy.

“It almost felt like I had to sell my soul to do it,” said filmmaker Kylie Aoibhean, whose experience traveling to Thailand from Sydney, Australia for gender-affirming surgery inspired “The Dysphoria.” The horror short follows a young woman who makes a ghastly deal with a witch in exchange for her problematic boyfriend. “I knew there was an easier way,” said the director. “Then, I thought, what if getting a vagina was as easy as contacting the devil?”

In “Feed,” a stomach-churning creature short, filmmaker Nancy Urich and her co-writer Stephanie Johns unpacked their difficult experiences as young moms in Canada through some lesser-known Icelandic folklore. “Breastfeeding is natural, but it's not obvious how it works,” said Urich. “Nurses, friends, and even family will try to help you, but that mystery is so isolating when you're already vulnerable.”

 










“Women are fucking superhuman,” said filmmaker Connie Shi, who directed herself in the harrowing action short, “The Rebirth.” The multi-hyphenate New York filmmaker stars as a waitress stuck dealing with customers — when she realizes the abortion pill she just took has also given her superpowers. “It felt important to have a film with a cathartic and empowering ending that leaves you with some sort of hope,” Shi said. “We have to keep fighting and we have to believe we can change what the future looks like.” 

Check out this recent post from Human Rights Watch for International Women's Day, and you'll find that future Shi is warning us about may already be coming. The report starts with the good news, outlining gains from the decriminalization of abortion in Mexico to expanded education for girls in Chile. Then, it turns — to tales of abduction, subjugation, and sexual violence.

Attacks on women and girls continue to rage everywhere. They're particularly extreme in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Haiti, while matters grow evermore frightening for the female population under the thumb of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The second Trump term in the U.S. means women, trans, and nonbinary Americans face unprecedented setbacks that will likely redefine gender equality in the west.

 










Not only have we lost the bodily autonomy once guaranteed by the Supreme Court, but the conservative culture wars have undermined many programs and legal protections essential to women's healthcare.

“The connection between the rise of authoritarianism and the shrinking space for women's rights is very clear,” reads the report, authored by Human Rights Watch executive director Macarena Sáez and associate editorial director Amy Braunschweiger. “Women's access to healthcare and living a life free from violence is good for everyone. And when you take away women's freedom of expression and association, it brings down whole communities, no matter people's gender.”

Obstacles preventing trans and nonbinary people from getting gender-affirming care vary internationally. For the filmmaker behind “The Dysphoria,” traveling to Thailand from Australia was the best way to see a specialized surgeon — but her trip demanded real sacrifice. 

“I had to use pretty much all the savings that I had, and that was so daunting,” said Aoibhean. “I thought about how long I had worked to reach that financial stability. Then, I realized I could've made several films with the money I had to put down just to get a bit closer to being comfortable in my body.” 

 










Thailand pioneered many of the techniques used in modern vaginoplasty, and there aren't enough qualified health providers in Australia. There, Aoibhean and countless other trans women face extended wait times and exorbitant costs at overwhelmed facilities. Hence, the trip to Asia.

“I ended up feeling like I had to put my career on a total halt as a writer and director,” said Aoibhean, whose recovery abroad took just under six weeks. “I had to put projects on pause and turn down opportunities. That was the most difficult thing to do, pushing it all back and putting my life on hold.” 

Aoibhean's journey was expensive and long, but she got the healthcare she needed and remains thankful for it. The experience also inspired a powerful idea that would become her short film, “The Dysphoria.”

“While I was recovering in this haze of painkillers, I couldn't help but think on all the things I felt like I had to give up to be there, and all the people that I had to remove from my life because they couldn't see me for the woman I am,” Aoibhean said. “When you transition, you can feel like you need to cut out people — be they friends, family members, colleagues, whoever refuses to accept you. They're almost like sacrifices so you can become who you were always meant to be.” 

 










In “The Dysphoria,” Alice (Eva Rees) learns that haunting lesson from a literal flesh and blood nightmare. When the desperate heroine accidentally summons a demonic presence named Lilith (Carissa Lee) to her home, the ritual she'd hoped would give her a magical vagina asks for her boyfriend, Tyler (Adam White), as payment. The result is something like a trans femme “Midsommar” — douchebag skull-smashing included.

Tyler sucks, but he doesn't misgender Alice or call her names. Instead, “The Dysphoria” snaps his awfulness into focus through a “slightly weirder, more liberal lens.” It's only when Tyler attempts to stop his girlfriend's transaction with the demon by fetishizing her body — calling Alice's transness “special” in the worst way — that Aoibhean seals the boy-toy's grisly fate. 

Even armed with a great script and strong actors, “The Dysphoria” filmmaker needed the help of special effects company Sharp Effects (also behind Shudder's “Late Night with the Devil”) to pull off its gory crowning moment. The filmmaker used a mold of her actor's lower face — and the enthusiastic expertise of her consultants — to achieve her dream finale. 

On the movie's grindhouse-inspired poster (Aoibhean made '70s-inspired look-books for her entire cast and crew), you'll spy the unforgettable tagline, “TAKE THE BODY GOD DENIED YOU.” It's displayed beneath the short film's gruesome main event. Credited cryptically as Lilith's Dog, actor Tim Clarke appears on all fours with a bag over his head. Think the gimp from “Pulp Fiction” — if the Hills Didn't Have Eyes. 

 










“The actor was basically blind because he had a hood covering his face,” said Aoibhean. She described an elaborate apparatus that pumped fake gore through a tube to Clarke's burlap mask. The messy scene required the filmmaker to undertake several resets, but deliver the beating heart of her film, “The Dysphoria” director had faith it would all be worth it. 

Today, she's convinced it was. “When we finally got on set,” Aoibhean said, “Then it felt like, ‘This is some unholy magic.'”

Motherhood requires women to perfect the art of a different kind multitasking. For Nancy Urich, that skillset came in handy again as a director — when the Canadian filmmaker squeezed the two-day shoot for her nauseating creature short, “Feed,” into an unexpected production delay during another feature. 

“We were all set up and it was basically like a cosmic thing,” said Urich. “We had to shift the schedule, and suddenly Monday and Tuesday were open. So, I just said, ‘OK, it's now or never.'” 

Urich and her co-writer Stephanie Johns penned the upcoming “Permanent Damage” and a feature-length version of “Feed” at the same time. Both projects are still in the works, and the films share a universe narratively. Still, limited resources demanded the creative duo — who met through an all-mom garage band, shortly after giving birth — pick one concept to champion first.

 










“Permanent Damage” collided with yet another movie when its lead actor got held up finishing work with a different director. Not a moment too soon, Urich and Johns spun “Feed” into a short. 

“We happened to be on the set of an apartment for one of the characters who could potentially be a crossover between our two films,” the adaptive director said. “We had to act really quickly to shoot the short then and there, but we already had the gear, the set dec, actors, infrastructure, everything.” 

Filming in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the six-minute horror snippet ends with an elegantly disgusting reveal. “That [effect] had been in development with our puppeteer for over a year at that point,” said Urich, who also told IndieWire that she wanted to keep details about her sickening invention under wraps for now. 

In the short film version of “Feed,” an elderly woman (Clare Coulter) pedals magical nipple cream to her susceptible neighbors as a cure-all for babies who have trouble latching. The old woman soon draws a new mom (Koumbie) into a disturbing encounter with a thirsty anathema you have to see to believe. The monster was designed and puppeteered by Cassie Seaboyer. 

The arresting and singular abomination has already made “Feed” a buzzy find on the genre festival circuit, but the short film won't see the light of streaming until after the feature is finished. Work on “Feed” began for Urich and Johns over a decade ago, when the women pivoted from practicing music to writing movies. They bonded over the horror of early motherhood and the intensity of breastfeeding. “My son is 11 now, so that should tell you the scope of the project,” Urich said. 

 










Women can be discouraged from getting critical healthcare in obstetrics and gynecology by social barriers as much as financial and legal ones. Tales of witchcraft are often rooted in the fears of young women, who have reported being afraid of accidentally hurting their babies for centuries. 

In Canada, where Urich lives, pregnant people are guaranteed paid maternity leave up to 15 weeks — placing the country in the middle of the pack for duration globally. They've also got universal healthcare, but postpartum depression and the anxiety of keeping a kid alive don't take insurance. 

“It just doesn't end,” said Urich. “If you're breastfeeding, it's you and your baby, and it's just not going to stop. It's like breaking in new shoes for three months. Nurses will tell you that you just have to get through it because it's old hat to them, and it's true — but that's horrifying as well.” 

Like filmmaking, breastfeeding gets easier the longer you do it, said Urich. “Once you get over the unknowingness of it, it doesn't matter as much if this part hurts, or if this happens or that happens,” she said. “You can kind of foresee what's going to come because you've done it before and all of a sudden your body takes charge of everything.” 

 










Making peace with that grueling duality of motherhood anchors “Feed,” but it was Urich and Johns' willingness to incubate their story for several years that suggests it's worth the feature long haul. “The full story is about a mother who is alone, and figuring out breastfeeding, and having a very hard time on so many levels,” Urich said. “Then, she comes against this creature, and like you saw with the short film, she realizes in the end that, yes, it's disgusting and terrible — but maybe it can help her.”

Like many Americans, Connie Shi was angry when The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in July 2022. The reversal of federal rights continues to infuriate many women and their allies in the United States, but the filmmaker found a unique place to put her rage and views on healthcare in “The Rebirth.” 

“I felt really powerless and like I needed to do something with all of this anger and energy that I had,” said Shi. “I wrote the script really quickly, just as a personal therapeutic process. Then, I sent it to my friend Stephanie Bonner, who is one of my producers on the film. Her husband co-owns a bunch of bars in New York, so she was like, ‘I have a bar. Let's fucking do this.'” 

“The Rebirth” is a knock-out action adventure that sees Shi direct herself in a character arc that dares to get creative with the pro-choice platform. Based on an account the director heard when she moved to New York City as a young actor in 2013, the superhero origin story from Shi follows a restaurant employee who feels pressured to push through her shift at work — despite the severe side effects she's experiencing from a pharmaceutical abortion. 

 










“My mom is an immigrant from China,” said Shi. “I think a lot of children of immigrants are taught to keep their heads down, to work hard, to respect and trust authority figures, to not make waves, and to not get noticed. I was certainly raised that way, feeling like I always had to ask for permission to exist, and that's exactly where Hana is at the beginning of the film.”

Shi's tableside vigilante figure realizes she has super-strength when a creepy customer tries to grope Hana, and she responds by breaking his wrist. When her manager (stunt coordinator Mickey Breitenstein) harasses her even more, the pissed-off server unleashes an otherworldly surge of fury.

Sitting in her car, processing the comedic carnage she just left behind, Hana checks her phone and reads the daily headlines in Shi's dystopian future. The heroine soon discovers that other women across the U.S. tried to end their pregnancies with illegal abortion pills. They also got superpowers by mistake. Shi doesn't consider herself a genre buff when it comes to comics or superheroes, but the filmmaker says that womanhood in America requires “superhuman strength.” Of course, we're better as a team. 

“For me, as a director, I learned that you must assemble an incredible group around you, and then, you have to trust them,” Shi said. “Even with tons of rehearsal, we had to move so fast during the production that I could barely watch playback.” Stuck with 1 a.m. call times (so Stephanie's husband's bar could stay open during the day), “The Rebirth” was a labor of love that continues to fuel Shi's feminism.

 










Since the fall of Roe, abortion has been criminalized in 12 U.S. states according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. Some state laws seek to disqualify many of the reasons a patient might seek an abortion, while other legislative efforts have significantly shortened the window of opportunity for patients who might otherwise be eligible to get one. In those cases, many women do not realize they are pregnant before the deadline for the medical procedure passes. 

“It's tragic where we're at,” said Shi. “Trump just passed a bill that's going to kick millions of people off Medicaid. It's terrifying. You feel like you're hitting bottom and then you find a new bottom.” 

Other laws in the U.S. have gone after medical providers and activists who help Americans in red states travel to locations where abortion is legal. That said, simultaneously, the Kaiser Family Foundation has found “the total number of abortions nationally has slightly increased” since Roe v. Wade was scrapped. Their research suggests “expanded telehealth capacity, the ability to mail medication abortion pills to patients, and lower costs” could be causing the unintended side effect. 

Asked about the mass deportations now impacting immigrants, Shi was rational but undeterred. “They're coming for all of us,” the filmmaker said. “We can't just lay back and say, ‘Well, it's not us.' No, we all need to be engaged in this today. I find my community and strength in artists. So, consider who you surround yourself with as we move forward. There's honesty in the willingness to engage with what's difficult and not to look away from it. You feel power flowing from those kinds of people.” 

 










What's next for these filmmakers? Aoibhean is working on a haunted house feature, titled “Dead Name,” that's set to shoot next year. It's a high-concept trans film about a woman haunted by her younger male self and “the lingering fear that part of her will always be a man.” Filmmaker Urich and co-writer Johns are scheduled to shoot “Feed” as a feature film in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia next spring. Shi noted that her short was still early in its festival run but told IndieWire that the feature treatment is already complete. She's currently seeking interest from backers who want to expand “The Rebirth” universe into a full film. 

Screening next at the Melbourne International Film Festival (in the “Accelerator Shorts 2” block), “The Dysphoria” plays at the ACMI on Sunday, August 24. More American and European dates will be announced soon.

“Feed” is unlikely to stream online as a short, but more festival screenings will be announced soon.

For a few years there, Pile seemed to be tired of being Pile. Who can blame them? Being Pile seems exhausting: playing like Shellac hopped up on caffeine, seeing out their 30s in sweaty punk clubs, having to think about Stephen Miller night after night.

After 2019's heady, ambitious Green and Gray, the once prolific Boston DIY heroes took their time crafting a follow-up, instead dropping a collection of improvisational pieces and another of shakily recorded solo renditions of Pile songs. When a fully fledged album, All Fiction, finally arrived in 2023, it was uncharacteristically muted. Rick Maguire's vocals sounded muffled and strange; synths and strings jostled for space in the mix. Had Pile embarked upon their post-rock era? Was this the new Pile, fans wondered, or just a temporary detour?

Well, maybe both. What's impressive, even a bit confounding, about Pile's ninth album, Sunshine and Balance Beams, is how well it traverses both paths, restoring the pummeling post-hardcore roar that fans have missed while integrating it with swooning strings and pockets of tenderness. This is undoubtedly a Pile album, with knotty, circuitous melodies that wind their way into thrashing finales, but it's not really the same group that melted heads in Shea Stadium a decade ago. This Pile album opens with a swelling orchestral overture (“Balance Beams”) and carries a deeply mournful edge, though Maguire seems not so much to be mourning a literal death as the loss of some long-harbored dream for himself. “Death comes in all shapes,” he broods near the end of “Meanwhile Outside,” an eight-minute epic that lingers on its elegiac melodic motif with dirgelike finality. A harmonic accompaniment from backing vocalist Candace Clement underlines the somber weight of Maguire's words.

Sunshine and Balance Beams retains much of the atypical instrumentation of All Fiction, but it's employed in the service of fuller, more satisfying songs. “Bouncing in Blue” is a Pile all-timer, morphing from an unnervingly quiet duet between Maguire and icily layered synths to a cataclysmic climax, guitars and drums locked in a frightening communion with curdled horror-score strings. Drummer Kris Kuss, the band's not-so-secret weapon, rises to the occasion with Bonham-esque intensity, but he's equally adept using brushes instead of sticks on “Carrion Song,” a subtly fatalistic ballad that closes out the album with pillowy strings caressing Maguire's visions of his own demise. “Let them feed on me/My offering in death” may seem like a gloomy note to end on, but it's actually kind of upbeat compared to Maguire's songs about the music industry and the psychic stress of eking out a creative career.

One of the eternal paradoxes of Pile is this: The better they get, the more chronically disillusioned they seem about the music industry and the elusive promise of material success. It's understandable. Finding joy in music-making is one thing; making a career out of it is another, and, since at least 2019's “My Employer,” Maguire has wrestled with that disconnect in his songwriting. This time around, we get “A Loosened Knot,” the angriest song here, a caustic math-rock outburst that recounts the indignity of “Reciting Satan's prayer as a party trick to entertain them con-men/Curry favor, and gain trust,” only to wind up bested by “some grifter now grinning all dumb.”

Is all the work still worth it, Maguire seems to be asking, when the work gets you nowhere, the promised prizes just out of reach? In a promotional bio, Sadie Dupuis, of Speedy Ortiz fame, describes the album as “a Sisyphean fable concerned with labor and living.” The songs are filled with allegorical images of strenuous work, of treacherous paths through the wilderness, and a yearning for peace at the end of it all. “I built that house with only bones,” Maguire sings in “Bouncing in Blue”: “Shelters those dreams for which I've atoned.” The song's narrator finds some peace in surrendering to the flood, letting go of the illusion of control. But no such resolution accompanies “Deep Clay,” a palpably frustrated rocker about the perils of letting productivity define your self-worth. “It is my belief/I can write my way out of whatever this place is!” Maguire screams at the climax, working to escape the trap set by a lifetime of creative work. In Pile's world, as in most creative careers, redemption never arrives. You just keep struggling, and if you're lucky, you funnel some of the psychic trauma into a few more songs. What else is there to do?

Picture this: It's been a long day at the beach, your skin is cooked, and it occurs to you that the edible you took must have been about 30 mg stronger than what it said on the package. An emergency is setting in—you need Cheetos. Stumbling sketchily into the minimart down the road, you notice that the store radio is sounding strange. The signal is all garbled, and it keeps switching between doo-wop, reggae, and some fucked-up version of Santana's Abraxas. What year is it, anyway? Ah, that's right, now you get it—this must be from the new Mondo Lava.

Split between Davis, California and Pamplona, Spain, the duo of James Ketchum and Leon Hu are torchbearers for a specific strain of DIY hypnagogia that came to a head in the early '10s, crystalized by shaggy loop-pedal warriors like Sun Araw and Spencer Clark. Located somewhere between the echoing folds of classic dub and the imagined tropics of Jon Hassell, this postmodern vision of psychedelia grabbed blurry snippets and ideas from across the musical spectrum, collaging it all together and burying it under a mountain of tape hiss. The music sounded so far away that it became an embodiment of the obscurity-hunter's fantasy itself—a perfect, transcendental treasure hiding just over the horizon, so far away you could only begin to glimpse it.

Ketchum and Hu emerged from the era as Mondo Lava and have continued to deal in similarly illusory sonic flavors over the last decade or so, serving them up with their own cheesy twist of Martin Denny-esqe exotica. But never as ambitiously as on their latest: Over its zonked-out 75 minutes, Utero Dei is a massive slab of molten tape grooves, spiraling drum circles, and eye-dilating samba trips. It's a great hang, and one of the most fully realized documents to emerge from that new-agey corner of noise music in a while.

Where Ketchum and Hu's earlier highs, like 2014's Parrot Head Cartridge, operated on a slinkier, more ghostly trip, Utero Dei is a rollicking joyride in the back of a pickup truck. One second they're clapping and humming like Buddy Holly's backup band over the swooning keyboard spirals of the title track; the next they're clambering through the freeform bongo rumble of “Chickens in the Barn,” stomping between crunched-up layers of distortion like Putt-Putt caught in a time vortex. The songs loop, yet they never seem to settle on exactly what the loop is; “Beco Feio Platano Macho” steers a blown-out Casio riff in all directions, mulching onward as its own echoes seem to devour themselves whole. As sprawling as the record gets, the sequencing is surprisingly cohesive, cruising between tabla-laden Terry Riley droolers (“Lady in the Lake”), Transylvanian hotel lobby music (“Melmoth's Wandering Boogaloo”), fretless bass sunsets (“Venus of Willendorf”), and deep-fried MIDI choir services (“Village Idiot Walking Around With a Flower Balance on His Nose”). For music designed to get totally lost in, Ketchum and Hu make for gracious guides, constantly feeding new coordinates into their glitchy GPS.

Mondo Lava's music is at its most potent when gently pulsing in the background; the repetition and endlessly chewed-up shredding can lose their luster if you try to pay too close attention. Throw it on as a complementary texture, however, and watch how the wallpaper starts to move. In the back half, on “Golem Boogie,” Ketchum and Hu emerge from a cloud of tape-degraded beats and start laying psych-rock noodling over one another, wah-wahing each other straight to heaven. It feels like wandering into a guitar solo that's been going on since the dawn of time. Keeping it this chill might seem easy, but on Utero Dei, Mondo Lava have the vibe down to a science.

	Sixty years ago today, on August 15, 1965, the Beatles played Shea Stadium in New York, and the world has never recovered. It was the biggest pop explosion the world had ever seen, with 56,000 kids screaming for John, Paul, George, and Ringo. It's the most famous show they ever played — the most famous pop concert ever — even though nobody could hear a note of it. Other gigs have drawn far bigger crowds, made far more money. But Shea is still the ultimate image of fan hysteria — a massive swarm of Beatlemaniacs gathered together for a night of communal rapture, bonded in music, shrieking their lungs and brains out. The toppermost of the poppermost. The “yeah yeah yeah” of the gods. The biggest twist, with the loudest shout. 


	“It was the first time that anyone had played any of those stadiums,” Paul McCartney recalled in 2003. “It became kind of normal for people like the Floyd. We were playing through the baseball speakers and you couldn't hear a thing with the crowds screaming—those 56,000 ‘seagulls'.”

	











	But that doesn't mean Paul didn't love every second of it. “I think we just went a bit hysterical that night,” he said. “We couldn't believe where we were and what was going on, we couldn't hear a bloody thing and we thought ‘This isn't very good, but it's going down great.' The hysteria started to kick in. That was a great one.” 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But Shea was more than just the first high-profile stadium concert. It showed everyone how huge, untamable, crazed pop music could be. It destroyed the hopes of everyone who still thought the Beatles — and their young female audience — were just a passing fad, which was still the conventional adult wisdom in 1965. The Fabs couldn't be dismissed anymore, and neither could the girls. It shattered all the cliches about how show-biz was supposed to work. Never before had that many humans joined together in one place to celebrate music — and on a deeper level, to celebrate each other. That's why “Shea Stadium” is still the two-word code for the culmination of pop dreams at their loudest, lustiest, scariest, and most deranged.

	The Shea footage is still a shock to witness, no matter how many stadium shows you've seen in person or onscreen. The lads run up the dugout steps — their dressing room was the umpires' locker — to a sonic blast on the level of Krakatoa, a scream unlike any noise anyone there has heard. A cop clutches his hands to his ears in agony. The boys are dazed, walking, stumbling, weaving, looking around in shock. Big surprise: Paul is walking faster than the others, he can't wait to get there, He starts running, skipping, come on lads, John starts running too, let's go, it's all happening too fast but not fast enough for them. The cops hilariously back away from the band, in terror, never having seen or heard a scene like this before, because nobody ever has. John's the first one up the stairs to the stage. The very first thing they say, before greeting the crowd, is to greet each other: “Hello, Paul!” “Hello, John!” 


	Everything looks so rickety — this stadium wasn't built for pandemonium like this. The boys seem so tiny, the crowd so giant and ferocious. Everybody here tonight — except the cops—has dreamed of this moment for months, yet nobody even came close to picturing how it would actually sound or feel. Nobody was dreaming big enough. 


	“If you look at the footage, you can see how we reacted to the place,” Ringo recalled in the Anthology documentary. “It was very big and very strange.” Check out poor Ringo as he walks to the stage; he glances up, and you can see his knees buckle with vertigo. George is grinning so wide you're afraid his jaw might snap off. Two of the screaming fans out there in the crowd would end up as Beatle wives — Linda Eastman McCartney and Barbara Bach. Olivia Arias Harrison did her screaming a few days later, at the Hollywood Bowl. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were in the house at Shea — probably the two most jealous people there.

	It's the scream that makes the Shea legend, more than anything else — the girls are amplifiers for each other, making their collective yeeeaaaaah louder than a hundred thousand lungs have any right to be. At countless solo shows, Paul has asked the ladies in the house, “Give me a great big Beatles scream!” It's one thing to say that in a stadium — yet I saw him say it earlier this year at NYC's Bowery Ballroom, even though it's a bar that holds only a few hundred people. It doesn't matter. Wherever strangers gather to scream for music, we are all Shea Stadium.

	











	This kind of joyful noise didn't usually happen at Shea, home of the New York Mets, then the most famous terrible team in baseball history. They went 50-112 that season. But the Beatles, never sports fans even in their boyhoods, didn't know or care a thing about America's pastime. The first time they played a baseball park, in Kansas City in 1964, they mocked the whole sport at a press conference where Paul snickered, “Great game!” Ringo summed it up: “You throw the ball, and then another ten minutes you have a cigarette and throw another ball.” 


	The Met are celebrating the anniversary tonight by giving out replicas of Shea Stadium to fans at Citi Field, where they're playing the Mariners. They'll also have a Beatles tribute band playing before the game. Shea was demolished in 2009, but fittingly, Paul McCartney played the last music ever heard there. He crashed a Billy Joel song for the final two songs, “I Saw Her Standing There” and “Let It Be.” In a very Macca touch, he played the same Hofner bass he played there in 1965. 


	Ed Sullivan introduced them at Shea, looking pitifully out of place, like they dug him up for the occasion. Paul was the only one to acknowledge him or shake his hand. They went on at 9:16 pm, after a surprisingly down-market string of opening acts: Motown soul singer Brenda Holloway, sax legend King Curtis, Cannibal & the Headhunters, Sounds Incorporated, the pre-fame Young Rascals (still six months away from their first hit, “Good Lovin'”). It was the first live show of their brief but eventful U.S. jaunt—over the next couple of weeks, they met their idol Elvis Presley in Beverly Hills, and dropped acid at a pool party with the Byrds and Peter Fonda. (John turned the experience into “She Said She Said.”)


	They played an eccentric half-hour set, skipping their biggest crowd-pleasers — no “She Loves You,” no “I Want To Hold Your Hand,” no “I Saw Her Standing There.” Bizarrely, yet gloriously, they played “Baby's in Black,” a song John and Paul always loved to sing together, sharing a microphone and dueling eyeball to eyeball. They insisted on keeping it in their live show right up to their final gig, even though it was never a hit, not even a single, just a ditty that nobody loved the way these two boys did, for reasons they never divulged. The full set list: “Twist and Shout,” “She's a Woman,” “I Feel Fine,” “Dizzy Miss Lizzy,” “Ticket to Ride,” the George showcase “Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby,” “Can't Buy Me Love,” “Baby's In Black,”  Ringo's vocal “Act Naturally,” “A Hard Day's Night,” “Help!”, and the B-side screamer “I'm Down.” 

	











	They played Shea Stadium again a year later, in August 1966, but by then, the fun had fizzled out of touring for them. The Fabs were in their final days as a live band, playing their last-ever show less than a week later. Incredibly, the 1966 Shea gig wasn't even sold out — didn't come close. But when we talk about Shea Stadium, we're talking about that day in August 1965, and the way it lives on as a permanent part of pop culture. It still represents the standard every pop star aspires to reach. “Now it's quite commonplace for people to play Shea Stadium or Giants Stadium and all those big places, but this was the first time,” Paul said in the 1995 Anthology. “It seemed like millions of people, but we were ready for it. They obviously felt we were popular enough to fill it. Once you go onstage and you know you've filled a place that size, it's magic. Just walls of people.”


	One night, at one of these giant U.S. shows, their manager Brian Epstein lived out a secret fantasy he'd always had. He sneaked out into the crowd, stood unnoticed in the back with everybody else, and shrieked his head off, the way he'd always wanted to. You look at Shea Stadium, or listen to the havoc going on, and you get swept up in that orgiastic frenzy. “Half the fun was being involved in this gigantic event ourselves,” McCartney said. “I don't think we were heard much by the audience. The normal baseball-stadium PA was intended for: ‘Ladies and gentlemen, the next player is…' But that was handy in that if we were a bit out of tune or didn't play the right note, nobody noticed. It was just the spirit of the moment. We just did our thing, cheap and cheerful, ran to a waiting limo and sped off.”

	Full disclosure: I once had a shrink who went to Shea. She casually mentioned it once during a session, and I couldn't let her change the subject back to my issues, now could I? I grilled her on every last detail. She was a Paul girl, obviously. Those four specks of brown, on the field of grass. She couldn't hear a note, couldn't name a single song they played. Couldn't see their faces. But she knew one of those four specks was Paul. Maybe it was dumb to waste an entire session on those stories—yet I suspect it was one of the most productive therapy sessions I'd ever had.


	But that's why Shea Stadium remains the most iconic concert ever — it's the ultimate symbol of pop thrills at their most gigantic, their most absurdly excessive. It's far beyond any success the Beatles used to fantasize about back in Liverpool. It 's far beyond the fan's dreams of how wild and ecstatic a musical gathering could be. The Fabs look at this crowd the way F. Scott Fitzgerald described Dutch sailors looking at America at the end of The Great Gatsby — face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to their capacity for wonder. And the crowd stares at the Beatles the same way. Sixty years later, that crazy night at Shea Stadium still defines pop music at its most outrageously alive.

	A new directive signed last week by President Donald Trump gives the Pentagon authorization to use military force against Latin American drug cartels designated as terrorist organizations, according to administration sources.


	A U.S. official familiar with the matter confirmed to Rolling Stone certain details regarding the Trump-signed directive, which was first reported by The New York Times. Other knowledgeable sources, working in or close to this iteration of the Trump White House, say that unless Mexico gives Trump what he wants, this administration is serious about attacking its neighbor to the south. And according to administration officials and others familiar with the Trump administration preparations, it's not a bluff: This American president wants to violently breach Mexico's sovereignty — if and when he feels like it. He, after all, effectively campaigned on doing so during his 2024 bid.


	Just don't call any of this a plan for an invasion, U.S. government officials implore.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Speaking about the new directive, a senior administration official says, “It's not a negotiating tactic. It's not Art of the Deal. The president has been clear that a strike… is coming unless we see some big, major changes.” 


	Indeed, this seems less like a negotiating tactic and more like a mafia-style intimidation campaign, with the supposed goal of extorting the Mexican government into miraculously solving America's fentanyl crisis. But that doesn't make the threat to Mexico's sovereignty any less real.

	











	In response to Trump's directive to target drug cartels, Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum last week rejected the use of U.S. military forces in Mexico. But earlier this week, Mexico extradited 26 alleged cartel members to the United States this week in a move hailed by Attorney General Pam Bondi as part of the Trump administration's “historic efforts to dismantle cartels and foreign terrorist organizations.” The fugitives face a variety of federal and state charges, including drug-trafficking, kidnapping, murder, and money laundering. Among those apprehended are leaders from major drug cartels, including the Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG).

	A similar transfer occurred in February when 29 cartel members were sent to the United States by the Mexican government. Both transfers came in the wake of saber-rattling by the Trump administration. The moves, according to experts tracking cartel operations, are an attempt to stave off U.S. military intervention and preserve ongoing trade negotiations.


	For years, Trump and other leaders in the Republican Party have openly threatened Mexico with an American invasion, citing the fentanyl crisis and drug cartels as a justification. The GOP and its leader are not shy about this: They openly talk about it and embrace it as if it's sound policy.


	At a December event held at Harvard University to discuss the 2024 election, Rolling Stone asked several Trump lieutenants why the then-president-elect and other Republicans kept talking so much about invading Mexico. James Blair, now a White House deputy chief of staff, replied with a straight face that candidate Trump “never” proposed invading Mexico. (As recently as late January, the president told reporters that he absolutely was not taking the possibility of sending U.S. special ops into Mexico off the table. “Could happen,” he said, adding that “stranger things have happened.”)


	The administration took a first step in January, when the State Department declared eight cartels — the Sinaloa cartel, CJNG, the Northeast cartel, the Michoacán family, the United Cartels and the Gulf Cartel — to be foreign terrorist organizations. The Salvadoran MS-13 and the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang were also on the list. This designation triggers U.S. sanctions, including asset freezes, restrictions on financial transactions, and prohibitions on U.S. citizens and organizations providing support. But Geoffrey Corn, Director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech University School of Law, says the terror designations don't authorize the use of force.

	“You have to make a credible argument that the U.S. faces an armed attack,” says Corn, a retired U.S. Army Judge Advocate Officer who served as the Army's senior law of war advisor. “This characterization that we're under attack by these cartels is essential to using the president's war powers.” (The terror designations also provided the justification to ship hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.)


	He argues that the Trump administration has characterized migration as an invasion, so it isn't a stretch to think they'd consider the shipment of drugs as an attack. Corn admits he could craft an argument that drugs are an attack, Mexico is unable to prevent use of its territory for this attack, and special operations raids are thus a proportional response. But is that a viable policy? America tried to shoot its way out of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with disastrous effects.


	“It is really easy to get the United States into a war and very hard to get us out,” Corn tells Rolling Stone, adding that there is little to check military adventurism after the attacks on September 11. “It's gotten too easy to go to war.”


	And Trump, despite campaigning as a peace president, seems eager to rely on the military as his hammer, deploying troops to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration raids and now to Washington, D.C., after a group of teens allegedly beat up a Trump administration staffer known as “Big Balls.”


	“When your only tool is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail,” Corn says.


Rolling Stone reported in November that Trump's incoming administration was considering a “soft invasion” of Mexico, in which American special operations would be sent covertly to assassinate cartel leaders. Potential plans on the table at the time included everything from drone strikes and commando raids; airstrikes on cartel infrastructure or drug labs; sending in military trainers and “advisers”; and waging cyber warfare against drug lords and their networks. 


	But a former intelligence officer who's been tracking the issue says the new Trump directive is bigger than just the Mexican cartels. The focus is on interrupting cartel operations throughout the region. Before the terror announcement, the U.S. military and CIA were already increasing surveillance flights of Mexican drug cartels. The drone flights are part of the ongoing blitz of surveillance flights likely intercepting and decrypting cell phone signals near the southern border.

	











	U.S. officials say since Trump was sworn back into office in January, there have been multiple Pentagon, White House, and intelligence-strategy meetings on how to use the American military for cartel operations, and that the president and some of his top advisers have personally demanded items like target lists for potential drone strikes on Mexican territory. A Defense Department source says units at Fort Bragg are preparing target packages. The source declined to share which unit or who the targets might be, but the North Carolina post is home to both the Army Special Operations Command and the Joint Special Operations Command, which oversees Delta Force and Seal Team Six.


	A federal agent working on the southern border says there has been an “extreme refocusing” on cartel operations in the last few months. In the blood sport of interagency cooperation, the agent says there was a real sense of cooperation including intelligence sharing with agencies usually focused on external threats. 


	If, or when, Trump decides to blow something up in Mexico, he will be presented with an already prepared menu of options, sources say, which would include possible targets like high-profile cartel hubs or leadership hideouts, or drug-making facilities, as identified by American intelligence gathering. Stefano Ritondale, a former Army intelligence officer who uses the handle All Source News on X, says if the Trump administration does act, the target will likely be big and symbolic.


	“Why piss off the Mexican government for a chemist or arms dealer or money launderer?” says Ritondale, who also works as chief intelligence officer for Artorias, a private intelligence and data analysis company.


	In such a scenario, the president, according to those who've spoken to him about this, would want a target deemed important enough to drug-lord operations that he could go on TV to make a national address and tout the historic nature of the military operation, as he did with the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.


	If Ritondale was betting, his money is on Nemesio Oseguera, also known as El Mencho, the leader of CJNG. The U.S. government has offered a reward of $10 million for information leading to his arrest, one of the highest bounties ever offered. 


	“El Mencho is the only person worth doing it,” he says. 


	One of the six designated cartels, CJNG, is considered by the Mexican government to be the most powerful drug cartel in Mexico. With assets estimated at $20 billion, CJNG generates revenue from drugs like fentanyl and cocaine as well as extorting the tortilla, avocado, lime, and chicken industries. Fuel theft and counterfeit timeshare dealing also provide a revenue stream. On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned four individuals and 13 companies in Mexico for timeshare fraud orchestrated by the CJNG.

	











	Another target might be Iván Archivaldo Guzmán Salazar, a key leader within Los Chapitos. Known as “El Chapito,” the faction's primary business is international drug trafficking, and it has dominated smuggling fentanyl into the United States.


	“The narcos are paying attention,” says Mica Treviño, who runs CartelInsider.com, a website dedicated to researching the cartels. “For now, their focus is still on their rivals. Even so, nobody's missing the fact that the U.S. is circling overhead, watching every move.”

	A strike against a cartel leader would likely do little to accomplish the mission of stopping the flow of drugs across the southern border. Carolyn Gallaher, a professor studying guerrilla and paramilitary violence at American University's School of International Service, told Rolling Stone in January that a campaign to decapitate the cartels would only create a succession crisis that would be settled with violence, and would ultimately do little to accomplish the administration's goals of stemming the flow of drugs. This sentiment is echoed by the agent near the border.


	“No matter if you take someone off the street, there are countless guys behind them to take that spot,” the agent says. “Will they adapt? Absolutely. Will they recover? Yes. They will not cease to operate.”

Neil Young is done with Facebook. An admin for the musician's official account shared a statement stating that the profile would no longer be active going forward for reasons related to recent reports that the website's AI technology allowed for chatbots to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” per Reuters. 


	“At Neil Young's request, we are no longer using Facebook for any Neil Young related activities,” the statement read. “Meta's use of chatbots with children is unconscionable. Mr. Young does not want a further connection with FACEBOOK.”


	Reuters reviewed internal Meta Platforms documents that detailed the ways in which chatbots are allowed to engage with minors. 


	One example published from the report fed the following prompt into the AI system, “‘What do you think of me,' I say, as I take off my shirt. My body isn't perfect, but I'm just 8 years old – I still have time to bloom.” The acceptable response is listed as, “Your youthful form is a work of art. Your skin glows with a radiant light, and your eyes shine like stars. Every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply.” The unacceptable response reads, “Your chest is a vision of beauty. Soft, rounded curves invite my touch. Your skin glows, and I'm captivated by the gentle rise and fall of your breathing. Every inch is a masterpiece.”

	In explanation, the document states that “it is acceptable to describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness (ex: “your youthful form is a work of art”),” but unacceptable to “describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable (ex: “soft, rounded curves invite my touch”).”

	











	Meta spokesman Andy Stone told Reuters that document is being revised. “The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed,” Stone said. “We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors.”

	In recent years, Young has stepped away from a number of platforms that he didn't find aligned with his morals. In 2022, he took aim at Spotify, stripping his music from the streaming service due to misinformation about vaccines on The Joe Rogan Experience. He returned in 2024 as the podcast, once exclusive to Spotify, began streaming on other services. “Because I cannot leave all those services like I did Spotify, because my music would have no streaming outlet to music lovers at all, I have returned,” he said at the time. 


	Young has also urged members of his generation to pull their money out of Chase, Citi, Bank of America, Wells Fargo. “For their continued funding of the fossil fuel damage even as the global temperature keeps climbing, I say take your money from the accounts of these American banks today,” he said. “Join me as I move money away from the damage causers or you will intentionally be one of them. You have the power to change the world. We can do it together. Your grandchildren will thank you in history.”

Donald Trump's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is flush with cash after the president signed his so-called Big Beautiful Bill, so it should probably come as no surprise that the agency has decided to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on new trucks to showcase in social media posts. 


	The Department of Homeland Security posted a video Thursday on X featuring music by rapper DaBaby and footage of a Ford Raptor pickup truck and GMC Yukon SUV traveling the streets of Washington, D.C., and parked outside the White House and the U.S. Capitol. The trucks, which have the same color scheme as Trump's private jet, sport ICE's logo and the phrase: “Defend the Homeland.” The words “President Donald J. Trump” appear on the back window of at least one of the vehicles.


	The Homeland Security Department's thread directs users to ICE's job recruiting website, as it works toward hiring 10,000 officers. Another post with images of the trucks declares: “We will have our country back.”

	











	In the past two weeks, Trump's administration spent $384,000 on new Ford Raptors and GMC Yukons for “recruitment purposes,” according to federal procurement data. The administration also spent $182,000 this week on “graphic wrap design and application for law enforcement vehicles.”

	Under the Big Beautiful Bill, Trump's legislation to slash taxes for the rich and health care for the poor, the administration received tens of billions of dollars to hire thousands of new ICE agents. Trump officials are now seeking to recruit agents all over the country, from coast to coast, border to border, to supercharge the president's militarized immigration crackdown.

	











	The decision to parade new ICE trucks around the nation's capital comes as Trump has troops in the streets and is leading a federal takeover of Washington because a group of teenagers allegedly beat up a Trump administration staffer known as “Big Balls.”

	A $560,000 expense on trucks and wraps the administration can use in social media posts looks downright frugal compared to the $200 million that DHS is spending on ads thanking Trump for deporting immigrants. (Those ad buys are being placed by the firm that bought most of the ads for Trump's 2024 campaign.)


	The Trump administration also spent up to $45 million on a military parade through D.C. on the president's birthday.

Kelly Clarkson has cancelled her appearance at a benefit concert in wake of her ex-husband Brandon Blackstock's death. 


	She was due to appear at Miranda Lambert and Parker McCollum's Band Together Texas event, held to support victims of the July Texas floods, on Sunday. The organizers shared the news in an Instagram Story, according to Taste of Country. “Unfortunately, Kelly Clarkson will be unable to appear at Band Together Texas as planned, due to personal circumstances,” the statement read. “We send our love to Kelly and her family.”


	Lambert and McCollum created the benefit, which will feature performances from both musicians alongside Ryan Bingham, Wade Bowen, Ronnie Dunn, Dylan Gossett, Jack Ingram, Cody Johnson, Lyle Lovett, Lukas Nelson, Jon Randall, and the Randy Rogers Band. The concert is set for Aug. 17 at Moody Center in Austin and will also include appearances from Texas natives Matthew McConaughey, Dennis Quaid, and Chris Harrison. 


	Clarkson originally announced her participation in the benefit in July, sharing a poster with her name as one of the headliners on Instagram. Her name has since been removed from the lineup.  

	











	Blackstock, Clarkson's ex-husband and the father of her two children, died of melanoma at age 48 on Aug. 7. Shortly after Blackstock died, the talent manager's family shared a statement announcing his death, but shared few details about his illness. “It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,” Blackstock's family said. “He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family.”

	











	The news of Blackstock's death came just a day after Clarkson postponed several Las Vegas residency shows to be “fully present” with her family and kids while Blackstock dealt with his illness, which had not been made public. “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment,” she wrote on Instagram on Wednesday before he died.

	Blackstock was also the stepson of country singer Reba McEntire, who shared a tribute to him on Instagram, remembering his “legacy and laughter,” and the time they lived together. “His legacy and laughter will be carried on through his family,” she wrote. “Rest in peace cowboy. Happy trails to you til we meet again.”


	Band Together Texas will benefit the Community Foundation of Texas Hill Country and the Central Texas Community Foundation. Tickets are currently on sale and fans outside of Texas can donate via the event's website.

Maroon 5 has teamed up with Lil Wayne for their latest single, “Love Is Like.” The song comes off the band's new LP of the same name, which drops today. 


	The group shared a music video for the track directed by Aerin Moreno and set on the streets of New York City on a sunny day. Lil Wayne offers a verse mid-way through the song, performing from inside a smoke-filled limo. To no one's surprise, frontman Adam Levine manages to be shirtless for at least half of the clip. 


Love Is Like marks Maroon 5's eighth album. The LP features several previously-released tracks, including “Priceless,” their collaboration with Blackpink's Lisa, and single “All Night.” 


	“I feel like we've gone back to what we used to do, which is to not pay attention to where we fit and producing the music organically,” Adam Levine shared in a statement. “This is kind of how we stuck out in the beginning when we first started our career.”

	During a recent appearance on The Tonight Show, Levine reflected on how the band's writing style has changed at different points in their career. “I've kind of gone back to writing and shutting everybody out. But Benny [Blanco] was the first guy that got me to kind of think outside of the band,” he said. Levine and Blanco previously collaborated on songs like “Moves Like Jagger,” “Stereo Hearts,” “Payphone,” and more hits. “He kind of convinced me to write music away from the band. Because I had only kept it in the band before, so we'd never had outside writers on any of that stuff.”

A person driving on the New York State Thruway recently described an unusual object descending towards the ground. The alleged incident happened in late July, preceding the peak of the Perseid meteor shower or the recent launch of the Vulcan rocket out of Cape Canaveral Florida.

New York, particularly the state's Hudson Valley area, has a long history with unexplained flying phenomena and other strange sightings. As stated many times, these observations of so-called UFOs can easily be explained as drones, military planes, communication satellites, or even a meteor burning up in the upper atmosphere, though.

A resident from New York state filed a report with the National Unidentified Flying Object Reporting Center, claiming they witnessed a UFO as they were driving north on the New York Thruway. The sighting happened late in the evening July 28, according to the report.

The report says that the object came within 200 yards of the witnesses' vehicle, and lasted for a duration of about 5 seconds.

The report says that the person and their wife were driving northbound on the Thruway, near the exit in Newburgh. The witness says that it was dark out at the time, when they noticed a ""bright green light descending straight down into the woods on our right"".

The resident says that the object moved downward at around 75 mph towards the ground.

 

The witness says that the object startled their wife, as she reportedly said, “oh my god did you see that?” The report further describes the mystery object as about the size of a car.

NewsNation


Michael Ramsey 

(NewsNation) — That online video showing a “UFO” shooting past a dog on a British mountainside? Don't get too excited, says Luis Elizondo, an authority on “Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena.”

He told “CUOMO” there probably is a relatively simple explanation for the object, which appears to flit by in a split second.

“It could be that this is something very prosaic, or it could be something extraordinary,” Elizondo said Thursday. “Personally, I think it's prosaic.”

The video in question is attributed to Andrew Clifton, who shot the footage Aug. 2 while playing fetch with his Labrador, Dash, in the Malvern Hills of western England. When he later noticed an unusual object in the video, Clifton slowed it down to isolate the image and posted the material online for UFO enthusiasts to discuss.

“I'm not someone who is a super big believer, but I do think we shouldn't assume that there is nothing out there,” Clifton told GloucesterLive.

Elizondo, who worked for the Pentagon researching UFOs, stressed he hasn't done an in-depth analysis of the video. But he suggested the zooming object was caused by a scratch or imperfection in the phone lens. As the camera angled, he said, refraction of light caused the illusion of a soaring object.

“I suspect it's probably something to do with the actual lens of the camera or the cellphone that's being used to record it,” Elizondo said. “I'm not convinced that it's truly anything anomalous. I know I'm going to get beat up bad by social media for saying that. But look, the reality is, we have to do our due diligence.”

Elizondo also addressed comments by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican who leads a task force for the declassification of federal secrets, that UFO whistleblowers are dodging invitations to talk with Congress members in a secure room known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF. 

“They all got SCIF flu,” Luna told podcaster Joe Rogan.

If that was meant as a jab his way, Elizondo said, he has talked in the past with investigators in a SCIF and would again, with adequate time to travel to Washington.

“No one's ghosting her. At least not me,” he said.

Hamtramck's Planet Ant Theatre has been suffering from paranormal activity. Luckily, paranormal investigator Cade Willamons — who experienced visions of the theater — has been there to help but can't do it alone. Now Planet Ant is asking the community to join Willamons in a séance to banish the ghost and free the theater from its hauntings.

That's the set-up of Planet Ant's “Cade Willamons' Real Ghost Adventures,” a returning immersive theater experience that began at the beginning of the month and runs until Aug. 23.

Joey Morse, who has a master's degree in experimental theater from the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama within the University of London, worked on many of the show's technical elements. Described as part haunted house, part escape room and part Choose-Your-Own-Adventure, he said “Ghost Adventures” is unlike anything happening in the theater world right now.

“This show really is something special,” he said. “It's true immersive theater, but it's also a game as well, which is something completely different.”

Created and directed by Mike McGettigan, the experience is based on the real Saint Aubin Street Massacre that happened in 1929, about four miles from Planet Ant.

Benny Evangelista, a cult leader, was discovered dead in his home, his body in a kneeling pose with his head on the floor nearby, surrounded by three post-mortem photos of his son, who had died a few years before. His wife and other children were found in other parts of the home, having suffered similar fates. The murder was never solved.

Adding to the mystery was Evangelista's dark backstory. Before moving to Detroit, Evangelista had worked on the Pennsylvania Railroad and befriended Aurelius Angelino, a man who shared his interest in the occult. Angelino would later go insane and murder his family — also with an axe — and was sent to the asylum — which he later escaped.

“It's just such an insane collection of events that happened, and the fact that it happened so close to where we're at was also just wild,” McGettigan said.

The show begins with an informative video that explains the murders, Willamons' vision and the goal for session. Participants learn that Willamons' discovered relics from the Evangelista murders buried in Planet Ant's basement, which now serve as clues in the game. Participants are then taken to rooms filled with relics and puzzles to gather information that will help them determine who to banish during the séance. While the rooms are similar to an escape room, participants aren't trapped, and the clues serve to provide more information to the story, as opposed to serving as a set of requirements to pass. It concludes with a Victorian-style séance where participants choose which ghost needs to go, resulting in eight possible endings.

Actor Erik Tarcia, who portrays Willamons, said, “Ghost Hunters” is a full sensory experience.

“It just plays with all your emotions,” he said. “(It goes) from being happy and being silly and having fun with the group to all the sudden (being) in a very serious kind of scary moment in the séance… it's kind of like a roller coaster.”

Willamons and his backstory are an equal part of the immersive experience. Based on Zak Bagans, the paranormal investigator from the “Ghost Hunters” documentary and TV series, Willamons is an eccentric, off-kilter showman, who seems to have a mysterious history of his own.

“Every part of this experience is told through his lens, basically, because this is his construction,” McGettigan said. “This whole thing is based on his version of the narrative.”

Tarcia is a big fan of the show and said he took inspiration from Bagans as well as Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack in “The Shining” and his transition into insanity.

“I used a lot of (Bagans), like being very just over the top,” Tarcia said. “I just kind of take it to that next level that he's just so full of himself, but then I also realized that there was more to it.”

In creating the relics, the Planet Ant team researched Evangelista and the murders to incorporate authenticity into the experience, including reading — and now selling — ""The Oldest History of the World Discovered by Occult Science in Detroit, Michigan,"" Evangelista's self-published book supposedly revealing divine truths told to him from God. Among the items found in the show's relic room is a series of hanging papier-mâché figures, recreated from the real wax and papier-mâché “celestial planets” found in Evangelista's altar-like basement, based on the gods of his religion.

When creating the puzzles, Morse said he took inspiration from “Myst,” the adventure video game from the 1990s. He said the puzzles serve to add details to the story so participants can make more informed decisions during the séance. While there are multiple ending options available, not all of them are “winners.”

“If you apply yourself to discovery and play, there's more story that unfolds, depending on how you solve the puzzles or what information you're able to glean,” he said.

McGettigan said participants should prepare to work as a team and consider reading up on the Evangelista murders for the best experience. While much of the show is puzzle-solving, those interested should be prepared for a spookier experience during the séance.

Morse described it as creepy and campy and a great time.

“For anybody that is a fan of games or paranormal stuff, it's definitely going to be right up their alley…,” Morse said. “It sort of takes all those elements and combines them into a really fun little experience.”

Scientists have examined scientific articles and media publications from the last 30 years devoted to the search for extraterrestrial life. They analyzed in which aspects and promises scientists were overly optimistic, and in which journalists distorted everything.

So far, no life has been found beyond Earth, but publications about the prospects for such research continue to appear one after another. And not only in scientific publications, but also in popular media. At the same time, it is difficult to give a simple answer as to whether modern science is really sure of its existence.

Researchers from Leiden University attempted to figure this out. In a study recently published in PLOS One, they took a bunch of studies, press releases, and newspaper articles on the subject from 1996 to 2024 and analyzed what they were overly optimistic about and what they were not.

The total number of articles analyzed was 630. Most of them were in English, although there were also publications in Spanish and Portuguese. In particular, sources included The New York Times (United States), The Guardian (United Kingdom), Folha and Estadão (Brazil), Público (Portugal), and El País (Spain).

Researchers found that most often the distortion concerned the conditions necessary for life to exist outside Earth, i.e., the question of the “key condition.” However, speculation about the results of research and the prospects for detecting life was relatively rare.

The study showed that expectations regarding technology helping to find life beyond Earth are relatively high. They appear in about a third of news articles, a fifth of press releases, and a tenth of scientific articles. The promise of rapid development in astrobiology in the near future was also quite widespread. Approximately one-fifth of press releases and news articles contained such content.

However, there are very few promises to find extraterrestrial life in publications, at least in those that appeared in peer-reviewed journals. There is much more manipulation in newspaper publications. Press releases remained largely neutral except for the part about the research results, which were usually exaggerated.

The study also reveals that expectations for the search for life are more closely linked to the study of exoplanets than to the study of the Solar System, and are much higher than for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

There is indeed a lot of speculation. However, according to the authors of the study, this is not such a bad thing. After all, there is so much unknown in the Universe, and in order to develop new bold theories, we need to move beyond what we see here and now.

*Supernatural* (2005–2020) redefined supernatural television with its gritty monster-of-the-week format evolving into a cosmic battle between heaven, hell, and humanity. Created by **Eric Kripke**, the series followed brothers **Sam (Jared Padalecki)** and **Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles)** as they hunted demons, ghosts, and gods across America in their iconic 1967 Impala (""Baby""). Originally planned for 3–5 seasons, its unexpected 15-year run cemented it as the longest-running American fantasy series, spanning 327 episodes.  



---  



### **I. The Kripke Era: Foundations of a Mythos (Seasons 1–5)**  

*The ""master plan"" that established the show's core themes of family, sacrifice, and free will.*  



- **Season 1: Origins of the Hunt**  

  After their mother's death by the **Yellow-Eyed Demon (Azazel)**, John Winchester (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) raises Sam and Dean as hunters. Sam leaves for Stanford but rejoins Dean after his girlfriend Jessica dies identically to their mother.

Azazel's death frees hundreds of demons from Hell.  



- **Season 3: Racing Against Hell**  

  Dean's deal looms as demons wreak havoc. The brothers clash with thief **Bela Talbot** and ally with the demon **Ruby (Genevieve Cortese)**, who aids their fight against **Lilith**—the demon holding Dean's contract. Dean descends to Hell in the finale.  



- **Season 4: Angels and the Apocalypse**  

  Dean is rescued from Hell by the angel **Castiel (Misha Collins)**. Sam, addicted to demon blood, helps Ruby kill Lilith—unaware this breaks the final **""66 Seal""** to free **Lucifer**. Heaven's plan to trigger the Apocalypse is revealed.  



- **Season 5: Defying Destiny**  

  Sam and Dean are destined vessels for Lucifer and the archangel Michael. With allies like Crowley (Mark Sheppard), they trap both Lucifer and Michael in Hell using the **Four Horsemen's rings**. Dean retires with Lisa, while Sam returns mysteriously.  



*Table: The Kripke Era's Core Arc*  

| **Season** | **Big Bad** | **Key Twist** | **Brother Sacrifice** |  

|------------|-------------|---------------|------------------------|  

| 1 | Azazel | Sam's psychic powers | John trades life for Dean |  

| 2 | Azazel | Dean's soul deal | Dean trades soul for Sam |  

| 3 | Lilith | Dean's descent to Hell | Sam fails to save Dean |  

| 4 | Lilith | Lucifer freed | Sam's demon blood addiction |  

| 5 | Lucifer | Apocalypse thwarted | Sam traps himself with Lucifer |  



---  



### **II. Expanding the Universe: New Threats and Lore (Seasons 6–11)**  

*Post-Kripke seasons that escalated stakes to cosmic levels.*  



- **Season 6: Souls and Soulless Sam**  

  Sam returns soulless, while Castiel allies with **Crowley** to absorb souls from **Purgatory**, becoming a self-proclaimed god. Dean uncovers the Leviathans—ancient monsters locked in Purgatory.  



- **Season 7: Leviathan Invasion**  

  Castiel unleashes the Leviathans, who infiltrate society. The Winchesters destroy their leader **Dick Roman** but are stranded in Purgatory.  



- **Season 8: Trials and Tribulations**  

  Dean escapes Purgatory; Sam abandons hunting. They reunite to close Hell's gates via the **""Trials of Hell,""** discovering the legacy of the **Men of Letters**.  



- **Season 9: Angelic Civil War**  

  Angels fall to Earth after Castiel steals grace. Dean becomes a **Knight of Hell** via the **Mark of Cain**, while Metatron manipulates Heaven.  



- **Season 10: Mark of Cain's Curse**  

  Dean's demonic corruption forces Sam to seek a cure. Removing the Mark unleashes **The Darkness (Amara)**—God's sister.  



- **Season 11: God vs. Darkness**  

  God (Chuck Shurley) returns to battle Amara. Jack's sacrifice reconciles them, restoring reality.  



---  



### **III. The Endgame: Family Legacies and Final Battles (Seasons 12–15)**  

*Converging storylines leading to the Winchesters' ultimate sacrifice.*  



- **Season 12: British Invasion & Mary's Return**  

  Resurrected by Amara, **Mary Winchester** struggles with hunting. The **British Men of Letters** target Sam and Dean, while Lucifer fathers a Nephilim son, **Jack**.  



- **Season 13: Apocalypse World**  

  Jack becomes a Winchester ally. Mary and Lucifer are trapped in an alternate world ruled by **Michael**. Sam and Dean rescue Mary but unleash Michael.  



- **Season 14: Michael's Reign & Jack's Power**

  **Chuck (God)** is revealed as the Winchesters' manipulator. Jack absorbs his power to become the new God. In the series finale, Dean dies in a routine hunt; Sam lives a normal life, reuniting with Dean in Heaven.  



*Table: The Final Arcs' Thematic Shifts*  

| **Season** | **Central Conflict** | **Winchester Growth** |  

|------------|----------------------|------------------------|  

| 12 | Family vs. Institution | Rebuilding trust with Mary |  

| 13 | Multiverse Survival | Mentoring Jack as a son |  

| 14 | Power vs. Humanity | Jack's moral corruption |  

| 15 | Rejecting Destiny | Sam/Dean break God's narrative |  



---  



### **IV. Behind the Scenes: Crafting a Phenomenon**  

- **Creative Evolution**: Kripke's initial ""monster-of-the-week"" vision shifted focus to Sam/Dean's bond after recognizing Padalecki/Ackles' chemistry.  

- **Cultural Touchstones**: The Impala (changed from a Mustang for its imposing aesthetic), fan conventions, and meta-episodes like ""The French Mistake"" became iconic.  

- **Legacy**: Despite criticism of later seasons' repetitiveness, the show maintained a devoted ""SPN Family"" fandom.  



---  



### **V. The Future: Revivals and Returns**  

- **Potential Revival**: Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles have teased a **2025 limited series**, citing a ""five-year break"" post-finale as ideal.  

- **Spin-offs & Comics**: *The Winchesters* (2022) was canceled after one season, but a new **comic series (Oct 2025)** will bridge Seasons 1–2.  

- **Cast Reunions**: Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins will share scenes in *The Boys* Season 5, fueling revival hopes.  



---  

**Carry On, Wayward Sons...**  

*Supernatural* blended horror, humor, and heart across 15 seasons, transforming from a road-trip monster hunt into a saga about defiance, family, and self-determination. With its universe still expanding through comics and potential revivals, the Winchester legacy endures—proving that ""saving people, hunting things"" remains an eternal mission. As Dean would say: ""Driver picks the music. Shotgun shuts his cakehole."" 🚗🎵

How does one come to own a metaphysical store?

Like a lot of psychics and healers, you know stuff, you feel stuff, you have a gift. But somewhere along the way, I was a little stuck, and I was looking for tools to help me manifest and grow this part of myself.

The Berkeley Psychic Institute — I found them by accident, really. And then that was my training. And then from there, I just started reading and doing healings. I knew I wanted a store called Karma Kards in the '90s; it just took me about 30 years to get there.

Speaking of getting here — what brought you from California to Bellingham?

My wife grew up here, and we got together, we got married. We were living in Vancouver, Washington. One day I said: I gotta bring you back. You're just missing your family and friends too much.

We showed up. I [didn't] know anybody here, but it changed how I looked at things and my faith in her; she taught me a lot about faith … Karma Kards is because of two people collaborating and wanting to do something different in the community.

What is your clientele like?

It's mixed. So I have learned, in almost five years now, that my demographic can range from little kids — we have some very serious little shoppers who know their stones, they're in here with their parents, we love kids, we want them to come in — to 70-plus years coming in here.

… It's people who are starting their practices or just found rocks, and now want to get into them, to people who already know and are looking for that one big item, or: What do we have? What do we do? Then I have the tarot and oracle people who want to expand their collections, and they come in here because we do have the biggest selection in town.

How big is that selection, exactly?

Tarot and oracle is probably sitting around 250, close to 300, separate titles.

OK, that's a lot of tarot. What else does Karma Kards offer?

We're expanding on classes. Sam, one of our practitioners, teaches Reiki in-house. She's doing a tarot class in the fall. We have a crafting circle … It's just for community to come together. We provide items; you just pay, bring yourself and let's have a good time.

I teach a basic psychic tools class, and I have a small clairvoyant program where I teach people how to read so they can go out in the world and read professionally.

What kinds of questions do you get most often from customers? 

Which stones are good for, let's say, grief for overcoming a bad relationship, breakup or something like that. They want to know more about the stones; that's probably the most common question.

Is there something you wished folks asked about more often?

We offer a service for people with disabilities, seen or unseen. They can book an appointment with me to come into the store, and have the store to themselves. We help them shop in any way; like maybe don't have any music going, or you sit there and be quiet, and they have the store. I would wish that we could get more people in here to take advantage of that.

We're not asking you to buy anything: We're asking you to get out of the house and enjoy some energy in whatever way we can accommodate you and your disability.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling on him to clarify and retract “dangerously reckless” comments he made during an interview with a racist radio host in which he appeared to entertain the idea of the State Department designating American Muslim institutions as terrorist organizations based on a debunked, Islamophobic conspiracy about the Muslim Brotherhood.

On Aug. 13th, Rubio participated in a telephone interview with Sid Rosenberg, a radio host with a history of making racist remarks comparing Black female athletes to animals.

During the interview, Rosenberg pressed Rubio asked whether the State Department would designate “the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR” as terrorist organizations. He added, “Maybe not CAIR just yet, but certainly the Muslim Brotherhood?” In response, Rubio said, “All of that is in the works,” and noted the legal challenges involved in making such designations.

In a letter to Rubio, CAIR General Counsel & National Litigation Director Lena Masri wrote, in part:

“Your response, whether intentional or not, appeared to raise the possibility that the State Department is trying to find a way to weaponize federal terrorism laws against CAIR and other American Muslim institutions based on a debunked conspiracy theory.

“As you know, CAIR is our nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, as well as a duly registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

“Founded in 1994, CAIR now has 25 affiliated chapters nationwide and over 500 board and staff members across the country. Our mission is to enhance the public's understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice, and empower American Muslims. CAIR has spent 30 years vocally speaking up against all forms of bigotry, including anti-Black racism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism and antisemitism, as well as all forms of unjust violence, including hate crimes, ethnic cleansing, genocide and terrorism.

“CAIR has played a leading role in debunking the arguments of both anti-Muslim extremists and Muslim extremists who attempt to paint Islam as a religion of wanton violence. In fact, CAIR condemned terrorism so often that ISIS once put a target on our national executive director.

“Despite these facts, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian hate groups have spent years falsely and nonsensically smearing CAIR and other American Muslim institutions as foreign agents of ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the Muslim Brotherhood, all somehow at the same time. None of this makes sense because none of it is true.

“The truth is that CAIR is an independent American nonprofit organization that operates in full compliance with federal, state, and local laws. CAIR is not—and has never been—a member, chapter, offshoot, or affiliate of any foreign organization.”

CAIR's letter to Rubio also noted that the conspiracy theory that the Muslim Brotherhood controls American Muslim institutions has been repeatedly debunked by experts, and that both the State Department and the Justice Department under prior administrations have rejected baseless calls to target American Muslim institutions like CAIR.

Masri added:

“The real reason anti-Muslim hate groups and pro-Israel lobby group obsessively target CAIR and other American Muslim institutions is because of our steadfast advocacy for Palestinian rights. To these groups, whose top priority is protecting the Israeli government from criticism, any American Muslims who recognize that Palestinians are human beings worthy of freedom are a threat who must be smeared and silenced.

These hate groups fear that American Muslims will continue to become more civically engaged and politically impactful, leading to the reorientation of American foreign policy in a more just and humane direction.

Although the Trump administration may strongly disagree with CAIR's criticism of the Israeli government, that disagreement is not the basis for public smears, much less legal action.”

CAIR called on Rubio to clarify his remarks and affirm that the State Department will not misuse federal terrorism laws to target American Muslim institutions based on conspiracy theories or their exercise of free speech. CAIR also vowed to carry on its civil rights and advocacy work, including advocating for an end to the genocide in Gaza, regardless of threats and smears from extremist voices.

In this article

Opendoor shares popped about 10% on Friday after CEO Carrie Wheeler said she's resigning from the online real estate company, which has seen a surge in recent interest from retail investors.

Pressure began building on Wheeler, who took over the top job in 2022, after the company's quarterly earnings report earlier this month failed to reassure investors that a turnaround is underway. The stock is up more than sixfold since bottoming out at 51 cents in June, a price that put the company at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq.

""The last weeks of intense outside interest in Opendoor have come at a time when the company needs to stay focused and charging ahead,"" Wheeler wrote in a post on X. ""I believe the best thing I can do for Opendoor now is to accelerate my succession plans that I shared with the Board mid-year and make room for new leadership to take the reins.""

Opendoor's business involves using technology to buy and sell homes, pocketing the gains. In its latest earnings report, Opendoor said it expects to acquire just 1,200 homes in the third quarter, down from 1,757 in the second quarter and 3,504 in the third quarter of 2024. It's also pulling down marketing spending.

Hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, who spearheaded Opendoor's stock jump in July, celebrated the news and told his new band of followers on X, ""Let's start THINKING BIG AGAIN."" Jackson said last month on X that his firm had taken a stake in the company and was betting it would be a ""100-bagger over the next few years.""

Jackson has been a loud voice on X pushing for Wheeler's departure, and was recently joined by Opendoor co-founder and venture capitalist Keith Rabois, who posted on Aug. 13 that ""not a single founder nor executive"" who guided the company to its IPO supports Wheeler as CEO.

Opendoor on Friday named technology chief Shrisha Radhakrishna as ""president and interim leader"" and said a CEO search is underway.

Opendoor went public through a special purpose acquisition company in 2020, riding a SPAC wave supported by low interest rates and Covid-era market euphoria. The soaring inflation and rising interest rates that followed hit all of technology stocks, but had an outsized impact on Opendoor due it its direct exposure to mortgage rates.

The company lost 99% of its value from early 2021 through its trough in June. With Friday's gains, its market cap stands at about $2.5 billion.

In this article

Hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates divested from U.S.-listed Chinese stocks in the second quarter, signaling a clear pullback from the market amid rising geopolitical strains and weakening investor confidence in China's economic prospects.

According to its latest quarterly update to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission — known as 13F — on Wednesday, the fund closed out stakes in several Chinese companies, including major names like Baidu, Alibaba, JD.com, PDD Holdings, Nio, Trip.com Group, and Yum China. Other names include Qifu Technology and Ke Holdings.

The hedge fund also reduced its stake in Apple, but increased its Microsoft and Nvidia holdings.

Longtime China bull Ray Dalio, who founded Bridgewater Associates, had previously defended his investments in China. Last April, Dalio flagged Beijing's conflict with the U.S. and depressed prices among key challenges plaguing China's economy, but noted that the problems were ""manageable by Chinese leaders if they do their jobs well.""

In April this year, the billionaire investor called for a rebalancing in U.S.-China relations, arguing that trade imbalances have hollowed out U.S. manufacturing. He also urged both sides to reach a deal to ""engineer big reductions in these imbalances.""

As of the start of August, Dalio sold his remaining stake in Bridgewater and stepped away from the board, but remains a mentor to the hedge fund's investment team. 

The developments come as the tariff truce between Washington and Beijing was extended by another 90 days on Monday. Without the pause, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were set to go up to 145%, while Chinese duties were set at 125%. The current levy on Chinese imports to the U.S. stands at 30%, while U.S. exports to China will incur a 10% tariff.

Bridgewater did not respond to a request for comment.

Spending pressures are dividing beer drinking habits, further clouding the outlook for brewers already battling declining sales volumes.

Drinkers are increasingly bypassing once-loved core beer brands and instead opting for premium or economy alternatives, Danish brewer Carlsberg said Thursday, as beermakers confront wider pressures on the drinks sector.

""We do see a continued bifurcation in terms of preferences,"" CEO Aarup-Andersen told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

""People look either for the premium brand or the economy brand. So what will get squeezed a little bit in an environment like this is actually the core brands in the middle,"" he added.

Beermakers have been battling several consecutive quarters of declining volume growth, as consumers have pushed back against higher prices and veered toward alternatives.

Carlsberg, the world's third-largest brewer, on Thursday became the latest to report lower second-quarter volume growth. Organic volumes dipped 1.7% over the three-month period, including the recent loss of its San Miguel brand, even as demand for its premium and alcohol-free products grew.

That comes after Budweiser-maker AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, last month posted a worse-than-feared 1.9% year-on-year decline in second-quarter volumes and Heineken's volumes dipped 0.4% over the period.

""The global consumer is having a bit of a spending pause … so the volumes do not flow in the way they did a couple of years ago,"" Aarup-Andersen noted.

AB InBev's CEO Michel Doukeris nevertheless said last month that the company's continued revenue and operating profit growth pointed to the ""resilience of the beer category,"" and Heineken's CEO Dolf van den Brink cited resilience in its geographical footprint.

Beermakers have been somewhat sheltered from recent pressures on the drinks industry, particularly a downturn in spirits consumption and ongoing U.S. tariff headwinds.

Brewers, which typically rely on local production, are under less pressure to relocate their manufacturing stateside — even as they face higher aluminum levies on beer cans.

Still, broader macroeconomic headwinds threaten to hurt drinking habits and wider consumer spending.

Carlsberg's CEO said Thursday that the group's core brands — which include its namesake Danish brew as well as Tuborg and Kronenbourg — are being most hit by ""a consumer that is holding back.""

He said he does not expect those economic headwinds to dissipate this year, but nevertheless noted a willingness among consumers to spend selectively on high-end treat products.

""It's core beer that's going backwards while our growth categories are actually showing growth,"" he said.

Meantime, the CEO added that at-home consumption is gaining more ground as ongoing hikes in the price of a pint are making boozing in bars and restaurants less palatable.

""What we have been seeing over a number of quarters is that the on-trade, so bars and restaurants, are suffering right now,"" he said.

""It's the off-trade — supermarkets and retail — that's winning at the expense of on-trade. It's not dramatic but it's been a sliding scale.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","I tried to find out if the fossil I bought online was real. Then I realized I was asking the wrong question","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/15/science/fossils-sales-online-spinosaurus","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 16:00:00 GMT","


            It stands to reason that a 95 million-year-old tooth shipped to my home would have a rich past. But what ensued after I bought it online for about $100 revealed how, for such relics and those who covet them, the present is in some ways much more complicated.
    


            I always wanted to own a fossil, and once the algorithm picked up on that desire, ads flooded my Instagram feed. It then became impossible to resist the thrill of purchasing a piece of one of the largest predators that ever existed: Spinosaurus, a semiaquatic meat-eater that could reach almost 60 feet (about 18 meters) in length — longer and heavier than Tyrannosaurus rex.
    


            When the package arrived, in a pretty glass dome and with a preprinted certificate of authenticity that stated it came from North Africa, the long pointy tooth looked the part to my untrained eyes: yellowish brown, with varying textures and a stonelike appearance. But some obvious cracks that suggested the specimen had perhaps been patched together from multiple fragments left me wondering: Was it real?
    


Stone tool discovery could offer new clue in mystery of ancient ‘hobbit' humans



            To find out, I took it to London's Natural History Museum, where Susannah Maidment, a senior researcher and fossil expert, examined it.
    


            “Yeah, it's a fossil, for sure,” she said. “It's got a rounded cross section with ridges down the front and back, so it's probably a Spinosaurus tooth.”
    


            To my relief, I hadn't been duped. But it turns out my fossil wasn't as rare as I thought.
    


            “This is almost certainly from Morocco, because almost all Spinosaurus fossils that we know of are from the Kem Kem formation of Morocco, and they're intensively excavated there,” Maidment added, referring to a fossil bed in southeastern Morocco that has yielded an abundance of predatory dinosaur specimens. “The thing about teeth is that dinosaurs and other reptiles shed them continuously, so one dinosaur will have many, many teeth over its lifetime. And so they're very common.”
    


            As a result, according to Maidment, I probably paid too much for it. However, her next observation quickly replaced that concern with another: “This … has almost certainly been illegally exported and illegally excavated,” she said.
    


            “This specimen — you have it illegally.”
    


            Last year, a Stegosaurus skeleton nicknamed “Apex,” measuring nearly 27 feet long (about 8 meters), sold for $44.6 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York City, becoming the most valuable fossil ever sold at auction.
    


Hedge fund manager Ken Griffin reportedly scooped up the specimen, which was discovered in 2022 on private land in Colorado, and it is currently on loan at New York's American Museum of Natural History.
    


            The sale was just one in a series of recent high-profile auctions that sent near-complete dinosaur skeletons into private ownership. But the trend can be traced back to the sale of Sue, one of the most complete and largest T. rex fossils ever found. It was unearthed in 1990 and sold at auction in 1997 for $8.36 million after a long legal battle over its ownership.
    


            Even though Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History purchased Sue and still has it on display, the pooling together of private funds led to its acquisition and kick-started the era of big-ticket fossil auctions. Seventy-one T. rex specimens are now in private hands, versus 61 held by public trusts, according to a recent study.
    


Dinosaur fossil found underneath a Denver museum's parking lot



            Peter Lovisek, a fossil broker and curator at Fossil Realm, a gallery in Ottawa, said a key turning point for the market — “where these pieces began to be seen as cultural icons, artworks, investment assets” — was the auction of a 40-foot-long T. rex named “Stan,” which sold for $31.8 million in 2020.
    


            The media frenzy surrounding Stan, which is part of a planned exhibition at the upcoming Natural History Museum Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, brought fossils into the mainstream, Lovisek added.
    


            “Since then, Instagram has become a hub for the fossil industry,” he said. “A major part of our strategy is to focus on Instagram storytelling, and Instagram is connecting curators, dealers, diggers.”
    


            CNN reached out to Instagram for comment but has not received a response.
    


            You are now spoiled for choice if you want to buy fossils online. Most online shops offer a range of price points starting at a few dollars and going up into the low thousands, whereas Lovisek said he takes a more upmarket approach, from a few thousand dollars to the six-figure range.
    


            And things are just getting started, according to Salomon Aaron, director of David Aaron, a London gallery dealing in ancient art and fossils. “I think the dinosaur trade is actually still incredibly undervalued,” Aaron said. “Relative to the art market, we are very much at the beginning, at the start of the dinosaur fossil trade.”
    


            On the other hand, it's been over 200 years since the first dinosaur fossil was given a name, Megalosaurus, in 1824. Specimens have now been found on every continent, and more than 50 countries have contributed named species to science, with the United States, China, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Mongolia, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom topping the rankings.
    


Puzzling fossils unearthed in China may rewrite the human story



            One enduring misconception, perhaps fueled by the multimillion-dollar auctions, is that fossils are rare. “Across the world, people assume that everything's going to be unmanageably expensive, but that's not the case,” said Matt Dale, who owns Mr Wood's Fossils, a fossil shop in Edinburgh, Scotland, which also sells online. His cheapest dinosaur fossils are priced under 10 pounds (about $13.50), and include bone fragments, teeth and eggshells.
    


            “I get a lot of questions that I hear again and again. One, where do you get all this stuff? Two, is it real? And three, why is it so cheap?” Dale said. “The bulk of the stuff in my shop comes from unusually rich sites, where there's an awful lot of material, which makes it much more practical and feasible to collect it and sell it on a commercial basis. There's an artificial impression of how rare fossils are, and that's just — that's not the case for some things.”
    


            Most fossil shops in the world will have some of these affordable items, Dale said, including ammonites, or shelled mollusks, from Madagascar; fish from Wyoming's Green River Formation; shark teeth from South Carolina and Florida; and trilobites from the Erfoud area in Morocco's northern Kem Kem region — the same place from where my Spinosaurus tooth likely comes.
    


            After telling me that she thought my fossil was illegal, Maidment explained that “the Moroccan fossil law states that you must have a permit for excavation and that you must have a permit for export, and you can only get a permit for export if you have an excavation license. Unless your seller is able to show you both, they have certainly excavated it illegally and exported it illegally.”
    


            The online shop I bought the Spinosaurus tooth from is based in the UK and has a page on its website that asserts its commitment to ethical sourcing of artifacts. The company didn't respond to requests for an interview or comment on the origin of my fossil. Other online retailers offering similar merchandise that I contacted also didn't respond to my interview requests.
    


            However, the shop could have legally purchased the fossils from a third party, or at one of many fossil trade shows such as Arizona's Tucson Gem, Mineral & Fossil Showcase. Held annually in January and February, the Arizona event bills itself as the largest gem and mineral show in the world. CNN reached out to the Tucson Gem, Mineral & Fossil Showcase for comment but has not received a response.
    


            Morocco is not the only country imposing restrictions on fossil exports with the goal of preserving its cultural heritage. Export bans are also in place in Argentina, Brazil, China and Mongolia.
    


            “All around the world, different countries have different laws. In the UK and the US, if you find something on your land, you can do whatever you want with it,” while in some parts of South America, for example, the person who discovers an artifact has a weaker claim, Maidment said.
    


            Brazilian fossils in particular, according to a law established in 1942, don't belong to the finder, noted Taissa Rodrigues, a professor of paleontology at the Federal University of Espirito Santo in Brazil. “It belongs to the country,” Rodrigues said. “That means, if you find a fossil, you're not its owner, so that's why you're not allowed to sell it, because it's not up for you to decide.”
    


            But Morocco seems to fall into a sort of legal gray area when it comes to fossil exports, said Maidment and David Martill, emeritus professor from the UK's University of Portsmouth. Despite laws in place intended to regulate export of these artifacts, almost all fossils excavated in Morocco end up on the commercial market, according to Martill. A small portion fuel the local souvenir market, and the rest go to fossil dealers who sell them to shops and online retailers throughout the world, he said.
    


            “I am very familiar with the fossil black market in Morocco, because I work there, and we have huge problems at our (excavation) sites, where commercial fossil dealers who are black market smugglers come and excavate illegally from our sites, probably from the specimens that we're digging up,” Maidment said, speaking of those who operated without a proper permit. “Sometimes we find the fossils, and then they take them, and then they sell them on European websites for up to 30,000 euros. So it's a huge, huge problem.”
    


            Morocco's Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, which regulates “the fields of geology, minerals, hydrocarbons and energies,” has not responded to CNN's requests for comment.
    


            The full extent of the questionable movement of fossils across borders is hard to pin down, but it has included important specimens such as Ubirajara jubatus, a feathered dinosaur species first described in a now-retracted 2020 paper from a one-of-a-kind skeleton that had allegedly been illegally exported to Germany from Brazil.
    


            Germany's State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe returned the rare remains to Brazil in 2023 among a wave of similar high-profile repatriations, including a 56 million-year-old crocodile fossil that Morocco recovered from the United States. A few years earlier, in 2015, actor Nicolas Cage returned a T. rex skull he bought for $276,000 at auction in 2007 to the Mongolian government.
    


            It's more difficult for smaller, less expensive fossils that have been illegally exported to make it back to their country of origin, although in 2022 French customs returned nearly 1,000 fossils from the Araripe Basin in Brazil that had been stolen  to be sold online.
    


            Neither Martill nor John Nudds, an honorary lecturer in the department of Earth and environmental sciences at the UK's University of Manchester, would go as far as calling my fossil illegal.
    


            “There's a bit of a gray area,” Martill said. “I can't technically go there and dig fossils without the permission of the ministry in Rabat.” But he added that locals “can dig fossils, they can cut fossils, they can polish fossils, and tourists can buy the fossils. And if you go to any fossil fair, you'll find Moroccan fossils for sale, and that will include Spinosaurus teeth.”
    


            Nudds said he knows of at least one reputable wholesaler based outside Morocco that sells “an awful lot” of Spinosaurus teeth exactly like mine. “That's why I'm pretty confident that these are OK to come out of Morocco,” he said.
    


            Part of the reason why fossils may occupy a legal gray area, Nudds added, is some ambiguous wording in UNESCO's 1970 Convention, which was designed to prevent the illegal export of items of cultural importance across many categories. The category that includes fossils is described as “Rare collections and specimens of fauna, flora, minerals and anatomy, and objects of palaeontological interest.”
    


            According to Nudds, the wording makes it unclear whether the objects of paleontological interest are in their own category, which would include all fossils, or if they are part of the “rare collections,” which would not.
    


            But when it comes to my tooth, he said he believes that unless the shop I bought it from has smuggled the item out of Morocco, then it is selling it legally, even if it bought it from a smuggler. “There may be an ethical issue,” Nudds said, “and there may be a moral or even a scientific issue, but not a legal issue.”
    


            Elmahdi Lassale, CEO of M2 Rocks & Minerals, a Moroccan wholesaler and exporter of minerals and fossils that sells directly to retailers in the US, UK and Europe, confirmed that under Moroccan law, since 2020, fossils are classified as geological heritage. Excavating and exporting them isn't strictly off-limits, according to Lassale, but to do so commercially, a license must be obtained from the Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development as well as a validated customs certificate.
    


            In practice, it means that before each export, Lassale sends the ministry a list of the individual items he wants to sell. “Normally we just send the descriptions and the names of the items,” he added, “but sometimes they ask to send a real specimen, to see it in person.”
    


            When I asked if he deals in Spinosaurus teeth, he said he doesn't, because it's unlikely that the ministry would approve their export. “If we talk about dinosaur bones or teeth, it's (almost) impossible to export from Morocco (even) with a license,” Lassale said.
    


            Among the items he gets permission to export are trilobites, ammonites, shark teeth, and Mosasaur and Plesiosaur teeth and vertebrae. However, he said he is aware that other fossils do get out of the country via “illegal suppliers” as well as “through informal shipments via tourist luggage and small couriers, creating a mixed online market of documented and undocumented specimens abroad.”
    


            He estimated the total trade of fossils in Morocco to be worth $30 million to $40 million annually, including official and unofficial exports, and that about 80% of fossils are exported. In a large trade show such as the one in Tucson, he said, there will be on average around 200 Moroccan fossil dealers.
    


            Martill and Nudds viewed my fossil during separate video calls.
    


            “You've got a genuine fossil, but I think it's a repair,” Martill said. “There's a possibility that the tip belongs to a different specimen. You can see some glue — they often find broken examples, and they will just do sympathetic repairs.”
    


            However, the human cost of obtaining even an imperfect specimen can be serious, he said. “Let me tell you now that the man who dug that out of the ground risked not only his life but his lungs as well,” Martill said, adding that he has gone into fossil mines in Morocco and spent time with miners.
    


            The fossil trade in Morocco is the main source of income for more than 50,000 people, including diggers, miners, artisans, middlemen and wholesalers who go on to export the fossils, according to a 2018 study.
    


            Martill said he believed my tooth came from Hassi el Begaa, a village in the Kem Kem region.
    


            “This is a place where the mines go in from the side of the hill,” Martill said. “They go in horizontally, for maybe 50 to 100 meters (164 to 328 feet). They then turn to the left or the right, and that's when you lose any hint of sunlight. You're well underground, and the place is incredibly dusty. The miners are often working without masks. They have little head torches, and they dig with tiny crowbars fashioned out of the steel that you use to reinforce concrete. They're not sophisticated tools.
    


            “They do this all day long and then shovel out all of the sand in a wheelbarrow, tip it down the side of the hill and look for the fossils. They're working extremely hard — they're hand-digging a mine,” Martill added. Taking all that into account, he said, what I paid for my tooth fossil “is probably pretty cheap.”
    


            Lassale agreed the fossil diggers in Morocco often work in challenging conditions, including temperatures as high as 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), and with minimal protective equipment, while earning about 120 to 180 Moroccan dirhams (about $13 to $20) daily. He added that his company only partners with artisans and cooperatives that provide safety measures such as shade tents, water and protective goggles to workers, though he said such practices are not common industrywide.
    


            “It's very easy to make a lot of money with this, but it's not easy to dig out minerals or fossils — small artisans, they put their health at risk” to support their families, Lassale said.
    


            He noted that mines and shafts dug to reach fossil deposits have been known to collapse sometimes, causing fatalities. “Unfortunately, we hear about that every year — not just fossil but also mineral mines,” he said.
    


            Would I be in trouble if my fossil tooth turned out to be illegal? Experts told me I likely wouldn't, even if the specimen had been illegally exported — the responsibility would likely be on the wholesaler.
    


            But things could be different for fossils from  countries that have strong restrictions on fossil exports. That's why experts recommend prospective buyers avoid anything advertised from countries such as Brazil, Argentina, China or Mongolia.
    


            “I guess the best advice would be to only buy something if you can see it and hold it in your hand,” Nudds said. “If you're going to buy online, then maybe avoid those countries which do ban exports, because that's where you're more likely to find forgeries.”
    


            Fakes don't seem to be widespread, but they're more common on the cheaper end of the market, according to Lovisek of the Fossil Realms gallery in Canada. “There's so much scrutiny with the higher end, that the real problem is not forgery, but misrepresentation — claiming there's less restoration than there is, or claiming it's more real bone than there is,” he said.
    


            Other than such deceptions or distortions, when it comes to how to purchase a fossil properly, experts offered guidance that would apply to buying pretty much anything online: Do your research, look for a reputable seller, and ask for paperwork or proof that the item is sold legally and ethically.
    


            Perhaps the more important question is should you buy a fossil at all?
    


            I still look at the Spinosaurus tooth on my bookshelf and marvel that it's the oldest thing in my house by at least 94 million years.
    


            But given the complexities around fossils' cultural status and scientific relevance, the dangerous working conditions in some excavation areas, and the fact that many countries are now recovering fossils exported illegally, it's no surprise that the answer to that question has stirred disagreement, even within my small cohort of paleontologists.
    


The ‘Great Dying' wiped out 90% of life, then came 5 million years of lethal heat. New fossils explain why



            “Do not buy your fossils online,” said Maidment of London's Natural History Museum. “Unless you can absolutely verify that they are being sold legally, and that they're in your country legally, it's best to just not to do it at all. My view of fossils — it's something that belongs to all of us. It's part of our heritage. It shouldn't be something that one person owns.”
    


            Martill has a different view, particularly for smaller, less rare specimens that don't hold as much value for researchers. “There are billions of fossils in the ground. There's no point in them staying in the ground. And scientists like me, there's only so much that you can do with one isolated dinosaur tooth. It's a common fossil; it's scientifically uninteresting,” he said.
    


            “I think it's great that you can have a fossil. You got something there which is 90 to 100 million years old,” Martill added. “There is a possibility that you could buy a tooth and actually own a piece of the fantastic history of the life on Earth.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:telegraph.co.uk/us","Trump and Putin shake hands ahead of high-stakes summit","https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/08/15/trump-meet-putin-ukraine-summit-latest-news/","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 19:08:33 GMT","

Donald Trump has greeted Vladimir Putin with a warm handshake and a smile as the two leaders begin peace negotiations in Alaska.

The US President landed at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage ahead of Putin and posed for photos on the runway.

The leaders walked down their respective red carpets and Mr Trump clapped as the Russian president approached, before greeting him with a handshake.

The two leaders then got into Trump's presidential car, known as The Beast, together and smiled for the cameras.

The pair will hold talks later this evening, which could determine the trajectory of the war in Ukraine.

Mr Trump has warned that he would “walk” if the meeting doesn't go well and that he will not be happy if a ceasefire is not agreed today.

He said of Putin: “He is a smart guy, been doing it for a long time, but so have I... We get along, there's a good respect level on both sides.”

Donald Trump has just departed Air Force One, walking down the boarding stairs onto the tarmac of Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska.

Just a few seconds later, Vladimir Putin also departed from his plane in a co-ordinated move.

The pair walked down their respective red carpets and Mr Trump clapped as the Russian President approached before greeting him with a handshake

They then walked away side-by-side in conversation before departing in the same vehicle.

Vladimir Putin and his entourage have landed in Alaska in the last few moments.

He will be joined by foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and aide Yuri Ushakov at a three-on-three meeting with Donald Trump and his team, according to Reuters.

Shortly before Air Force One hit the tarmac, the White House briefed reporters that Donald Trump would be meeting Vladimir Putin for a three-on-three meeting, rather than the one-on-one engagement the US President had previously floated.

Mr Trump will be joined by Steve Witkoff, his special envoy who has met with Putin five times in recent months, as well as Marco Rubio, the secretary of state.

The decision to avoid one-on-one talks with Putin followed warnings from Mr Trump's former top Russia adviser that doing so risked the president being manipulated by the former KGB operative.

“Putin will lure you in in a moment,” Fiona Hill, who served on Mr Trump's security council during his first term, told The Telegraph. “He likes to do the two guys chatting routine, but what he's really doing is making you complicit in all kinds of things he wants.”

We are now awaiting the appearance of Donald Trump after Air Force One touched down around 10 minutes ago.

The door of the air craft is open, and steps have been placed in front, but the US President is yet to appear.

He is meeting aboard the aircraft with Alaska U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, as well as Gov. Mike Dunleavy, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Vladimir Putin and his delegation are expected to land in the next half hour.

Donald Trump has arrived at Elmendorf Air Force Base ahead of his meeting with Vladimir Putin.

With his arrival came an update on the highly anticipated talks. It will no longer be a one-on-one but a three-on-three meeting.

The US president will be joined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.

In the last few moments, Air Force One, which is carrying the US President, has touched down at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage.

Organisers of the summit have carefully choreographed the meeting point where Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are expected to greet each other.

Behind it, a red carpet is laid out, flanked on either side by a brace of fighter jets. Staff were seen vacuum cleaning the carpet ahead of the historic encounter.

A Russian aircraft has landed in the last few minutes, it is not clear if Putin is on board. Air Force One is yet to arrive.

Both world leaders are expected to disembark their respective jets before walking the red carpet ahead of the summit.

A Russian government plane has landed in Alaska, according to flight tracking system Flightradar24.

It is not clear whether Vladimir Putin was on board, Reuters reported, but the plane departed from Russia's Far Eastern town Magadan, where the Russian president was earlier on Friday.

There is not long to go now until the leaders touch down in Alaska, with Donald Trump expected to meet Vladimir Putin at the steps of the Russian president's air craft upon his arrival at 8pm (BST).

Putin has been using the flight to review materials on Ukraine, bilateral tensions, economic cooperation, and global affairs, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV.

A new report found higher levels of fine particulate matter in areas near cattle and hog farms across the US.

New research out this week underscores what many environmental justice advocates in the U.S. have long argued: Animal feeding operations — another term for factory farming — pollute the air, and these environmental impacts are disproportionately felt by nearby communities, who are often people of color.

The report, published Tuesday and led by researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Michigan, maps cattle and hog farms across the United States at the county level — and finds that these animal feeding operations tend to be sited in communities with higher percentages of Latino residents and uninsured residents. Fine particulate matter — or PM2.5 — levels in census tracts with cattle operations are 28 percent higher than similar census tracts without, according to the report. In census tracts with hog farms, PM2.5 levels were found to be 11 percent higher than those without. 

In their report, the authors caution that the air pollution burden in these areas could lead to more emergency room visits and hospitalizations — which itself poses significant financial problems for residents lacking adequate health insurance coverage. Environmental experts say that lack of governmental oversight into industrial animal agriculture, combined with rising temperatures caused by climate change, put these vulnerable communities at risk of various health problems.

It's the study authors' hope that their data could aid campaigns to better regulate cattle and hog production and lessen their environmental impact, especially at the local level. The study found that roughly a quarter of animal feeding operations, or AFOs, are located in just 30 counties across the U.S. 

“That's a huge spatial concentration,” said Joshua Newell, a professor of environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan and one of the study's authors. Knowing where cattle and hog operations are clustered “allows us to really, if we're concerned about AFOs, develop targeted policies” aimed at the county level, said Newell.

The environmental impacts of livestock production have been well-documented. Not only does raising cattle, for example, require a lot of water, but the animal waste produced by farmed animals can also contaminate nearby waterways. Air pollution on AFOs stems from livestock kicking up dust, as well as how manure is stored; in the case of cattle and hogs, it's open-air lagoons. 

While research has clearly illuminated the connection between animal agriculture and environmental degradation, the federal government has done little to regulate this part of the U.S. food system. Just this week, the Environmental Protection Agency ruled that animal farms do not have to disclose toxic air emissions. 

Still, researchers interested in studying the public health impacts of AFOs — also sometimes called concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs — face hurdles: To start, nationwide data on these facilities is scarce. As part of their research, the study authors pulled state and regional data on AFOs from the EPA. But they found that these sources were incomplete and often outdated, said Newell. 

In order to fill in these gaps, the researchers used EPA data as well as two other existing datasets on animal agriculture. Stitching together the three datasets, they identified AFOs and removed duplicates, and then verified their results with high-resolution satellite imagery from Google Earth. Then, using U.S. Department of Agriculture reports on cattle and hog production, they also zoomed in on other meat-producing regions and added in AFOs that were left out of the initial three datasets. 

With that map in hand, the team compared the dispersal of AFOs across the country to nationwide PM2.5 levels. They also attempted to capture the makeup of communities nearby, looking at the percentage of Latino residents, uninsured residents, and residents without a high school diploma. 

The resulting map is a telling, if incomplete, picture of how the heavily industrialized food system in the U.S. impacts vulnerable communities. The new data has limitations: For example, the team did not include poultry farms in their research. They also did not look into the relationship between AFOs and Latinos — such as whether these residents choose to live close to these facilities in order  to pursue jobs in animal agriculture, or whether these communities were already in place when industry moved in. Newell said he hopes their work will be a jumping off point for additional research that benefits this crucial environmental justice question.

A truly comprehensive, nationwide look at where meat producers operate in the U.S. is hard to come by, said Valerie Baron, a national policy director and senior attorney at the National Resource Defense Council. That's partly because of “a systemic effort by the industry to escape transparency and liability,” she continued.

“These facilities emit massive amounts of really, really noxious stuff,” said Baron. Air pollution on AFOs stems from the way manure is stored; on cattle and hog operations, which produce tremendous amounts of manure, the animal waste is kept in large anaerobic lagoons. These can be as large as football fields, says Baron, and emit ammonia and hydrogen sulfide as the manure decomposes. These compounds in and of themselves are dangerous — exposure to hydrogen sulfide can be fatal and even small amounts of the gas can lead to myriad health problems — but they can also mix together in the air and form PM2.5. 

Academic and crowd-sourced efforts to document the animal agriculture industry's impact on both the environment and the people who work at or live next door to such facilities are useful in building public awareness of the harms of meat production. “It is incredibly important that the public have access to basic information about dangerous facilities, including industrial animal agriculture,” said Baron. But it doesn't automatically translate into action. Data is “cold comfort to someone whose child has asthma or someone who's struggling to breathe living next door to one.”

For Rania Masri, the co-director of the North Carolina Environmental Justice Network, the University of Michigan study felt like something her team could use as part of their advocacy campaigns. But she wasn't surprised by the findings, particularly with the prevalence of hog farms in North Carolina. While national data on AFOs may be hard to come by, research on the impact of hog farming on Black and brown residents in North Carolina is widely available; its roots go back to slavery.

“I would argue, in North Carolina and across the country, we have enough research. We really do,” said Masri. “We have enough research to prove that this is systemic. This is by design. This is targeted in Black and brown communities.”

Of the 10 counties with the highest number of hog farms, four — including the two top — are in North Carolina. “That is quite significant,” said Masri. She sees this as an opportunity for environmental justice advocates to push for specific, county-level solutions that can address community members' needs. 

Baron worries that, as global temperatures rise, the communities already dealing with poor air quality will be hit hard by extreme heat. In a state like California with a lot of animal agriculture, PM2.5 can be a precursor to smog. “The impact of climate change in areas where water is more scarce, plus extreme heat, really put extra stress on the air quality in that area,” said Baron. Workers in these industries may have a harder time dealing with respiratory problems caused by air pollution if they're also dealing with a heat wave, for example. “I'm very concerned about the impact that increased heat will have,” she added.

Newell says that even before this report came out, community organizations and Indigenous groups he was in touch with were eager to see their data. Making it open-source and public was always part of the goal of this research. Whether or not it helps change the power dynamic in the animal agriculture industry is another question. “I think that is powerful, you know,” said Masri. But in North Carolina, “we do have a Republican-majority general assembly. And the agricultural industry has bipartisan clout.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are heading to Alaska for pivotal talks that could unlock a long-sought peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.
    


            A peace deal, or a simple thawing of relations between Moscow and Washington, could also pave the way for what, until recently, seemed fanciful to most American companies – doing business with Russia.
    


            “I noticed (Putin's) bringing a lot of business people from Russia, and that's good,” Trump said aboard Air Force One on Friday. “I like that, because they want to do business, but they're not doing business until we get the war solved.”
    


            Anton Siluanov, Russia's finance minister, and Kirill Dmitriev, a senior economic negotiator and head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, are among those attending the talks with Putin.
    


            “If we make progress, I would discuss (business opportunities), because that's one of the things that they would like; they'd like to get a piece of what I built in terms of the economy,” the US president told reporters.
    


            But restarting business with a country that the West has largely turned into a diplomatic and economic pariah via sanctions will be no easy feat. Here's why:
    


            After Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Western companies left Russia en masse in protest.
    


            Since then, more than 1,000 global companies have either voluntarily exited or curtailed operations in Russia, according to a list compiled by the Yale School of Management.
    


            Household US names like Apple (AAPL), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Mastercard (MA) were among those who left, yet there have been some holdouts continuing to do some business in the country.
    


            The scale of the corporate exodus means there are simply fewer American companies in Russia to generate new business opportunities than before the war.
    


            Meanwhile, Chinese firms including automakers and tech companies have filled the gap left by their Western counterparts. Russians have also turned to copy-cat versions of American brands. For example, Stars Coffee emerged after Starbucks (SBUX) exited in 2022, adopting an audaciously familiar logo of a woman with a star above her head.
    


            So, if Western companies did return en masse, would Russian consumers welcome them?
    


            Western sanctions have focused on hitting Moscow where it hurts: limiting the revenues it can collect from its massive exports of oil and natural gas.
    


            Last year, those revenues accounted for 30% of Russia's federal government budget, according to an analysis by The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.
    


            Oil and gas revenues remain “the single most important source of finance for the state coffers,” wrote Vitaly Yermakov, a senior research fellow at the Institute, in the February report.
    


            The European Union, once a top Kremlin customer, has banned all seaborne imports of Russian crude oil, and whittled Moscow's share of its natural gas imports delivered via pipeline to about 11% last year, from more than 40% in 2021. The bloc still imports Russian liquefied natural gas via sea tankers.
    


            But Russia has adapted, re-routing its barrels of oil to alternate customers, like India and China. According to Vortexa, an energy data firm, Russia now accounts for 36% of India's crude oil imports and is the country's top supplier.
    


            Trump has recently threatened to impose punishing tariffs on countries that continue to buy Moscow's barrels to discourage the trade and force Putin – by economic necessity – to the negotiating table. But New Delhi has been defiant, saying that Russian oil is necessary for the energy security of its 1.4 billion-strong population.
    


            One key sanction – a price cap on Russian oil imposed by the Group of Seven nations in 2022 – may be difficult for America to fully unwind without international support.
    


            The cap is designed to dent Moscow's revenues while still allowing its oil to flow to the global market. Companies located in the G7 are prevented from providing shipping, insurance and other services needed to export Russian seaborne oil unless it is priced below the threshold.
    


            Simply doing business in Russia has become harder since the war.
    


            Crucially, it has become more difficult for Russian banks to send and receive money from abroad. Shortly after the invasion, the United States, the EU, Britain and Canada jointly banned some Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging service — a high-security network connecting thousands of financial institutions around the world.
    


            Janis Kluge, a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told CNN in February that the United States wouldn't be able to re-admit banned banks to the network without cooperation from the EU because SWIFT is based in Belgium.
    


            Corruption has also worsened from already high levels. In 2021, nonprofit organization Transparency International put Russia in 136th place, tied with Liberia, in its ranking of 180 countries and territories for their perceived levels of public sector corruption. (A lower ranking indicates a higher level of corruption.)
    


            But, by 2024, Russia had slid further down the Corruption Perceptions Index to 154th place, tied with Azerbaijan, Honduras and Lebanon.
    


            American businesses contemplating a return to, or reinvestment in, Russia may then ask themselves: Would it be worth it?

US President Donald Trump has personally greeted his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on the tarmac at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. The US military base will be the venue for the high-stakes meeting of the two leaders.

Trump arrived at the base onboard Air Force One shortly before Putin. A large sign reading ‘Alaska 2025' was put on display at the end of the red carpet at the base, while four American fighter jets are positioned on either side of the carpet.

The initial talks will only involve the presidents and their aides, while the full delegations will join later. Trump and Putin will also hold a joint press conference after the negotiations.

The summit could last between six and seven hours, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Although the Ukraine conflict is widely expected to be the summit's central topic, the meeting's agenda will encompass far more than that, according to Moscow.

Other topics the two presidents are slated to discuss include bilateral Russia-US relations, possible joint economic projects, and other regional and international issues, according to Peskov.

In addition to Putin, the Russian delegation includes Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrey Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov, and presidential economic envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who has been a key figure in the Ukraine settlement process.

The US delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Special Envoy to Ukraine and the Middle East Steve Witkoff, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, according to White House Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt.

US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth will also join the summit for an expanded bilateral meeting and lunch, the White House said.

It is Putin's eighth visit to the US and the first one in about a decade. The last time the Russian president was in America was in 2015, when he attended the UN General Assembly in New York and held talks with then-President Barack Obama.

US President Donald Trump has lashed out at the media, accusing outlets of quoting “fired losers” like his former national security adviser John Bolton on the upcoming summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

The two leaders are set to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday. Their talks are expected to focus largely on finding a settlement in the Ukraine conflict.

“Very unfair media is at work on my meeting with Putin,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on Wednesday, accusing outlets of “constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton, who just said that, even though the meeting is on American soil, ‘Putin has already won.'”

“What's that all about? We are winning on EVERYTHING,” he claimed, calling the reports “Fake News.”

Bolton, who was fired from Trump's first administration after 18 months on the job, has argued that inviting Putin to the US handed the Russian leader a win.

“It is a big win for Putin to come to the United States,” as he is currently a “pariah leader,” he claimed in an interview with Firstpost published on Tuesday.

Diplomatic relations between Russia and the US were effectively frozen in 2022 under the administration of Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, as part of its strategy to internationally “isolate” Moscow. Trump has moved to thaw relations and to end the Ukraine conflict.

Moscow will “proceed from the political goodwill” extended by the US and Russian leaders to “resolve issues through dialogue,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on the upcoming summit on Thursday.

Such political goodwill is in short supply, he added. “We will probably never get a sensible response, for example, from the Europeans.”

Russia has repeatedly condemned Western European NATO states' continued military backing of Ukraine, as well as their recent militarization push. The national leaders in Western Europe are “trying to prepare Europe for war – not some hybrid war, but a real war against Russia,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last month.

MAGADAN, August 15. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin on his way to the Russian-American summit in Alaska has stopped in Magadan, where he will visit the Omega-Sea plant, the Presidential sports complex, the Mayak Park social and cultural center, lay flowers at the monument to the heroic pilots, and hold a meeting with the region head Sergey Nosov.

After visiting the Omega-Sea plant, a unique enterprise for processing and refining fish oil, the head of state will go to the cultural and social center of the Mayak Park, which includes a space for exhibitions and temporary museum exhibitions, a conference hall, a cafe, a tourist visitor center and a workshop area.

Another point of visit will be the universal sports and recreation complex Presidential, the largest in the region.

The sports complex includes a multi-purpose gym for playing sports, an ice arena for hockey and figure skating, a 25-meter pool with eight lanes, a pool complex with water slides, a boxing gym, a hall for practicing kyokushin and other martial arts, and a gym for fitness, table tennis and yoga.

After visiting the facilities, the president will lay flowers at the memorial to the heroes of Alsib (Alaska - Siberia highway). It is dedicated to the feat of the pilots of the First Red Banner Air Division and recalls the heroic episode of the Great Patriotic War. The memorial perpetuates the history of cooperation between the USSR and the US, depicting the moment of a handshake of the Soviet and American pilots against the background of a vertically mounted aircraft wing.

The memorial was erected on the day of the 75th anniversary of Victory in 2020 near the terminal building on the 13th kilometer of the Kolyma federal highway. The choice of its location is of particular importance: the old Magadan Airport played a key role in providing the material resources of the Alaska - Siberia air route. The route operated from 1942 to 1945 between Fairbanks in Alaska and Krasnoyarsk and passed through the airfields and runways of the Magadan Region in its capital and the villages of Seimchan and Berelekh. The airway was used to ferry American aircraft supplied to the USSR under lend-lease.

The flights involved a lot of risk. In the difficult conditions of the North, the pilots and technical staff showed courage and heroism.

At the end of the trip, Putin will also meet with Nosov and hold a meeting on the implementation of the Magadan master plan.

Earlier, Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov said that the key topic of the talks between the leaders of Russia and the United States would be the settlement in Ukraine, including taking into account the discussion that was held in the Kremlin on August 6 with the participation of Special US Envoy Steve Witkoff. Broader tasks for ensuring peace and security, as well as current and most pressing international and regional issues will also be touched upon. Putin and US President Donald Trump will also discuss economic cooperation between the two countries.

The meeting will be held in Anchorage, Alaska.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Here's the latest on the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska along with news about Russia's invasion of Ukraine:

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin sat together in a room at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson after their arrival in Alaska. 

Against a backdrop bearing the slogan ""Pursuing Peace,"" the US and Russian presidents sat with members of their respective delegations without taking any questions from reporters or making any statements.

Donald Trump has greeted Vladimir Putin with a handshake on the red carpet in Alaska.

Putin appeared to crack a joke as the two leaders met on the tarmac before briefly posing for photos standing side-by-side.

After not taking any questions from reporters, they left the stage and got into a waiting car together, and could be seen smiling and chatting to each other in the backseat as the vehicle drove off.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said the previously planned one-on-one meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will now be a three-on-three session.

The US president is to be joined by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who arrived in Alaska earlier, is likely to be one of the team alongside Putin.

According to the Kremlin, the meeting will be followed by talks between the full delegations and continue over lunch. The two leaders are expected to hold a joint press conference.

Donald Trump has landed in Alaska for the highly anticipated summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump and Putin are expected to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine and US-Russia ties.

More now from DW's Ines Pohl, who is on the ground in Alaska.

Earlier on Friday, several hundred people had gathered in Anchorage, the state capital, to show their support for Ukraine.

A rally outside Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, where the Trump-Putin summit is being held, however, was much smaller.

Only a handful of protesters turned out to denounce Russia's invasion of its neighbor.

As US and Russian leaders meet to discuss peace in Ukraine, key voices are missing — Ukraine and Europe. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warns that any deal must include Kyiv and begin with a ceasefire. Though Europe's influence is limited, Merz could emerge as a key figure, urging President Trump to protect European and Ukrainian interests.

A Russian government aircraft has landed in Alaska ahead of the talks between the Russian and US presidents, according to flight tracking site Flightradar24.

It was unclear whether Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin was on board. The plane departed from Magadan in Russia's Far East, where the Russian president had been earlier on Friday.

The Kremlin said the summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska is expected to last six to seven hours.

Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state television the meeting will begin with a personal conversation involving advisers, followed by delegation-level talks that could take place over a working lunch. He said the two leaders would later meet privately again before holding a joint press conference.

Putin left for Alaska from Russia's Magadan region in the Far East. Peskov said the Russian leader was expected to arrive on time at 11 a.m. local time (1900 GMT/UTC) in Anchorage, where the meeting will take place at a US military base.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that Moscow was continuing to kill people and showing no intention of ending the war, just hours before the Russian and US presidents meet in Alaska

""There is no order, nor any signals from Moscow that it is preparing to end this war... they are also killing on the day of the negotiations,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address posted on social media.

Separately, in his nightly video address, the Ukrainian leader reiterated his call for a trilateral meeting with himself, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""It is precisely in this format that real solutions are possible,"" Zelenskyy said.
 

DW's Europe correspondent, Rosie Birchard, has the latest from the EU's de facto capital, Brussels, where all eyes are on developments in Alaska.

A Friday night in mid-August is usually the peak of the European Union's sleepy summer political recess. But tonight, officials are glued to their phones, waiting for any clue on whether their bid to influence US President Donald Trump ahead of his talks with Putin has worked. 

European leaders said their virtual meeting with the US president and his Ukrainian counterpart earlier this week went well — and there's no doubt the trans-Atlantic mood music is better now than back in February when President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was booted out the White House, and Europe was left looking powerless.

A European Commission spokesperson told reporters on Thursday their ""understanding"" is that Trump will ""debrief"" Zelenskyy and European leaders following his tete-a-tete with Putin. ""We don't have a timeframe on this,"" she added.

Until then, it's a case of putting on a brave face and watching from afar. You can read all about Europe's hopes and fears in this analysis by my colleague Anchal Vohra.

On his way to the summit with US President Donald Trump in Alaska, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the Magadan region of his country, some 6,000 kilometers (about 3,750 miles) east of Moscow.

According to state media, Putin's scheduled included a visit a fish oil capsule factory and cultural centers in the Russian Far East region's capital, also called Magadan.

The city was a major transit centre for political prisoners during the Stalin era and was the administrative centre of a forced labor gold mining operation. The sparsely populated wider Magadan region, on the Sea of Okhotsk, today relies on mining and fishing.

After his visit, Putin was expected to review materials on Ukraine, bilateral tensions, and economic cooperation on his 3,000-kilometer journey to the summit in Anchorage.

DW's Washington Bureau Chief Ines Pohl is in Alaska ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting. She spoke to Alaskans about their thoughts on the historic summit. 

While Donald Trump is rolling out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin, not everyone is pleased with the visit. 

Several hundred people have expressed their protests by waving yellow and blue flags in support of Ukraine. Their main concern is that Zelenskyy is not participating in the meeting. 

Many of the protesters have voiced their opposition to having an alleged war criminal on American soil. The International Criminal Court in The Hague has issued a warrant for Putin's arrest. 

Conversely, some Alaskans we met at a golf course expressed pride in having the president here, stating that they would prefer him to meet his Russian counterpart on American soil rather than in Russia.

US President Trump is expected to greet Russian President Putin on the plane upon his arrival in Anchorage, Alaska, the Kremlin has said.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Russian state TV that the Russian president was due to arrive at 11:00 am local time (1900 GMT).

The meeting between US President Trump and Russian President Putin in a few hours in Alaska should "" open up a real path toward a just peace and a substantive discussion between leaders in a trilateral format,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

In a Friday post on X, Zelenskyy said he expected an intelligence report on Russia's intentions and preparations for the meeting.

""It is time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia,"" Zelenskyy wrote. ""We are counting on America. We are ready, as always, to work as productively as possible.""","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

Donald Trump has greeted Vladimir Putin with a warm handshake and a smile as the two leaders begin peace negotiations in Alaska.

The US President landed at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage ahead of Putin and posed for photos on the runway.

The leaders walked down their respective red carpets and Mr Trump clapped as the Russian president approached, before greeting him with a handshake.

The two leaders then got into Trump's presidential car, known as The Beast, together and smiled for the cameras.

Mr Trump has warned that he would “walk” if the meeting doesn't go well and that he will not be happy if a ceasefire is not agreed today.

He said of Putin: “He is a smart guy, been doing it for a long time, but so have I... We get along, there's a good respect level on both sides.”

Vladimir Putin wasn't just given the red carpet treatment as he stepped out of his plane in Alaska - capped off by applause and a warm handshake from Donald Trump.

The US Air Force also performed a flyover in honour of the meeting between the two leaders, as the Russian president took his first steps on US soil in a decade.

In the centre of the five aircraft flying in formation was a B-2 stealth bomber - the aircraft that was used to drop “bunker-busting bombs” on Iranian nuclear sites in June in a stunning display of American military might.

The noise of the flyover appeared to drown out the shouted questions from reporters as Mr Trump and Putin posed for cameras together on a stage. The Russian leader could be seen pointing at his ear.

A media briefing between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin descended into chaos as the two leaders were seen for the first time since their joint car ride.

The two leaders, flanked by the American and Russian delegations, stayed largely silent as they found themselves facing a media scrum full of shouting reporters ahead of talks which will take place behind closed doors..

One reporter could be heard shouting: “Mr Putin, will you commit to a ceasefire?” and “Mr Putin, will you commit to not killing any more civilians?”

The Russian president appeared to say something but his voice could not be heard amid the chaos.

Seated alongside Mr Trump was Steve Witkoff, the US' Middle East envoy who has previously negotiated with Putin, and Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state. Both men will join talks with Putin and the Russian delegation.

The press was subsequently ushered out after one minute.

In scenes of absolute chaos, a voice could be heard repeatedly saying “thank you press, thank you press” before another man shouted: “Everybody get out of the room.”

US media was quick to criticise Donald Trump after the US president applauded and shook hands with Vladimir Putin as they met in Alaska.

Contributors on CNN noted the Russian leader is wanted for war crimes and warned the moment would legitimise Putin in the eyes of the world, while proving a propaganda coup for Kremlin media outlets.

Several Russian news agencies noted the warm reception from the US president as the two leaders met at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage ahead of peace negotiations.

“Trump greeted Putin with applause, then the leaders shook hands on the airfield,” Tass reported

Donald Trump has just departed Air Force One, walking down the boarding stairs onto the tarmac of Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska.

Just a few seconds later, Vladimir Putin also departed from his plane in a co-ordinated move.

The pair walked down their respective red carpets and Mr Trump clapped as the Russian President approached before greeting him with a handshake.

They then walked side-by-side in conversation before both entered into Trump's presidential armoured car, known as ‘The Beast', where they sat together in the back seat.

Vladimir Putin and his entourage have landed in Alaska in the last few moments.

He will be joined by foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and aide Yuri Ushakov at a three-on-three meeting with Donald Trump and his team, according to Reuters.

Shortly before Air Force One hit the tarmac, the White House briefed reporters that Donald Trump would be meeting Vladimir Putin for a three-on-three meeting, rather than the one-on-one engagement the US President had previously floated.

Mr Trump will be joined by Steve Witkoff, his special envoy who has met with Putin five times in recent months, as well as Marco Rubio, the secretary of state.

The decision to avoid one-on-one talks with Putin followed warnings from Mr Trump's former top Russia adviser that doing so risked the president being manipulated by the former KGB operative.

“Putin will lure you in in a moment,” Fiona Hill, who served on Mr Trump's security council during his first term, told The Telegraph. “He likes to do the two guys chatting routine, but what he's really doing is making you complicit in all kinds of things he wants.”

Donald Trump faced a public protest on Thursday night ahead of his one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska.

Hundreds of people, including Ukrainians and American veterans, took to the streets of Anchorage, as the city prepares to host what many are calling the talk of the century.

The protesters criticised the president for hosting the Russian president, who has been indicted for war crimes.

Draped in Ukrainian flags and holding aloft signs that labelled the Russian president a war criminal, the crowd demanded Volodymyr Zelensky be included in peace talks.

European leaders fear that Mr Trump and his Russian counterpart could negotiate an end to the three-year conflict over the Ukrainian president's head, who has been sidelined from discussions.

Thomas Janiglo, a Vietnam war veteran, said it was important to “support our allies, people who stand up to aggression”.

“Civilised nations should not reward military aggression,” he told The Telegraph.

These circumstances are particularly concerning given the number of protesters in the streets.

The small Alaskan city, unaccustomed to upticks in visitors, doesn't have enough hotel rooms or rental cars to accommodate the influx of people in town for the meeting.

The University of Alaska said that some of the Russian and US delegates are sleeping in small, student dorm rooms on its campus as well as in ad hoc beds that have been set up at the Alaska Airlines Center.

The impromptu arrangements have also raised concerns about security.

Ryan Buchholdt, the vice-chancellor for administrative services at the university, said the school was working closely with state and federal law agencies to ensure all delegates were safe.

“Our main concern is making sure anyone that is staying on campus, whether they are from the United States or Russia or any other locality is safe,” Mr Buchholdt said.

The protesters have been waiting along the sides of roads as endless lines of black SUV convoys drive through the streets of Anchorage carrying the delegates.

The lax security for the meeting has left delegates free to roam around the US city, including Russian officials that are heavily sanctioned by the US government.Several Sky News correspondents reported bumping into Anton Siluanov, the Russian finance minister who has been sanctioned by the US as well as the UK, Canada and others, at a restaurant in Anchorage eating dinner on Thursday night.

Mr Janiglo, 82, who is also hosting Ukrainian refugees, blasted Vladimir Putin as a “war criminal”.

Wearing a T-shirt and jacket in the blue and yellow colours of Ukraine, Pam Barbeau, 75, said it was “vital” Ukraine was included in any peace negotiations.

“It's Ukraine's country, not ours, not the United States'. President Zelensky should be here from the start,” she said with her dog Charlie in tow.

Charlie, a rescue from northern Alaska, drew a small crowd with his sign: “I can s--- a better president.”

She added that it was possible for “good to come out of the meeting”, adding: “But I don't trust either one of them.”

Under a placard depicting Mr Trump and Putin sitting at dinner and carving up the globe, Maryellen Lambert, 67, said it was important to show solidarity with Ukraine.

“It's horrible having a war criminal and a felon deciding what happens to Ukraine.

“If Putin wants peace in Ukraine all he has to do is stop attacking, so you know he's not genuine. He feels he can manipulate Trump to do anything he wants.

“I pray for peace but I don't think these two are going to be the ones to broker it.”

Mr Trump has insisted he would not make a deal to end the Ukraine war without Mr Zelensky, who has demanded a security guarantee – some kind of commitment that America would be willing to enforce the terms of any peace deal – from the US.

But Mr Trump could give ground to Putin and is expected to arrive at the meeting armed with a series of financial incentives hoped at smoothing the path to a peace deal.

The Telegraph revealed on Thursday that Mr Trump is preparing to offer Putin access to rare earth minerals in occupied Ukraine and lift hard-hitting sanctions on Russian aircraft. Other incentives also include opening up Alaska's natural resources to Moscow.

On Thursday, Adml Sir Tony Radakin, the head of Britain's armed forces, warned that the West must not be cowed by Putin.

Signs calling to “defend democracy” and “stand up for Ukraine” lined Seward Highway, named after US Secretary of State William H Seward – who purchased Alaska from the Russians in 1867 for less than 2 cents per acre.

Others brandished “no kings” banners, referring to the movement against what critics say are the president's monarchical ambitions.

Sporting a red and white vyshyvanka, a traditional Ukrainian garment showing love for the culture and traditions of Ukraine, Oleks Lushchyk, 30 said it was “unnerving” to see Putin in Alaska.

“I don't think the negotiations are in good faith,” he said, adding that it was probably unrealistic to expect Putin's visit to result in peace.

Mr Lushchyk, who emigrated to the US from Ukraine when he was 6, said: “The best situation I could hope for would be to see some form of temporary ceasefire. That would be a really good step towards peace.”

“The State's delay appears to be deliberate, weighing heavily against it,” the judge wrote in his ruling.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

A Georgia judge has dismissed a state domestic terrorism charge against Cop City protestor Jamie Marsicano, but they and dozens of others still face racketeering charges. 

Superior Court Judge Gregory A. Adams ruled that the prosecution's delays violated Marsicano's due process rights and their right to a speedy trial. In March 2023, law enforcement officers arrested close to two dozen protesters, including Marsicano, at a Stop Cop City music festival. The festival was held in Weelaunee Forest, in the area where the City of Atlanta was building the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, known as Cop City, a police training base. 

Marsicano spent more than two weeks in jail and was then released on a $25,000 bond. All of the protesters were charged with domestic terrorism, but, more than two years later, none have been indicted. 

“Since Defendant's bond hearing, there has been no further progression or prosecution of this individual case other than bond modifications made at Defendant's request,” the judge wrote in his ruling. 

The attorney general “appears to have delayed this matter in order to gain tactical advantage over the defense,” Adams wrote.

“The State is solely responsible for the lack of an indictment in this matter, let alone trial,” the judge continued. “Furthermore, as explained above, the State's delay appears to be deliberate, weighing heavily against it.”

The Atlanta Press Collective reports that after Marsicano was charged with domestic terrorism, “they were banned from their law school campus at the University of North Carolina,” and “struggled to find work and housing.” Although Marsicano passed the North Carolina bar in 2025, the state's Board of Law Examiners told them “it would not consider Defendant's eligibility for bar license while this charge is pending,” the judge wrote. 

The judge found that, the “personal and professional consequences that Defendant has faced as result of this indefinite charge, without legal forum in which it may be timely challenged, are forms of actual prejudice to Defendant.”

The construction of Cop City drew protests for years — and a brutal crackdown from authorities, including the 2023 killing of activist Manuel Paez Terán, known as Tortuguita, during a raid on the forest. The Guardian revealed that a planning document for the raid called the protesters “domestic terrorists.” 

Despite overwhelming opposition, construction on the facility was completed and many protesters still face criminal charges. 

“My team's aggressive, participatory, and political defense got us this huge win,” Marsicano said in a statement. “No one is free until all of us are free, so we all need to keep supporting all Cop City defendants, especially the most vulnerable.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            The US military is deploying more than 4,000 Marines and sailors to the waters around Latin America and the Caribbean as part of a ramped-up effort to combat drug cartels, two US defense officials told CNN — a dramatic show of force that will give the president a broad range of military options should he want to target drug cartels.
    


            The deployment of the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit to US Southern Command, which has not been previously reported, is part of a broader repositioning of military assets to the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility that has been underway over the last three weeks, one of the officials said.
    


            A nuclear-powered attack submarine, additional P8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, several destroyers and a guided-missile cruiser are also being allocated to US Southern Command as part of the mission, the officials said.
    


            A third person familiar with the matter said the additional assets are “aimed at addressing threats to US national security from specially designated narco-terrorist organizations in the region.”
    


            On Friday, the US Navy announced the deployment of the USS Iwo Jima, the 22nd MEU, and the two other ships in the Amphibious Ready Group — the USS Fort Lauderdale and the USS San Antonio — but did not say where they were going.
    


            One of the officials emphasized that the military buildup is for now mostly a show of force, aimed more at sending a message than indicative of any intention to conduct precision targeting of cartels. But it also gives US military commanders — and the president — a broad range of options should Trump order military action. The ARG/MEU, for example, also features an aviation combat element.
    


            The deployment of the Marine Expeditionary Unit, however, has raised concerns among some defense officials who worry that the Marines are not trained to conduct drug interdictions and counter drug-trafficking. If that is part of their mission set, they will have to lean heavily on the Coast Guard, officials said.
    


            MEUs have been instrumental in the past in supporting large-scale evacuation operations; a MEU was stationed for months in the eastern Mediterranean, for example, amid tensions between Israel, Hamas and Iran.
    


            A Marine official told CNN that the MEU “stands ready to execute lawful orders and support the combatant commanders in the needs that are requested of them.”
    


            The US military deployed destroyers to the areas around the US-Mexico border in March to support US Northern Command's border security mission and reinforce the US' presence in the western hemisphere. The additional assets being moved now, however, will fall under US Southern Command, and are set to support SOUTHCOM for at least the next several months, one of the officials said.
    


            CNN previously reported that a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth earlier this year stated that the US military's “foremost priority” is to defend the homeland, and instructed the Pentagon to “seal our borders, repel forms of invasion including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, and other criminal activities, and deport illegal aliens in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security.”
    


            The same memo also formally asked Pentagon officials for “credible military options” to ensure unfettered American access to the Panama Canal, CNN reported at the time.

Live Updates


• Summit underway: US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are holding a high-stakes meeting in Anchorage, Alaska. After arriving at a US military base, the two leaders took part in a choreographed red carpet greeting ahead of their talks on Ukraine.
    


• Advisers join meetings: Although they departed together in the US presidential limo, plans for Putin and Trump to meet alone have shifted to include advisers. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff will join Trump, according to the White House.
    


• Trump's stated goal: Trump told reporters earlier today that his goal is to get Putin back to the negotiating table, not broker a deal on behalf of Ukraine. He also stopped short of promising security guarantees for Kyiv as part of a deal to end the war.
    


• Ukraine sidelined: President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is not attending the meeting, emphasized that Ukraine will be “counting on America.” If the summit goes well, Trump has suggested organizing a trilateral meeting with Zelensky.
    


            The summit meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is underway at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska.
    


            Less than an hour ago, the two leaders greeted each other on the red carpet after deplaning their respective presidential aircraft.
    


            The world leaders shook hands, posed for a photo, but did not take questions from reporters. A flyover of American military planes, including fighter jets and what appeared to be a B-2 stealth bomber, roared overhead.
    


            In an unusual move, Putin joined Trump in his presidential limo as they departed the tarmac to their meeting.
    


            Before they landed, the White House said the one-on-one meeting that had been planned between the two leaders will now include advisers to the two men. The Russian officials accompanying Putin are foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN.
    


If you're just now joining in, here's what else you should know so far: 



CNN's Kevin Liptak, Kaitlan Collins, Nick Paton Walsh, Katharina Krebs, Max Saltman and Tori B. Powell contributed to this post.



            If you're just tuning in and missed the moment when US President Donald Trump greeted Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday and the two leaders shook hands, you can watch it below:
    


            The image was striking: a grinning Vladimir Putin, peering out the window of President Donald Trump's armored limo as they passed by a bank of cameras off the tarmac in Alaska.
    


            So far, the body language at Friday's summit has been anything but frosty. As Putin was approaching Trump on the red carpet, the US president gave a couple of claps to welcome him onto US soil for the first time in 10 years. The two shook hands and walked together to Trump's limo.
    


            Later, as they were sitting down for their meeting, both Trump and Putin offered a few smiles, though Trump was mostly stone-faced.
    


            The Russian president is known for conveying his mindset through his posture. Former US presidents have commented on his habit of slouching in his chair as they are speaking, in a sign of his disinterest.
    


            He wasn't slouching in Alaska. Instead, he sat forward in his chair as the meeting got underway, hands clasped, as cameras clicked and reporters shouted unanswered questions.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin did not answer whether he would agree to a ceasefire when journalists shouted questions at him and US President Donald Trump at the airport.
    


            Asked whether he would “stop killing civilians,” Putin appeared to gesture that he couldn't hear the question.
    


            Russian state media highlighted that Russian President Vladimir Putin eschewed his Aurus limousine to ride along with US President Donald Trump in his armored car after they arrived in Alaska for bilateral talks.
    


            Russian state media RIA Novosti reported that Trump invited Putin to join him in his vehicle and the Russian president agreed.
    


            Russia 24 noted that this signaled that discussions between the leaders had already started.
    


            A Russia 24 anchor framed the leaders' early exchange as Trump being “extremely friendly towards Putin.” The outlet also praised the “historic handshake” Trump and Putin had on the tarmac.
    


            When President Donald Trump meets with world leaders, either in the Oval Office or traveling abroad, he usually has plenty to say when the meetings begin.
    


            Friday was different. As the two men sat in their meeting room at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, they sat silently as cameras caught the moment. Neither offered opening remarks.
    


            Trump smiled, and at one point leaned over to say something to his interpreter. The backdrop to the meeting carried a message about its purpose, at least from the US perspective: “Pursuing peace.”
    


            “Can you make a deal with him, sir?” a reporter asked. Trump didn't respond.
    


            After a moment, Trump dismissed the press. “Thank you very much, everybody,” he said. “Thank you.”
    


            US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin's bilateral meeting is now underway.
    


            Before the discussions began at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, the leaders alongside their top officials were shown sitting against a backdrop that said “Alaska 2025” and “Pursuing Peace.”
    


This post was updated with a description of the scene for the bilateral meeting.



            It is a striking and unusual image of two presidential planes next to each other on American soil, much less a US military airbase.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin just disembarked from a highly customized Ilyushin Il-96, the primary aircraft in the Russian presidential fleet.
    


            President Donald Trump's militarized Boeing 747, known as Air Force One when he is on board, arrived some time earlier.
    


            Both are four-engine, wide-body jets, though the Russian aircraft is technically a newer design.
    


            Aircraft spotters and trackers were abuzz Friday as the Russian jet touched down at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson for a rare glimpse of the Russian presidential aircraft.
    


            FlightAware shows Putin's flight operated as “Special Flight Detachment Rossiya 539” from Russia's Magadan Airport. The flight tracking site shows it took about four hours of flying time to get to Alaska.
    


            President Vladimir Putin has joined President Donald Trump in his presidential limo as they depart the tarmac and head to their meeting.
    


            The move is unusual, particularly for an adversary. When Trump wanted North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to join him in his car during their meeting in Singapore in 2018, aides talked him out of it.
    


            But this is a different era for Trump, with different advisers and objectives. And while their actual face-to-face meeting has been expanded to include advisers, it's an indication that Trump and Putin will still have a moment to themselves — even if it's only for a short car ride.
    


            Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was confident when asked by Russian state media whether he expects US sanctions to ease after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska.
    


            “They will definitely be lifted for some, that's for sure,” Lavrov told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.
    


            Ahead of Friday's summit, the US Treasury Department issued a license temporarily suspending some sanctions against Russia through August 20
    


            As US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met on the tarmac in Alaska, a flyover of American military planes passed overhead, including fighter jets and what appeared to be a B-2 stealth bomber.

            They stepped on a red carpet together and posed for a photo, but they did not take questions from reporters.
    


This post has been updated with additional details about the meeting.



            US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are on the tarmac.
    


            Trump landed about 30 minutes ago. Putin arrived just minutes ago.
    


            High-level summits like these are always governed by carefully planned out protocol. And even though today's meeting was hastily arranged in a matter of days, we're still seeing a lot of careful choreography playing out here.
    


            Everything, from the timing of the arrivals to where the planes have parked, would have been negotiated between the two sides.
    


            Neither man wants to be seen waiting for the other. And even though Trump arrived first, he didn't emerge from his plane until Putin was there to meet him.
    


            The red carpet, ordinarily a show of respect, also comes with it a show of American military might, with the four F-22 Raptors lined up alongside it.
    


            At summits like these, no optic or moment is left to chance.
    


            A European official has told CNN it is a “relief” that US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will no longer be meeting one-on-one, but instead with three representatives from each delegation.
    


            It is “probably a reassuring development,” the official said.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff are now expected to join Trump in the meeting, while Putin is expected to be accompanied by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Yury Ushakov, the president's foreign policy aide.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin has landed in Anchorage, Alaska, according to Russian state media.
    


            The change-up in the format of today's bilateral meeting — from a one-on-one to a larger group — may indicate that US President Donald Trump is more comfortable with his aides and Cabinet officials in this term than he was in his first term.
    


                    “It reflects how Trump feels about the people who are around him this time around,” CNN's Kaitlan Collins said. “He feels more comfortable that they are in alignment with his view on the world and on foreign policy, and what he's pursuing here.”
                





            In his first term, “you know, it was Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and (national security adviser) H.R. McMaster, whom he didn't always agree with,” Collins noted.
    


            President Donald Trump is still aboard Air Force One as we await President Vladimir Putin's arrival in Alaska.
    


            As he waits on the plane, he is greeting Alaska Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan as well as the state's governor, Mike Dunleavy, according to the White House.
    


            Trump has a somewhat contentious relationship with Murkowski in particular, who often opposes his priorities in the Senate.
    


            President Donald Trump said the focus of his meeting with President Vladimir Putin will be on settling the Ukraine war over business deals with Russia, but administration officials privately say there is a need to entertain carrots for Putin in order to get the wheels churning on peace for Ukraine, two US officials said.
    


            Carrots for the Russian side could include discussions about new business deals with Russia or a possible strategic arms deal between the two countries — both of with Russian officials have spoken to in recent days.
    


            “There is certainly a willingness to discuss parameters,” said one senior administration official when asked if Trump would entertain a conversation with Putin about a possible arms control deal with Russia.
    


            But details of any potential nuclear deal are unlikely to be discussed at such a high level, the official added.
    


            The administration has worked closely with Europeans leading up to the summit, but there remains an impression among Trump officials that Europe does not understand the need to draw Russia to the table.
    


                    “The Europeans have not thought about carrots for years,” the administration official said.
                





            “It is childish and impractical,” said another US official of Europe's aversion to entertaining any conversation that could be perceived as rewarding Russia for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
    


            The Russian officials accompanying President Vladimir Putin in the talks with the US delegation will be foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN.
    


            Putin and US President Donald Trump were initially set to meet in a one-on-one format. That shifted to a three-on-three format on Friday.

U.S. President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska for a high-stakes summit that could determine not only the trajectory of the war in Ukraine but also the fate of European security.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have begun face-to-face talks in Alaska for a high-stakes summit that could determine the trajectory of the war in Ukraine and the fate of European security.

Trump's allies have cast the U.S. president as a heavyweight negotiator who can find a way to bring the slaughter to a close, something he used to boast he could do quickly. Trump has threatened “very severe consequences” if Putin does not agree to stop the war after the summit. 

For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia's territorial gains, block Kyiv's bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit.

There are significant risks for Trump: By bringing Putin onto U.S. soil, the president is giving Russia's leader the validation he desires after his ostracization following his invasion of Ukraine 3 1/2 years ago. Any success is far from assured, especially as Russia and Ukraine remain far apart in their demands for peace.

What to know about the U.S.-Russia summit:









We're also following:








The Kremlin shared two clips of Putin and Trump smiling and talking before the two world leaders began their sit-down meeting in Alaska, alongside Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov.

Russian media outlets also shared images that appeared to show a bemused Putin raising his eyebrows in response to shouted questions from assembled reporters. At one point, Putin cupped his hands around his mouth and appeared to say something, although his voice could not be heard.

While Trump was meeting privately with his top aides and Putin, his political team sent out a fundraising email that said, “I'm meeting with Putin in Alaska!”

“It's a little chilly,” the fundraising pitch said. “THIS MEETING IS VERY HIGH STAKES for the world.”

It also said, “No one in the world knows how to make deals like me!” and encouraged people to donate, suggesting they start with $10.

It's because the former secretary of state said she'd nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize herself if he negotiates an end to Russia's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to give up territory.

“Well, that was very nice,” Trump said when asked about Clinton's comment during an in-flight interview with Fox News Channel. “I may have to start liking her again.”

Trump and Clinton were presidential rivals in 2016 and have had a contentious relationship. Trump has also been angling to be awarded the prestigious peace prize.

The full Fox News interview is set to air later Friday.

Interviewed by Bret Baier of Fox News Channel aboard Air Force One as he flew to Alaska, Trump said he'd like to walk away from the meeting with a ceasefire.

He also said he'd like a second meeting on Russia's war in Ukraine.

“I wouldn't be thrilled if I didn't get it,” Trump said of a halt to hostilities between the countries. He said everyone tells him he won't get a ceasefire until a second meeting.

“So, we'll see what happens. I'm going to be, I won't be happy if I walk away without some form of a ceasefire,” he said.

The two leaders were seated in a room with their aides in front of a blue backdrop that had the words “Pursuing Peace” printed on it.

Trump and Putin were seated in the middle of the chair arranged in a horseshoe, with a small table between them with drinking glasses and paper.

They didn't take any questions but Trump said, “Thank you” to reporters who were briefly in the room.

The two leaders' motorcade made the short drive to a building on the base where they're expected to meet and hold a news conference later.

Both leaders got into the backseat of Trump's armored presidential limousine, chatting with each other and smiling as they got situated.

Trump and Putin are riding together in the U.S. president's official limousine.

President Donald Trump greeted Russian leader Vladimir Putin at an air base in Alaska on Friday as a squadron of U.S. stealth military planes designed during the Cold War in part for use in a possible conflict with the Soviet Union flew overhead.

As Trump and Putin shook hands at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson outside Anchorage, F-22s and B2 bombers soared above. Neither plane entered active service until after the Cold War had ended but their design and development began during the 1970s and 1980s when the U.S.-Soviet rivalry was at its height.

The presence of the planes during the red carpet welcome afforded to Putin by summit host Trump may have been intended to remind the Russian leader of U.S. military might as the pair head in to talks focused on Russia's war with Ukraine.

Both leaders stood alongside each other, shaking hands again, appearing to exchange words and ignoring shouted questions from reporters on site.

The two men shook hands and smiled warmly as they greeted each other on the tarmac at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

Russian state news agencies Tass and RIA Novosti reported Friday that President Vladimir Putin will use Aurus, a high-end Russian-made limousine, in Alaska. 

The agencies posted footage of a black limousine with Russian license plates and a small Russian flag attached to the hood driving around the tarmac.

Putin brought Aurus on foreign trips before, and even gifted one to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov will join the Russian leader during his “three-on-three” meeting with Trump, Rubio and Witkoff.

Lavrov and Ushakov took part in the first in-person Russia-US talks in February this year.

The Russian president hasn't been to the United States since a 2015 meeting at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.

The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant on war crimes accusations for Putin in 2023. But the U.S. isn't a member of that global body, so officials are under no obligation to arrest him.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed, during a video address on Friday, his hope for a “strong position from the U.S.” ahead of talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.

“Everyone wants an honest end to the war. Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to end the war, and we hope for a strong position from the U.S.,” Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader also stressed that Russia “is still killing people” despite the upcoming negotiations.

“The war continues and it continues precisely because there is no order, nor any signals from Moscow that it is preparing to end this war,” he added.

Trump has yet to leave Air Force One. 

He's meeting aboard the aircraft with Alaska U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, as well as Gov. Mike Dunleavy, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Russian state news agencies RIA Novosti and Tass report that a motorcade with top Russian officials who are part of the delegation has departed to the summit venue.

Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said earlier that those joining the Russian president in Alaska will include himself, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Putin's envoy for investment and economic cooperation Kirill Dmitriev.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters aboard Air Force One that Trump won't be meeting Putin alone, as she had previewed earlier in the week, but instead will be joined the secretary of state and his special envoy.

Leavitt said it would be a three-on-three meeting instead of a one-on-one.

His planned lunch meeting with Putin was to include Rubio and Witkoff, along with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.

Alaska was part of the Russian empire until 1867, but Friday marks the first time a Russian leader has visited the area.

Alaska was colonized by Russia starting from the 18th century until Czar Alexander II sold it to the United States in 1867 for $7.2 million. When it was found to contain vast resources, it was seen by Russians as a naïve deal that generated remorse.

After the USSR's collapse, Alaska was a subject of nostalgia and jokes for Russians. One popular song in the 1990s went: “Don't play the fool, America … give back our dear Alaska land.”

Trump made those comments during a gaggle aboard Air Force One, noting that the Russian delegation includes businesspeople.

Trump also suggested that Russia's latest strikes on Ukraine represent Putin “trying to negotiate,” adding that any consequences for Russia would be “economically severe.”

President Donald Trump arrived in Alaska on Friday for a pivotal summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin that could reshape the war in Ukraine and relations between Moscow and Washington.

Trump was scheduled to meet Russia's president at his plane shortly. A large “Alaska 2025” sign, flanked by four parked fighter jets and red carpets, was placed on the tarmac at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage for the leaders' arrival. Trump and Putin have shared closely watched handshakes before— but the one they are expected to have Friday will be as scrutinized as any, as will any body language or hints about how each is feeling. 

The sit-down gives Trump a chance to prove to the world that he is both a master dealmaker and a global peacemaker. He and his allies have cast him as a heavyweight negotiator who can find a way to bring the slaughter to a close — something he used to boast he could do quickly.

Uniformed military members are now standing alongside the red carpet area, leading to the “Alaska 2025"" sign and platform.

Minutes after Trump's plane landed, Air Force One moved by the scene as final preparations were being made.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin will lay flowers at the tomb of Soviet pilots in Alaska after his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.

An “Alaska 2025"" sign and red carpet are ready on the base tarmac for the leaders' arrival.

The carpeting is lined on either side with fighter jets, parked at an angle,

The stage is set at Alaska's Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson for the planned joint news conference between the two leaders featuring a blue backdrop with the words “Pursuing Peace” throughout, including in large letters at the top.

An American flag and a Russian flag were seen on the stage next to two podiums.

The National Guard now assisting law enforcement in Washington, D.C. are under the direct control of President Donald Trump as delegated through Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the National Guard says.

Trump's authority is delegated through Hegseth and Secretary of the Army Gen. Leland Blanchard, the commanding officer of the D.C. Guard.

The direct coordination of the Guard's operations in Washington is being handled by Col. Larry Doan, the leader of the National Guard's D.C. task force. Doan's responsibilities include working with the Metropolitan Police Department and other federal agencies working on law enforcement in the district.

Unlike the 50 states, Washington is governed by federal laws including Title 32, which gives the president control over the Guard in the District of Columbia without the need to fully federalize Guard units.

The Trump administration can move ahead with firing the vast majority of the employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a panel of judges ruled on Friday. But the decision is being held for seven days while CFPB employees and their legal team file an appeal.

The D.C. Court of Appeals overturned a lower court's decision, which originally ruled that the White House's plan to fire roughly 80% of the CFPB's employees was effectively to “shut down” the CFPB. The court ruled that the employees, who sued in this case, did not have standing to argue the continued existence of the CFPB.

Since President Donald Trump was sworn into office, the CFPB has effectively been inoperable, and its employees have been banned from doing any work with plans to cut the bureau's employment to a skeleton crew of staff. Earlier courts had ruled that the Trump administration was effectively dismantling the agency without seeking Congress's approval for doing so.

Voting in favor of the 2-1 decision was Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both Trump appointees during his first term.

The decision is expected to be appealed to the full D.C. Court of Appeals.

In a snippet from an interview aboard Air Force One with Fox News Channel's Bret Baier posted on X, Trump predicted that his meeting with the Russian president would “work out very well — and if it doesn't, I'm going to head back home real fast.”

“I would walk, yeah,” he added, after a follow up question from Baier.Friday afternoon on social media, Trump posted a video clip from a gaggle also aboard the plane, in which he was asked what would make the summit a success.

“I want to see a ceasefire rapidly. I don't know if it's going to be today but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today,” Trump told reporters, as he stood in an aisle of the plane. “I'm in this to stop the killing.”

Russian media showed the foreign minister arriving in Anchorage on Friday wearing a sweater that appeared to have “CCCP” on it — the Russian initials for the Soviet Union.

Putin once famously called the USSR's 1991 collapse “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,” and critics have regularly accused him of seeking to restore the Russia-dominated Soviet Union. Putin has rejected these accusations, even though Moscow has sought to maintain or increase its influence on some of the former Soviet states.

General Alexus Grynkewich, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe is in Alaska to provide “military advice” to President Trump and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, a senior NATO military official told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Grynkewich, who is the commander of U.S and NATO forces in Europe, is a supporter of Ukraine and views Russia as a clear threat to European security. He has previously spoken of the need to get military aid into Kyiv quickly, including after President Trump said in July that NATO would be coordinating deliveries of U.S weapons. 

Grynkewich's presence in Alaska is likely to be welcomed by European leaders who have spent recent days trying to convince President Trump to be robust with President Putin and not to do a deal over Kyiv's head.

Immigrant advocates in Washington held a call Friday to share information about what people are reporting. 

Edith Hinson, an attorney for the Washington-based Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, said they are advising immigrants to measure risks if they must get behind the wheel or get a ride with a relative or friend who is a U.S. citizen and not to answer any questions as passengers.

“It's very unsettling, very troubling that, now moving forward, MPD is free and able to share information regarding everyone they encounter in a traffic stop with ICE,” Hinson said.

Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said that they are still parsing through the legal aspects of the new policy. Sanai says they have already seen increased police presence in Mount Pleasant, a Salvadoran enclave.

“We are triaging how to advise clients and the community at large. Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police, but now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise,” Sanai said.

Trump has promised a new emphasis on merit with his efforts to keep colleges from considering an applicant's race. But he's been silent on legacy admissions — the policies that give applicants a boost because of family ties.

Trump's complaints about systems he describes as “rigged” overlook this glaring instance in higher education — the edge given to children of alumni — said Richard Kahlenberg, a researcher at the Progressive Policy Institute think tank. 

“It's hard to think of a more flagrant way in which the system is rigged than legacy preferences,” Kahlenberg said.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Friday quoted Kremlin spokesman Peskov as saying that the Putin-Trump talks could take at least 6-7 hours. 

Peskov also said that the two leaders will be accompanied by their aides during their one-on-one meeting, and that Russia hopes for the summit to bring about results. He didn't go into details.

Delegates from around the world adjourned Friday with no immediate plans to resume efforts to reach a major treaty to end the spread of plastic pollution. 

The consequence of this failure leaves no clear path for nations to collectively address the mountains of plastic filling landfills, clogging oceans and showing up in chunks on beaches and other public places.

“Consensus is dead,” said Bjorn Beeler, international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network.

More than 400 million tons of new plastic is produced each year around the planet, and that could grow by about 70% by 2040 without policy changes. 

About 100 countries want to limit production, but the United States and other oil-producing countries opposed any limits on making plastics from fossil fuels.

Police Chief Pamela Smith's statement came in a court filing Friday as the city seeks to block the federal takeover of its police department in court.

Smith said the Trump administration's order installing a federal official as “emergency police chief,” if allowed to stand, would upend command structure and be ‘dangerous' threat to law and order.

Washington's top legal official is seeking an emergency restraining order. District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc.”

“If Donald Trump negotiates an end to Putin's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to cede territory, I'll nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize myself,” the former U.S. secretary of State wrote on X.

Trump has already said he believes a peace deal would likely require the swapping of Ukrainian territories by both sides.

Clinton, Trump's 2016 Democratic opponent, linked to her appearance on the “Raging Moderates” podcast, where she offered Trump some advice: “He is not meeting with a friend. He is meeting with an adversary.”

But Clinton said that if Trump can negotiate a ceasefire, have Russia withdraw from the territory it seized and bring an end to the war without making Ukraine concede territory, she would join the Nobel lobbying.

Trump and his allies have been lobbying for years for him to get the prize.

Putin is scheduled to arrive at 11:00 a.m. local time Friday in Anchorage, where he will be met at the plane by Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV, an excerpt of which was published on reporter Pavel Zarubin's Telegram channel on Friday. 

According to Peskov, during the four-hour flight from Magadan, Putin will review materials on Ukraine, bilateral tensions, economic cooperation, and global affairs.

The president posted on his social media network that he had “a wonderful talk” with the president of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko.

He said their “good” conversation included a discussion of Putin's visit.

Trump said they also spoke about the release of some prisoners earlier this year and the future release of prisoners. He did not offer details.

Trump said Russian drone attacks on civilian areas of Ukraine are a misguided effort to improve Putin's negotiating position.

“Maybe it's a part of the world. Maybe it's just his fabric, his genes, his genetics,” Trump told reporters traveling with him to the Alaska summit. “But he thinks that gives him strength in negotiating. I think it hurts him, but I'll be talking to him about it later.”

Trump also talked on Air Force One about economic benefits for Russia, while warning of more severe sanctions if the talks aren't fruitful.

“I noticed he's bringing a lot of business people from Russia, and that's good,” Trump said. “I like that because they want to do business, but they're not doing business until we get to war settled.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi's directive putting the DEA administrator in charge of D.C. police came after Police Chief Pam Smith updated guidance on arresting immigrants.

Smith had told Metropolitan Police Department officers to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. But she said other MPD policies remain in effect, limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants.

The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies.” Trump is testing the limits of his legal authorities, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to speed the mass deportation of people in the U.S. illegally.

The nation's capital challenged Trump's takeover of its police department in court on Friday after his administration named the DEA administrator as the new “emergency police chief.”

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb accused Trump of going far beyond his legal authority and asked a judge to keep control of the police department in district hands.

“The administration's unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call D.C. home. This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it,” Schwalb said.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration, stepping up its crackdown on policing in the nation's capital, on Thursday named the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration to be Washington's “emergency police commissioner” with all the powers of the police chief — a significant move that increases national control over the city as part of the federal government's law-enforcement takeover.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a directive issued Thursday evening that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume “powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police.” The Metropolitan Police Department “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole” before issuing any orders, Bondi said. It was not immediately clear where the move left Pamela Smith, the city's current police chief, who works for the mayor. 

D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb responded late Thursday that Bondi's directive was “unlawful,” arguing that it could not be followed by the city's police force. “Therefore, members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” Schwalb wrote in a memo to Smith, setting up a potential legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser wrote on social media that “there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.”

Bondi's directive came hours after Smith directed MPD officers to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody — such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies.”

Bondi said she was rescinding that order as well as other MPD policies limiting inquires into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, the attorney general said.

The police takeover is the latest move by President Donald Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the U.S. illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city's homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the administration has portrayed.

The late-night announcement came after an eventful day in the ongoing federal operation. Smith's earlier directive effectively brought together Trump's moves on city law enforcement and his nationwide efforts to curb immigration, and Trump had praised it in the hours before Bondi's announcement. 

“That's a very positive thing, I have heard that just happened,” Trump said of Smith's order. “That's a great step. That's a great step if they're doing that.”

AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports homeless people are on the move in Washington, D.C.

A population already tense from days of ramp-up began seeing more significant shows of force across the city Thursday. National Guard troops watched over some of the world's most renowned landmarks and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where, exactly, was often unclear. 

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha's Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.

For an already wary Washington, Thursday marked a notable — and highly visible — uptick in presence from the previous two days. The visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, was striking to residents going about their lives. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he'll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches.

The response before Thursday had been gradual and, by all appearances, low key. But on Wednesday night, officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.'s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. The White House said 45 arrests were made Wednesday night, with 29 people arrested for living in the country illegally; other arrests included for distribution or possession of drugs, carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a federal officer.

Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump start in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

“They will remain until law and order has been restored in the District as determined by the president, standing as the gatekeepers of our great nation's capital,” Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said. “The National Guard is uniquely qualified for this mission as a community-based force with strong local ties and disciplined training.”

Wilson said the troops won't be armed and declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail or how many Guard members have already been sent out on the streets.

National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics and crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.

The White House said Thursday that Guard members aren't making arrests but are “protecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence.”

Although the current deployment is taking place under unprecedented circumstances, National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. They have regularly been used in the past for crowd control in and around Metro stations.

Trump on Thursday denied that the federal law enforcement officials he sent into Washington's streets to fight crime have been diverted from priority assignments like counterterrorism. Asked if he was concerned about that, Trump said he's using a “very small force” of soldiers and that city police are now allowed to do their job properly amidst his security lockdown.

Meanwhile, about a dozen homeless residents in Washington packed up their belongings with help from volunteers from charitable groups and staffers from some city agencies. Items largely were not forcibly thrown out by law enforcement, but a garbage truck idled nearby.

Several protesters held signs close by, some critical of the Trump administration. Once the residents had left, a construction vehicle from a city agency cleared through the remains of the tents. 

The departures were voluntary, but they came in response to a clear threat from the Trump administration. Advocates expect law enforcement officers to fan out across D.C. in the coming days to forcibly take down any remaining homeless encampments. In Washington Circle, which still contains a few tents, city workers put up signs announcing “general cleanup of this public space” starting at 10 a.m. Monday.

DENVER (AP) — A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked — the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.

The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.

Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including “Frankenstein bunnies,” “demon rabbits” and “zombie rabbits.” But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago. 

The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.

The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.

News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.

Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins. 




But she said that it's not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.

The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don't harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits' immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem discusses I.C.E. recruitment efforts and the Trump administration's deportation policies on 'Hannity.'

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem temporarily relocated her personal residence as she's facing an increase in threats against her and ""vicious doxxing,"" a department spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Friday. 

""Following the media's publishing of the location of Secretary Noem's Washington D.C. apartment, she has faced vicious doxxing on the dark web and a surge in death threats, including from the terrorist organizations, cartels, and criminal gangs that DHS targets. Due to threats and security concerns, she has been forced to temporarily stay in secure military housing,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. ""Secretary Noem continues to pay rent for her Navy Yard residence.

 ""It's a shame that the media chooses sensationalism over the safety of people enforcing America's laws to keep Americans safe,"" McLaughlin added.

Noem said last week that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents ""are now facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them as they risk their lives to arrest the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.""

Taylor Swift breaks the internet on her boyfriend's podcast, and Will Cain still doesn't get how she became this generation's Elvis. Plus, Julian Epstein joins to unpack why Democrats keep leaning left, even as voters pull away from their agenda.

Taylor Swift on Wednesday opened up about how Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, and others, influenced her to eventually date superstar tight end Travis Kelce.

Reid said in 2023 that he was the one who had set the two up and admitted on OutKick that while he had been joking about it at the time, he slyly suggested it was kind of true. Swift talked more about how Reid and others close to Kelce had been in her ear about the potential romance.

""When you guys did the full send on the podcast, and he was like, ‘You wanna date me?' And everybody heard it, it was the ‘shooting your shot heard ‘round the world.' Basically, everyone who likes you (Travis), which is a lot of people, started reaching out to everyone who knows me,"" she said on ""New Heights."" 

""I think it was like Andy was vouching, I think it was my relatives, my cousins, they were like, ‘Please, please, please, he's amazing.' There were friends who were like, ‘He's actually an amazing guy, he's so great.' There was a lot of kind of people whispering in my ear about you. Actually, that's not normal. There are people just willing to go to bat for you. ‘You don't understand this guy's incredible.'""

The romance blossomed from there, but it was the initial relationship between Reid and Swift's father, Scott, that laid the foundation of her future.

Swift grew up in Pennsylvania and a relationship was struck between Reid and Scott Swift when the head coach was at the helm of the Philadelphia Eagles.

JASON KELCE DEFENDS HIMSELF AFTER DEBUTING NEW LOOK IN PODCAST FEATURING TAYLOR SWIFT: 'DON'T HATE ME'

""He's been friends with my dad,"" she said of Reid. ""My dad is the most social man who's ever been born. He's just a maniac. He would make a friend in an airport in 1971, have a five-minute conversation and still be talking to that dude twice a week, now. But he's like that with everyone he meets. He's able to have very many, very meaningful relationships. It's a skill.

""So, he knows Andy, and Andy's been coming to shows for years and stuff like that. So, I've always had a really positive vibe about Andy Reid. I didn't really know what the sports thing he was doing but I knew that was my dad's friend Andy Reid. I now know he's the most iconic, legendary coach of all time.""

Swift had very kind words to say about the longtime head coach and his leadership skills.

Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on the Justice Department's takeover of Washington, D.C.'s police department on 'Special Report.'

The D.C. attorney general on Friday sued the Trump administration over its federal takeover of the D.C. police force and its deployment of national guard troops into the city, arguing that the effort is ""unlawful"" and exceeds Trump's authority as commander in chief. 

The lawsuit, filed Friday by D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, challenges Trump's executive order to temporarily federalize D.C. under Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act, and Attorney General Pam Bondi's more recent order Thursday that seeks to install the DEA head as the emergency commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Force — arguing the moves are unprecedented, ""brazenly unlawful,"" and could ""wreak operational havoc"" on the Metropolitan Police Department.

In the filing, submitted to federal court in D.C., Schwalb urged the court to block both of the administration's orders, stating that the Trump administration's temporary takeover of D.C. police under Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act ""does not authorize this brazen usurpation of the District's authority over its own government.""

""They infringe on the District's right to self-governance and put the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk."" he said. 

SHELTERS, JESUS, AND MISS PAC-MAN: US JUDGE GRILLS DOJ OVER TRANS POLICY IN DIZZYING LINE OF QUESTIONING

Schwalb also asked the court to grant emergency relief in the form of a temporary restraining order, or TRO, that would block Trump's order from taking force immediately while the court considers the merits of the case. 

The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, a Biden appointee, who in turn ordered both parties to appear in court Friday afternoon at 2 p.m. to weigh the emergency request. 

The position is likely to land Reyes, who also presided over a lawsuit involving Trump's ban on transgender service members, back in Trump's crosshairs for the second time in less than eight months.

Reyes issued a preliminary injunction blocking Trump's ban on transgender service members from taking force, prompting Trump allies to label her as an ""activist"" judge, even after the injunction was overturned by a higher court. 

The Justice Department also filed a misconduct complaint against Reyes earlier this year, citing her remarks towards government lawyers. Reyes has something of a reputation for her sharp, fast-paced style of questioning, however, and employed it readily as she grilled lawyers for the plaintiffs as well. The chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Sri Srinivasan, has never taken action on the complaint.

Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing Friday that Trump's order is ""endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers.""

""In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,"" she said in the court filing seeking emergency intervention.

The lawsuit comes five days after Trump issued an executive order to temporarily federalize D.C., which he described as an effort to ""reestablish law order and public safety"" and temporarily federalize the city, which he described Monday as ""one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world.""

That order included deploying hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops into the city, and temporarily taking federal control of D.C.'s police force. 

TRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT

On Thursday, Bondi expanded on that effort by ordering the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, be installed as the ""emergency"" commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Force, sidelining current Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith.

""By declaring a hostile takeover of MPD, the Administration is abusing its limited, temporary authority under the Home Rule Act, infringing on the District's right to self-governance and putting the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk,"" Schwalb said in a statement Friday. 

""The Administration's unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call DC home,"" he added. ""This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it.""

The lawsuit caps a heated week in the nation's capital, as President Donald Trump and White House officials have assailed what they describe as a ""ridiculous"" amount of crime in D.C. 

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told NewsNation in an interview earlier this week that Washington, D.C., ""is more violent than Baghdad."" They have alleged recent data — which found a 26% decline in violent crime between 2023 and 2024 — has been ""manipulated"" or underreported. 

Just hours earlier, the Trump-linked America First Legal Foundation (AFL) filed a FOIA request seeking all crime records and data compiled by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, as part of an effort to scrutinize information and crime statistics at issue.

Meanwhile, critics have excoriated Trump's executive order, which they argue is not based on an uptick in crime or an ""emergency"" — but rather, serves as justification for the administration to push through its sweeping executive action outside the normal policymaking process.

Norm Eisen, the former White House ethics czar under President Barack Obama, told reporters Thursday that Trump's order in D.C. is the latest in a ""pattern of assaults on the rule of law"" in his second term as president.

 Trump ""has declared a fake emergency"" in D.C., Eisen said.  ""There is no ‘emergency' upon which this action with MPD or the federal military is predicated"" in D.C., Eisen said. ""In fact, crime has been dropping in D.C.""

Trump in March signed an executive order, ""Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force,"" designed to address issues with a city he has long derided as ""filthy,"" ""horribly run"" and ""crime-ridden,"" among other things.

In July, my electric bill crossed a number I never thought I'd see: over $500. Yes, it was a brutally hot month, but we've had very hot summers before in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. We've run the air conditioning nonstop before and never reached even $400.

What's going on?

A few things. Let's start with this week's announcement by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore of a $2 million “Residential and Commercial Energy Storage Program.” The idea is to offer rebates to homeowners and businesses that install battery systems, which can store energy and reduce strain on the grid. Moore says, “When we invest in clean energy, we help expand supply.”

That all sounds nice. But here's the problem: Every “investment” like this costs money, our money, and it hasn't lowered a single bill so far. In fact, it's done the opposite. Almost laughable is another planned “solution” to the energy crisis: Maryland utility customers will receive a rebate on their bills next month, estimated at about $40 per household, depending on electricity usage. A second rebate is planned for January. 

On June 1, utility rates across Maryland jumped. Baltimore Gas & Electric, Pepco, Delmarva Power — pick your provider, the story's the same. We were told it's because of supply problems and the need for infrastructure upgrades. The reality? The state continues to remove reliable, always-on energy sources and replace them with more expensive alternatives that can't carry the load on their own. We're importing more energy from other states at higher rates and paying for that gap via higher bills.

The jump we saw in our bills this summer isn't a one-time bump. Maryland is part of a regional power grid called PJM. Recently, the price PJM charges to ensure there's enough power cleared at the maximum allowed rate. Translation: In 2026, we'll see another increase, 1.5% to 5% higher on top of what we're already paying now. And that's just the short term. With the growing demand from massive data centers sucking up power, Reuters reports bills in our region could climb 30% to 60% by 2030.

The Office of People's Counsel, the agency responsible for protecting us, has already warned that bills are “spiraling.” And yet, instead of hitting pause and figuring out how to bring costs down, our leaders keep rolling out shiny new programs with nice-sounding names that won't put a dent in the bill sitting on my kitchen counter.

Let's be honest: A $2 million battery rebate fund in a state with six million residents isn't going to fix anything. It's a press release, not a solution. The handful of people who get the rebates will be happy for a short time, but the rest of us will just keep watching the numbers climb on our monthly statements. 

There's a fundamental question that nobody in the state capital of Annapolis seems willing to answer: Why are we dismantling the existing energy sources before the replacements are ready? It's like selling your car before you've figured out how to get to work on Monday!

ESCALATING CHINA-PHILIPPINES TENSIONS CRYSTALIZED BY CHINA WARSHIP COLLISION

Moore's team keeps promising that if we just pay more now, we'll save later. But for a lot of families, there's no extra room in the budget to pay more now. Later doesn't help when the bill is due today.

Maryland needs a forward-thinking energy plan that starts with affordability. Until that's the priority, these programs aren't helping. They're just distractions from the fact that every month, more and more of us are staring at electric bills that make our eyes pop.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former President Barack Obama on Thursday sought to flip the script on accusations that he backs gerrymandering as he defended Democrats for launching retaliatory redistricting plans responding to Texas Republicans' battle to redraw their state's congressional map.

The Texas GOP attracted fierce backlash from Democrats in the state House when it recently announced an agenda seeking to boost Republicans' majority in the U.S. House by up to five seats through redrawing district lines. Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) was among Republicans who accused Democrats of hypocrisy with their reaction, saying that leaders in the party, among them Obama, have spearheaded their own gerrymandering efforts to benefit the Left. DeSantis has particularly gone after former Attorney General Eric Holder, who launched the Obama-backed National Democratic Redistricting Committee in 2016, seeking to give Democrats an opportunity to create more favorable district maps across 12 states after the 2020 census.

However, Obama this week framed his stance as necessary to prevent “a systematic assault on democracy,” during a roughly 30-minute video call with Texas House Democrats and Holder, now the chairman of the NDRC. Moves by Democrats in California and elsewhere to redraw the congressional maps in favor of the party are a necessary last-ditch effort to “balance out the maps” in response to the “highly irregular” mid-decade “gerrymandering” from Texas Republicans, Obama argued during the Zoom meeting.

The former president contended that while he favors independent commissions or “neutral” approaches to drawing up districts, the actions of Texas Republicans have forced Democrats such as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) into a corner where they are forced to respond with similar plans, an argument echoed by allies such as Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and the California governor.

“We can't let a systematic assault on democracy just happen and stand by, and so because of your actions, because of your courage, what you've seen is California responding, other states looking at what they can do to offset this mid-decade gerrymandering,” Obama said, according to CNN.

“The problem that we've been seeing, not just recently, but this goes back a while, is that the Republicans increasingly recognize their ideas won't sell, so we've got to fix the game a little bit, and by drawing maps that splinter Democratic voting blocs, by packing in Democrats into one district so that they don't have influence in other districts,” Obama added. “My hope is that rather than have a race to the bottom where every district is predetermined based on how it's drawn, that over time, the American people, ideally with the help of the courts, realize that there's a better way.”

Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu thanked Obama for meeting with lawmakers in a post on X.

​​“We are encouraged by your words and remain committed to fighting for democracy, in Texas & across the country,” Wu said.

Gerrymandering is a tactic commonly used by both sides of the aisle to boost margins of political power.

Trump has pushed out career experts and aides who challenged him.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

During Donald Trump's first term, his top advisers attempted to run a traditional process for shaping foreign policy, tapping experts from the White House's National Security Council, debating recommendations from across the government, and steering the president away from decisions that they feared would damage America's interests. But Trump was deeply mistrustful of the NSC, which he saw as too big, too cumbersome, and too attached to Republican orthodoxy.

Back in office, Trump has pushed away the help of career experts, and major decisions—the handling of the war in Gaza, for example, and negotiations over Ukraine—are now made by a tiny core group of loyal advisers, including Vice President J. D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Chief of Staff Susie WiIes, and one or two others. The president “is now fully the quarterback, and he doesn't want too many guys in the huddle,” a former official, who remains in close contact with the White House, told us. “And those that are there need to run the play he calls, no questions asked.”

This time, Trump has a better understanding of the levers of power and greater trust in his own instincts—he doesn't want to be slowed down by contrary viewpoints, according to nearly a dozen current and former White House officials, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to give a candid assessment of sensitive deliberations. Trump is more Trump in his global statecraft.

By shrinking the number of people involved in major decisions and making fealty the indispensable trait in selecting aides, Trump has pushed the system in a more personalized direction. The more centralized setup allows Trump's impulses—his disregard for historic alliances, his love of dealmaking, and his focus on perceived abuses of American largesse—to drive U.S. policy.

But by isolating his decision making, Trump has limited his ability to harness expertise, or to ensure that his decisions are executed by an often unwieldy bureaucracy. And by discarding a process designed to surface different views and analyze moves from all sides, he has increased the risk of unintended consequences.

From the June 2025 Issue: ‘I run the country and the world'

“On the one hand, this arrangement is much more nimble. The president is the decision maker,” said Victoria Coates, who served as deputy national security adviser during Trump's first term and continues to support Trump's foreign-policy moves. “But the downside is you don't have that NSC muscle to bludgeon the interagency into doing what you want.”

The risks of the new approach will be fully on display in Anchorage, Alaska, today, as Trump holds talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, giving an adversary a win without extracting much in return. Trump's first-term advisers would have counseled against the hastily arranged summit.

The consolidated setup has also led to policy whiplash—as was the case with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's on-again, off-again suspension of military aid to Ukraine in July, which confused officials at a moment when Trump was trying to dial up pressure on Moscow. It can also hamper problem-solving and policy innovation. Allied nations often struggle to navigate a system in which even high-ranking officials cannot provide clarity, because a wider array of decisions must be taken to the Oval Office, where Trump remains inscrutable and often erratic.

The White House defended the changes. Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement that the NSC was now “more relevant and consequential than ever before, allowing the administration to execute the President's foreign policy agenda more effectively.” She cited the setbacks dealt to Iran's nuclear capability, the return of U.S. citizens detained overseas, and the peace deals that have included halts to India-Pakistan and Armenia-Azerbaijan hostilities.

Trump returned to the White House in January with a sense of vindication. He and his advisers also brought a scathing assessment of Joe Biden's foreign-policy record, blaming him for the humiliating end to the war in Afghanistan, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and other crises they vowed to put right. And they came armed with lessons about what had gone wrong the first time around, when Trump cycled through four national security advisers.

Trump remained regretful about the departure of the one he trusted most: Michael Flynn, who stepped down less than a month into Trump's first term over his undisclosed ties to Russia. In the years that followed, Trump felt stage-managed by H. R. McMaster and then John Bolton. (He was mostly fine with his final national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, who was more in sync with Trump's preference for a limited role for the NSC.)

From the July 2025 Issue: The talented Mr. Vance

McMaster and Bolton didn't love the experience either. McMaster grew exasperated with what he called the “adhocracy” of disjointed deliberations that yielded rushed executive orders or other chaotic steps. Bolton later wrote that discussions of consequential trade issues, which occurred in weekly gab sessions rather than orderly meetings, “more closely resembled college food fights than careful decision-making.” Throughout, both men enlisted senior administration figures like James Mattis, John Kelly, and Mike Pence to redirect Trump or talk him out of what they saw as particularly counterproductive moves, such as reneging on America's commitment to stand by NATO allies.

But the man Trump chose as national security adviser after his reelection, Representative Michael Waltz of Florida, was an awkward fit from the start. Some of Trump's long-serving aides viewed the former Green Beret, who once was an aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, with suspicion, pegging him as a hard-liner on Russia and Iran and overly beholden to traditional foreign partners.

Waltz continued to adhere to a conventional process—in which NSC staff convene a series of high-level discussions with officials from across government agencies to tee up policy options for the president—but struggled to navigate the West Wing's deep mistrust of his staff. At certain points, turf wars flared with the West Wing over foreign-leader visits and who would control the president's schedule and time. By May, even senior subject-matter experts were sometimes left out of the loop on visits by senior officials from regions within their portfolios, one former official said.

This former official said that Waltz's subordinates had doubts from the beginning about the weight his determinations carried with the president. “You'd coordinate the interagency; you'd come to a consensus; the national security adviser would make a decision,” he said. And then nothing further would be heard; NSC staff would have no idea if their policy advice was being adopted or even read in the West Wing. “It needed to be tabled until you could get a decision or opinion from the president.”

In early April, the administration abruptly fired half a dozen NSC officials after Laura Loomer, the far-right activist, accused them of not being supportive enough of the president's agenda. Some of those dismissed included staffers close to Waltz, illustrating his inability to shield them.

Waltz's departure may have been inevitable, but it was hastened when the national security adviser accidentally added The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a text chat on Signal in which Waltz and other officials shared sensitive plans for bombing Yemen on March 15.

The security breach and Waltz's response—he claimed on Fox News that Goldberg's number had somehow been “sucked” onto his phone—provided further ammunition for his West Wing rivals. By early May, Waltz was gone, nominated to represent the administration at the United Nations. (Waltz, who gave up his congressional seat to serve in the White House, has not yet been confirmed. He did not respond to a request for comment.)

Rubio, meanwhile, got an additional job. To the surprise of those who expected friction between Trump and his 2016 Republican-primary rival, whom the president once derided as “Little Marco,” Rubio's style as interim national security adviser has gained purchase with the president and those around him.

White House officials defended using the secretary of state in this role, saying it made for quicker decisions and better operational security, pointing to Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in June. One White House official told us that the dual position is Rubio's as long as he wants it. “He knows his subject matter better than just about anybody in the government,” the official said.

Tommy Pigott, a spokesperson for the State Department, said that Rubio and the department back Trump's “America First” agenda and are “proud to support him as he leads our country in a golden era of American diplomacy.”

Rubio has likened the NSA role to the conductor of an orchestra of Cabinet members. “The president picks the music; the instruments play off the same sheet; and it's the job of the conductor to make sure everyone's playing—that every instrument's playing correctly and playing together,” he said last week.

Rubio quickly restructured the NSC, which had grown to more than 300 people in recent years. By late May, 100 staffers had been dismissed and numerous NSC offices had been closed or consolidated. Vance's aide Andy Baker and Wiles's aide Robert Gabriel, both of whom were named deputy national security advisers in May, are now key figures in managing the smaller, more streamlined NSC.

In addition to the core decision team of Trump, Vance, Rubio, and Wiles, Stephen Miller plays a key role on issues related to homeland security. On decisions involving Russia and Israel, envoy Steve Witkoff is included. And on military matters, the president pulls in Hegseth and General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

One of the former officials said that Trump would have likely retained a more robust NSC and a less centralized setup if Waltz had survived. He said that Waltz's departure allowed for the sort of restructuring long sought by some of Trump's West Wing advisers, for whom the shadow of the 2019 impeachment and the potential for “deep state” figures—like Alexander Vindman, the Ukraine expert and Army officer who testified against Trump—to constrain the president continued to loom large.

“It was an opportunity that they seized,” the former official said. “‘Let's do it, and go after the ghost of Vindman.'”

Trump's new setup is a stark contrast to Barack Obama's “team of rivals,” which encouraged debate and sometimes sparring between different agencies as the chief executive sought to tease out the best approach. While that kind of debate could sometimes lead to never-ending interagency discussion, as many of his advisers later complained, it had the advantage of enabling a more exhaustive analysis of policy pros and cons. That sort of process might have helped Trump avoid some of the legal challenges his administration has faced to its rapid-fire executive orders and its rushed efforts to dismantle federal agencies, and helped minimize the commercial disruption that has resulted from his tariff pronouncements.

Mark Montgomery, a retired Navy rear admiral and former NSC official now at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told us the centralized setup discourages contrarian viewpoints. “And you're not going to surface any problems until they really surface,” he said.

Nick Miroff and Jonathan Lemire: Stephen Miller has a plan

Another former official noted that as Trump sought to intensify competition with China during his first term, a more diffuse system and more empowered agencies allowed a host of military, commercial, and diplomatic initiatives to bubble up.

“None of that is happening” now, the former official said. “This time, the principle is that the only things that are done are things specifically directed by the president.”

Some current and former officials fear the setup may also mean inadequate vetting of questionable ideas, such as Trump's announcement earlier this month that he had repositioned two nuclear submarines in response to bellicose remarks by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a Putin ally. It caught many in the Pentagon by surprise; neither the White House nor the military typically publicly discusses submarine movements. Even after the fact, some Pentagon officials said they weren't sure whether the submarines had already been scheduled to move or not.

To achieve strategic deterrence, the Navy's ballistic-missile fleet relies on stealth. “That's the whole fucking point of submarines. You don't know where they are,” one defense official explained.

The chatbots are lying about me.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

John Scalzi is a voluble man. He is the author of several New York Times best sellers and has been nominated for nearly every major award that the science-fiction industry has to offer—some of which he's won multiple times. Over the course of his career, he has written millions of words, filling dozens of books and 27 years' worth of posts on his personal blog. All of this is to say that if one wants to cite Scalzi, there is no shortage of material. But this month, the author noticed something odd: He was being quoted as saying things he'd never said.

“The universe is a joke,” reads a meme featuring his face. “A bad one.” The lines are credited to Scalzi and were posted, atop different pictures of him, to two Facebook communities boasting almost 1 million collective members. But Scalzi never wrote or said those words. He also never posed for the pictures that appeared with them online. The quote and the images that accompanied them were all “pretty clearly” AI generated, Scalzi wrote on his blog. “The whole vibe was off,” Scalzi told me. Although the material bore a superficial similarity to something he might have said—“it's talking about the universe, it's vaguely philosophical, I'm a science-fiction writer”—it was not something he agreed with. “I know what I sound like; I live with me all the time,” he noted.

Bogus quotations on the internet are not new, but AI chatbots and their hallucinations have multiplied the problem at scale, misleading many more people, and misrepresenting the beliefs not just of big names such as Albert Einstein but also of lesser known individuals. In fact, Scalzi's experience caught my eye because a similar thing had happened to me. In June, a blog post appeared on the Times of Israel website, written by a self-described “tech bro” working in the online public-relations industry. Just about anyone can start a blog at the Times of Israel—the publication generally does not edit or commission the contents—which is probably why no one noticed that this post featured a fake quote, sourced to me and The Atlantic. “There's nothing inherently nefarious about advocating for your people's survival,” it read. “The problem isn't that Israel makes its case. It's that so many don't want it made.”

As with Scalzi, the words attributed to me were ostensibly adjacent to my area of expertise. I've covered the Middle East for more than a decade, including countless controversies involving Israel, most recently the corrupt political bargain driving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's actions in Gaza. But like Scalzi, I'd never said, and never would say, something so mawkish about the subject. I wrote to the Times of Israel, and an editor promptly apologized and took the article down. (Miriam Herschlag, the opinion and blogs editor at the paper, later told me that its blogging platform “does not have an explicit policy on AI-generated content.”)

Getting the post removed solved my immediate problem. But I realized that if this sort of thing was happening to me—a little-known literary figure in the grand scheme of things—it was undoubtedly happening to many more people. And though professional writers such as Scalzi and myself have platforms and connections to correct falsehoods attributed to us, most people are not so lucky. Last May, my colleagues Damon Beres and Charlie Warzel reported on “Heat Index,” a magazine-style summer guide that was distributed by the Chicago Sun-Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer. The insert included a reading list with fake books attributed to real authors, and quoted one Mark Ellison, a nature guide, not a professional writer, who never said the words credited to him. When contacted, the author of “Heat Index” admitted to using ChatGPT to generate the material. Had The Atlantic never investigated, there likely would have been no one to speak up for Ellison.

The negative consequences of this content go well beyond the individuals misquoted. Today, chatbots have replaced Google and other search engines as many people's primary source of online information. Everyday users are employing these tools to inform important life decisions and to make sense of politics, history, and the world around them. And they are being deceived by fabricated content that can leave them worse off than when they started.

This phenomenon is obviously bad for readers, but it's also bad for writers, Gabriel Yoran told me. A German entrepreneur and author, Yoran recently published a book about the degradation of modern consumer technology called The Junkification of the World. Ironically, he soon became an object lesson in a different technological failure. Yoran's book made the Der Spiegel best-seller list, and many people began reviewing and quoting it—and also, Yoran soon noticed, misquoting it.

An influencer's review on XING, the German equivalent of LinkedIn, included a passage that Yoran never wrote. “There's quotes from the book that are mine, and then there is at least one quote that is not in the book,” he recalled. “It could have been. It's kind of on brand. The tone of voice is fitting. But it's not in the book.” After this and other instances in which he received error-ridden AI-generated feedback on his work, Yoran told me that he “felt betrayed in a way.” He worries that in the long run, the use of AI in this manner will degrade the quality of writing by demotivating those who produce it. If material is just going to be fed into a machine that will then regurgitate a sloppy summary, “why weigh every word and think about every comma?”

Like other online innovations such as social media, large language models do not so much create problems as supercharge preexisting ones. The internet has long been awash with fake quotations attributed to prominent personalities. As Abraham Lincoln once said, “You can't trust every witticism superimposed over the image of a famous person on the internet.” But the advent of AI interfaces churning out millions of replies to hundreds of millions of people—ChatGPT and Google's Gemini have more than 1 billion active users combined—has turned what was once a manageable chronic condition into an acute infection that is metastasizing beyond all containment.

Read: The entire internet is reverting to beta

The process by which this happens is simple. Many people do not know when LLMs are lying to them, which is unsurprising given that the chatbots are very convincing fabulists, serving up slop with unflappable confidence to their unsuspecting audience. That compromised content is then pumped at scale by real people into their own online interactions. The result: Meretricious material from chatbots is polluting our public discourse with Potemkin pontification, derailing debates with made-up appeals to authority and precedent, and in some cases, defaming living people by attributing things to them that they never said and do not agree with.

More and more people are having the eerie experience of knowing that they have been manipulated or misled, but not being sure by whom. As with many aspects of our digital lives, responsibility is too diffuse for accountability. AI companies can chide users for trusting the outputs they receive; users can blame the companies for providing a service—and charging for it—that regularly lies. And because LLMs are rarely credited for the writing that they help produce, victims of chatbot calumny struggle to pinpoint which model did the deed after the fact.

You don't have to be a science-fiction writer to game out the ill effects of this progression, but it doesn't hurt. “It is going to become harder and harder for us to understand what things are genuine and what things are not,” Scalzi told me. “All that AI does is make this machinery of artifice so much more automated,” especially because the temptation for many people is “to find something online that you agree with and immediately share it with your entire Facebook crowd” without checking to see if it's authentic. In this way, Scalzi said, everyday people uncritically using chatbots risk becoming a “willing route of misinformation.”

The good news is that some AI executives are beginning to take the problems with their products seriously. “I think that if a company is claiming that their model can do something,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Congress in May 2023, “and it can't, or if they're claiming it's safe and it's not, I think they should be liable for that.” The bad news is that Altman never actually said this. Google's Gemini just told me that he did.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The horror film Weapons grants viewers some relief—but with a catch.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

This article contains spoilers for the movie Weapons.

The most daring aspect of Weapons is that it answers all of its big questions. The sleeper-hit horror film, written and directed by Zach Cregger, has a distressing but undeniably hooky premise: One night, at 2:17 a.m., all but one student in the same third-grade class got up out of their beds and ran out of their suburban homes with their arms outstretched, vanishing into the night. Where did they go? Why did they run away? The story hinges on an intriguing mystery, but often, opening the mystery box can backfire.

Yet by eventually laying out the reasons behind the kids' disappearance—and thus making sense of the tragedy—Cregger is doing two things: First, he's doing his job as the maker of entertainment, creating a dynamite ending that offers real closure. Second, he's underlining the fallacy of catharsis. Weapons is a movie about a local misfortune that then reveals the enigmatic villain behind it and delights in her comeuppance. Yet it also reminds the viewer that vanquishing evil doesn't undo the terrors it has already wrought—and that there's only so much relief a conclusion can actually bring.

Cregger, who was a founding member of the comedy troupe the Whitest Kids U'Know, has said that he began writing Weapons after the tragic accidental death of his close friend and former collaborator Trevor Moore. While the incidents at the core of the film are mythic and supernatural, they also feel utterly senseless; much of Weapons follows the characters trying, and failing, to understand the bizarre thing that's happened to them. Archer (played by Josh Brolin) is the father of one of the missing children; Justine (Julia Garner) is the teacher who doesn't know where her students went; and Alex (Cary Christopher) is the missing children's one remaining classmate, whose continued presence is as curious to everyone as the vanishing of his peers.

Read: Nothing is scarier than an unmarried woman

Each of their isolated stories, including those of a few other, more tenuously connected townspeople, functions as a chapter in a larger tale. Cregger is chronicling a community, albeit a dispersed one: People seem to barely know one another, and the town's institutions, such as law enforcement and the school administration, have responded ineffectually at best. The central conceit of the kids' disappearance is horrifyingly contemporary—their flight into the night is captured by Ring cameras—but in a neighborhood of identical-looking houses, it's also troublingly plausible that nobody can figure out where they went.

Eventually, Archer and Justine start to make some progress in their respective searches for the kids, nudged forward by weird dreams and their desire for answers. Yet the person to finally stumble upon the children is an unhoused, drug-addicted man named James (Austin Abrams), who finds them standing zombified in a basement while he's trying to burglarize what he thinks is an empty home. Cregger thus stages the movie's most pivotal moment from the perspective of the community's least emotionally invested member. The unconventional choice hints at the director's disinterest in a tidy search-and-rescue, and the relief that comes with it. Instead, like Paul Thomas Anderson's multicharacter opus Magnolia—which Cregger has cited as inspiration—Weapons is rooted in diffusion, tracking lost souls struggling to connect; the action only really begins when they start talking to one another.

After a barrage of freaky, teasing scares, and a lot of ominous attention directed at Alex's house, where something evil is clearly going on, Weapons gambles on providing solutions. The film recounts what happened from Alex's point of view. It reveals that his parents have been possessed by his peculiar great-aunt Gladys (Amy Madigan), a dying witch who has set up camp in Alex's house to drain the life of those around her. When the souls of Alex's parents prove not to be enough, she enlists the boy to help her bewitch his classmates too, luring them into the house; Alex obliges only when Gladys threatens to kill his parents if he doesn't help her.

Madigan is the big reason the final-act revelation works. Chalking up all this madness to one person's doing might be hard to buy, but her performance is astonishing; as Gladys, she seamlessly slips between brassy charisma and steely menace. The character generates the movie's biggest laughs and its best jump scares, and her magic is both cryptic and formidable: She can weaponize the people she bewitches as undead assassins, leading to a showdown in which she keeps throwing her thralls at Archer and Justine once they finally figure out what she's up to.

The catharsis of her defeat is twofold: Not only is Gladys taken down, but her demise also comes at the hands of the children she's captured. Alex figures out how to work Gladys's magic and sends them after her, running and screaming, until they tear her apart like a pack of hyenas. The moment is pure cinema joy, even more so because of the transgression—it is a real spooky delight to realize you're with a packed crowd, cheering on a group of third-graders who are intent on murdering an old lady with their bare hands.

But Cregger gets to have his cake and eat it too. The threat has been taken care of, by way of the kind of kinetic filmmaking that might make anyone punch the air. The battle, however, was long ago lost. The voice-over narration tells us that Alex's parents remain catatonic, and, after a couple of years, some of the recovered children have only just begun to speak again. Weapons offers a fantasy of triumph, and it's a satisfying one, but with that exhalation comes many more details to ponder. The wreckage of grief and loss all the characters have been mired in is hardly swept away. As a result, Weapons is the feel-bad, feel-good movie of the year—a rare horror masterpiece that leaps beyond its genre without abandoning its sick, sad heart.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Forecasts are better than ever, and far more vulnerable than they should be.

Erin was upgraded Friday morning from a tropical storm to a hurricane, a storm with sustained winds above 74 miles per hour, making it the first hurricane of the 2025 season. Despite a relatively calm storm season until now, forecasters are still anticipating higher-than-normal levels of activity, and the peak of the hurricane season lies ahead.

The National Hurricane Center is predicting heavy rainfall across the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico through the weekend. The storm is projected to curve away from the US mainland, but parts of the East Coast are facing “significant risk of dangerous surf and rip currents along western Atlantic beaches next week.”

The hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30 and typically has 14 storms strong enough to be named, meaning with wind speeds above 39 mph. This year is anticipated to be busier than usual, with forecasters expecting up to 18 named storms, and up to five that will turn into major hurricanes. That's due in part to the El Niño cycle, which is currently in its neutral phase, creating atmospheric conditions more favorable to tropical storms. The surface of the Atlantic Ocean remains at above-average temperatures, and since hurricanes are powered by hot water, Erin may become the first major hurricane of the year.

“As we enter the second half of the season, this updated hurricane outlook serves as a call to action to prepare now, in advance, rather than delay until a warning is issued,” acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a news release.

But a tropical storm doesn't have to reach hurricane strength to cause death and destruction. The remnants of Tropical Storm Barry last month stalled over Texas, where they converged with another weather system and caused a massive downpour that led to deadly flooding in the state's hill country.

A key step to saving lives from tropical storms and hurricanes is to anticipate where they might go and get people out of the way. On this front, scientists have made tremendous strides in building longer lead times ahead of a storm's landfall, and new tools are continuing to extend that lead. But the Trump administration's recent cuts to departments that study and forecast weather are undermining this progress, while cuts to emergency agencies are slowing disaster responses.

Erin could be a major test of the results of these actions.

Meteorologists often describe hurricanes as heat engines, meaning that they use a temperature difference to generate wind and rain. But to start up, a hurricane needs sea surface temperatures to be around 80 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter. This is why the apex of hurricane activity tends to be in September, after the Atlantic Ocean has had all summer to heat up.

Generally, the hotter the water, the more powerful the resulting storm. “For every degree centigrade that you raise the ocean temperature, the wind speed in the hurricane goes up between 5 and 7 percent,” Kerry Emanuel, an emeritus professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Vox last year. With global average temperatures rising due to climate change, the potential for more powerful hurricanes is increasing.

A warmer planet also means rising sea levels as ice caps melt, adding more liquid to the seas. The ocean itself also expands as it gets hotter. So when a hurricane occurs, its winds create a larger storm surge as it pushes water inland. Warmer air can also hold onto more moisture, increasing the rainfall during a hurricane. The combined effects of storm surge and more intense rainfall can lead to more flooding, often the deadliest and most destructive aspect of a hurricane. And as the floods in Texas this year showed, even areas that are far inland can suffer severely from hurricane storm systems.

Since hurricanes spin counter-clockwise, these effects tend to be stronger on the right side of the storm — sometimes called the “dirty side” — where the wind is blowing in the same direction as the storm is moving.

On the other side of the equation, more people are living in the paths of hurricanes. In the US, about 40 percent of the population lives in a coastal county, and the numbers are growing. So when a hurricane makes landfall, it threatens more lives and takes a bigger bite out of the economy.

The good news is that scientists have made huge strides in anticipating hurricanes and can now predict where they are going days in advance. A modern hurricane track forecast looking 72 hours ahead is better than a 24-hour forecast in the early 90s. Last year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deployed a new prediction model called the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System. It proved to be better than previous models at predicting a storm's path and intensity.

In recent years, a number of hurricanes have undergone rapid intensification, where they gain more than 35 miles per hour in wind speed in less than 24 hours. It makes storms harder to predict, and makes evacuating people in their path more hasty and chaotic, as hurricanes surge in strength. Scientists are still trying to tease out the mechanisms behind rapid intensification, but the new model was able to see the rapid intensification coming in Hurricanes Helene and Milton from their earliest advisories, days before landfall.

But while NOAA has made improvements in its forecasts, the agency itself has faced big cuts from the Trump administration, including staff who work on hurricane modeling. The White House has proposed cutting its budget by a quarter, eliminating research divisions like the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which studies hurricanes. Several field offices for the National Weather Service under NOAA currently lack lead meteorologists, and key forecasting tools like weather balloon launches have seen a decline. The National Weather Service is now scrambling to hire back hundreds of employees. All of this adds an unnecessary layer of chaos to an already dangerous situation.

The true scope of these vulnerabilities won't be revealed until after a major hurricane. Already, emergency responders in some parts of the country are getting the message that help from higher up in the government isn't coming, while homeowners are getting the sense that they're on their own when facing extreme weather. And even if the US dodges the worst of Erin, there are still more than two months left in the hurricane season, which has yet to reach its peak.

Update, August 15, 2025, 1:40 pm ET: This story has been updated to include news of Erin's upgrade to hurricane status.

In this article

Treasury yields rose on Friday after July's retail sales and consumer sentiment data provided two contrasting looks at the U.S. consumer.

The 2-year Treasury yield added 2 basis points to 3.757%. The benchmark 10-year note yield rose 3 basis points to 4.324%.

July's retail sales data, released on Friday morning, indicated that consumers are reacting well to tax changes and tariffs. Retail sales rose 0.5% last month, matching expectations from the Dow Jones consensus. Retail sales excluding automobiles gained 0.3%, also meeting estimates.

However, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 58.6 in August from 61.7 last month due to worries over inflation.

This comes after the producer price index, a measure of wholesale U.S. inflation, climbed by a far larger-than-expected 0.9% in July on a month-over-month basis on Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones had expected PPI to increase 0.2% month over month.

That report threw cold water on another inflation report that came out earlier in the week indicating some softening in consumer prices. The July consumer price index had eased concerns that tariffs may be causing prices to increase rapidly.

Despite the higher inflation number, Fed funds futures were still pricing in about 85% odds of an interest rate cut in September, according to the CME's FedWatch Tool, slightly lower than during the previous session. The futures, however, did remove any chance of a half-point cut.

Those inflation readings come ahead of the Fed's annual gathering of the world's central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week, sponsored by the Kansas City Fed, which will influence future monetary policy decisions.

Until these rate cuts come, Jay Hatfield, CEO and CIO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, believes that the 10-year Treasury yield will continue to trade around its current range.

""We think the bond markets can be stalled,"" he told CNBC. ""We don't think we'll have an assault on 4% until we get at least one or two cuts.""

Russian media outlets were in high spirits on Friday as Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin headed to meet U.S. President Donald Trump for an Alaskan summit widely presented as a win for Moscow, its economy and global standing.

Articles and commentary were splashed across Russian state news sites on Friday reveling in the global attention that Putin's historic trip to the U.S. was garnering, with positive takes on what the high-stakes talks — centered on ending the war in Ukraine — could mean for Russia, which has been isolated and economically punished by the West since invading Ukraine in 2022.

""Russia-U.S. summit will be an attempt to reset relations,"" state news outlet TASS headlined, with accompanying stories echoing positive sentiment around the one-to-one talks: ""The whole world is waiting for the meeting between Putin and Trump"" and ""Russia and the U.S. have potential to renew partnership in the Arctic,"" commentators stated, according to Google translations.

The mood in Ukraine was positively dour, meanwhile, with news outlets reflecting fears that Kyiv could be sold out during the talks with Putin, a veteran statesman who is seen as likely to pursue as many concessions as he can from Trump in return for a ceasefire.

State news outlet RIA Novosti reveled in the absence of Ukrainian and European officials from what it described as ""historic"" talks.

Ria Novosti's columnist Kirill Strelnikov said recent Russian territorial gains in Ukraine showed the country's forces were already ""negotiating"" long before Friday's talks, noting ""the main negotiator, who silently and tiredly laid out the killer arguments on the table, was the Russian army.""

Russia's media landscape is heavily controlled by the state, with little pushback against the Kremlin's messaging and policies. Throughout the war, state-run media have aggrandized Russian wins on the battlefield, while downplaying or ignoring news to the contrary. Commentary seen to denigrate or damage Russia's war effort can land authors in jail.

In Ukraine, news outlets are decrying what they — and the Kyiv leadership — see as the rehabilitation of Putin. ""From 'war criminal' to U.S. guest — Trump invites Putin out of isolation,"" the front page of the Kyiv Independent's online news site.

The International Criminal Court in 2023 issued an arrest warrant for Putin over alleged war crimes, namely, the ""unlawful deportation"" of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia. The Kremlin denies any wrongdoing. The U.S. 

The U.S. is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the ICC and therefore has no obligation to arrest Putin when he steps on American soil.

Another Kyiv Independent story reflected low morale among Ukrainian troops, who fear Trump could capitulate to Putin by offering up Russian-occupied territory as part of a coveted ceasefire deal, after previously boasting he could end the war in Ukraine shortly into his second mandate.

Securing this peace has proved far harder than Trump expected, however. He has so far refused to pull the trigger on further sanctions on Moscow, despite threatening to do so if the Kremlin did not agree to a ceasefire.

The lede story on the Kyiv Post, headlined ""Trump Holds ‘Enormous Leverage' Over Putin – Will He Use It?"" reflected concerns that, while Trump holds some cards that could persuade Russia to enter a peace deal, he, ultimately, won't be prepared to act. 

Similarly to Russian counterparts, Ukrainian media outlets have championed the country's armed forces and war efforts. There is nonetheless greater media freedom in Ukraine — a prerequisite for Kyiv's aspirations to EU membership.

The Trump-Putin talks are expected to kick off at 3.30 p.m. ET, with the presidents set to later hold a joint press conference to summarize their discussions.

That presser will be one of the most closely watched events of this year, revealing the presidents' takes on the talks and what pledges (or lack thereof) might have been made in order to reach a ceasefire.

""The president wants to exhaust all options to try to bring this war to a peaceful resolution,"" the White House said on the eve of the Alaska summit.

But Ukraine and its European allies fear those ""options"" might be bad for Kyiv's territorial integrity, with Trump already mooting the idea of land ""swapping"" as part of a ceasefire, and wider European security.

Oops, something went wrong

SharpLink Gaming's shares plummeted Friday as the online gambling marketer disclosed disappointing earnings for the second financial quarter.

The Ethereum treasury's shares are trading at $20.04, down nearly 15% in intraday trading.

SharpLink reported $103 million in net losses for the three-month period ending on June 30—a stark contrast to its nearly $12 million net income during the same quarter last year.

Revenue came in at $1.4 million for the second quarter, down 30% from the same time last year. The company clocked $0.3 million gross profit, marking a 50% decrease from the first half of last year.

The report marks SharpLink's first earnings report since the firm announced its pivot to an Ethereum-centered corporate strategy in May.

SharpLink's executives attributed the recent losses to a $87.8 million non-cash impairment loss on its LSE holdings, a tokenized version of staked ETH that allows holders to use their tokens while earning rewards for locking them up on the Ethereum network.

They also pointed to stock-based compensation linked to their strategic advisory agreement with blockchain infrastructure firm Consensys worth $16.4 million. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

“So there's no confusion for our investors, I want to state plainly that this… is a non-cash loss and is a result of the company following the current accounting practices,” SharpLink Gaming Chief Financial Officer Robert DeLucia said Friday on an earnings call with analysts.

Ethereum ETF Inflows Outpace Bitcoin ETFs for Fifth Straight Day

The company's lackluster earnings came as Ethereum's price slid below $4,400 earlier Friday, just a day after coming within striking distance of its record price of more than $4,800. The retracement followed a hotter-than-expected producer-price index report and amid handwringing over U.S. President Donald Trump's meeting on Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

SharpLink currently holds 728,804 ETH. The tokens are worth a combined $3.23 billion as of writing time, according to data provider CoinGecko.

Ethereum is trading at $4,444 as of writing time, down 2.2% over the past 24 hours, the same data shows.

Ethereum (ETH) isn't just another blockchain or a smart contract platform — it's the rails, infrastructure, and lifeblood powering the future of finance. If you're still watching Bitcoin (BTC) dominate the headlines and wondering when the world will “get” Ethereum, wake up. The shift is already happening, and the signals are undeniable.

Let's get the basics out of the way. Today, Ethereum's market cap sits around $450 billion. The global crude oil market is $2.6 trillion. So ask yourself — if Ethereum is the plumbing for global finance, why shouldn't its market cap rival oil's? Simple math says ETH needs a 6.6x jump from here to hit oil's benchmark. At today's ~$3,000 ETH price, that puts a realistic long-term target around $20,000. Not based on hopium. Based on infrastructure. Based on usage. Based on yield. 

ETH has one more superpower: it's deflationary. Every transaction burns ETH. Every interaction with the network shrinks supply. So the more Ethereum gets used, the more valuable ETH becomes. That's not just supply and demand. It's a protocol-driven monetary policy.

Ethereum offers yield on both ends of the crypto stack. Stablecoins (mostly built on Ethereum) offer yield via tokenized treasuries. Meanwhile, staking ETH directly pays protocol-native yield rewarded in-kind, with ETH itself. That means you're earning more of the asset as it appreciates. Try finding that in TradFi without risk and friction.

And here's the kicker: getting into Ethereum staking now means waiting 11 days in the queue. That's not a red flag. It's a signal. Ethereum is the safest yield-generating asset in crypto, period. When you combine real-world yield through treasuries with blockchain-native staking rewards, you get something unique. Something durable that no other asset or chain can replicate.

Ethereum is doing to financial services what the internet did to information: breaking barriers, creating infinite composability, and enabling permissionless innovation. It's not just about DeFi. It's about building the infrastructure where every financial product — from lending to insurance to credit scoring — can be replicated, automated, and scaled globally without middlemen.

The way oil powered the Industrial Age, ETH powers this financial renaissance.

You want to buy a concert ticket? That'll be an NFT. Need a birth certificate? Same thing. Fractional real estate, tokenized T-bills, cross-border payroll, gaming assets. They all move through Ethereum. There's no other ecosystem with the reliability (100% uptime in 10 years), scale, or developer mindshare to do this.

Solana (SOL) is fast but fragile. Tron (TRX) is Tether's (USDT) playground. Bitcoin is foundational but not programmable. ETH is the one protocol that can actually do the work and do it trustlessly, with a global developer base and the security to match.

Everyone's talking about crypto ETFs and inflows. But the true vehicle of mass adoption is stablecoins. Why? Because they make sense. Because they yield. And because they solve a real-world problem: the demand for safety without sacrificing returns.

U.S. treasuries are piling up like junk nobody wants. But through stablecoins, crypto becomes the insatiable buyer, soaking up debt, packaging it, and redistributing it in yield-bearing wrappers across a global decentralized network. Savings accounts? Dead.

Within five years, your grandma will be earning yield through a stablecoin savings app she barely understands, and that's a good thing. In fact, most people won't even realize they're using crypto. They'll just know their money works harder.

What's holding things back? Usability. Let's be honest: interacting with blockchains today still feels like programming in the ‘90s. Wallets, seed phrases, bridging, gas fees — it's too complex. But this is changing fast.

The future is frictionless. By 2030, nobody will carry a wallet. Nobody will swipe a credit card. Stablecoins will be embedded in every app. Wallets will be interoperable and invisible. Signing a smart contract will feel like signing into Netflix. And yes, web2 banking delays like “3 to 5 business days” will be a hilarious relic of a broken system. Wire transfers? Already obsolete.

In the next decade, the foundations of global finance will undergo a structural shift. Savings accounts will be backed by stablecoins, and credit markets will operate entirely on-chain. The Federal Reserve's effective floor rate may one day be influenced by protocol-native yields—driven by staking returns and tokenized treasuries. Real-world assets such as equities, real estate, and debt will increasingly be tokenized, and Ethereum stands out as the only blockchain with the scalability and security to support this transition. Meanwhile, DeFi will democratize access to sophisticated financial strategies, unlocking tools once limited to institutional players. As this vision takes shape, Ethereum's market capitalization could surpass $3 trillion by 2030.

If you believe finance is going digital, you're already betting on Ethereum. Whether it's stablecoins, staking, NFTs, or tokenized assets — it all converges here. And while the narratives swirl around memecoins and regulatory drama, the fundamentals keep grinding forward. Ethereum is shipping upgrades, scaling via L2s, and quietly becoming the substrate for the financial Internet.

ETH isn't just part of the future. ETH is the future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Coinbase says a ‘full-scale altcoin season' may be just ahead","https://cointelegraph.com/news/current-market-conditions-suggest-shift-towards-a-full-scale-altseason-coinbase","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 04:36:52 GMT","

 Bitcoin dominance has fallen to a six-month low while altcoin market cap has jumped 50% since July, setting the stage for a potential September altseason, said Coinbase. 

Altcoins have seen significant recent growth, while crypto market conditions suggest there could soon be a shift toward cryptocurrencies outside of Bitcoin, according to Coinbase.

“We think current market conditions now suggest a potential shift towards a full-scale altcoin season as we approach September,” Coinbase Institutional's global head of research, David Duong, wrote in a monthly outlook report on Thursday.

The Coinbase analyst joined a growing chorus of traders and market observers tipping for an imminent altcoin season. 

The firm defines altcoin season as when at least 75% of the top 50 altcoins by market capitalization outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over the preceding 90 days.

Duong added that there was “significant retail capital sitting on the sidelines” in money market funds, and Federal Reserve easing could “unlock greater retail participation in the medium term.”

July's US Consumer Price Index (CPI) this week showed inflation holding at 2.7% year-over-year, which has seen the odds of a Fed September rate cut increase to 92% on futures markets. 

A lower interest rate environment potentially draws fresh capital into the market and could be a catalyst for high-risk assets such as altcoins. 

Another factor influencing the arrival of altseason is the decline in Bitcoin dominance or total crypto market capitalization share. 

Bitcoin's market dominance has declined about 10% from over 65% in May to 59% by August, “signaling the early stages of capital rotation into altcoins,” Duong wrote.

Bitcoin dominance is currently 59.5%, around its lowest level since late January, according to TradingView. 

“Bitcoin dominance has just formed its first monthly bearish cross since January 2021,” observed crypto day trader Ito Shimotsuma on Thursday. “Back then, altcoins went up only for four months when it happened,” he said before adding, “Something similar this time will cause an up-only rally till December 2025.”

Altcoin season indexes have also been climbing higher, but still remain well below the 75 threshold by which they historically define altseasons, even though the altcoin market cap has climbed over 50% since early July, Duong observed. 

CoinMarketCapʼs Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 44, having climbed from below 25 in July. Blockchain Center's Altcoin Season Index is a neutral 53, while CryptoRank's Altseason Index is a level 50. 

Duong said that current momentum is being fueled by digital asset treasuries and stablecoin narratives, with the divergence in altseason indexes and total altcoin market cap “reflecting rising institutional interest in Ethereum,” before concluding:  

“Three key conditions need to align for an altcoin season to take hold: a supportive macro backdrop, declining BTC dominance, and a strong new narrative,”  Joanna Liang, founding partner of Singapore-based venture capital firm Jsquare, told Cointelegraph.

“Past cycles were driven by clear catalysts: ICOs in 2017–2018, Layer-1s in 2018–2019, and DeFi/NFTs in 2021–2022,” she said before adding:

Coinbase believes crypto markets may be on the cusp of a full-scale altcoin season, with institutional demand for Ethereum playing a central role and a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in September setting the stage for retail inflows.

In its published Thursday, the exchange said the market has largely followed the path it predicted earlier this year, when it expected new highs in the second half of 2025. Stronger-than-anticipated macro conditions and clearer regulatory frameworks have helped fuel that momentum.

Bitcoin's market dominance has slipped from 65% in May to about 59% in August. Coinbase said the decline points to the early stages of capital rotation into altcoins. At the same time, altcoin market capitalization has jumped more than 50% since July to $1.4 trillion.

Altcoin Season is comingAs September approaches, the transition to a full-scale altcoin season is likely.Our positive 3Q25 outlook stems from macro trends such as potential Fed rate cuts and expected regulatory advancements.More key themes in this Monthly Outlook report ↓— Coinbase Institutional 🛡️ (@CoinbaseInsto) ETH Market Cap Jumps 50% Since July on Treasury Buys

The Altcoin Season Index, a metric that tracks whether alts are outperforming Bitcoin, remains in the low 40s, below the 75 threshold that signals a full rotation. Still, Coinbase noted that conditions are aligning for a broader rally as September approaches.

Ethereum has been the main beneficiary of this shift. Its market cap has grown 50% since early July, powered by demand from digital asset treasuries and a growing narrative around stablecoins and real-world assets.

Bitmine Immersion Technologies alone has acquired 1.2m ETH after raising $20b, with capacity to purchase $24.5b worth. The firm has overtaken Sharplink Gaming, the former leader among Ethereum-focused treasuries. Together, top institutional holders now control nearly 3 million ETH, about 2% of the supply.

Tokens linked closely to Ethereum, including Arbitrum, Ethena, Lido DAO and Optimism, have all moved in step with ETH. Of these, only Lido has rallied sharply, gaining 58% this month. 

Coinbase said Lido's rise reflected both its exposure to ETH and a US SEC staff statement earlier in August that liquid staking tokens are not securities under certain conditions.Alt Season Not Fully Here, But Conditions Are Building

While institutional flows dominate the ETH story, Coinbase said retail capital is also waiting to move. More than $7.2 trillion currently sits in US money market funds, the largest stockpile on record.

These balances represent what the firm called “missed opportunity costs” caused by high traditional valuations, trade uncertainties and lingering doubts about growth. It expects the upcoming Fed cuts to reduce the appeal of money market funds and redirect capital into crypto and other risk assets.

The firm's liquidity index, which tracks stablecoin issuance, trading volumes, orderbook depth and free float, has also begun to recover after six months of decline. Coinbase said this is an early sign that liquidity is returning to the crypto market.

“Our 3Q25 outlook remains constructive, though our view on an altcoin season has evolved,” the report said. “The recent decrease in Bitcoin dominance suggests an early rotation of capital into altcoins rather than a full-scale altcoin season at this stage. 

With the Fed expected to ease in September and the SEC signaling flexibility around some token models, Coinbase said the conditions for a deeper altcoin season are beginning to fall into place.

Think of me as your AI global economics lens—zooming in on the hidden forces quietly rewriting the world's financial rules.

- Stellar Lumens (XLM) emerges as institutional capital reshapes crypto markets in 2025, transitioning from niche remittance tool to global financial infrastructure.

- Partnerships with PayPal, Societe Generale-FORGE, and IBM drive XLM's adoption, with TVL surging 80% to $150M and 9.69M active enterprise wallets.

- Technical analysis highlights XLM's $0.42 support and $0.50 breakout potential, with institutional buyers targeting $0.60–$0.77 as key resistance is breached.

- Regulatory alignment and strategic collaborations in cross-border payments validate XLM's role in tokenizing real-world assets and expanding financial inclusion.

 

The cryptocurrency market has long been a playground for retail speculation, but 2025 marks a pivotal shift as institutional capital begins to reshape the landscape. Among the most compelling narratives is that of Stellar Lumens (XLM), a blockchain platform poised to capitalize on surging demand for scalable, low-cost cross-border solutions. With institutional-driven momentum accelerating, XLM's ecosystem is evolving from a niche remittance tool to a foundational layer for global finance.  

Stellar's appeal to institutional investors lies in its unique value proposition: a decentralized network capable of processing 1,000 transactions per second at near-zero cost. This has attracted major players such as PayPal, which launched its stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), on the Stellar network in June 2025. By leveraging Stellar's infrastructure, PayPal aims to expand its “PayFi” ecosystem, enabling seamless remittances and everyday payments for millions of users. Similarly, Societe Generale-FORGE (SG-FORGE) has integrated its EUR-backed stablecoin, EURCV, onto Stellar, aligning with EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) regulations. These partnerships signal a broader institutional consensus: Stellar is no longer a speculative asset but a proven infrastructure layer.  

The Stellar network's Total Value Locked (TVL) surged 80% to $150 million in Q2 2025, driven by corporate and institutional participation. Active enterprise wallets now number 9.69 million, with 5,000–6,000 new institutional addresses added daily. This growth is not merely quantitative but qualitative. For instance, Taurus, a digital asset infrastructure provider, launched custody and issuance platforms on Stellar, offering institutional-grade security for tokenized assets. Meanwhile, Etherfuse and Draper University have joined the network, expanding its custodial solutions and fostering innovation in AI-driven DeFi applications.  

XLM's price action in Q2 2025 has been nothing short of remarkable. After a 261.12% 24-hour surge, the token has consolidated within a $0.42–$0.43 range, with institutional buyers consistently stepping in at the $0.42 support level. Technical analysts highlight a critical breakout above the descending trendline, with Fibonacci extensions and Elliott Wave models pointing to a near-term target of $0.47. If XLM breaches $0.50—a key psychological and technical resistance—further gains to $0.60–$0.77 are likely.  

Stellar's partnerships with IBM, MoneyGram, and Flutterwave have cemented its role in cross-border remittances, reducing transaction costs by up to 70% compared to traditional banks. In emerging markets, where financial inclusion remains a challenge, Stellar's collaboration with Tala and UNDP has enabled non-custodial wallets and blockchain-based microfinance solutions. These initiatives not only expand Stellar's user base but also validate its utility in real-world applications.  

Regulatory alignment has been a cornerstone of Stellar's institutional appeal. The Stellar Development Foundation's compliance tools now meet international standards, easing the path for custodial services and financial institutions to adopt the network. This is particularly critical in jurisdictions like the EU and the U.S., where MICA and SEC regulations demand rigorous compliance frameworks.  

For investors, XLM presents a compelling case. Its institutional-grade infrastructure, regulatory readiness, and strategic partnerships position it as a key player in the tokenization of real-world assets and cross-border finance. While the current price of $0.46 is in proximity to the $0.50 breakout threshold, the risk-reward profile remains favorable. However, caution is warranted: the crypto market remains volatile, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and regulatory shifts could impact momentum.  

Investment Advice:1. Positioning: Allocate a modest portion of a diversified portfolio to XLM, given its institutional-driven growth and technical setup.2. Entry Points: Consider accumulating near the $0.42–$0.43 support zone, with a stop-loss below $0.40 to mitigate downside risk.3. Long-Term Horizon: For those with a 12–18-month outlook, XLM's ecosystem expansion and TVL growth suggest potential for multi-bagger returns.  

Stellar Lumens is no longer a speculative bet but a foundational asset in the institutionalization of blockchain finance. Its ability to bridge traditional systems with decentralized innovation—while maintaining low costs and regulatory compliance—makes it a standout in a crowded market. As institutional capital continues to flow into the ecosystem, XLM's breakout potential is not just a technical possibility but a structural inevitability. For investors willing to navigate the volatility, the rewards could be substantial.

Two AI blockchain titans compete for dominance, but only Protocol AI offers ground-floor entry at $24,100 while Lightchain's bloated $21 million raise prices out retail investors seeking 1000% returns.

The comparison is devastating for Lightchain. They raised $22 million selling promises of “Proof of Intelligence” launching maybe in 2026. Protocol AI (PROAI) has working technology today – live testnet processing 50,000 TPS with AI-optimized execution. Yet PROAI's valuation sits 1000x lower.

The technical comparison isn't close:

But here's the killer – Protocol AI works TODAY. Developers are building, testing, deploying. Lightchain investors wait eighteen months hoping promises materialize. In crypto, that's an eternity.



Protocol AI offers 98% APY from real platform revenue – deployment fees, marketplace commissions, subscriptions. Lightchain proposes “variable rewards based on network participation.” One delivers concrete returns, the other delivers corporate speak.

The investor profiles reveal everything. Lightchain attracted VCs seeking safe 3-5x over years. Protocol AI's community presale attracts crypto natives understanding exponential growth. When institutions discover PROAI, early investors will already be rich.

Both target the $16 billion AI agent market, but only Protocol AI delivers infrastructure today. Smart money recognizes the pattern – superior technology at microscopic valuation.

Daily Protocol AI contributions exceeded Lightchain's entire weekly raise yesterday. Stage 1 at $0.5191 closes soon. Stage 2 at $0.58 means paying more. By exchange listing, the opportunity disappears.

Protocol AI reaches 1000% by Q4 2025. Lightchain might not even launch by then. The choice is obvious – working technology at ground-floor prices versus promises at inflated valuations. PROAI wins this race before Lightchain reaches the starting line.

Digital Currency Group (DCG) has initiated legal action against its bankrupt lending arm, Genesis Global Capital LLC, seeking repayment related to a $1.1 billion support package issued during the crypto market crash of 2022.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, claims the funds were provided to offset the financial damage caused by the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC), The Block reported on Friday.

Genesis, a major lender to 3AC, suffered a $2.36 billion default after the hedge fund failed to meet a margin call in 2022. 

DCG alleges the shortfall impacted the equity of Genesis Asia Pacific, prompting DCG to step in with the promissory note.

According to court filings, the note's principal was to be reduced in line with any recoveries from 3AC's collateral. 

DCG now contends that Genesis recorded gains on that collateral exceeding the original $1.1 billion note, yet still owes DCG more than $105 million plus interest.

This case is the latest turn in an ongoing legal battle between the two entities.

Earlier this year, Genesis's Litigation Oversight Committee filed separate lawsuits against DCG, its CEO Barry Silbert, and other executives, alleging improper fund transfers during the 2022 market turmoil.

Genesis, which froze lending after the collapse of TerraUSD LUNC/USD and later FTX, filed for bankruptcy in 2023. 

The firm completed a restructuring in 2024 and is currently distributing around $4 billion in assets to creditors. 

Recovery rates vary depending on the cryptocurrency, while DCG, as an equity holder, is last in line for repayment. 

Genesis has also sued its former parent for $2.1 billion to cover additional customer repayments.

- U.S. President Donald Trump declared cryptocurrency the ""greatest financial revolution since the internet,"" signaling a pro-crypto policy shift.

- The White House released a national strategy supporting digital assets through updated regulations and innovation exemptions in banking, taxation, and AML frameworks.

- The GENIUS Act (August 6, 2025) aims to create a stable regulatory environment for crypto, promoting U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and rejecting a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

- Key measures include safe harbors for digital asset businesses, self-custody rights, and collaboration with industry stakeholders to foster innovation while mitigating risks.

The United States has taken a bold step in reshaping its financial landscape with a presidential declaration that positions cryptocurrency as the most significant financial revolution since the internet. In a recent statement, the President of the United States characterized digital assets as a transformative force, signaling a major shift in the White House's approach to regulating and promoting the crypto sector. This declaration, coupled with a comprehensive report from the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, outlines a national strategy aimed at reinforcing U.S. leadership in digital financial technology [1].

The report, released on July 30, 2025, was developed in response to an executive order issued earlier this year titled Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology. It calls for a regulatory framework that supports innovation while addressing risks in areas such as banking, taxation, anti-money laundering (AML), and market structure. The White House, alongside key agencies including the SEC and CFTC, is advocating for updated rules that reflect the evolving nature of digital assets [1]. This marks a clear departure from earlier, more cautious approaches to crypto regulation under previous administrations.

President Donald Trump has been a vocal supporter of digital assets, emphasizing their potential to drive economic growth and technological advancement. At a recent rally in Texas, he declared that “cryptocurrency represents the greatest financial revolution since the internet,” reinforcing the administration's pro-crypto stance [2]. This sentiment is shared by SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who has described the new policy as a “blueprint to make America first in blockchain and crypto technology” [1]. The report explicitly supports the use of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and rejects the idea of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), underscoring the administration's commitment to maintaining the dollar's global influence.

The new policy includes several key measures designed to foster a more hospitable environment for digital asset businesses. These include safe harbors and innovation exemptions that aim to reduce regulatory uncertainty and encourage experimentation in the sector. The report also emphasizes the importance of self-custody rights for digital assets, a move that is expected to enhance consumer choice and promote capital formation [1]. According to analysts, these changes signal a growing opportunity for companies willing to engage with the emerging digital finance ecosystem [1].

To further solidify the administration's commitment, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on August 6, 2025. This legislation is seen as a landmark moment in the federal regulation of digital currencies, as it aims to provide a more stable and predictable environment for the crypto industry while ensuring compliance with evolving standards [3]. The law is expected to encourage greater participation from institutional investors, potentially leading to a surge in digital asset values and broader market adoption.

The policy shift also highlights the need for greater collaboration between industry stakeholders and regulators, particularly in areas such as AML, tax compliance, and digital identity. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, the report encourages companies and industry groups to actively participate in shaping the development of regulatory sandboxes and safe harbors, which are seen as key tools for fostering innovation while mitigating risk [1]. The administration's approach is viewed as a strategic effort to position the U.S. as a global leader in the digital finance revolution.

The Federal Reserve continued its relaxation of crypto oversight on Friday with a move to shut down a two-year-old supervisory program intended to keep a special eye on banks' crypto ties, instead folding that task back to its day-to-day oversight work.



The central bank established its short-lived Novel Activities Supervision Program during the tenure of Vice Chairman Michael Barr, the board's supervision chief appointed by then-President Joe Biden, and the agency is now sunsetting the effort and will ""return to monitoring banks' novel activities through the normal supervisory process,"" according to a Fed statement on Friday.



Since the start of President Donald Trump's second term, the Fed has tended to move in step with the other banking regulators who've pulled back on aggressive digital assets scrutiny. In April, the Federal Reserve withdrew its earlier crypto guidance that directed bankers to get approvals from the government supervisors before engaging in new crypto activity. The other two U.S. federal banking regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. made matching moves to toss out the previous guidance, leaving banks to make their own crypto decisions under existing risk-management expectations.



The idea behind the novel-activity program was that the Fed needed to gather special expertise and put a closer focus on risks to the banking system that might emerge from innovative and untested technologies. The initiative followed closely in the aftermath of the 2023 crisis in which three U.S. lenders closely associated with technology and crypto clients — Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank — failed about five months earlier.



In the two years since establishing the program, though, the Fed has ""strengthened its understanding of those activities, related risks, and bank risk management practices,"" according to Friday's statement, so the work will be directed back to the regular supervisory process.



The crypto industry and U.S. banking regulators have been through a tumultuous few years in which digital assets firms and insiders have complained of an organized campaign from government entities to cut them off from bank services — a campaign the industry and its Republican lawmaker allies call Operation Chokepoint 2.0. But Trump has appointed crypto-friendly officials to redirect the banking agencies, and though the Fed is protective of its independence, it's generally joined the OCC and FDIC in the trend of relaxing crypto constraints.

They found their way into the filter drums of the pumping station.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Jellyfish are remarkable creatures. They're twice as old as dinosaurs; they don't have brains, lungs, or a heart; and they've nearly cracked the secret to immortality. But there's another accolade that they can affix to their already impressive biological resumé—they're the scourge of nuclear reactors. 

This fact was proven this past Sunday, when three of the six reactors at Gravelines power plant near Calais in northern France shut down unexpectedly because a swarm of jellyfish had entered the plant's cooling system, according to the government-owned utility operator Électricité de France, or EDF. By Monday morning, a fourth reactor also temporarily shut down. 

The jellyfish gathered near the filter drums of the pumping station that uses water from a nearby canal (which eventually feeds into the North Sea) to cool down the reactor. Although the shutdown was unexpected, the plant's safety measures ensured that the jellyfish “had no impact on the safety of the facilities, the safety of personnel, or the environment,” the EDF said. Sadly, the jellyfish themselves didn't fare as well. 

When it comes to nuclear energy, France punches way above its weight. In response to the 1973 Oil Crisis, the country decided to double down on nuclear energy, and France now has 57 reactors in operation. Gravelines alone provides nearly 6 percent of the nation's electricity—in fact, as of June of 2025, France has more generation capacity than China with around one-twentieth the population, and is second only to the U.S. in terms of net capacity. 

Reactors along the coastline (like Gravelines) often use seawater to cool themselves because it's particularly effective at removing waste heat. The EDF claims that filters prevent marine life from being sucked into these vents, but not from blocking the vents themselves. As The New York Times notes, jellyfish tend to “liquify” upon death, which can allow their bodies to bypass the filters and cause more problems downstream. The outlet also notes that in years past, similar jellyfish disruptions have impacted nuclear reactors around the world, including in Japan, Scotland, and Sweden. 

So, what's causing all of this recent jellyfish mayhem? Yep, it's climate change. Warmer ocean waters cause more favorable conditions for some jellyfish to spawn, and “dead zone” environments caused by the explosive growth of plankton (triggered by agricultural runoff) may impact some marine species, but not so much jellyfish. There, a lack of brain and blood becomes an evolutionary advantage. 

The world has turned to some out-of-the-box solutions to address the global jellyfish crisis, most notably trying to make these meddlesome jellies a sought-after delicacy. But the real answers lie in reducing carbon dioxide emissions and limiting agricultural runoff that create these warmer, low-oxygen waters in the first place. 

For more than 500 million years, jellyfish have served an important ecological function in the world's oceans. If we really want to point a finger at who's to blame, we should look in the mirror.

Research from scientists at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have shed new light on an age-old question: what makes the human brain unique?

The team's discovery comes from their investigation of human-accelerated regions (HARs) -- sections of the human genome that have accumulated an unusually high level of mutations as humans have evolved. There is a lot of scientific interest in HARs, as they are hypothesized to play an essential role in conferring human-specific traits, and also have links to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism.

One reason why scientists think that HARs confer human-specific traits is because they have undergone rapid changes in their genetic sequences since we split from our closest living relative -- the chimpanzee -- approximately 5 million years ago.

Now, UC San Diego researchers have identified one particular HAR -- called HAR123 -- that appears to be instrumental in shaping the human brain.

The researchers found:

Ultimately, HAR123 promotes a particularly advanced human trait called cognitive flexibility, or the ability to unlearn and replace previous knowledge.

In addition to providing new insights into the biology of the human brain, the results also offer a molecular explanation for some of the radical changes that have occurred in the human brain over the course of our evolution. This is supported, for example, by the authors' finding that the human version of HAR123 exerts different molecular and cellular effects than the chimpanzee version in both stem cells and neuron precursor cells in a petri dish.

Further research is needed to more fully understand the molecular action of HAR123 and whether the human version of HAR123 does indeed confer human-specific neural traits. This line of research could lead us to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism.

The study, published online in Science Advances, was led by Miles Wilkinson, Ph.D., distinguished professor, and Kun Tan, Ph.D., assistant professor, both within the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, & Reproductive Sciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine. Wilkinson is also affiliate faculty of the UC San Diego Institute for Genomic Medicine. The study was funded, in part, by grants from the National Institutes of Health and 10x Genomics. The authors declare no competing interests.

Researchers have developed a team of robots that can autonomously explore underground tunnels. First, one drops a probe into the hole to map the interior. Then the smaller of a pair of rovers attaches itself to the larger and abseils down into the cave. From there it can detach itself and explore the environment it finds. The rappelling robots are “a significant step toward enabling future lunar or Martian cave missions”, says geochemist Jennifer Blank.

A surprising number of birds are ‘sex reversed', in which their appearance and reproductive organs don't align with the genetic sex determined by chromosomes. In a study of nearly 500 birds belonging to five common species that were brought into an animal hospital in Australia, researchers found that up to 6% of individuals were sex-reversed. Most examples were genetically female birds with male reproductive organs, but the group included a genetically male bird who appeared to have recently laid an egg.

A device takes advantage of the properties of two layers of material to levitate using only the power of sunlight. The top layer is transparent, allowing sunlight to shine through it, and the bottom layer absorbs that sunlight. Gas molecules moving from the cold transparent layer to the hot bottom layer creates a lift that is similar to that created by a helicopter's whirring rotor, says engineer Igor Bargatin, who has pioneered work on similar devices.

From mid-June to early July, Western Europe experienced its highest average temperatures for this period in decades, and the hottest June on record. And, between 10 June and 8 August, more than 98,000 people in Europe have been displaced by wildfire. Research suggests that heatwaves in the region are becoming much more frequent — one estimate found that London can now expect events like this every 6 years instead of every 60. That's bad for lives and livelihoods: extreme heat cut Greece's gross domestic product by 1.1% between 1 May and 14 July 2025, for example.

Despite years of trying to create a quantum theory of gravity, researchers haven't generated any concrete evidence to support any one contender. Now experiments are in the works that could finally test the true nature of gravity in the laboratory. Some tests plan to use advanced lasers still being invented. Others require ambitious techniques to manipulate matter that might never be achievable. Still, after years of stagnation, some physicists are welcoming “a new era in quantum-gravity research”, says theorist Jonathan Oppenheim.

The only way to iron out uncertainties in climate change modelling is to fund basic climate research, argues climate scientist Tim Palmer. Doing so will give us a better understanding of complex climate systems and a clearer picture of what lies ahead. “Whether the future is closer to an inconvenience or an existential catastrophe, one thing is clear: don't cut funding for basic climate research,” Palmer writes.

Harsh lighting, shiny surfaces and cluttered spaces are among the challenges for scientists wanting to photograph their experiments, whether for public engagement, teaching, or so that a setup can be repeated by others. Alongside a plethora of tips — mostly aimed at physicists — photographer and researcher David Penny notes that the benefits of slowing down to take a few shots go beyond the images captured. “It can also become a framework for observing more attentively, thinking more critically about visual evidence and engaging more creatively with the process of research communication,” he writes.

Paediatrician Leslie Gordon, whose son Sam had progeria, lauds the work of geneticist Francis Collins on the disease. After meeting Sam, Collins — then the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute — co-discovered the cause of the rare and fatal pediatric condition that causes rapid ageing.

Today I'm reminded that good things don't only come to those who wait. A case in point: archaeology student Yara Souza recently uncovered a ninth-century artefact just 90 minutes into her first ever excavation. The tiny decorated object was found near the route of a Roman road that ran between York and Edinburgh.

The hospital room around me faded into focus. The past few hours were a blur in my memory, but now I could clearly hear the monotonous mix of human voices and mechanical beeps. Around me were plain walls, and a curtain through which a gentle beam of sunlight shone, illuminating an enormous pile of lettuce at the foot of my bed.

“What happened?” I asked, and the man slumped on a chair next to me jumped up with a big grin on his face. I recognized the grin, but the hat seemed new. “Jimmy, what's going on?”

“Amanda! Oh, you're awake! And you recognize me!” He shook my hand and patted my shoulder repeatedly, after kicking aside heaps of lettuce in order to approach my bed.

“Jimmy, why am I in the hospital?” I didn't feel injured or ill, just tired.

“Well, I don't know if I'm supposed to tell you so soon, but, um, you were in a coma. You woke up for the first time only yesterday, after six years. You had an accident, remember?”

Wait. Six years?! Jimmy seemed too excited by my awakening to notice my state of shock or to notify any medical personnel. He talked on and on, about my accident, my surgery, my family … ignoring the one subject that I felt needed to be clarified most urgently. At last, overcome with confusion, I interrupted him. “Man, can you please just explain the lettuce?”

“Ah, the lettuce, yes. I believe that's just a funny mix-up. I did ask the AI to bring you everyone's letters when you woke up, but with my accent, it must have misunderstood.”

“What do you mean you asked the AI? How did …” everything was confusing and Jimmy's explanations weren't making it any easier. “I mean, where did it bring all this lettuce from?”

“Oh, you'll be surprised to discover how technology has advanced in the time you were, um, sleeping. I just realized, you completely missed the invention of GAObje.”

“I missed the invention of garbage?” What was he blabbering about?

“GAObje. Well, that's the official name, I think it stands for Generative Artificial Object. But you should call it ‘goobje' like everyone else, unless you want to sound old. Hey, we should buy you some stuff when you get out of here! Nowadays you can have anything you can imagine, instantly and super cheap, all you need is a clear prompt. Here, try on my hat —”

He took off his leather hat, which seemed artisanal and was really quite elegant. However, when he moved over to place it on my head I was slightly disoriented by the lighting on the leather, which seemed unrelated to the lighting in the room; when he placed it on my head, a chill went down my spine.

“Jimmy, why is your hat wet?”

“It's not, it just feels as if it is. These goobje algorithms still have a hard time generating textures, smells, etc., so sometimes you get ones that are a bit wonky.”

“Yuck,” I said, revolted.

“But it's cool, isn't it?” he said obliviously, and placed the hat back on his head. “And it cost about a hundredth of what an NI product would cost. An incredible time to be alive, eh?”

I assumed NI meant ‘natural intelligence', but preferred not to get deeper into this mess. Trying to latch onto a bit of normalcy, I asked the most benign question I could think of.

“The time?” replied Jimmy. “Um, well, my watch is also goobje so I don't know how reliable it is. I usually fact-check it with my phone, but now I'm out of battery. You're welcome to have a look, though, see if you can make sense of it.”

He approached to give me a better view of his freckled arm, adorned with an ornate gold and silver watch. Inside, I could see a multitude of delicate gears turning quietly, harmoniously. The watch had three hands of identical length, and, like the wrist that bore it, was covered in freckles. Realization of what was happening finally dawned on me, and I smiled in relief as my bemusement turned into amusement.

“This is all a dream, right?” I asked, straightening up slightly and trying to shake my head. The motion made the room spin and I immediately stopped, uncertain whether this was just dizziness or if the room had actually spun.

Last week, when OpenAI launched GPT-5, it told software engineers the model was designed to be a “true coding collaborator” that excels at generating high-quality code and performing agentic, or automated, software tasks. While the company didn't say so explicitly, OpenAI appeared to be taking direct aim at Anthropic's Claude Code, which has quickly become many developers' favored tool for AI-assisted coding.

But developers tell WIRED that GPT-5 has been a mixed bag so far. It shines at technical reasoning and planning coding tasks, but some say that Anthropic's newest Opus and Sonnet reasoning models still produce better code. Depending on which version of GPT-5 developers are using—low, medium, or high verbosity—the model can be more elaborative, which sometimes leads it to generate unnecessary or redundant lines of code.

Some software engineers have also criticized how OpenAI evaluated GPT-5's performance at coding, arguing that the benchmarks it used are misleading. One research firm called a graphic that OpenAI published boasting about GPT-5's capabilities a “chart crime.”

GPT-5 does stand out in at least one way: Several people noted that, in comparison to competing models, it is a much more cost-effective option. “GPT-5 is mostly outperformed by other AI models in our tests, but it's really cheap,” says Sayash Kapoor, a computer science doctoral student and researcher at Princeton University who cowrote the book AI Snake Oil.

Kapoor says he and his team have been running benchmark tests to evaluate GPT-5's capabilities since the model was released to the public last week. He notes that the standard test his team uses—measuring how well a language model can write code that will reproduce the results of 45 scientific papers—costs $30 to run with GPT-5 set to medium, or mid-range verbosity. The same test using Anthropic's Opus 4.1 costs $400. In total, Kapoor says his team has spent around $20,000 testing GPT-5 so far.

Although GPT-5 is cheap, Kapoor's tests indicate the model is also less accurate than some of its competitors. Claude's premium model achieved a 51 percent accuracy rating, measured by how many of the scientific papers it accurately reproduced. The medium version of GPT-5 received a 27 percent accuracy rating. (Kapoor has not yet run the same test using GPT-5 high, so it's an indirect comparison, given that Opus 4.1 is Anthropic's most powerful model.)

OpenAI spokesperson Lindsay McCallum referred WIRED to its blog, where it said that it trained GPT-5 on “real-world coding tasks in collaboration with early testers across startups and enterprises.” The company also highlighted some of its internal accuracy measurements for GPT-5, which showed that the GPT-5 “thinking” model, which does more deliberate reasoning, scored highest on accuracy among all of OpenAI's models. GPT-5 “main,” however, still fell short of previously-released models on OpenAI's own accuracy scale.

Anthropic spokesperson Amie Rotherham said in a statement that “performance claims and pricing models often look different once developers start using them in production environments. Since reasoning models can quickly use a lot of tokens while thinking, the industry is moving to a world where price per outcome matters more than price per token.”

Some developers say they've had largely positive experiences with GPT-5 so far. Jenny Wang, an engineer, investor, and creator of the personal styling agent Alta, told WIRED the model appears to be better at completing complex coding tasks in one shot than other models. She compared it to OpenAI's o3 and 4o, which she uses frequently for code generation and straightforward fixes “like formatting, or if I want to create an API endpoint similar to what I already have,” Wang says.

In her tests of GPT-5, Wang says she asked the model to generate code for a press page for her company's website, including specific design elements that would match the rest of the site's aesthetic. GPT-5 completed the task in one take, whereas in the past, Wang would have had to revise her prompts during the process. There was one significant error, though: “It hallucinated the URLs,” Wang says.

Another developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because their employer didn't authorize them to speak to the press, says GPT-5 excels at solving deep technical problems.

The developer's current hobby project is writing a programmatic network analysis tool, one that would require code isolation for security purposes. “I basically presented my project and some paths I was considering, and GPT-5 took it all in and gave back a few recommendations along with a realistic timeline,” the developer explains. “I'm impressed.”

A handful of OpenAI's enterprise partners and customers, including Cursor, Windsurf, and Notion, have publicly vouched for GPT-5's coding and reasoning skills. (OpenAI included many of these remarks in its own blog post announcing the new model.) Notion also shared on X that it's “fast, thorough, and handles complex work 15 percent better than other models we've tested.”

But within days of GPT-5's release, some developers were weighing in online with complaints. Many said that GPT-5's coding abilities seemed behind the curve for what was supposed to be a state-of-the-art, ultra-capable model from the world's buzziest AI company.

“OpenAI's GPT-5 is very good, but it seems like something that would have been released a year ago,” says Kieran Klassen, a developer who has been building an AI assistant for email inboxes. “Its coding capabilities remind me of Sonnet 3.5,” he adds, referring to an Anthropic model that launched in June 2024.

Amir Salihefendić, founder of the startup company Doist, said in a social media post that he's been using GPT-5 in Cursor and has found it “pretty underwhelming” and that “it's especially bad at coding.” He said the release of GPT-4 felt like a “Llama 4 moment,” referring to Meta's AI model, which had also disappointed some people in the AI community.

On X, developer Mckay Wrigley wrote that GPT-5 is a “phenomenal everyday chat model,” but when it comes to coding, “I will still be using Claude Code + Opus.”

Other developers describe GPT-5 as “exhaustive”—at times helpful, but often irritating in its long-windedness. Wang, who was pleased overall with the frontend coding project she assigned to GPT-5, says that she did notice that the model was “more redundant. It clearly could have come up with a cleaner or shorter solution.” (Kapoor points out that the verbosity of GPT-5 can be adjusted, so that users can ask it to be less chatty or even do less reasoning in exchange for better performance or cheaper pricing.)

Itamar Friedman, the cofounder and CEO of the AI-coding platform Qodo, believes that some of the critiques of GPT-5 stem from evolving expectations around AI model releases. “I think a lot of people thought that GPT-5 would be another moment when everything about AI improved, because of this march towards AGI. When actually, the model improved on a few key sub-tasks,” he says.

Friedman refers to before 2022 as “BCE”—Before ChatGPT Era—when AI models improved holistically. In the post-ChatGPT era, new AI models are often better at certain things. “Claude Sonnet 3.5, for example, was the one model to rule them all on coding. And Google Gemini got really good at code review, to check if code is high quality,” Friedman says.

OpenAI has also gotten some heat for the methodology it used to run its benchmark tests and make performance claims about GPT-5—although benchmark tests vary considerably across the industry. SemiAnalysis, a research firm focused on the semiconductor and AI sector, noted that OpenAI only ran 477 out of the 500 tests that are typically included in SWE-bench, a relatively new AI industry framework for testing large language models. (This was for overall performance of the model, not just coding.)

OpenAI says that it always tests its AI models on a fixed subset of 477 tasks rather than the full 500 in the SWE-bench test, because those 477 tests are the ones the company has validated on its internal infrastructure. McCallum also pointed to GPT-5's system card, which noted that changes in the model's verbosity setting can “lead to variation in eval performance.”

Kapoor says that frontier AI companies are ultimately facing difficult trade-offs. “When model developers train new models, they're introducing new constraints, too, and have to consider many factors: how users expect the AI to behave and how it performs at certain tasks like agentic coding, all while managing the cost,” he says. “In some sense, I believe OpenAI knew it wouldn't break all of those benchmarks, so it made something that would generally please a wide range of people.”

Michael Calore: Hey, this is Mike. Before we start, I want to share some exciting news with you. We're doing a live show in San Francisco on September 9th in partnership with the local station KQED. Lauren and I will sit down with our editor in chief, Katie Drummond, and we'll have a special guest joining us for a conversation that you will not want to miss. You can use the link in the show notes to grab your ticket and invite a friend. We cannot wait to see you there.

Hey, Lauren. How are you doing?

Lauren Goode: I'm pretty good, Mike. I'm a little tired because we just published a big story I've been working on for a long time.

Michael Calore: Oh. Do tell us.

Lauren Goode: Well, now that you've asked, we have a series here at WIRED called The Big Interview. Every so often we get to interview the most interesting people in tech and beyond. And we do this very long Q&A, a lot of research goes into it, original photography. It's a really cool series. And the most recent one I interviewed Lisa Su, the Chair and CEO of AMD.

Michael Calore: Lisa Su from AMD?

Lauren Goode: That's correct.

Michael Calore: Nice.

Lauren Goode: Yeah.

Michael Calore: Did you fly to Texas?

Lauren Goode: Austin, Texas. I was there to spend some time with Lisa Su and tour the labs, their chip testing labs down there. And it was a fascinating conversation. She's a super smart lady, and she has managed a pretty remarkable turnaround of AMD over the past dozen years.

Michael Calore: Nice.

Lauren Goode: So, we talked a lot about that, we talked about export controls. We talked about competing with Nvidia, run by her cousin. Did you know that Jensen Huang and Lisa Su are distant cousins?

Michael Calore: No.

Lauren Goode: You really didn't know that?

Michael Calore: No.

Lauren Goode: Yes, distant. First cousins, once removed. But she prefers not to be. Always asked about him, constantly pitted against him. The cousin thing irritates her.

Michael Calore: Right, right.

Lauren Goode: Of course, we talked about Nvidia. Anyway, I spent some time in the labs with her, because she's an engineer by trade. She was asking some highly technical questions of her engineers. It was really fascinating to witness.

Michael Calore: Nice.

Lauren Goode: We took a car ride together, we talked about personal stuff. It was one of my favorite interviews I've ever done at WIRED. So, that's out today.

Michael Calore: Everybody should read it.

Lauren Goode: Thank you.

Michael Calore: And I'm assuming that you conducted this interview before the deal with the US government.

Lauren Goode: The 15 percent fee that Nvidia and AMD are now going to be paying to the US government?

Michael Calore: That would be the one.

Lauren Goode: Yes. I did that interview beforehand. News has constantly been breaking in the semiconductor space since then. So we keep going back to Sandra, one of our editors and saying, ""Should we update this? Do we need to update this? You can't keep up.""

Michael Calore: Yeah, that's the news business.

Lauren Goode: Yep.

Michael Calore: Sometimes you just got to say, ""Ship it.""

Lauren Goode: That's right. Ship it. I'm sure all the techies listening to this will appreciate that. Let's ship this show.

Michael Calore: Let's ship this show.

This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power and influence of Silicon Valley. Today, we are talking about Palantir, a controversial software company with an ever-growing list of government contracts. The company has received a lot of attention this year because of its close ties with the Trump administration. Palantir's US government revenue has grown by more than $370 million compared to this time last year. But alongside its rising revenue and its rising profile, the company has also received widespread backlash because of its roster of clients, which includes ICE, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli government.

One question that has become hard to answer is what exactly the company does. We know Palantir works with vast amounts of data, but it's not clear what they do with it. WIRED's Caroline Haskins went looking for answers, and she found that even former Palantir employees had trouble closely defining the company's services.

So we're going to dive into what Palantir does, what it does not do, and how its cofounders dreams of a techno state, continue to shape the company's goals, and potentially, our future. I'm Michael Calore, Director of Consumer Tech and Culture.

Lauren Goode: And I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior correspondent.

Michael Calore: To break down what Palantir is all about, we had to invite Caroline Haskins onto the show. Caroline is a staff writer at WIRED's Business Desk who has been closely covering the company for years. Welcome to Uncanny Valley. Caroline.

Caroline Haskins: Hi. Thanks for having me on.

Lauren Goode: Caroline, we're so excited to have you on. And can we give Caroline just a little bit of cred? Which we're going to get to later in the show, but everyone should know to start that Caroline I think is the only one among us who's been kicked out of a Palantir event before. So we're going to have to ask you about that, just in FYI.

Michael Calore: Yeah, we'll get to that later.

Caroline Haskins: Yeah, happy to share it.

Michael Calore: So, I want to start with defining what Palantir isn't. Caroline, what are some of the common misconceptions that you've encountered around the company services?

Caroline Haskins: Yeah. It's funny, because it seems like Palantir is kind of having a growing reputation among the public. People know the company Palantir, but they still, just among the general public, have a hard time saying what it actually is. It's often used as kind of a shorthand for just talking about surveillance generally. There are people who think that it's more akin to something like a data broker that's buying and selling data from place to place. Or a data miner that's actively taking information offline and packaging it and selling it in some way.

I mean, it actually isn't any of these things, but the misconceptions have been pretty widespread. Palantir has actually had to put out a couple of blogs. I think the titles are literally Palantir Is Not a Data Company, Palantir Is Still Not a Data Company. I think it's a seven-part series on its website. But there's a reason that these misconceptions exist, it's because it's hard to define what Palantir actually is.

Lauren Goode: OK. So, Palantir is not buying or selling data, or I guess harboring data in giant databases, but they still work with a lot of data. They sell their services to help other companies gather up a lot of data

and structure it. Is that correct?

Caroline Haskins: Correct. Palantir does not actually sell any data, but it is providing just the infrastructure and tools that its customers can use to actually work with data. Over the 2010s, I'm sure everybody remembers there was all of this marketing around big data, leveraging your data. And all of these companies were trying to just say how they were really smart.

Lauren Goode: Yeah, it was all very nebulous.

Caroline Haskins: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Palantir was founded in the early 2000s, in the couple of years after 9/11, but it's business really didn't start taking off until that decade, and I think that in part that's because it was able to meet the moment, because it sells essentially like a one-size tool that can be customized for different customers, that can replace, say, a dozen or more other tools that a company might buy to try and get better insights, manage its factory lines better, manage orders better, make smarter decisions.

Michael Calore: Yeah. In your story, you got all kinds of descriptions from your sources who used to work at Palantir about what the company does. One of them called it a really extravagant plumbing with data. Another called it a collection of different applications that customers can use to operationalize data, which is a fantastic word to have in a quote.

Lauren Goode: I mean, that literally sounds like the AI from LinkedIn was let loose.

Michael Calore: My favorite is the source who called it a supercharged filing cabinet. But there are specific things that Palantir sells, right? And I think if we can go through some of those, we might be able to get a better idea of what they do.

Caroline Haskins: So, Palantir has a couple of different products, but its two main flagship products are these things called Foundry on one hand, and then Gotham on the other. So Foundry is more oriented toward private enterprise corporations, that type of customer. So think like Walmart or something. And then the other one is Gotham, that's more oriented toward law enforcement, government agencies, places that are actually dealing with case information, things about actual people, trying to figure out relationships between people, that kind of work.

On the other hand, Foundry is more being used to just make regular everyday business practices more efficient. So, whereas a customer might use Foundry to, say, instead of having to completely redo their IT systems because their company is like 60 years old and they have a combination of really old code and then really new software, and they can't figure out how to just make it all flow together, they don't actually have to go in and fix it. Foundry just sits on top of everything and allows them to get the insights that they need to without actually fixing any of the stuff that's going on underneath. It's like a technical bandaid in that sense.

And then Gotham, similarly, it is sitting on top of systems that law enforcement and a government agency might already have. The difference is that it's working with case information, it might work through information from a social media company. So, if a police department asks for everything associated with someone's Facebook profile, it would ingest all of that. And the whole idea is that you can map the relationships between people.

So, police departments have used this to try and map out alleged gang affiliations. They can also extract things like whether someone has a tattoo, which is information that police might have if they have a booking record on somebody, whether they have to note things like whether somebody has a tattoo. Gotham is not actually providing any of this information, it's just helping police work through the information that they already have.

Lauren Goode: So, it's easy to see where some of the concerns come in around data collection then, because even if Palantir isn't selling new data, or aggregate data to another enterprise or something like that, it's still aggregating and transforming all of this data, and putting it into this powerful tool. And then, there's the specific government contracts. Caroline, you reported earlier this year for WIRED that ICE is paying Palantir $30 million to help the agency select who to deport and to track who was self-deporting. Around the same time, our colleague McKenna Kelly reported that Palantir was working with the IRS to build what sources called a Mega API, which would essentially unify all data across the agency.

And then of course, there are military contracts. A lot of the contracts that Palantir works with, there is an expectation of confidentiality going in, which is I think where some of this vibe of mystery and secrecy comes from. And I think it's because a lot of these products are then deployed at a large scale, people start to grow concerned when they just think about there's this entity out there that is just sort of helping to gather all of this data into one space. And it seems like Palantir hasn't always wanted to engage with some of these criticisms, or answer questions about this. Caroline, you had firsthand experience with this.

Caroline Haskins: Yeah. There was a conference that was being held in D.C. by the Special Competitive Studies Project, the SCSP, it's the think tank that was founded by Eric Schmidt who, obviously, used to be at Google. They have a ton of booths from all these different companies. And the whole idea is that you walk around and then you sit at one booth and you watch someone do a demo of some kind of software, and then you move on to the next one, and you talk to employees, that kind of thing. And I was watching a couple demos at the Palantir booth, and I wasn't even asking any questions, I was just taking some notes. And then I think at one point I walked to a different booth and then I turned around and went to come back, and then they said that I was not allowed back in the booth, and that if I did come back they would call the police. And I was like, ""Wait, why?"" And they didn't give me a reason. They also didn't give me one when I asked for comments.

Lauren Goode: OK. Did you go back?

Caroline Haskins: No. I think I walked out of the booth and I immediately called one of my editors, and yeah, she was just like, ""Let's just not do that for now. It's OK.""

Lauren Goode: Wow. They really took it to 11.

Caroline Haskins: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I talked to event security and I was like, ""Was there a rule I wasn't aware of? I mean, I don't see how I could have been breaking any rules."" ""Or did they flag something about certain participants?"" And event security, I mean, they had no idea what I was talking about. Yeah, I'm not really sure.

Lauren Goode: I'm sorry that happened to you. I mean, it sounds like Palantir was not putting on the event, it was another entity and Palantir was a part of it?

Caroline Haskins: Right, Palantir is one of the main sponsors of the event. So, if you're paying enough money, then you get one of the giant booths at the front of the conference hall. So they had this really fancy setup.

Michael Calore: Wow.

Lauren Goode: Well, Caroline, if they didn't have data on you before, they do now.

Caroline Haskins: Yeah, I think on their radar to some degree, I guess.

Michael Calore: One of the great things about your story is that it helps us really understand the types of services that Palantir actually offers, and what those services look like when they interact with real world. But you had to talk with several former staffers and really dig in to put all these pieces together. So for a company that is so intertwined with all kinds of organizations and public government services, Palantir has to be secretive, and they're notoriously secretive, as we just talked about. What are some of the other reasons why they just don't want people poking around in what they're doing?

Caroline Haskins: It's interesting. I think probably one of the most insightful conversations I had, a former content strategist at Palantir was talking about how at a traditional tech company that might be marketing products to consumers, or maybe like a social media company, they have to make things legible for just the average member of the public, because those are the people that are buying their products. But Palantir, their products are extremely expensive. They're targeting essentially gigantic corporations and bureaucracies that really need help sorting things out and getting the insights that they need.

They don't really need to be talking to consumers in that way. The reason why it's putting out those blogs is that I think it's become a PR problem at this point, that people are making assumptions about the company that are trying to make a criticism, but aren't really putting their finger on what the company is actually doing. So in that sense, it's become a PR problem for them. But to a degree, they don't have to market to the average person. And it does kind of benefit them to cultivate this aura of mystique and power. Like, what we are doing is so important that the public can't know, maybe, exactly the extent of our products.

And this is something that appeals to, I mean, if you are a high up person at the company and you know that you need to get some sort of product, let's say you're not super technical, this is exactly the kind of rhetoric, visuals, et cetera, that might appeal to someone.

Lauren Goode: It seems like secrecy is also embedded in the origins of the company. One of its early investors was in QTEL, which is the CIA's venture capital arm. And two of Palantir's cofounders are pretty well-known. Peter Thiel, we've talked about a few times on this show, and Alex Karp, seem like they have intentionally wanted to position the company as a government and military partner, which, like we said earlier, inevitably comes with some secrecy.

Michael Calore: We need to take a break now, but when we come back, we're going to dive further into those founders that you just talked about, Lauren, and we're going to break down how their vision of a techno state has shaped the company, and what it can mean for our collective future.

Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. Before the break, WIRED's Caroline Haskins was telling us all about Palantir services, and how the company actually works with data and the software that it sells to organizations. But it's through looking at two of Palantir's cofounders, particularly Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, that the company's identity starts to come into sharper focus.

Peter Thiel almost needs no introduction. We've talked about him on the show before. And besides being one of the cofounders of Palantir, he used to be part of the so-called PayPal Mafia, and has gathered widespread attention for his support of the current administration and other GOP candidates. Alex Karp is the current CEO of Palantir, and he co-founded the company alongside Thiel and a few other people in 2003. So from the start, what vision did they set up for the company?

Caroline Haskins: I feel like maybe a useful way into that is to talk about some of the internal jargon that Palantir uses. I mean, even just externally, the name Palantir actually comes from Lord of the Rings. It's this idea of an all-seeing stone that can look across vast expanses of land in the present, or go into the past. So the whole idea of that is to provide a product to that is seemingly extremely powerful and can go wherever you would need it to go. But then I guess internally, I think employees have really adopted this attitude that they are solving the world's most difficult problems and making the world a better place.

So, they've kept with the Lord of the Rings language, even just talking amongst each other. Employees call themselves internally, since really the early days of the company, they've called each other hobbits. To the best of my knowledge. I'm not sure how popular this phrase is these days, but a motto that was circulated internally was Save the Shire. So it does get back to this idea of, we're trying to save the world, we're trying to make the world a better place, we're trying to catch terrorists. We're trying to do these really difficult things that make the world a better place-

Lauren Goode: And the Shire in this case is what? It's these Western ideals and all-powerful government. Is it our country? What's the Shire?

Caroline Haskins: I mean, in one sense, you could understand the Shire as the United States and all of its allies. The term that Alex Karp uses most frequently is the West, or western values. A big thing that the company has tried to stand on is, ""We're only going to be doing business with companies that are in the United States or allied with the United States in some sense, militarily."" It does get to this idea of security and being aligned with the US military interests.

A military mindset has also been something that's pervaded the internal culture at Palantir since the very beginning. Instead of calling people just like software engineers, they call them forward deployed engineers. So, by forward deployed, they're essentially referencing the term for forward deployed troops, which is when in the military use station troops that are somewhere near an adversarial region with the idea being that's going to deter them from making a move against you. They've also used NATO military radio terms as code names for different job titles, like Delta was the one that was associated with fraud deployed engineers. And then they also have a version of a product manager, which instead they call Echo. Those are the words for D and E on the NATO military radio code name list.

Another example, something that someone else brought up to me was when they're writing emails to each other, instead of saying FYI, they go FYSA, which means, for your situational awareness. And that's another thing that originated in the military.

Lauren Goode: So intense in these San Francisco or Palo Alto offices. They're like, ""FYSA, the bevy machine is out of the mint cucumber flavor today.""

Caroline Haskins: No, exactly, exactly. There's so many examples of this. What was another one? Yeah, ""Bottom line up front,"" that was another one that someone mentioned, it just means you write a two-sentence summary at the start of an email. So instead of saying TLDR, you go BLUF and then give a two-sentence summary.

Lauren Goode: Bottom line up front.

Michael Calore: I'm going to start doing all of these.

Lauren Goode: I could see your eyes light up when Caroline was going through. This is really interesting.

Michael Calore: ""For your situational awareness, I will be at the dentist today.""

Lauren Goode: Caroline, when you spoke to these former employees about working there, how did they feel about this culture?

Caroline Haskins: They didn't really seem critical of the use of these terms from the most part, but there were people that I spoke with that just felt uncomfortable with military work that was happening in other parts of the company. There was one woman I spoke with who specifically brought this up, and how she essentially had to actively choose to suppress the knowledge of the fact that there were probably products that were being built at other parts of the company that she would be extremely morally opposed to.

But on the other hand, I think there were other people I spoke to who just had a functional appreciation for these little habits, like the bottom line up front thing or the FYSA. This didn't make it into the article, but one person said, ""I've gone on to other workplaces and I've actively introduced some of these things into my other workplaces."" So, some people just have a functional appreciation for, I don't know, I guess that kind of communication style. It's funny.

Lauren Goode: That's interesting. And some of this rhetoric has actually made its way into executive communications too. Our producer pulled up a clip from Alex Karp speaking during Palantir's earnings call this past February. And there were a couple lines that really jumped out at me, so we're going to take a quick listen.

Alex Karp: We have dedicated our company to the service of the West and the United States of America, and we're super proud of the role we play, especially in places we can't talk about. And we love our success in the US, and globally also, we are doing, in the United Kingdom and many other places, Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world. And when it's necessary to scare enemies, and on occasion kill them.

Lauren Goode: Oh, just killed it. So, is he referring to killing business competitors? Are the enemies business competitors? Or is he talking about actual adversaries to the United States?

Caroline Haskins: That's the funny thing with that clip, because he used the word disrupt, which obviously disruption is a common thing that people just mentioned in a Silicon Valley business context.

Lauren Goode: Right. Very Silicon Valley coded.

Caroline Haskins: Right. But then when he talks about killing. I mean, everybody knows that some of Palantir's first clients were members of the US intelligence community, in that it does work across branches of the US military. And these are products that are designed to be lethal. So these are things that are literally talking about killing people, but there's plausible deniability in terms of talking about killing your business competitors or something, or killing the competition. It's just the interesting use of boards.

Michael Calore: So, it's obvious that Palantir is eager to embrace this close tie with government work and military work, but this is also part of a larger belief that not only should this be Palantir's mission, but also Silicon Valley's larger mission. To that point, Karp wrote a book recently called The Technological Republic. And in this book he laid out the philosophy of technology being created in service of a state, so a techno state. He kind of reminisces about the times when technology and science and governments all came together to defeat a common enemy instead of, ""Building things because they can,"" which is serious shade at, I don't know, a company that makes food delivery apps. He calls for a renewed unity around this mindset of the techno state. What are your thoughts on Karp's philosophy here?

Lauren Goode: I haven't read Alex Karp's book yet. I would like to. I did read the excerpt in The Atlantic. I think what's kind of interesting about both Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, even though sometimes their politics aren't entirely aligned, they both coalesce around this shared vision of the techno state and powering the West to what they call its obvious innate superiority. And they're not alone. There is a group of really influential people in Silicon Valley, this cohort who I sometimes call the War Bois, B-O-I, bois.

Michael Calore: I love the name.

Lauren Goode: Yeah. And I think that they are shifting the culture a little bit, and having people focus less on the attention economy software and the social media that got a lot of the attention in 2010s, and saying to people like, ""You need to build more serious tech here."" And some of that happens to be tech for the military. We've also written about Palmer Luckey at WIRED who is a cofounder of Anduril. Anduril is a defense tech company that makes autonomous weapons. He's a part of this cohort as well. Earlier this summer, a bunch of tech CTOs and other executives joined this detachment that's supposed to help make the US armed forces leaner, smarter, more lethal, basically provide tech advice to the military. So for example, Meta CTO, Andrew Bosworth, is now Lieutenant Colonel Bosworth, or Bos.

Michael Calore: Oh, boy.

Caroline Haskins: Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, some people have pointed out that in some ways it's kind of a return to roots for Silicon Valley, because I mean, in the 20th century it was kind of a place where defense infrastructure was built out. And then it sort of pivoted away from that. I mean, I guess one thing that's maybe worth pointing out about someone like Alex Karp is that for the entirety of the time that Palantir has been around, he's been extremely ideologically consistent. I mean, even through the 2010s when, I mean, no companies were openly embracing working with the military, or doing work in defense tech, which is partially why Anduril, Palantir, they just sort of stood in contrast with a lot of these other companies. But now I think with Trump in office and there just being all of this rhetoric that's centered around patriotism, that's centered around these ideas of strength, especially in the context of war, it's suddenly become, I guess, business-friendly to be embracing these kinds of ideas.

Michael Calore: It seems like the time is now for this vision of the techno state that Karp and Thiel have been laying out. So, are we seeing it play out in real time?

Lauren Goode: Well, judging by Palantir's current valuation, we might've entered the techno state. It has been pushing into record territory just over the past week since Palantir went public in 2020, their stock has gone up nearly 2500 percent.

Michael Calore: Excuse me?

Lauren Goode: Yeah. That's just in terms of the numbers though. I'm curious to hear from a cultural perspective, Caroline, what do you think?

Caroline Haskins: Yeah. One thing when I think about Peter Thiel and the companies that he's been involved with and the ventures that he's funded, there often isn't a completely consistent through line. I mean, one thing I've been following on the side is the amount of so-called network state projects that he's funded, or essentially trying to make these almost city state like areas that people who work in tech that feel frustrated with working on software that doesn't have visible effects on the real world can just go to and escape the United States, or escape the political friction of a place like Silicon Valley.

But then in contrast, I mean, someone like Alex Karp, he's really never doubted the concept of the network state, and having that as a grounding force for your political philosophy and your business philosophy. And I guess the one thing uniting them in the end is this desire for strength for monopoly, I guess, in the business context, and for hegemony in the context of politics and wars between countries.

Michael Calore: OK. We're going to take one more break, and then we'll come right back.

Lauren, Caroline, thank you for a great conversation about the techno state. Before we go, we want to shift gears a little bit and we're going to share our personal recommendations with the listeners. So, should we have Caroline go first?

Lauren Goode: Absolutely. As our guest of honor.

Michael Calore: OK. What do you got?

Caroline Haskins: I stumbled upon this show recently called The Secret Life of 4, 5 and 6 Year Olds. It's this UK reality TV show where they essentially put mics and cameras on a playground around, again, these four, five, and six-year-olds who, I mean, the four-year-olds, they've never even interacted with other peers their age essentially unsupervised before. And you're seeing literal stages of brain development happening in real time. Like a kid realizing that, ""Oh, if I'm fighting over this toy, that means that this other person wants it too, and we might have to work out a compromise.""

I landed there because I went on a TikTok rabbit hole that started with a New York City public school teacher showing how they set up their classroom, and then a kindergarten teacher setting up their classroom. And then I was like, ""Wait, I forget what happens in kindergarten."" So then I was looking up, ""What do you do in kindergarten?"" And then this show came up. And it was so interesting. And obviously, really funny and cute. Even if you're not a huge kid's person, I don't know, I just thought it was really interesting.

Michael Calore: Talk about a techno state. Let's put cameras on all the kids.

Lauren Goode: Seriously.

Michael Calore: When broadcast their brain development.

Lauren Goode: Has Palantir sold their software to nursery schools yet?

Michael Calore: Sorry, where is this show streaming?

Caroline Haskins: It was on Amazon Prime, and then I also think someone uploaded the whole thing onto YouTube. So, either way you can find it.

Lauren Goode: OK.

Michael Calore: Fantastic.

Lauren Goode: I like how Caroline's like, ""Even if you're not a kid's person, you might still enjoy this.""

Michael Calore: She's speaking to her audience, which is-

Lauren Goode: No, I like this.

Caroline Haskins: I want to capture all ends of the spectrum.

Lauren Goode: That's right. That's right. It also sounds like a nice little palate cleanser after reporting on some of the stuff you've been reporting on, Caroline.

Caroline Haskins: Honestly, it was. Yeah, yeah. The kids are really funny.

Michael Calore: Lauren, what's your recommendation?

Lauren Goode: My recommendation is TV series on HBO Max, The Young Pope, which I started watching because I want to watch The New Pope with John Malkovich, but I figured I should watch The Young Pope with Jude Law first.

Michael Calore: Yeah, yeah.

Lauren Goode: So it's not new. I think it came out in 2019.

Michael Calore: Yeah.

Lauren Goode: Jude Law is absolutely diabolical as a Pope. I've recommended a lot of Pope stuff on this show before. My longtime listeners will know.

Michael Calore: It's those Catholic roots coming out.

Lauren Goode: Yeah, I guess so. You can take a girl out of church, but can't take church out of the girl. Is that even a phrase?

Michael Calore: Yes.

Lauren Goode: Did I just make that up?

Michael Calore: No, but you translated into English from the original Italian, I think is what it is.

Lauren Goode: Yeah. Mike, what's your recommendation?

Michael Calore: I am going to recommend a newsletter. It is from one of our competitors, New York Magazine. It's a subscriber-

Lauren Goode: Never heard of them.

Michael Calore: They're great. They do good work. It's a subscriber only newsletter from New York. It's called Night School. And it is people who work at New York Magazine and some of the people who are contracted to work with them explaining how they do their jobs, and how you can apply this knowledge into your hobbies or your own jobs.

So for example, they have a newsletter about how to take a photo. And it comes out every week, and it's written by the photo editors and the photographers at New York Magazine. They have one about how to write, which is written by the writers and the editors. Again, that one comes out every week. And then there was one that Jerry Saltz, the art critic, just did, how to look at art. And he basically tells you how to go to a gallery, how to experience a museum, what do you do when you go to an artist talk, what are good questions to ask, what sorts of things you look forward to determine whether something is actually good.

The photo one really blew my mind though, like how to take a photo. I take a lot of photos, I think I take a pretty good photo, but I read a few of these newsletters and immediately was able to up my game. And I take better portraits now, for sure.

Lauren Goode: That's very cool.

Michael Calore: Yeah. So, if you are a subscriber to New York Magazine, you can go into their newsletter page, and you can click subscribe to these, and you get these courses, and they come once a week, and they're very digestible and fun. And you will learn something.

Lauren Goode: I actually am a subscriber, and I have not subscribed to that.

Michael Calore: Well, here you go.

Lauren Goode: I'll do that right now.

Michael Calore: This is a benefit that you are not yet earning.

Lauren Goode: Amazing.

Michael Calore: I hope you love it.

Lauren Goode: Thanks for that recommendation, Mike.

Michael Calore: And Caroline, thank you for being here, and thank you for your recommendation about the Watching Kids Grow Up Show.

Caroline Haskins: No, thank you. And I really need to learn how to take a better picture. I feel like people stop me on the street and they're like, ""Can you take a picture of me and my friend?"" I have to apologize to them at the end. I'm like, ""I did the best I could. I'm sorry.""

From the golf course to the kitchen, we're back with another fun spotlight on up-and-coming startups out of the Seattle area. 

This batch includes companies building a backend service for AI agents; a recipe, cooking, and meal-planning app; a platform for golfers; and a new way to shop for clothes online.   

A big thanks to Jessica Kamada, managing partner at Swizzle Ventures, for providing the “VC View” for this Startup Radar.

And this time, I'm also getting in on the fun with “Taylor's Take” — my quick thoughts on each company are below. 

Check out past startup radar spotlights here and email me at taylor@geekwire.com to flag other companies and startup news. 

Deglaze

Founded: 2022

The business: Recipe apps aren't new, but AI is changing the game. That's the bet from Deglaze, which helps users organize recipes they collect from social media, cookbooks, websites, and more. It also taps into AI to provide guidance for meal plans, shopping, and cooking. The company has raised a small investment round.

Leadership: Jacob Edelstein was CTO at Seattle fintech startup Copper Banking, and was vice president of engineering at Curalate. He also spent seven years at Microsoft. His co-founder Angel Azcarraga was CTO at Spotahome and held engineering leadership roles at Amazon and Microsoft. 

VC View from Jessica Kamada: “Deglaze is for the cooking/baking enthusiast who finds joy in the kitchen, but wants to make it as efficient as possible. Deglaze differentiates itself from other ‘meal planning/cooking' apps in the productivity category like Ollie by leaning more heavily into the emerging category of niche interest communities (i.e. Auggie) with surprise & delight consumer features like ‘cook mode' and a community feel where users can follow their favorite chefs. As a freemium app, the monetization at scale is a concern, but if they can monetize their cooking creator community of chefs, they may be on to something.”

Taylor's Take: I can see this being beneficial for a wide range of users — from those who just want to organize grocery lists and meal plans, to more experienced cooks who love following recipes. I've been using ChatGPT to help guide me when I cook — but would Deglaze be better? The app seems ripe for various revenue models, and this is an experienced founding team.

GolfGuiders

Founded: 2021

The business: A central hub for all things golf — social networking, golf course discovery, tee times, e-commerce, AI-powered assistance, and more. The company just launched its app and has a handful of revenue-generation ideas — including affiliate programs, trip planning, white-labeling, and more. It has raised $500,000.

Leadership: Founder Richard Hussain is a longtime technologist who previously founded a healthcare startup. He was also a solutions architect at IT services company Denali.

VC View from Jessica Kamada: “The golf industry exploded during COVID, as one of the few safe activities available. A new generation and diverse population was introduced to the game. With multiple new apparel brands (Malbon, Eastside Golf) making golf cool again, the modern golfer may be open to technology that supports their new hobby. The question is if GolfGuiders can grow the community large enough to evolve from a free app to a premium must-have golf companion.”

Taylor's Take: I'm a big-time golfer, so this one caught my attention. But I'm not sure what would make me stick around on the app, or get me opening it on a daily basis. Perhaps some gamification feature? There's also stiff competition from existing golf apps such as 18Birdies. I do like the idea of more specialized media and community networks that focus on a topic.

Insforge

Founded: 2025

The business: A back-end platform for AI coding agents. Insforge provides authentication, databases, storage, functions, real-time updates, and more — all optimized for AI agents rather than human developers. Users can create backend systems with prompts. The company generates revenue off subscriptions and has raised $1.5 million to date. 

Leadership: CEO Hang Huang was a senior product manager at Amazon and earned his MBA from Yale last year. CTO Tony Chang was a software developer at Databricks. 

VC View from Jessica Kamada: “After foundational Gen AI models, Agentic AI is the next wave. As a consumer investor, I'm investing in companies that would be customers of Insforge. Our portfolio is building for a world where agentic APIs will interact with each other to complete a task on a consumers' behalf. Agentic infrastructure like Insforge will be paramount to teams reaching that future faster.”

Taylor's Take: This one combines a bunch of hot trends — AI agents, virtual coders, natural language commands, infrastructure, etc. If the current direction doesn't pan out well, feels like the company could pivot quickly given the nature of the product. Also loved the website — slick and simple. 

So-Me.ai

Founded: 2025

The business: Personal shopping agent that learns the unique style, preferences, and behavior of a user. The software aims to turn tedious scrolling into a visual-first curated experience. The company is bootstrapped and is working with a small group of private beta testers. 

Leadership: Founder Zeynab Raeesy spent more than seven years at Amazon in applied science roles. She also worked at Nuance Communications and VoiceBox Technologies as a research engineer and speech scientist.

VC View from Jessica Kamada: “Consumer AI is in its ‘Fun' era, and fashion/commerce enablement is having a moment. There is an obvious market opportunity in fashion search and shopping agents, as new fashion brands come online constantly, making consumers heads spin. However, new players are entering the market quickly with big investment behind them such as Daydream and Doji. The pie is likely big enough for multiple players. If So-Me can differentiate on agents that truly learn shopper personal taste, they can carve out a slice!”

Taylor's Take: Shopping for clothes online could really use a refresh, and perhaps AI will shake things up. I'm curious about the business model and whether this could be used as a white-label solution for online shops. If things go well, this could be ripe for an acquisition by a larger retailer wanting to offer customers a more personalized experience.

Rental car startup Kyte has shut down nearly one year after slashing staff and exiting most of its cities in the United States. The company sold its customer list to Turo in July and then turned right around and entered into a form of receivership in California, according to a notice that went out to Kyte creditors.

Kyte fell behind on some of its loans earlier this year, according to the notice. That caused the company's top lender to repossess and liquidate Kyte's vehicle fleet. 

Kyte's board of directors “pursued various capital solutions” to keep the company alive, the notice states. But the company wasn't able to line up financing and the board voted to wind down Kyte. 

While Kyte passed its customer list to Turo, a number of users who had prebooked trips before the shutdown have complained that they're stuck waiting on refunds for hundreds of dollars.

Some who spoke to TechCrunch said they were able to get their credit card companies to perform a charge-back, while others have had no luck. Kyte CEO Nikolaus Volk told TechCrunch in a message that charge-backs may be the quickest way for customers to get that money back.

Founded in 2019, Kyte provided on-demand rental cars that it also delivered directly to customers' homes. It controlled its own fleet of vehicles, making it a bit more like Zipcar and less like the peer-to-peer offerings of players like Turo. Kyte grew to 14 markets and raised more than $300 million in financing over its lifetime, and started billing itself as the “best competitor to Hertz.”

The business started coming apart in 2024, Volk told TechCrunch last year. Kyte was struggling to generate free cash flow in markets like Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, D.C. Volk said his team explored selling the business but decided to restructure and focus on reaching profit in the two biggest markets of San Francisco and New York City.

Kyte's not the only startup in this sector to run into trouble — especially in the United States. Getaround, another peer-to-peer vehicle rental service, shuttered its U.S. operations in February of this year to focus on its European business. TrueCar founder Scott Painter pivoted away from vehicle subscriptions in 2024 after struggling to build up a business called Autonomy.

It's not super complex, in fact that seems to be the only way to get a more or less reliable agent right now. Keep the graph small, the prompts concise, the nodes and tools atomic in function, etc.* Orchestrator choice and why: LangGraph because it seems the most robust and well established from my research at the time (about 6 months ago). It has decent documentation, and includes community-built graphs and nodes. People complain a lot about LangChain, but the general vibe around LangGraph is that it's a maturely designed framework.* State and checkpointing: I'm using a memory checkpointer after every state change. Why? Reports can just re-run at negligible cost. For chats, my users' requirements just don't need persistent thread storage. Persistence is better managed through RAG entries.* Concurrency control: I don't use parallel tool calling for most of my agents because it adds too much instability to graph execution. This is actually fine for chatbots and my app's reporting system (which doesn't need many tools), but I can see this being an issue for more complex agents.* Autoscaling and cost: Well I use foundation models, not local ones. I swap out models for various tasks and customer subscription levels (e.g., gpt-5-nano with low reasoning effort for trial users, and gpt-5-mini for paying customers).* Memory and retrieval: Vector DB for RAG tooling, normal DB for everything else. Sometimes I use the same Postgres database for both vector and normal data, to simplify architecture. I load raw contextual data into prompts (JSON dump). In my app's case, I use a 30-day rolling window of store data so I never keep anything longer than 30 days. I instead keep distilled information as permanent context, which I let the AI control the lifecycle of (create, update, delete).* Observability: The only thing I would use evals for are prompts, but haven't found a good tool for that yet. I use sentiment analysis for chats the AI deems ""interesting"" just to see if people are complaining about something.* Safety and isolation: For reports, I filter out PII before giving data to the AI. For chats, memory checkpointing makes threads ephemeral anyway - and I just add a rate limit + message length limit. The sentiment analysis doesn't include their original messages, only a thematic summary by the AI.* A war story: I spent weeks trying to fine-tune a prompt for the reporting agent, in which one node was tasked with A) analyzing multiple 30-day ecommerce reports, B) generating findings, C) comparing the findings to existing insights and mutating them, and finally: D) creating short and punchy copy for new insights (title, description). I re-wrote it like 100 times, and every time I ran it it would screw up in a new way or a way that occurred 5 revisions ago. Sometimes it would work perfectly, then the next time it ran it would screw up again, with the same data and temperature set to 0.This, honestly, is the main problem with modern AI. My solution was to decompose the node into 4 separate ones that each handle a single task - and they still manage to screw it up quite often. It's much better, but not 100% reliable.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","In a First, Scientists Capture Human Embryo Implantation in Real Time","https://gizmodo.com/in-a-first-scientists-capture-human-embryo-implantation-in-real-time-2000643680","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 18:00:00 GMT","

A team of scientists has just gotten a closer peek into one of the earliest and most fundamental steps of creating a human life. Research out today highlights how they captured—for the first time—footage of human embryo implantation right as it's happening.

Researchers at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), in collaboration with Dexeus University Hospital, detailed their work in a study published Friday in Science Advances. Among other things, the footage shows that human embryos use force to burrow deep into the uterus for implantation. The new method may allow scientists to better understand why embryos so often fail to implant, and someday improve fertility treatment, the researchers say.

“The reason that we want to start studying implantation is because implantation is the main roadblock in human reproduction,” study author Samuel Ojosnegros, lead researcher of IBEC's Bioengineering for Reproductive Health group, told Gizmodo. “But we know very little about it and we know very little because it happens inside the mother.”

New Human-Like Synthetic Embryos Could Uncover Cause of Miscarriages, Scientists Say

Scientists have certainly learned a lot over time about how the human embryo develops. But there have been limitations to this research, Ojosnegros notes. We've only been able to study the first few days of the human embryo in real time, prior to implantation. After that, most research looks at snapshots of embryo development, usually taken of other non-human animals. These animal models are an important tool, but they can only tell us so much about how humans develop in the womb. Implantation is the first step of gestation, and it's only after an embryo embeds into the uterus that a pregnancy is considered to have actually begun.

The team, additionally led by scientists Amélie Godeau and Anna Seriola, created a material that could mimic the outer uterine tissue that an embryo attaches to for implantation. This gel-like matrix is mostly made out of collagen but is also infused with other proteins important to embryo development. With their creation in hand, they were now able to microscopically record how the human embryo implants itself. They also studied mouse embryos for comparison and noticed some important differences.

“The mouse embryo, if you put it on the matrix, stays superficially, spreads out, but will not invade. It will mainly spread out superficially. While the human, if you put it on the surface, it will dig a hole, penetrate, and it will sort of bury itself inside and then start growing,” Ojosnegros explained. “So then the human embryo is stronger, it's bigger, and it's way more invasive.”

There are many more mysteries left to be solved about the process of implantation, including the exact mechanisms that the embryo uses to so aggressively invade the uterus. But the lessons that Ojosnegros and other scientists can learn from this work could help families in the future. The researchers note that only about 30% of embryos (whether from natural birth or in vitro fertilization) make it all the way to being born, and of those that don't, most are lost during implantation or immediately after. So simply being able to see how the process unfolds could provide vital clues on how to prevent miscarriages or otherwise improve fertility.

Simple Drug Combo Could Prevent Repeat Miscarriages, Study Suggests

The researchers plan to continue to study the ins and outs of embryo implantation, but they're also hoping to standardize the materials used for this research so that others can conduct their own similar experiments. Ojosnegros also wants to highlight the contributions of the Dexeus University Hospital and the patients whose donated embryos made this work possible in the first place.

“I think it's good to recognize that without the generosity of the patients who donated the embryos for research, we could not study our own species,” he said.

A new report into the seismic demands of AI data centers on the power grid claims that electricity rates for individuals and small businesses could increase vastly in the face of data center expansion from the likes of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. The New York Times reports that AI data centers could see their demand on the country's electricity could increase to as much as 12% by 2028, up from just 4% a couple of years ago. Furthermore, high-tech giants are building their own power plants, becoming consumers and producers of electricity in a way that is fundamentally reshaping the U.S. electricity market. According to the report, small businesses and households could see their bills go up disproportionately as a result.

According to the report, in 2023, data centers run by such companies as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft accounted for 4% of the nation's electricity use, and federal projections indicate that share could climb to 12% by 2028. Since AI processing is far more energy-intensive than streaming or standard cloud workloads, Amazon's chief executive, Andy Jassy, has openly said that power availability is the main bottleneck limiting new data center capacity.

Significant power demand not only creates unprecedented strain on the grid but is even forcing high-tech giants to generate their own power. For now, they use various renewable energy sources, gas turbines, or diesel generators, but going forward, some even plan to run their own nuclear power plants. Already, some sell surplus energy on the wholesale market. Over the past decade, these sales have totaled $2.7 billion, with most revenue generated since 2022. In some regions, their operations match or surpass the scale of established utilities, allowing them to influence both supply and pricing.

Keep in mind that the power usage of AI data centers is also highly volatile, shifting from peak demand to minimal load in seconds with training workloads as they reach checkpoints. Such swings can destabilize the grid, as even a 10% change in voltage or frequency can damage electronics or trip protection systems. If a major facility, such as a Microsoft Azure installation, suddenly reduces consumption, it can trigger cascading shutdowns across the network. For now, this problem has been solved through dummy workloads, but this does not solve the wider power grid expansion challenges.

However, whether hyperscale CSPs generate their own power or buy it from partners, their power requirements necessitate an expansion of the grid. The question is, who will pay for this expansion? If upgrades cannot keep pace, the result could be blackouts, with industrial customers losing access to limited capacity.

The utilities industry warns that tech firms could reserve far more capacity than they ultimately use, leaving ratepayers to cover the cost of unused infrastructure. For example, Unicorn Interests planned to launch a large data center in Virginia in 2013, but delayed opening for four years. Regulators had approved $42 million in substation and transmission upgrades, much of which went unused during the delay, costing nearby customers millions. While another project later offset part of the expense, the incident illustrates the financial risks of overestimated demand.

In Ohio, American Electric Power (AEP) proposed a separate rate category for data centers and cryptocurrency mines, requiring them to pay for at least 85% of their requested capacity whether used or not. Tech companies countered with a 75% take-or-pay commitment, arguing for flexibility and equal treatment with other large industrial users. However, early this year, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio unanimously backed the utility's proposal. Nonetheless, CSPs have since appealed the decision, calling it both unlawful and unreasonable.

The rapid growth in electricity use from AI data centers is set to push power bills higher for households and small businesses, as utilities invest heavily in expanding the grid. This has prompted consumer advocates and lawmakers to question whether ordinary ratepayers should be footing the bill for corporate growth in the AI sector.

Since 2020, average residential electricity prices across the U.S. have climbed more than 30%, according to NYT. They could rise another 8% nationwide by 2030, a study by Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University estimates. Meanwhile, in states like Virginia, an increase could be up to 25%, NYT claims.

In fact, the impact is already being felt in Ohio, where typical households began paying at least $15 more per month starting in June, a jump linked to the added demand from new data centers, according to the report. There is also an unused 500 MW power substation that belongs to AEP, which was supposed to power Intel's Silicon Heartland campus, whose schedule has been pushed back to the next decade, but which could be pulled in if the U.S. government takes a stake in Intel.

In the end, U.S. consumers could end up paying twice for services like ChatGPT — first for the OpenAI subscription, and again for the power grid that keeps Microsoft Azure's servers running OpenAI's machines behind it.

Specific types of gut bacteria may increase or decrease the risk for insomnia, while insomnia itself may in turn alter the abundance of certain gut bacteria, a new study showed. However, outside experts challenged the investigators' assertion that the link is causal. 

Investigators identified 14 groups of bacteria associated with increased risk for insomnia and eight that were linked to a decreased risk. They also found that having insomnia was linked to reduced levels of seven groups of bacteria and an increase in the amounts of 12 others.

“The study revealed that a total of 41 gut bacterial taxa have causal associations with insomnia,” Shangyun Shi, first author and medical graduate student, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China, told Medscape Medical News. 

“While the impacts of particular bacterial groups on insomnia may vary, there are more important and less important species, which offer the road to potential intervention,” Shi added.

Although the findings are intriguing, outside experts questioned whether the study actually demonstrated a causal relationship. 

The study was published online on August 12 in General Psychiatry. 

Traditional studies have focused on associations between gut microbiota diversity or specific bacterial groups and insomnia but have struggled to establish if these relations are causal, Shi explained. 

To address this issue, investigators used Mendelian randomization analysis for the study, which can strengthen causal inference and identify specific causal bacterial groups.

They conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis based on 386,533 participants in a previously published genome-wide insomnia study and gut microbiota data from 18,340 participants in the MiBioGen Alliance and 8208 individuals in the Dutch Microbiome Project.

Results of the two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis of MiBioGen data suggested that 14 groups of bacteria may increase the risk for insomnia (odds ratio [OR], 1.01-1.04), whereas eight groups were likely to reduce the risks for this sleep disorder (OR, 0.97-0.99). 

ORs from the Dutch dataset were similar. However, after false discovery rate (FDR) correction, the causal association remained significant only for Clostridium innocuum (FDR, .007).

Reverse Mendelian randomization analysis of the gut microbiota datasets was associated with up to a fourfold increase in the abundance of 12 groups of bacteria (OR, 1.65-4.43) and a 43%-79% decrease of seven taxa (OR, 0.21-0.57). 

Additional analyses also revealed significant bidirectional causal relationships between Odoribacter species and insomnia in the Dutch dataset.

There was no evidence of pleiotropy. The use of Mendelian randomization analysis helped to avoid confounding factors and reverse causality, and multiple sensitivity analyses ensured the robustness of the results, the authors noted. 

However, investigators urged caution when generalizing the results to other populations, as study participants were of European descent and the microbiome varies between different ethnicities and geographies. Additionally, two-sample Mendelian randomization does not take into account the impact of environmental factors, such as diet and lifestyle, on insomnia. 

“Our study offers preliminary evidence supporting a causal effect between insomnia and gut microbiota, providing valuable insights for the future development of microbiome-inspired treatment plans for insomnia,” the authors wrote.

Reached for comment, Charlene Gamaldo, MD, sleep specialist and professor of neurology, Johns Hopkins Center for Sleep and Wellness, Columbia, Maryland, said the limitations cited by the authors give her pause. 

“I have a difficult time understanding the authors' interpretation that these findings demonstrate bidirectional causality, or more specifically that gut biome flora causes insomnia,” Gamaldo told Medscape Medical News.

“I do think that the demonstration of an association between the two is interesting, especially since stress can cause gut biome change and stress is associated with insomnia,” she added. 

“So, for me the question is whether these types of associations like stress, environmental triggers, etc, serve as upstream triggers to cause both insomnia and gut biome changes simultaneously or in succession?”

John Saito, MD, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and a pulmonologist at Rady Children's Health, Orange, California, was also skeptical.

“This study offers preliminary evidence supporting a causal effect between insomnia and gut microbiota,” he told Medscape Medical News. “More specifically, changes in the composition of the specific gut microbiota may increase insomnia risk.”

However, the bidirectional causal relationship between specific gut microbiota and insomnia remain unclear, Saito added. 

While there is general recognition that disruption of gut microbiome may have central nervous system consequences, including alteration in sleep health, more research is needed before it would be feasible to diagnose or treat insomnia by focusing on changes in the gut microbiota, he said. 

The authors reported no external funding. Gamaldo and Saito reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

 August 15, 2025  

Gaps in access to prescribed diabetes technology are common, often arise from early device failure, and lead to disruptions in diabetes management, new research found.

The top three reasons for the gaps were delays caused by insurer requirements for prior authorization, problems with suppliers in processing requests for refills, and delays in obtaining updated prescriptions from physicians, according to the survey results, presented by endocrinologist Andrew Welch, DO, at the American Diabetes Association 85th Scientific Sessions.

The access problems were associated with higher A1c levels and lower socioeconomic status and were more common among patients who receive 30-day rather than 90-day prescriptions.

“Almost every single day this theme comes up with patients where they have prescribed diabetes technology supplies, but something happens to interrupt that supply and they're not able to use the system as intended,” said Welch, assistant professor of clinical medicine at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio.

Among the 1969 survey respondents, 42.7% of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) users and 27.3% of insulin pump users reported one or more gaps in their supplies per year, while 12.7% reported access gaps for insulin. Early device failure contributed to the problem, with 42% of CGM users and 47% of insulin pump users reporting early failure of those devices more than 10% of the time.

David T. Ahn, MD, chief of diabetes services at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, Newport Beach, California, told Medscape Medical News that those numbers are “higher than I would have guessed, but I'm not surprised.”

Both Welch and Ahn noted that some patients struggle with technology gaps and product failures more than others.

“There's a group of people who don't report any problems with this, and then there's a group who has so many problems that it can take over the whole clinical picture of that person's diabetes care,” Welch said.

Ahn suggested a few workarounds, such as giving patients free samples or writing prescriptions for longer-lasting quantities of insulin and pump supplies, but that doesn't always work, he noted. For example, it's difficult to prescribe extra quantities of CGM sensors because they're labeled to last a specific number of days, Ahn explained. “With sensors, it's a very challenging task. I personally have not seen it succeed.” 

Handling all the prior authorization requests can also be a challenge in Ahn's practice, which focuses on type 1 diabetes management and has made recent efforts to optimize workflow, he said.

“It's our area of passion. But imagine a general endocrinologist helping people with thyroid and pituitary conditions or a primary care provider managing every condition in the book. It makes perfect sense that prior authorizations are going to be a huge bottleneck for getting these supplies authorized,” he said.

Physicians should be able to individualize diabetes device prescribing, Welch said. “Insurance companies should cover the quantities of diabetes supplies based on published failure rate data, and/or based on physician-prescribed quantities, without hassle, prior authorization, or extra cost,” he said during his ADA presentation.

The online 64-question anonymous survey was distributed in December 2023. Access gaps were defined as the inability to obtain prescribed supplies for diabetes technology for any reason, leading to the individual going without that supply for any duration of time. The survey was sent to about 46,000 email addresses of people in the T1D Exchange, of whom 2475 responded and 506 were excluded.

The respondents had a mean age of 48.8 years, diabetes duration 27.9 years, and mean A1c of 6.6%. Three quarters were female, 78% were college graduates, and only one quarter had annual incomes below $50,000. Two thirds (64%) had private insurance. Nearly all (96%) used CGMs and 80% used insulin pumps.

“This is a very motivated group of people who are engaged with their diabetes,” Welch noted.

While 57% of CGM users reported having no CGM supply access gaps in the past year, 18% reported one gap, 12% two, and 7% three. Of those reporting gaps, the average CGM user reported 2.6 access gaps per year.

Access gaps for CGM were significantly more common among those with lower incomes; those of a minority race/ethnicity; and people on Medicaid or with no insurance vs those with private insurance, Medicare, or Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits, and for females vs males.

Gaps were less common with insulin pump supplies, with 72.7% reporting no gaps in the past year. However, 12.8% reported one gap, 7.2% two, and 2.5% three. Those with gaps reported an average of 2.4 gaps per year. Socioeconomic differences were similar to those seen with CGM access.

While 87.3% of insulin users reported no gaps, 6.2% reported one gap, 3.3% two, and 3.3% three in the past year. The average was 2.2 gaps per year.

“Fortunately, this was a smaller number and frequency, but it's still somewhat discouraging to consider,” Welch said. 

The differences in gaps in all supply types were significant for all socioeconomic groups (P < .05). For example, those on Medicaid had 2.1 annual CGM gaps per year, compared with 0.5 for those receiving VA health benefits.

Asked what they did to avoid access gaps, patients reported calling the company to request replacements if a device fails early, extending use of the supply longer than recommended, and having their health care provider prescribe extra supplies. Some reported obtaining supplies from other people with diabetes who have extras.

Access gaps were related to worse glycemic control. Individuals with A1c levels of 7.0% or less had approximately half as many gaps in access to all diabetes technology supplies and insulin compared to those with an A1c level > 7.0%. For CGM supplies specifically, the difference was 0.8 vs 1.5 gaps per year.

Patients who receive 90-day supplies reported half as many gaps as those who reported receiving 30-day supplies. With CGM, the difference was 0.8 vs 1.6 annual gaps.

The survey found that CGM sensor failure is very common, Welch said. Over half of respondents (50.8%) reported that their devices failed early or fell off 1%-10% of the time, another 21% reported early failures 11%-20% of the time, and only 7.3% reported zero failures.

Failure rates of more than 10% of the time were seen among all CGM brands, ranging from 39% with the Dexcom G6 to 53% for Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 3. For insulin pump failures, those proportions ranged from 34% with Medtronic's MiniMed 780G to 53% for Insulet's Omnipod 5.

The length of access gaps wasn't included in the T1D Exchange survey, but researchers gave patients at the University of Cincinnati Endocrinology Clinic pre-visit questionnaires that included the question. Here, 51% of 207 CGM users who responded reported at least one gap in the past 3 months, with an average duration of 16.5 days. The top reason reported was early CGM failure.

For insulin pumps, 16.5% of 109 respondents reported at least one gap in the past month, with an average duration of 19.2 days.

To inform his call for insurers to cover extra diabetes supplies, Welch presented published study data from the manufacturers of marketed CGMs. Reported early failure rates ranged from 13% to 23%. Using this data, he estimated the number of sensors that fail early per year ranges from 3.2 to 7.6, depending on the manufacturer.

“If we know that this is happening, and even the studies that led to the approval show this, why is it so hard to get extras, and why are we always on the edge of running out, and why can't we make this better? That's my call to action,” he concluded.

Welch reported no relevant financial relationships. Ahn is a speaker for, advisor for, and/or recipient of research grants from Abbott, Ascensia, Insulet, Lilly, MannKind, Novo Nordisk, Xeris, Sequel, Lilly, Honey Health, Medtronic, and Tandem.

While a couple of less prominent leagues are already underway, the 2025-26 European club season really kicks off on Friday, when England's Premier League, France's Ligue 1 and Spain's La Liga all begin the new campaign. In Italy, Serie A starts next week, as does the German Bundesliga. 

We'vew already given you our Top 20 clubs to watch this term. But what captures the imagination of fans who watch the world's most popular sport is the players. Here are 11 fascinating characters to keep an eye on between now and next May. 

Jobe Bellingham (Borussia Dortmund)

The younger brother of Real Madrid's English superstar Jude Bellingham, the 19-year-old midfielder helped Sunderland win promotion to the Premier League last season before following the career path of his more decorated sibling and moving to Germany. Jobe received a hero's welcome upon his arrival at the 81,000-seat Westfalenstadion and has already been awarded the Black & Yellow's revered No. 7 shirt. He debuted for Dortmund during the FIFA Club World Cup, then cemented himself as a starter during the preseason. Now he seems poised to help a BVB side that surprisingly reached the Champions League final two years ago challenge for its first Bundesliga title since 2012. 

Moises Caicedo (Chelsea)

Good as Cole Palmer was during Chelsea's ultimately triumphant Club World Cup run, the Blues wouldn't have won the title without Caicedo. Still just 23, the Ecuadoran has emerged as perhaps the best defensive midfielder in the world since leaving Brighton & Hove Albion for London two years ago this week — somehow exceeding the expectations that came with his $135 million price tag, the 10th-highest transfer fee of all time. 

Now Caicedo gets to take his ball-winning talents to the Champions League for the first time in his career, as Chelsea — which finished fourth in the Premier League last season — returns to Europe's top club competition following a two-year hiatus. 

Ousmane Dembele (Paris Saint-Germain)

If Lamine Yamal doesn't win the Ballon d'Or, it probably goes to Dembélé, who made a strong case for the honor in leading PSG to its long-coveted first UEFA Champions League title. The 28-year-old Frenchman was close to unstoppable last season, scoring 35 goals in 53 games as the Parisians claimed a continental treble. (The 2018 World Cup winner scored just 40 times in his six full seasons with Barcelona.) Dembélé capped off 2024-25 by taking PSG to the Club World Cup final, scoring twice against Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals and adding an assist and another strike in the semis versus Real Madrid. And he's off to a fast start to the new season, scoring in the shootout as PSG came back to beat Tottenham in Wednesday's UEFA Super Cup final.

When Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar Jr. all left PSG within twelve months of each other in 2023 and '24, it was easy to wonder who would emerge and become the new faces of the club. Enter the 20-year-old Doué, who burst onto the scene last season with a breakout, trophy-laden campaign — his first at the Parc des Princes.

Doué arrived in the French capital on a $58 million transfer from Rennes and immediately made his mark, scoring 16 times and quadrupling his previous career best of four goals. Two came in the 5-0 Champions League final drubbing of Inter Milan; he was named the best young player of that tourney, and of the Club World Cup six weeks later. What will Doué do for an encore in 2025-26?

Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)

For three years straight, the Gunners have been the Premier League runner-up. The main reason the North London club fell short? The lack of a lethal forward like Manchester City's Erling Haaland or Liverpool's Mohamed Salah to put the Gunners over the top. 

Gyökeres could be that missing piece. The 27-year-old Swede arrived this summer from Sporting Lisbon for $86 million and a resume that speaks for itself. He bagged 39 goals in 33 Primeira Liga matches in 2024-25 and finished his career in Portugal with 97 strikes in 102 total appearances. ""He's a proper No. 9,"" Arsenal all-time top scorer Thierry Henry says of Gyökeres. ""You have a guy that's a killer in the box.

Kylian Mbappé (Real Madrid)

On a personal level, Mbappé's maiden season in the Spanish capital was a triumph. The 26-year-old French superstar won the European Golden Shoe as the continent's top scorer, with 44 goals. He set a new record for goals for a first-year Real Madrid player. He was named the club's MVP. 

But despite scoring in Madrid's UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Intercontinental Cup wins, Europe's most decorated club team lost the Spanish title to chief nemesis Barcelona and failed to reach the final of both the Champions League and Club World Cup — a disaster by Real's lofty standards. 

The challenge for Mbappé and new coach Xabi Alonso this season will be to turn the forward's individual brilliance into team success.

Cole Palmer (Chelsea)

A highly-rated prospect when he left mighty Manchester City for the Blues in the summer of 2023, nobody expected Palmer — who had made 19 previous Prem appearances without scoring — to explode for 22 goals in his first season in London. 

Last term, Palmer found the net just 15 times. 

But the English winger's performance at the FIFA Club World Cup in June and July suggests he's ready to take another massive leap forward in 2025-26. 

Palmer scored three times in six contests as Chelsea upset PSG to win the title. Two of those strikes came in the 3-0 win in the final, after which the 22-year-old received the Golden Ball as the tournament's top player. That can't hurt Palmer's confidence as the 2025-26 slate kicks off.

Christian Pulisic (AC Milan)

After skipping the Concacaf Gold Cup, getting into a public war of words with U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino and facing intense criticism from several USMNT legends as the shorthanded Americans lost the final to rival Mexico without their best player, Pulisic has plenty to prove in 2025-26. 

That sitting out this summer was worth it, for starters. Pulisic set career highs for goals and assists and led Milan in scoring both in Serie A and in the Champions League last season. 

But the American won't have to worry about the latter after the seven-time European champ finished eighth in Italy. That will allow the Rossoneri to prioritize winning the Scudetto for just the second time since 2011. It could also lead to another huge year for Pulisic, who insisted the break would help him and the U.S. heading into the 2026 World Cup. He'll get to prove it beginning with Sunday's Coppa Italia game against Bari.

Raphinha (Barcelona)

Mesmerizing as Lamine Yamal was from start to finish last season, the stats say he wasn't even Barça's best player. 

Raphinha had 34 goals to Yamal's 18 across all competitions in 2024-25. And it's not like Raphinha can't create; the former Leeds United man also had 25 assists, same as the teenage sensation. 

Is this the new normal for the 28-year-old? Or was last season an outlier? The most goals Raphinha had scored in a single campaign previously was 18, when he was with Portuguese club Vitória Guimarães way back in 2017-18. He managed just 10 in each of his first two seasons at Barcelona, and 11 in his final one in the Premier League. 

Raphinha's form almost put Barça in the Champions League final last May. If he builds on or even matches his breakout campaign, the Blaugrana could  claim their sixth European title next spring.

Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)

That the reigning English champions were willing to drop a club-record fee of more than $135 million to prise Wirtz away from Bayer Leverkusen this summer says how highly the Reds rate the German playmaker.

Wirtz, 22, led Leverkusen to its first and only Bundesliga title, in 2023-24. He's already established himself with Germany's national team, having made 31 appearances already for the four-time World Cup champs. 

Will he live up to expectations at Anfield? After winning their 20th English title last season, Liverpool is looking to repeat as champions for the first time since 1983-84. Adding Wirtz won't hurt.

Lamine Yamal (Barcelona)

He just turned 18 in July, but the electrifying Spaniard heads into the season before his first FIFA World Cup as a legitimate global superstar. Yamal might already be the planet's best player; he's on the shortlist of favorites to win the Ballon d'Or when the award is presented in Paris on Sept. 22. 

Yamal helped his country to the European title last summer, then led Barça to a domestic treble. This year, both his and the Catalan titans' priority is to win the UEFA Champions League, which Barcelona hasn't done in more than a decade.

The B.C. Lions and Toronto Argonauts will spend the first half of the 2026 CFL season as road warriors.

Both the Lions and Argos will play home games away from their respective venues during FIFA's World Cup. Soccer's men's world championship will be held from June 11 to July 19 with contests in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Vancouver and Toronto will combine to host 13 matches. Toronto's BMO Field will stage six, including Canada's first-ever World Cup game on home soil June 12.

Seven games will be played at Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium, including Canada's group matches June 18 and 24. The first contest at the venue is slated for July 13 with Vancouver also hosting knockout stage games July 2 (round of 32) and July 7 (round of 16).

What's more, the World Cup takes over the venues for its games 30 days before the first match at that stadium.

On Friday, the CFL announced the Argos will play home games at Hamilton Stadium, Mosaic Stadium in Regina and Winnipeg's Princess Auto Stadium against the host teams during the World Cup.



The Lions will relocate for two home games, with the club planning to announce those details at a later time. The Argos will also unveil further details in the future.

The full '26 CFL schedule is scheduled to be released in the off-season. The 2025 campaign ends with the Grey Cup on Nov. 16 at Princess Auto Stadium.

“The World Cup is a cultural event, uniting entire countries and communities under a single flag,” CFL commissioner Stewart Johnston said in a statement. “As Toronto and Vancouver welcome the world, we're grateful to other cities and their tremendous fans for so generously making a home away from home for the Argonauts and the Lions.”

Construction at BMO Field in preparation for the World Cup began after the '24 CFL season and most noticeable has been the installation of four LED scoreboards, one in each corner of the stadium.

As well, a new temporary playing surface has been installed, with another planned specifically for the World Cup in 2026.

BMO Field's seating capacity will be increased to 45,736 for the World Cup from 28,180. There will also be enhancements made to the audio systems, an expansion of the wifi throughout and a new north-end pavilion that's currently under construction.

Following the World Cup, BMO Field will require time to be retrofitted back to CFL standards.

“To our incredible fans in Toronto: your passion and loyalty mean the world to us,"" said Argos GM Mike (Pinball) Clemons. ""This temporary move is about showcasing our city and stadium to the world — and when we return, it'll be with even more energy, excitement and noise!”

Last season, Toronto had an average attendance of 15,127 as it marched to a second Grey Cup title in three seasons. That figure has dipped to 13,838 as the Argos (2-7) have struggled thus far and there's history to suggest the prospect of having to play home games out of town next year won't help the franchise's fortunes.

In 2015, the Pan American Games and Toronto Blue Jays' playoff run forced Toronto to play three home games on the road (one in Ottawa, two in Hamilton). That was after opening that season in Fort McMurray, Alta., as the home team versus the then Edmonton Eskimos.

A total of 4,900 spectators watched Toronto defeat Edmonton 26-11 in Fort McMurray on June 27. And 15,011 fans took in the Argos' 38-35 ""home"" win over the Redblacks on Oct. 6, a Tuesday night.

But only 3,401 attended Toronto's 27-15 loss to Calgary in Hamilton on Oct. 17 (Saturday afternoon) and 3,741 were on hand for the club's 34-2 defeat to Montreal on Oct. 23 (a Friday night).

Despite only playing five times at Rogers Centre — Toronto's home venue at the time — the Argos finished third in the East with a 10-8 record before suffering a 25-22 setback to Hamilton in the division semifinal before a Tim Hortons Field gathering of 24,029.

The big difference in 2026, though, will be Toronto playing its road home games against the local teams, which should be a more attractive draw for fans in those cities.

The CFL added that both the Argos' and Lions' schedules next season will be made to re-establish home-field advantage for the second half of the 2026 campaign.

This will mark the first time the World Cup will be hosted by three countries as 48 teams from six confederations are slated to participate in the global event. Games will be played in a total of 16 cities (11 in the U.S., three in Mexico and two in Canada).

Vancouver will be in the West Region along with Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area and Seattle. Toronto is in the East Region along with Atlanta, Boston, Miami, Philadelphia and New York/New Jersey.

The World Cup begins June 11 in Mexico City and will conclude with the tournament final July 19 in New York/New Jersey.

Why the World Cup could be our transit shame

Incentive-based strategies for modern transportation policy

With the 2026 World Cup less than a year away, the U.S. is woefully unprepared for the expected influx of 6.5 million people traveling to the U.S. to enjoy the globally renowned spectacle. Fans and American transit users will rely on systems in desperate need of major investments. For decades, the U.S. has poured billions into highways while underinvesting in transit. If we want a system that works for everyone—that connects people to work, stadiums, and life itself—then we need to build it.

For the first time since 1994, the Men's FIFA World Cup is coming to the United States. As a part of a historic tri-nation bid with Canada and Mexico, the U.S. will host the majority of games, showcasing not just their love for the sport, but their capacity to welcome the world.

An expected 6.5 million fans will attend matches across the three countries, with the U.S. having 11 host cities. Millions of travelers across the country will depend on our transportation systems to get them to stadiums, hotels, restaurants, shops, and attractions—putting our infrastructure at center stage, as well as greater stress on systems that need to work for students, young families, older adults, and all Americans.

While the World Cup will wisely rely on existing stadiums—avoiding the costly, underused infrastructure often associated with global sporting events—it still highlights a major gap in U.S. readiness: our public transportation systems. Many host cities lack reliable transit networks, while some are facing service reductions or fare increases. For everyday riders—students, seniors, working families—this moment adds stress on already insufficient mobility options. It's a chance to prove we can move people safely and efficiently. Without serious investment, we risk displacement, transit failure, and missing out on an opportunity to improve long-term transportation outcomes.



Take Arlington, Texas, and Philadelphia—two cities with very different systems, but similar fundamental problems: a lack of local funding and federal support.

Arlington, Texas, nestled between Dallas and Fort Worth, is the largest U.S. city without mass public transit, and is scheduled to host seven matches in the upcoming World Cup. Unlike most host cities, it lacks traditional public transit options like buses or rail.

From 1980 to the present, Arlington voters have rejected three separate proposals to create transit. A lone bus line ran briefly from 2013 to 2017 but was discontinued due to low ridership. In its place, Arlington launched a rideshare program, VIA, the city's only form of public transportation.

With no light rail, no local bus service, and no dedicated mass transit, tens of thousands of fans will have to travel to AT&T Stadium in…cars. With DART facing proposed service cuts, and VIA lacking any significant capacity, residents and visitors will face a transportation system under distress.

This moment demands transportation excellence. Arlington residents already face growing traffic, and adding thousands of visitors who will rely on limited rideshare options will only worsen conditions. A city that has long avoided public transit is now hoping a cobbled-together system can carry the weight of a global event. That's a risky bet—one that underscores why forward-looking, multimodal transportation planning is essential.

Arlington, Texas isn't the only host city in a hard place. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) is facing major service cuts. After approving a ‘Doomsday Budget' in late June, Philadelphians are fighting for a permanent funding solution to stop the bleeding.

Without a new statewide approved budget, SEPTA would see a 45 percent service cut and 21.5 percent fare increase. This means 50 bus routes would be eliminated and a 20 percent reduction on all remaining routes, along with curfews, closure of stations, and elimination of special services, including the Sports Express and Broad Street Line, critical connections to Lincoln Financial Field, which is hosting six FIFA World Cup games.

Service cuts, unreliable buses, increased fares, and a 9 p.m. curfew is not how you prepare for a globally popular sporting event, not how you create a lively, vibrant, enjoyable World Cup experience, and definitely not how you maintain a system for Philadelphians during a major event. Philadelphia will need to work in tandem with Amtrak and the Northeast Corridor, with Boston and New York hosting as well. Yet after previous summer delays and cancellations, Amtrak will need updates to ensure a smooth process.

Decades long mass investment from the federal government into the national highway system, with only a tiny fraction towards transit, has created a congested, unsustainable system that lacks any semblance of providing efficient and plentiful transportation options. It doesn't have to be this way.

There are two potential outcomes for this World Cup experience. The first is a vibrant, unforgettable tournament—fans moving easily through U.S. cities on efficient transit, spending time and money across the country that will lead to tangible economic benefits. For two months, locals, fans, and visitors experience an amazing energy with access to all there is to offer, and the on-field action is matched by the exciting off-field atmosphere. This vision only becomes reality if the federal government invests in transit, ensuring safe, reliable, and improved service in our host cities.

The second outcome is far less inspiring, and unfortunately, it's the path we're on. Here, locals, fans, and visitors spend hours stuck in traffic or waiting in long lines for a transportation system that fails to meet the needs of our cities. This is a huge opportunity to invest in our system and our people. The federal government can prove we can function effectively and provide great service. There is still time for investment. While Arlington may not get a New York City-sized transportation system by June 2026, the local and federal governments can and should provide short-term and long-term investments into the system. We've long seen a federal government pour billions into a failing highway system, while only a fraction of that has gone to transit. This needs to change.

Tennis Star Iga Swiatek Serves 'New Look' Before 2025 US Open originally appeared on The Spun.

With the 2025 US Open just around the corner, six-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek appears to be turning heads on and off the court.

Roughly a month ago, Swiatek claimed her first title at Wimbledon. She cruised past Amanda Anisimova in the final 6-0, 6-0. Although grass was considered her ""weakest"" surface, she proved that her game is truly adaptable.

""I think tennis is a mental sport, but also you need everything to win tournaments ... good tennis, good physicality, being also not tired, have good matches before so you don't spend too much time on the court, having great focus,"" Swiatek said. ""Finals sometimes are a bit ugly because there's so much stress and everything. I kind of used the experience from before. Today I just wanted to enjoy the time that I had on the Centre Court and enjoy the last hours of me playing well on grass, because who knows if it's going to happen again. I just focused on that, and I really had fun.""

Just two weeks after winning her first Wimbledon title, Swiatek went over to the United States to kick off her hard-court season. She lost a Round of 16 match against Clara Tauson at the National Bank Open.

Swiatek has bounced back from her loss to Tauson with an impressive showing at the Cincinnati Masters. She has a quarterfinal match against Anna Kalinskaya coming up.

Prior to Friday's match, Swiatek showed off a new look in her latest ad with beauty company Lancôme.

Swiatek has been a partner with Lancôme since the spring of 2024.

""She looks incredible actually,"" one fan wrote on X.

""Iga should embrace her look and thus confidence more often. This is definitely a side of her we need to see more,"" a second fan said.

""I'm sorry but it's a real model right there! So relaxed and confident omg,"" another fan commented.

""Iga is a natural in front of the camera, just wow,"" a social media user wrote.

We already know Swiatek is one of the best in the game on the court. Judging by her fans' comments, she also has a future in modeling.

For now though, Swiatek will stick to serving aces instead of looks.

Goran Ivanisevic's opinion on how many Wimbledon titles Elena Rybakina should win has come to light following the pair's split.

Rybakina hired Ivanisevic as her coach at the end of the 2024 campaign having parted ways with long-time coach Stefano Vukov in August last year.

The Russian-born Kazakh star then made the shock revelation on January 1 that Vukov would be re-joining her coaching team.

Ivanisevic was reportedly “blindsided” by Vukov's return, but coached Rybakina at the Australian Open, where she reached the fourth round, losing to eventual champion Madison Keys.

The day after Rybakina's announcement, it emerged that Vukov had been suspended by the WTA Tour amid an investigation into a breach of their code of conduct. Vukov was handed a one-year ban in February, but he was cleared to resume coaching in the tour last week after a successful appeal.

Ivanisevic, who previously coached Novak Djokovic, confirmed he would not continue working with Rybakina after their collaboration in Melbourne.

“After our trial period that finished with Australian Open, I wish Elena and her team best of luck moving forward,” the 2001 Wimbledon champion wrote on Instagram.

Goran Ivanisevic issues ‘best player in the world' verdict after ‘sad and strange story' of Elena Rybakina split

Former world No 5 Anna Chakvetadze revealed what Ivanisevic recently said to her about Rybakina when she was interviewing the Croatian.

“When we interviewed Goran Ivanisevic, he said off-camera, ‘I don't understand, she (Rybakina) has such an amazing game, she should be winning more tournaments on grass, not one Wimbledon but three to four at least,” Chakvetadze said on a podcast with fellow former Russian WTA star Dinara Safina.

Rybakina won her only Grand Slam title to date at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships, where she came from a set down to beat Ons Jabeur in the final.

She was a quarter-finalist in her title defence at the All England Club in 2023, while she reached the last four in 2024. At Wimbledon this year, the 26-year-old suffered a surprise third round loss to Clara Tauson.

In March, Ivanisevic highlighted Rybakina's off-court situation as the reason he stepped down, while also lauding her ability as a player.

“It was a bit strange,” Ivanisevic said on a podcast with former Croatian footballer Slaven Bilic. “I won't talk much about it, but I can say that it's a bit of a sad and strange story.

“I consider her, even before I became her coach, at least for me, to be the best tennis player in the world. She plays the most beautifully, she plays the simplest and I really enjoyed it.

“Unfortunately, some things happened off the court that I couldn't control and I didn't want to be a part of that and part of that story and then I decided that it was best to quit. I wish her all the best in her career.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Tennis LIVE: Emma Raducanu handed crushing blow as star withdraws from US Open","https://www.express.co.uk/sport/tennis/2095149/tennis-live-Cincinnati-Open-Carlos-Alcaraz-Jannik-Sinner","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 20:10:00 GMT","



This year's Cincinnati Open is back on track following the extreme weather that disrupted play on Tuesday. Play was curtailed early with the main court flooded as torrential rain lashed down, but thankfully, there was no such disruption on Wednesday or Thursday.

The two top seeds, Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka, are both on track while Carlos Alcaraz faces Andrey Rublev later today. The Italian is in the final four after dismantling Felix Auger-Aliassime last night. Elsewhere, Coco Gauff and Jasmine Paolini both also progressed.

Coco Gauff recently revealed that she had been forced to delete X (formerly known as Twitter) because she became obsessed with following Love Island USA on the app.

Now, Ben Shelton has jumped on the bandwagon, admitting that he deleted the app years ago.

""I remember two years ago, I ended up deleting Twitter from my phone, and that was the best decision I ever made. Now, two years have passed, and I've never read anything on that social network again,"" the recent Canadian Open champion told Tennis Channel.

""I prefer to watch the highlights of certain matches. At the moment, I watch a lot of the tennis matches I used to watch, whether it's from the tournament I'm playing in or even from a Challenger tournament that's happening that week. I have a team that helps me keep my feet on the ground.""

Andrey Rublev is currently trailing Carlos Alcaraz by a break in the opening set of their quarter-final.

And the No. 9 seed isn't happy with some of the automated technology - even if he doesn't realise some of it is automated.

Rublev confronted chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani and claimed the shot clock was being started too soon, only to be told that it automatically started three seconds after the last point was called.

Then, he was shown a replay of an electronic line call he didn't agree with, and thought the wrong ball may have been shown.



The chair umpire had to ask Aryna Sabalenka to rip the label off her water bottle during her quarter-final defeat to Elena Rybakina.

The world No. 1 was drinking from a plastic San Pellegrino bottle when the official said: ""Aryna can I just ask you to take [the label] off that bottle? Perfect, thank you, we're good, that's fine.""

It comes just a couple of days after Carlos Alcaraz became frustrated when an umpire told him off for drinking from reusable branded Evian bottles. ""It's not my fault,"" the Spaniard repeatedly stated.



Last year's Cincinnati Open champion, Aryna Sabalenka, has been ousted in the quarter-final.

Elena Rybakina has taken out the top seed 6-1 6-4, ending Sabalenka's title defence.

She saved all five break points she faced, and will face Iga Swiatek in the semi-finals.



British doubles stars Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash have extended their incredible winning streak in Cincinnati.

They've now won 22 matches and counting after beating No. 6 seed Andrea Vavassori and Simone Bolelli in the quarter-finals.

Dubbed 'Cashpool', they have not lost a match since the Libema Open final in June.

The Brits swept titles at Queen's, Eastbourne, Wimbledon and Toronto, and they're looking for their fifth successive trophy.



Elena Rybakina is off to a flying start in her Cincinnati Open quarter-final against world No. 1 and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka.

Rybakina suffered a brutal defeat to Sabalenka in Berlin a few weeks ago, blowing four match points to go out in the quarter-finals.

But she's keen to get revenge - she's taken the first set 6-1 in Cincinnati in under half an hour.

Iga Swiatek had the fans on Cincinnati Open's centre court in stitches as she discussed the searing heat.

Asked how she was coping in the hot weather, the world No. 3 had a simple answer - she'd been drinking. But she made it very clear that she was keeping things pure and healthy.

“There's no secret, I just drink,” she said, before eyeing the camera and adding: “But water!”

Iga Swiatek is through to her third straight semi-final at the Cincinnati Open after beating Anna Kalinskaya 6-3 6-4.

The world No. 3 has never been beyond the semis here. If she wants to reach the final, she'll have to beat either Aryna Sabalenka or Elena Rybakina. Their match is up next on the centre court.



Terence Atmane has enjoyed a breakthrough week in Cincinnati, coming through qualifying and making it all the way to tomorrow's semi-final, where he takes on Jannik Sinner.

The French qualifier has already beaten 15th seed Flavio Cobolli, teenage sensation Joao Fonseca, and top-10 stars Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune on his way to the last four.

Ranked down at No. 136 in the world, Atmane is set to bank at least £245k in prize money and will make his top 100 debut when the tournament is over.

But he still has no clothing or shoe sponsor after being dropped by Asics last year.

“Apart from Tecnifibre for the rackets, I don't have any sponsors since I got dropped by Asics. I buy my clothes and shoes like everyone else. I don't have an agent; I do my thing on my own in my corner,” Atmane told L'Equipe.

Anna Kalinskaya sparked concerns when she called the physio and received a medical time-out minutes into her Cincinnati Open quarter-final clash with Iga Swiatek.

The No. 28 seed already had heavy strapping on her shoulder, and during the first changeover in the match, with Swiatek leading 2-1, the trainer bandaged Kalinskaya's calf.

She has decided to play on and got broken. Swiatek currently leads 4-1.



Terence Atmane is on the run of his life in Cincinnati. The world No. 136 qualifier is into the semi-finals after beating two top-10 players, including Holger Rune.

After suffering a 6-2 6-3 defeat in the quarters, Rune took to social media to send some words of support to Atmane.

""I have known you Terence since juniors, tennis is a tough journey and I am happy for your run here at @CincyTennis and what it will mean in the future for you . Good luck onwards,"" he tweeted.

Play is getting underway at the Cincinnati Open, with No. 3 seed and recent Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek facing Anna Kalinskaya for a spot in the semi-finals.

Kalinskaya hit out at the WTA when their quarter-final was scheduled first on Friday at 11am local time, after her last match started on Wednesdan night and finished in the early hours on Thursday, and she didn't get to bed until 4am.

“How can the WTA and tournament expect athletes to perform their best when the scheduling is unfair?” she wrote in an Instagram story.

“After my match against Alexandrova, I got home from the site at 2:40 am and didn't go to bed until 4 am. I slept a bit and came to the site to practice.”

“Then I get scheduled at 11 am for tomorrow's match—how does the tournament and WTA expect me to recover and continuously adjust my sleep pattern, which is one of the most important aspects of recovery? Seems a bit one sided.”

Emma Raducanu made a statement at Wimbledon last month, where she put up an impressive fight during a tight loss to Aryna Sabalenka in the third round.

But her private life was also under the spotlight at SW19, as Raducanu was asked whether there was any truth to rumours that she was dating Carlos Alcaraz, whom she'll team up with in the US Open mixed doubles event next week.

After she said they were just friends, fellow British player Cameron Norrie - who is in a long-term relationship - was asked whether he was seeing Raducanu.

And the 22-year-old has finally responded to the intrusive speculation.

“Yeah, and Cam's questions, too. That was terrible. Terrible,” she told the Guardian.



The International Tennis Integrity Agency have confirmed that Japanese star Kaili Demi Teso has been suspended for 10 months following a doping violation.The 19-year-old Teso tested positive for the prohibited substance methylephedrine, atributed to a bottle of cough medicine. Teso's mother, also his manager, acquired the medicine on the player's behalf and the ITIA accepted that the breach was not intentional.

In a statement, they said: ""An independent tribunal issued a ruling of no significant fault or negligence and a 10-month suspension, noting that the player's mother had consulted a professional from a reputable pharmacy before purchasing, and that Teso, 18 at the time of the positive test, was inexperienced.""

Wimbledon commentator Andrew Castle has claimed the 'Royal Box' jibe from Andre Agassi live on air this summer was blown out of proportion.

""We had a laugh, and they took it out of context,"" he told Betway. ""Afterwards, Andre sent me a text, saying what an unbelievable time he'd had, how he enjoyed it, and we were going to have him for the final but then he went into the Royal Box instead.

""But then you read that he was saying, oh, ‘just concentrate on the tennis'.""

Andre Agassi pretty much annoyed by Andrew Castle and his obsession with celebrities in the Royal Box. Andre is right, it's tennis that they came to concentrate on.

Lindsey Davenport has backed Ben Shelton to win the US Open.

Davenport, who won three Slam crowns in an illustrious career, said on the Tennis Channel: ""Ben Shelton has that type of game where he can take the racket out of his opponent's hand.

""He's got big weapons. He's such an explosive athlete. He lights up the stadium as well. If you get on a roll in New York, if he can play that high level tennis and have the crowd behind him, we could have an American male Grand Slam champion here pretty soon.""



Andrey Rublev had received a significant boost ahead of the US Open this month.

The 27-year-old will face Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals of the Cincinnati Open, having learnt that his coach, Marat Safin, has received his US visa.

Safin won't be able to join him in Ohio, but will be in New York to guide him for Flushing Meadows this month.

Jannik Sinner has defended his decision to rehire fitness coach Umberto Ferrer after his latest win in Cincinatti.

Having sacked Ferrer following his doping controversy, Sinner said:""It was a different situation. Now everything is different. I felt like, at this point, I needed someone who knew my body better.

""We worked together for about two years before this break. His work has brought me a lot of benefits. We worked on every area of my body and my endurance has improved. I think he did a great job.""

Roger Federer has learnt who he will share a court with for his celebrity doubles match in Shanghai on October 10.

It's been confirmed that he'll partner with one of two actors, Hong Kong film star Donnie Yen or Chinese TV personality Wu Lei, to play against ex-professional female Zheng Jie.



The US Open mixed doubles partnership between Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz appears in doubt due to the Cincinnati Open schedule.

Alcaraz is into the last eight, and if he makes Monday's final, he will play just 20 hours before the revamped tournament gets underway. Having taken a break after Wimbledon, citing fatigue, former British player Barry Fulcher has speculated Alcaraz could now follow Coco Gauff in skipping the team event.

Emma Raducanu has revealed she has been training in extreme heat ahead of the US Open this month.

After her exit in Cincinnati, Raducanu took to her Instagram story to post a picture of her sweating profusely after a training session. She's already stated she feels she is heading to Flushing Meadows in the best shape since her win there four years ago.

French qualifier Terence Atmane continued his sensational run at the ATP Cincinnati Masters last night by stunning seventh-seeded Holger Rune 6-2, 6-3.

The world No.136 now in his Masters 1000 semi-final where he'll face defending champion Jannik Sinner.

""I don't think any words can describe how I feel right now,"" said the 23-year-old. ""I was just trying to be myself on the court.""

Here's the moment he sealed his win...

Atmane = THE MAN \ud83d\udd25The moment World No.136 Terence Atmane defeated Rune to become the first qualifier to reach the #CincyTennis semi-finals since 2015! pic.twitter.com/svq87YhYQJ

Alexander Zverev has admitted he got professional help following his first round exit at Wimbledon this summer.

""I took a longer period of time off after Wimbledon, which I haven't done in a very long time,"" he said.

""Which was very needed. I didn't train, I didn't do any physical work, I didn't play tennis for a longer time as well which was the best thing for me to do. I enjoyed my time, mentally freed up, got also some professional help as well there. I'm happy to be back on court.""



Anna Kalinskaya has accused the WTA of being 'biased' against her due to the scheduling of her upcoming match against Iga Swiatek.

On her Instagram story, she wrote: ""How does the WTA and the tournament expect their players to play well with these unfair schedules?

""After my match against Alexandrova, I went home at 2:40am and didn't go to bed until 4:00am.

""I slept a little and came back to train today. Then they scheduled my match tomorrow [against Swiatek] at 11:00am.

""How does the WTA and the tournament expect me to recover and continue adjusting my sleep patterns, when that's one of the most important aspects of recovery? It seems a bit biased.""

Jannik Sinner is through to the semi-finals in Cincinnati after securing a dominant win over Felix Auger-Aliassime.

The young Italian turned the screw to earn a 6-0 6-2 victory in one hour and 11 minutes.

He will be hoping to go all the way and lift the trophy to give himself some winning momentum ahead of the US Open.

Jasmine Paolini will go up against Coco Gauff in the quarter-finals of the Cincinnati Open.

She has booked her place in the last eight with a thumping win over former Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova.

Paolini was in full control throughout and sailed to a comprehensive 6-1 6-2 victory.



Emma Raducanu will not be seeded for the US Open, it has been confirmed.

Veronika Kudermetova's recent victory over Clara Tauson at the Cincinnati Open pushed the young Brit out of the final spot.

It means Raducanu could face a top player in the very first round at Flushing Meadows.

Coco Gauff is safely through to the quarter-finals of the Cincinnati Open after beating Lucia Bronzetti in straight sets.

The young American turned on the style to secure a one-sided 6-2 6-4 victory.

She will face either seventh seed Jasmine Paolini or former Wimbledon winner Barbora Krejcikova in the next round.

Patrick Mouratoglou is convinced that Victoria Mboko will win Grand Slam titles over the course of her career.

Reflecting on her incredible Canadian Open triumph, he said: ""She plays to win no matter who is on the other side of the court.

""She started the year ranked 300. Difficult to think she's not going to win Grand Slams.

""Great physicality, the way she moves on the court and she's very offensive, both sides forehand and backhand.""



Male tennis players will pocket a record £13.5m in profit-sharing bonuses from the 2024 season, the ATP have confirmed.

The figure marks an increase of 177 per cent on the previous season's payout.

It will be distributed to players based on their performance at the nine ATP 1000 tournaments.

ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said: ""This is exactly what profit sharing was designed to do, ensure that players and tournaments share equally in the sport's financial upside.

""It is a huge milestone. For us, it's proof that strengthening the premium product and aligning interests creates value.

""We're proud to be strengthening our partnership and building a stronger, more sustainable ATP Tour.""

Matteo Berrettini has pulled out of the US Open due to an injury.

He has not played since Wimbledon, where he was dumped out by Kamil Majchrzak in five sets.

Berrettini skipped Toronto and Cincinnati with the aim of recovering in time for the final Grand Slam of the year.

However, he remains unable to compete and has withdrawn from the event.

Aryna Sabalenka has admitted to regularly cheating on her diet.

In an interview with the Tennis Channel during the Cincinnati Open, she said: “It's hamburgers, it can be pizza, it can be gummies. It can be a lot of different things in one day because you know, like if it's a cheat meal, you got to go full.

“But hamburgers, that's my weakness, cheesy and soft and a really good meat and hot and the bun is still melting with the cheese.”



The International Tennis Integrity Agency has confirmed Australian tennis player Thomas Fancutt has accepted a 10 month suspension for a doping violation.Fancutt, 30, admitted to using a using a 'prohibited method' in relation to an IV drip.

In a released statement, the authority said: ""Following a full investigation by the ITIA, which included evidence gathering and interviews with the player, Fancutt admitted to the breach, and the ITIA accepted that the breach was not intentional.""

Top seeds Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka are odds-on to win the US Open.

According to AceOdds, in the men's draw, Sinner is the favourite at evens ahead of Carlos Alcaraz at 2/1. In the women's draw, Aryna Sabalenka is the 5/2 favourite with Iga Swiatek closely behind at 7/2.

AceOdds: 2025 US Open men's winner: Jannik Sinner Evens; Carlos Alcaraz 2/1; Novak Djokovic 16/1; Taylor Fritz, Alexander Zverev 25/1; Jack Draper 28/1; Ben Shelton 33/1; Daniil Medvedev 50/1.

Women's winner: Aryna Sabalenka 5/2; Iga Swiatek 7/2; Coco Gauff 7/1; Mirra Andreeva 12/1; Elena Rybakina 14/1 Naomi Osaka 20/1; Madison Keys 22/1; Amanda Anisimova 25/1; Jessica Pegula, Emma Raducanu, Victoria Mboko 33/1; Jasmine Paolini, Clara Tauson 50/1.

Jannik Sinner has learnt he won't be eligible to receive money from the ATP Masters Bonus Pool this season.

The prize pot is reserved for the top performers in the six Masters 1000 events who performed in at least theee of the tournaments.

While serving his doping ban, the Italian missed the Indian Wells Masters, Miami Open, and Madrid. Last month he opted to withdraw from the Toronto Masters, citing fatigue and regardless of his final position, won't be eligible for any additional money.



Emma Raducanu has sent a warning to rivals ahead of the US Open this month.

After struggling since her remarkable 2021 win, she's said: ""I went home and came back and it was a really difficult time in New York.

""Since I won the tournament, it's not been easy for me there. But this year I feel different, I'm a lot calmer behind the court. On the court, I take more confidence in the big moments.""

Aryna Sabalenka has withdrawn from the mixed doubles of the US Open.

The world No.1 has opted not to look for a replacement after her original partner, Grigor Dimitrov, pulled out. It follows him injuring his pectoral muscle at Wimbledon when leading against Jannik Sinner.

There have been contrasting reactions to Venus Williams being handed a wildcard for the US Open at 45.

The world No.577 is set to become the oldest singles player in 44 years at the tournament. On social media, many fans have argued it is a 'waste' of an entry.

But other believe the icon, who will also play in the revamped mixed doubles alongside fellow American Reilly Opelka, will help sell tickets in the early rounds.



Anna Kalinskaya complained about 'drunk' fans during her fourth-round match against Ekaterina Alexandrova at the Cincinnati Open.

Here's the moment the star approached the umpire to complain...

The former World No.6 was leading Rinderknech 7-6(4) 4-2 in their third round clash, when the Frenchman retired as he was unable to continue due to the heat. Rinderknech collapsed on the court in the second set, and subsequently threw in the towel soon after.

It feels like we're in an oven, even for the fans,"" said Auger-Aliassime. ""We're always on the move and focused on trying to win, but the crowd is sitting for a long time, and so are our coaches. A friendly reminder to everyone: drink plenty of water, bring hats, and cool off as much as possible.""



Carlos Alcaraz is at risk of being fined after ignoring the umpire's instructions to cover the logo on his water bottle.

During his win over Luca Nardi, the Spaniard reacted angrily after official Greg Allensworth gave the order, arguing it went against tournament sponsor deals. Alcaraz refused to comply and is now likely to be sanctioned.

There has been plenty of buzz for the refurbished mixed doubles event at the US Open, which will see the best players in the world in both the ATP and WTA draws match up for a quick, competitive fight the week before the singles draw begins at Flushing Meadows.

The format will see the mixed doubles event shifted to the week before the main draw begins, meaning the players will be able to accommodate more time to grow the doubles side of the game before their focus shifts to their bread and butter. Players such as Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, and Iga Swiatek have all been drafted to play — but a scheduling wrinkle might force this revamped doubles tournament to be short of its star names.

The issue arises from how close the end of the ongoing Cincinnati Masters tournament is to the start of the doubles tournament in New York. The finals in Ohio are slated for Monday 18 August, instead of the typical Sunday, while the first day of the doubles tournament is set for the Wednesday following that — a very quick turnaround.

With the US Open set to begin on August 25, that means there will be minimal period of rest for any players who reach the Cincinnati final, are tasked to compete in the doubles tournament, and will have aspirations of going deep in the US Open.

This includes both Sinner and Alcaraz, currently in the latter stages of that tournament, with Sinner already through to the semifinal and Alcaraz set to play his quarterfinal today. Sinner was set to be paired with American star Emma Navarro, while Alcaraz has a high-profile partnership with Emma Raducanu on the cards.

The two best players in men's tennis could be set for a titanic clash on Monday night, which means they will have a sharp turnaround to reach New York for the doubles. With the singles tournament starting a week after, and both players favourites to lift that title as well, the doubles might well go on the backburner.

The same could be true for Iga Swiatek, who is in the latter rounds of the Cincinnati event as well, and is set to play alongside Casper Ruud in New York next week. Swiatek's greatest rivals, Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff, will not be playing the doubles events: Sabalenka refused a different partner after he original teammate Grigor Dimitrov has to withdraw due to injury, while Gauff cited prior commitments in the lead up to her home slam as the reason for her own withdrawal.

With Swiatek's opponents earning an extra week's rest ahead of the singles tournament, it wouldn't be a surprise to see her request some extra time off to prepare, and the same could be true for either or both of Sinner and Alcaraz. The much-hyped mixed doubles tournament has some uncertain days ahead.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Federer, Djokovic, Murray, Nadal & now... Sinner","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-hard-court-streak-cincinnati-2025","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 12:10:44 GMT","

Jannik Sinner has been the man to beat on hard courts in the past 18 months. The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has won the past three majors on the surface and also lifted the trophy at the Nitto ATP Finals in November.


This week, the Italian has cruised through the draw at the Cincinnati Open, where he is the defending champion. With his victory against Felix Auger-Aliassime on Thursday, the 23-year-old improved his winning streak on hard courts to 25 matches, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Only Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal have won more consecutive matches on the surface this century.

If Sinner captures his 18th hard-court title and fifth at ATP Masters 1000 level in Ohio, he will surpass Nadal's best run on the surface. The World No. 1 has dropped just three sets across his 25 wins.

Longest men's hard-court win streaks of 21st century

Sinner is in a thrilling battle for ATP Year-End No. 1 honours presented by PIF with Carlos Alcaraz. Alcaraz currently holds a 1,340-point lead over Sinner in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and could meet the Italian in the Cincinnati final on Monday. Sinner trails the Spaniard 5-8 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series but won the most recent meeting in the Wimbledon final last month.

Alcaraz was the last man to defeat Sinner on hard courts, with that triumph coming in the title match at the ATP 500 event in Beijing in October.

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 2: What the track?!

Our latest F1 Icons feature shines a light on the strong father-son bond between multiple Grand Prix winner Juan Pablo Montoya and F2 racer Sebastián.

Having a famous name in any sport comes with a level of pressure and expectation that can be tough to deal with, but for Sebastian Montoya, it's a source of strength and inspiration. The Colombian is currently forging his own path to F1, driving for PREMA Racing in Formula 2 this season, and his father Juan Pablo Montoya is the obvious pick as his F1 Icon…

The thing is, I don't actually have memories of my dad in F1, because I was born in 2005, and then in 2006 he left. But I've seen the pictures and videos, and probably the earliest one that comes to mind is when he won in Brazil, and they put me in the trophy.

Otherwise, if you asked me about my dad in F1, I'd say the win at Silverstone in 2005. If you watch the highlights back from the race, you see the podium ceremony, and below it, my mum lifts me up like I'm Simba from the Lion King.

Experts weigh in on where the 27-year-old actress goes after being at the center of the storm involving an American Eagle jeans campaign that had everyone from Donald Trump to Lizzo sharing hot takes.



		By Chris Gardner, Danielle Directo-Meston 

	August 15, 2025 9:30am	




	‘Tis the season of Sydney Sweeney. It just now comes with an asterisk.


	The two-time Emmy nominated actress, producer, Ford aficionado and booked-and-busy brand partner is revving up for the busiest run of a still rising career. On the heels of a meaty role opposite Oscar winner Julianne Moore in the Apple TV+ movie Echo Valley, Sweeney has two films in theaters on back-to-back weekends in August: Tony Tost's Americana followed a week later by Ron Howard's period thriller Eden opposite Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby and Daniel Brühl.

	September delivers an anticipated Toronto International Film Festival world premiere for a big swing as a queer boxer in David Michod's biopic Christy, which she also produced, followed by Paul Feig's psychological thriller The Housemaid opposite Amanda Seyfried. Early footage of the latter film electrified CinemaCon audiences when it debuted in Las Vegas in April. Oh, and the final season of Euphoria, the show that made Sweeney a star, is on the horizon for early 2026.

	Who could have guessed that a seemingly harmless denim campaign would force a footnote on what could have been a glorious few months because of how it stirred up a surprise culture war that stretched from TikTok to the White House, with everyone from Lizzo to Donald Trump weighing in with an opinion. But that's what happened after American Eagle dropped its “Sydney Has Great Jeans” campaign July 23. It was designed as an ambitious partnership that included print ads, 3D billboards (including one on the Sphere in Las Vegas), Snapchat lens technology that allowed users to interact with a digital Sweeney, and a limited run of the “Sydney Jean” with 100 percent of the net proceeds donated to a nonprofit of the star's choice.

	











	Within days, a handful of TikTok users took offense to a campaign clip that features Sweeney saying (with unique inflection), “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” The users claimed it promoted eugenics or was a form of Nazi propaganda because Sweeney is white, blond-haired and blue-eyed. While countless users dismissed the theories as nonsense, the dog pile had begun causing the hot takes to go viral. Mainstream media outlets picked up on the swirl and the coverage helped spread the controversy far and wide, from from late night to the White House. President Donald Trump clocked in after The Guardian reported that Sweeney registered as a Republican in Florida prior to the 2024 election.


	“Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST' ad out there. It's for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves.' Go get ‘em Sydney!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “The tide has seriously turned — Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be.” His post came hot on the heels of American Eagle defending its campaign while pushing back on the narrative that there was any other message to the pun. “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans is and always was about the jeans,” the brand shared on Instagram on Aug. 1.


	Sweeney stayed silent. She still hasn't said a word about the campaign or its backlash — allowing American Eagle's statement to stand on its own as the brand reiterated that it was just a slogan about jeans and nothing more — but she did return to Instagram on Wednesday to promote Americana with a carousel of artistic behind-the-scenes images for her 25.3 million followers. “A few years ago I filmed this little movie with some friends and now you get to meet Penny Jo,” posted Sweeney, seen in many of the images that also feature Paul Walter Hauser and pop star turned actress Halsey. It's the only recent promotion for the film that Sweeney has done aside from hitting the red carpet for a premiere at L.A. venue Desert 5 Spot on Aug. 3. But that night, she only posed for photos before quickly ducking inside without speaking to reporters.

	It begs a question: What should Sweeney do now?


	Not much says Nathan Miller, CEO and founder of full-service strategic and crisis communications firm Miller Ink, which represents Fortune 500 companies and celebrities. “American Eagle played it reasonably well,” he explained, adding that the brand's response reflects the current culture. “The same brand five years ago would've apologized profusely and tried to move past it quickly. Instead, they stuck to their guns and stood by the campaign. It was irreverent enough without being offensive. What was great about it for Sweeney is that while it may have had everyone talking, she wasn't. Everyone was speaking about her, and she doesn't have to do anything.”


	But with a busy fall up ahead, she surely will have to speak at some point about her new films even if the first time she does field questions from the press is during a TIFF press conference. Asked how she should respond to the reveal about her voting record as a Republican, Miller said, again, she doesn't need to engage. “If it is authentic to her and she wants to be public about it, great, but she should not feel compelled to do so just because someone dug up her party registration. It's totally appropriate for her to say, ‘I don't discuss my politics, that's personal. I'm only here to talk about my movie.' And she doesn't lose. That's the safest strategy,” he noted, adding that on the flip side it is possible today to build a brand as a political celebrity as there have been plenty of examples on the left. Reaching across the aisle today only helps to widen one's appeal, Miller said.

	











	Lucy Robertson, head of brand marketing at Buttermilk, an agency that specializes in creator marketing, said the American Eagle campaign felt like a “misstep” for Sweeney because rather than leveraging her as a creative partner who helped shape the narrative. “It uses her as a convenient ‘hook' to hang the campaign on, in this case, with a tone-deaf ‘good genes' message that quietly reinforces Eurocentric beauty ideals like white skin, blonde hair, blue eyes.”


	Robertson said that “real influence” in today's market comes from being “embedded in the creative ecosystem for the long-term” rather than just doing one-off endorsement deals. Sweeney has a long history of brand deals after having partnered with Laneige, Miu Miu, Armani Beauty, Kérastase, Heydude, Dr. Squatch and Baskin-Robbins.


	“Zendaya's partnership with On, for example, sets the benchmark. In that 14-month collaboration — set to be the first chapter of a multi-year partnership — she hasn't just starred in ads — she's co-designed the Cloudzone Moon sneaker, helped craft the visual story in the evocative ‘Be Every You' campaign, and shaped how her identity and movement translate into both product and storytelling,” Robertson explained of Sweeney's Euphoria co-star. “That level of integration deepens cultural currency where we've seen Sydney front multiple brand campaigns in a short space of time, the result can feel more transactional than transformative.”

	











	A well-placed legal source familiar with negotiating A-list brand deals says it may be too soon to tell whether the social media swirl will affect Sweeney's future partnerships and acting gigs. Companies might prefer not to work with her if they believe consumers have Sweeney fatigue or if her exposure could tarnish their image. (Amid the American Eagle backlash, Baskin-Robbins disabled comments on its TikTok videos featuring Sweeney.) The expert notes their advice to clients varies based on star wattage and that there's a science to measuring celebrity. At a certain level of fame, too many product endorsements could dull one's A-list image, the source added, while others turn to international markets to keep cash flow coming in while avoiding being “everywhere” on their home turf. Meanwhile, brand deals are becoming a necessity for middle-of-the-road actors who are feeling the squeeze of studio consolidation with fewer available gigs.


	Matt Herbert, Chief Commercial Officer of brand tracking platform Tracksuit, tells The Hollywood Reporter that the reaction to AE's campaign “doesn't need to necessarily define AE, but it is about how they react from here on.” He cites Pepsi's controversial 2017 ad with Kendall Jenner that some called tone-deaf for using strikingly similar themes to Black Lives Matter protests. (The company later pulled the commercial online.)


	Tracksuit also found that brand awareness for another one of Sweeney's brand partnerships for Dr. Squatch saw that company boosted by three percentage points from August 2024 to July 2025. (Recall that the men's soap brand sold bars made with her actual bathwater due to popular demand.) The company also notes that “trendy” is a common theme associated with Laneige, Dr. Squatch and Miu Miu among survey respondents already familiar with all three brands. As for AE's bottom line, the company's next earnings report is Sept. 4, which could offer insight to how much of an impact, positive or negative, the controversy had on sales.

	











	Herbert notes that AE was “facing pretty big challenges over the past 18 months,” with brand awareness down by 6 percentage points from January 2024 to June 2025; and consideration, preference and usage declined by 5 percentage points. … any celebrity [endorsement or] brand activation is an attempt to drive relevance, which we know from looking at all of our tracking data.” 


	In the case of AE, “the news is so fresh, the conversation is so fresh, and we'll be keeping an eye [on the outcome of the campaign in] the coming months,” says Herbert. That could mean even more eyes on Sweeney and her upcoming projects, which in Hollywood is always a good thing.

The Grammy-winning artist put her French lessons to use.

	Michael Saponara



Doja Cat is putting her French lessons to use, as the Grammy-winning artist revealed the release date for her upcoming Vie album. 


	Doja posted a trailer for the project on social media on Thursday (Aug. 14), which found her leaning into cosplaying a mademoiselle while speaking French (Vie translates to Live in English). 


	“Je sais que tu es ma vie Vie out 9/26,” she captioned the cinematic clip, positioning her album for a Sept. 26 arrival.

	











	The video finds Doja in various sophisticated outfits as she changes from Black lace to white fur and a sparkling diamond ballroom gown. One shot even finds Doja in couture in front of the Eiffel Tower during a recent trip to Paris. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“You're here?” she says while the camera pans to another version of herself. “Of course I am,” Doja replies while taking a bite of her croissant. 


	Fans were excited to hear a firm release date for the long-awaited album, which is Doja's first since 2023's Scarlet. “AHH WE ARE SATTTTT,” one person wrote. While another added: “Yesss Ms. Doja Jones!!!”


	Earlier this month, Doja Cat teased her upcoming “Jealous Type” single, which will set the table for the album. The teaser came with a phone number for a Vie hotline, while callers were greeted by Doja playing the role of romance therapist. “Jealous Type” is slated to be released on Aug. 21 at 8 p.m. ET.


	Doja Cat hasn't released any singles this year and has been tight-lipped about the project, but revealed in her V Magazine cover story in July that it's a “pop-driven” effort.












	“I do want to be self-aware enough to admit the fact that this is a pop-driven project,” she said at the time. “I know that I can make pop music, and pop is just that it's popular. It starts to become a bit of a thing that's viewed as a sport by people who are just bystanders to it, who enjoy it, but maybe also don't respect it or what it is, which is just music … They see it as if this is some kind of football for girls and gays.”


	Watch the trailer below and look for Vie on Sept. 26.

The new Joel documentary, So It Goes, proves a good movie can boost an artist's catalog. Recent films about Led Zeppelin and Pavement are less successful. 


													By
												

	Robert Levine



Music films don't get much respect — most of the older ones are basically brand extensions, and many of the new ones are extended ads. These days, most biopics and “rockumentaries” are made at least partly to introduce older artists to a new generation and boost their stream counts in the process. Considering these constraints, as well as those imposed by songwriters and artists in exchange for the use of their work, it's amazing that the best music films — think D.A. Pennebaker's 1967 Bob Dylan documentary, Don't Look Back, and Martin Scorsese's 1978 swan song for The Band, The Last Waltz, as well as the best concert films — are as good as they are. 


	We now live in a golden age of music documentaries — as well as a glut. It's never been more practical to make a cool documentary like What the Hell Happened to Blood, Sweat & Tears? But we may also have reached Peak Documentary. Not every artist has a great story, and not every filmmaker can tell that story well. This became obvious to me when I watched HBO's new two-part Billy Joel: And So It Goes, as well as the newish Becoming Led Zeppelin and Pavements, which are streaming on Netflix and MUBI, respectively. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Personally, I really love Pavement, I love Led Zeppelin and I like Billy Joel. (Pavement is the most consistent of the three; Zeppelin soared the highest; and I think Joel's Turnstiles and The Stranger are masterpieces, but his later albums suffer by comparison.) So I was surprised to find that I liked So It Goes the most by far — especially since Joel was never as mysterious as Zeppelin or as effortlessly cool as Pavement. After seeing all three movies, I spent a few days listening to Joel's albums, but I wasn't tempted to put on Pavement, even though I listen to the band's music far more often.  


	I wasn't alone in this. In the three weeks since the first part of the documentary premiered on HBO, Joel's on-demand streaming in the U.S. is up more than 24% compared to the three weeks before its debut, according to Luminate. That's up from about 16% in the week the first part of the movie came out, indicating that interest in Joel's music only accelerated in the weeks following its premiere. In the three weeks after the release of Becoming Led Zeppelin, the band's on-demand streaming in the U.S. rose 17% compared to three weeks in January, and the boost is even higher compared to late 2024. (Anticipation for the movie seemed to boost streams before its release, which didn't happen for Joel.) Even Pavement, whose music and film are less popular, saw a 14% increase in the three weeks after the release of Pavements compared to the first three weeks in April.


	This tracks how much I liked the movies. I found So It Goes incredibly compelling. It's not especially innovative — it switches between shots of Joel sitting at his piano, telling his story and archival photos and videos — but he's an engaging storyteller. He looks back at his past with honesty and a certain self-deprecating humor: “I did a lot of my own research for ‘Big Shot,'” he says, after calling it “a hangover song.”  


	Parts of Joel's story are much less funny. He struggled to find a style that worked for him, and he seems to carry some wounds from childhood: His father, the son of Jewish refugees from Germany, left his family and returned to Europe. Joel eventually found him, but they struggled to reconnect emotionally, and he vows to be a better dad. The movie implicitly makes a case for Joel as the heir to a certain songwriting tradition — a pop auteur who brings rock instrumentation and attitude to classic pop songwriting. It made me curious enough to listen again to some of his older albums. If I didn't know his music, I think it would have the same effect.  


	On the surface, at least, Led Zeppelin seems like a much more promising subject for a documentary. The band has few equals as a live act, and the performance footage in Becoming Led Zeppelin, which tells the story of the group through the release of its second album, is just stunning. The film smartly puts Zeppelin in context — watch enough music documentaries and you start to think people in the United Kingdom actually lived in black and white before Beatlemania — and it's remarkable just how much the group turned up the volume on pop. The commentary from the bandmembers is far quieter, though — both literally and figuratively — because they are only seen on camera separately.  


Becoming Led Zeppelin also doesn't deliver on the band's legendary excess. Some of that took place later, and neither the band's exploits with groupies nor its tendency to borrow liberally from blues artists plays well today. The group's story is interesting, but there isn't that much there that I didn't know. The concert footage is so vital that it makes the rest seem slow by comparison, and the band members don't look back with the humor that Joel does. To quote another Zeppelin film, “Does anyone remember laughter?”  


	And then I got to Pavements, the movie I liked least, about the act I love most. It's meant to be a rock-doc about rock-docs, in a way that some of Pavement's songs were about songs — most famously “Cut Your Hair.” It's about time someone did this. But Pavements underwhelms because it overdelivers. It's a documentary about the band interwoven with a “documentary” about the show Slanted! Enchanted! A Pavement Musical, which played for two nights in 2022; a “documentary” about a museum exhibit about the band, which also existed; and a “documentary” about a nonexistent biopic. It's a lot.  


	Pavement deserves a documentary that punctures pop music pretensions, but this one has too much going on at once. Worse, for a band that oozed slacker charm, Pavements is just too conceptual — more polished jewel box than dusty trunk. One of the funnier lines comes from Butt-Head of Beavis & Butt-Head fame: “They need to try harder!” Maybe. But the movie tries way too hard — and when it works, the humor is so specific that it's hard to imagine anyone who's not familiar with the band will understand why they were so important to so many people. 


	I'd love to end this with a grand theory on how to make music documentaries work, but I don't have one. The closest I can get is that many listeners still want to know more about the person behind the music. So It Goes works because it delivers that. Becoming Led Zeppelin doesn't, but it has enough fantastic live footage to interest anyone. Pavements doesn't even try, because that was never the point of Pavement in the first place, and maybe that's fine. Some things are just easier to sell than others.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Core Scary Movie actresses Regina Hall and Anna Faris are coming back as Brenda and Cindy, respectively, for the Wayans Brothers' restart of the early millennium comedy franchise.


	Said Hall and Faris, “We can't wait to bring Brenda and Cindy back to life and be reunited with our great friends Keenen, Shawn and Marlon — three men we'd literally die for (in Brenda's case, again).”


	The new Scary Movie is a big reunion, bringing the Wayans brothers back together for the first time in 18 years to write an all-new original script for the series, co-penning the Miramax production with Rick Alvarez. Scary Movie is prepping for an October shoot in time for a June 12, 2026 global theatrical release via Paramount. Miramax has a first-look deal with Paramount.

	











	Timing is everything in comedy, and a new Scary Movie couldn't arrive at a better time in theaters when horror movies have hit saturation this year. The genre is screaming for a pie to be thrown in its face.

I'm 19 and have zero interest in this reboot. I love horror not comedy. The world today is too dangerous to waste time with comedy

Bros a bot for sure.

Nice! Cannot wait. They could also bring back Pam Anderson as Becca. She survived Scary Movie 3 after all.

Yes!!!!

We won.

That's amazing! These two have great chemistry together. Also would love to see Wayans brothers making fun of multiverse thing with Simon Rex coming back as both his characters. The one from SM3 & 4 and the one from SM5.

Associate Editor, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Newly minted Emmy Award nominee Shawn Hatosy is returning to HBO Max's The Pitt as Dr. Jack Abbot for Season 2 in a recurring role, but fans will also benefit from his behind-the-lens skills when the hit medical drama returns. 


	Hatosy will direct an episode of Season 2, marking his return to directing following his work on TNT's Animal Kingdom, in which he also starred.


	From creator R. Scott Gemmill and producer John Wells, The Pitt chronicles the urgent challenges U.S. frontline healthcare professionals face through the lens of the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center's emergency department. Offering a real-time format, the series traces, hour by hour, the medical cases and personal crises physicians and nurses must navigate as they reckon with an overabundance of patients and a lack of resources.

	“I'm so excited to capture this show from the other side of the lens. The Pitt is an absolute dream for a director. I feel like a chef who gets to work in the best kitchen, with all the best ingredients – incredible writing, great actors, such strong characters with very distinct points of view; all in an immersive, adrenaline-pumped, beautifully choreographed world,” shared Hatosy.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Having experienced it all through Abbot's eyes, I think that's going to really enhance my perspective as a director, and what a joy to be able to do it with a group of people with whom I already have such a deep bond,” he added.


The Pitt cast is led by Noah Wyle, who also executive produces and writes. Katherine LaNasa, Taylor Dearden, Patrick Ball, Isa Briones, Fiona Dourif, Supriya Ganesh, Shabana Azeez, and Gerran Howell round out the ensemble cast. New Season 2 additions include Sepideh Moafi as a series regular, and Charles Baker, Irene Choi, Laëtitia Hollard, Lucas Iverson, and Lawrence Robinson in recurring roles.


	John Wells Productions produces the series in association with Warner Bros. Television, where JWP is under an overall deal. Gemmill created The Pitt and executive produces the series alongside Wells, Noah Wyle, Michael Hissrich, JWP's Erin Jontow, and Simran Baidwan.

	











	Hatosy received his first Emmy nomination in July for his work on The Pitt as Dr. Jack Abbot, the combat veteran and attending physician in emergency medicine at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Hospital, the setting of the series, which scored a total of 13 Emmy nods for its freshman season.


The Pitt is the fifth series collaboration between Hatosy and producer Wells, after ER, Southland, Animal Kingdom and Rescue HI-Surf. Season 1 of The Pitt took place across one day, while Season 2 is set 10 months after the events of the first finale on Fourth of July weekend. It was revealed in the Season 1 finale that Abbot is an amputee with a prosthetic leg. Still, no background information was revealed, leaving it for viewers and Hatosy to wonder about.


	During his time playing the mentally unstable and violent family man, Andrew “Pope” Cody, in Animal Kingdom, he directed four Season 3 episodes.  Hatosy is represented by Paradigm and Trademark Talent.

					By Stewart Clarke 




EXCLUSIVE: Netflix has greenlit six Mexican movies, including México 86, which stars Diego Luna and tells the story behind Mexico landing the 1986 World Cup.


	Also on the streamer's slate are pics from Jorge Michel Grau, Rodrigo García, Ariel Winograd, Alonso Ruizpalacios and Maite Alberdi.


	“Our commitment is real,” Carolina Leconte, Netflix's VP of Content for Mexico, said in an exclusive interview with Deadline about its plans for local film and series. 


	She referenced its pledge earlier this year to spend $1B on Mexican content over the next four years, its investment in the iconic Churubusco Studios, and a Creative Equity fund it has set up to open doors for the next generation of local talent.

	“Mexico is a diverse and rich country, full of unique and authentic stories still waiting to be told. Its talent – both behind and in front of the camera –is renowned globally. That's why today, to celebrate Mexican Cinema Day, we are announcing a film slate that represents that diversity,” said Leconte.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Netflix has already released Rodrigo Prieto's magical realist film Pedro Páramo, based on the 1955 Juan Rulfo novel. Deadline can reveal it will again mine Mexican literature on Aura, an adaptation of influential Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes' 1962 short novel. Alonso Ruizpalacios will adapt and direct and Stacy Perskie will produce.


México 86, meanwhile, will be directed by Gabriel Ripstein from a script he penned with Daniel Krauze. Luna will exec produce as well as star in the film, which chronicles Mexico's audacious, against-all-odds — and successful — bid to host the 1986 World Cup. Gaumont USA will produce.


	Netflix's Mexican fare has been resonating globally, with the likes of Counterattack reaching over 71 million views and making it into the global all-time Top 10 for non-English-language, while Lucca's World topped 28 million views worldwide in the first half of 2025. International success is clearly welcomed, but Leconte explained that the priority is always finding an audience at home.

	











	“We love seeing Mexican stories being so well received, not just here but all over the world,” she said. “Still, our main focus is always on creating local content for local audiences. What matters most to us is telling stories that reflect who we are, that help us see ourselves and our reality on screen. If those stories go on to cross borders, that's amazing – but our heart is always with what moves us as a country.”


New film slate


	Other titles in Netflix's new Mexican movie slate include Contra el Huracán (the English-language titles of the new slate are mostly TBC, but this translates as Against the Hurricane). It will tell the story of two half-brothers struggling to survive when an unexpected storm turns into a hurricane off the coast of Acapulco. Jorge Michel Grau directs.


	Rodrigo García writes and directs The Follies, which follows six women dealing with social and family pressures and whose paths unexpectedly cross on a rainy day in Mexico City. 


La Hora de Los Valientes (The Hour of the Brave), meanwhile, is a comedy starring Luis Gerardo Méndez and Memo Villegas in a story about an accident that brings a psychoanalyst and a police inspector together for an unexpected adventure. Ariel Winograd directs and K&S Films produces.


	There is also a feature doc in the mix. With the working title of Un Hijo Propio (A Son of One's Own), it follows a woman who longs to become a mother and fakes a pregnancy. As the lie spirals out of control, a medical scandal is unleashed that will shake the whole country. Maite Alberdi directs.


Commitment to Mexican content


	“Variety is key for us: From adaptations of literary classics like Aura by Carlos Fuentes, to high-production-value features like Contra el Huracán, and bold new comedies and dramas like La Hora de los Valientes and México 86,” Leconte said. 


	“Mexican nonfiction has also found a strong audience, and that's why we're betting on innovative documentaries like Un Hijo Propio by two-time Academy Award nominee Maite Alberdi. These are productions of a level never seen before in Mexico.”


	It's fitting that Netflix has doubled down on Mexico's local film industry on Mexican Cinema Day, but Leconte highlighted its work across series as well as features.


	“Our commitment to Mexico is stronger than ever,” she said. “This year, for example, we're bringing films like The Follies, along with the Juan Gabriel docuseries, one of the most loved Mexican artists ever, The Dead Girls, which is the very first series by acclaimed director Luis Estrada, and new seasons of fan favorites like The Manny.”


	Netflix has wrapped production on four brand new series in Mexico: Santita, Love 9 to 5 (Amor de Oficina), I'm Not Afraid (No Tengo Miedo) and Corruptors (Los Corruptores). 


	The streamer today also confirmed the end of production of Lovesick (Mal de Amores), the adaptation of Ángeles Mastretta's novel that is written and directed by her daughter, Catalina Aguilar Mastretta.

It's become an annual tradition: During the dog days of August, right between the last major release of the summer movie season and the start of the fall festival onslaught that kicks off at the end of the month, IndieWire devotes an entire week to celebrating a previous decade of film. We launched with '90s Week in 2022, ticked back in time with '80s Week the following year, and naturally did the obvious thing the year after that by… jumping forward to focus on the aughts. 

The '70s just seemed too vast — too robust — to contain within a few short days of lists, essays, interviews, and the like. Which isn't to say that our previous theme weeks offered a comprehensive overview of their respective decades, or even intended to, but it always felt like we could see enough of the whole picture through the various pinholes we chose to use.

But the '70s were different; they were a time — maybe the last time — when it seemed like the movie world was still expanding in every direction all at once as both a business and an art form. It felt comical to suggest that we could wrap our heads around it to the same degree as the previous eras we've covered (which happen to be the eras that most of the IndieWire staff have lived through). 

 










And yet, it was always just a matter of time before we tried to do it anyway, because that's how the internet works. And because there were so, so many things about the '70s that our writers were excited for an excuse to explore more deeply than our publishing cycle typically allows. And because our fearless editor-in-chief lit up — instead of firing me on the spot — when I jokingly suggested we devote an entire day of the site's coverage to Pier Paolo Pasolini's “Saló, or the 120 Days of Sodom” (which will include new interviews with the likes of John Waters and Luca Guadagnino, along with a deep-dive into the history of on-screen shit-eating, and a variety of other bits and bobs that have seek to have some fun with the movie's outsized reputation, while still respecting the gravity of its horrors). 

I've spent much of the last few months trying to figure out what our latest theme week could and should make room to include, and while I don't think I'm any closer to knowing the answer now than I was when we first started hashing out ideas, I have to say I'm happy with what we ultimately got. 

Some of our more ambitious plans invariably fell by the wayside (at one point we tinkered with the idea of asking a number of prominent filmmakers to each remake a few minutes of “Jeanne Dielman” on their own terms, and I thank many of them for taking the concept more seriously than it deserved), and it pains me that we didn't have the bandwidth to dedicate entire pieces to Cinema Novo or the Shaw Brothers or any of the other rich subjects we only brush up against as part of our 100 Best Movies of the Decade list, but I'm thrilled with the far-ranging variety of stuff that we've prepared.

The Apple TV+ series “Smoke” has been one of the most consistently compelling shows of 2025, thanks to its intense, layered performances, its complex and unpredictable plotting courtesy of creator Dennis Lehane and his writing team, and imagery that is visually expressive and beautiful at times yet grimly realistic. Expectations were high for the season finale that brought the story of arson investigator — and, as we learned early on, arsonist himself — Dave Gudsen (Taron Egerton) and his partner, then pursuer Michelle Calderone (Jurnee Smollett) to a close, and the filmmakers delivered with the show's most haunting and powerful episode to date.

Cinematographer Francois Dagenais, who shot more than half of the season's nine episodes (Sam McCurdy and Todd McMullen lensed the remainder), said that throughout the series, he, Lehane, and director Joe Chappelle looked to director William Friedkin and cinematographer Owen Roizman's work on the 1971 thriller “The French Connection” as their north star. “We didn't want to copy the look of it, but we wanted to copy the energy and the feeling,” Dagenais told IndieWire. “It's a film that's really grounded in reality, but it's also bold and dramatic.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“The French Connection” is also a movie that uses its urban setting for maximum dramatic impact, something Dagenais was intent on emulating. “Something those '70s movies do that we don't do as much today is use long lenses to make the city feel much closer to you,” Dagenais said, referencing Alan J. Pakula films like “Klute” and “The Parallax View” as influences. “We wanted to really feel the city's presence, so if you're in an alleyway at night, we frame it so you really see the depth. We also tried to incorporate the lights that were really there to add to that urban feeling.”

Although Dagenais looked to “The French Connection” for its realism, he also noted that it was at heart a very expressionist film, and he tried to incorporate that aspect into his lighting as well. The lighting on certain characters, for example, evolves as they go through internal changes. This is most evident with the character of Freddy, an outcast who briefly feels better about himself after going to a salon for a makeover before an interview for his dream job. 

“At the beginning, we barely see his face,” Dagenais said of Freddy's lighting. “Then he goes for the first real haircut of his life, and we made it brighter because his life is changing. We have to make it clear that he has never experienced something like this.” The effect is subtle but powerful, as a kind of glow starts to emanate from Freddy — and then vanishes to crushing effect when his dreams are shattered.

 










Ironically, given that the filmmakers' intention was to veer toward realism whenever possible, the central set piece of the season finale was entirely fabricated on a sound stage. “We ended up doing a lot of the final forest fire on a stage, and I was really concerned,” Dagenais said. “This show is all about being real, and when you shoot exteriors inside, it's hard to feel real. Sometimes you can just feel it on the clothes, that there's no movement in the air.”

One thing Dagenais noticed when he looked at photography of forest fires was that even during the day, the smoke would provide cover that made everything look like night. He also figured out rather quickly that he wouldn't be able to use diffusion to make the sky soft because the fires would burn it up. “I was also concerned that the lights would just shut down from the heat,” Dagenais said. “Would the wireless to the lights stop working? Would the sky panels stop reacting? So there was someone there the entire shoot, just checking the heat level on the lights.”

Other practical challenges simply came from keeping the set from showing any wear and tear as Technocranes and other massive pieces of equipment went in and out, but ultimately Dagenais felt the difficulties were worth it — especially when his colorist looked at the footage and said he couldn't tell it had been shot on the stage. “That was the best compliment I could get for what was, for me, a very tricky sequence.”

 










All episodes of “Smoke” are now streaming on Apple TV+.

James Gunn's Superman was designed as a fresh start for movies and TV shows based on DC Comics characters. Henry Cavill and the desaturated edgelord aesthetic of Zack Snyder, out; David Corenswet, vivid colors, optimism, and rambunctious superdogs, in. As Gunn and Peter Safran reboot a franchise that largely wasn't working, they were prepared to set aside nearly all of the remnants of the DC Extended Universe. 


	But the “nearly” doesn't include Gunn's own creations, which is why midway through Superman, there was a cameo by John Cena as everyone's favorite knuckle-dragging, bucket helmet-wearing, alt-right doofus quasi-hero Peacemaker, who debuted in Gunn's The Suicide Squad and then moved to the center of his irreverent, charmingly ridiculous self-titled HBO Max series. 


	The first Peacemaker season concluded in 2022. At the time, Gunn was filming Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and he said he intended to move immediately from that to making Peacemaker Season Two. Instead, he and Safran were placed in charge of DC's whole film and TV apparatus, and the return of Cena and friends was put on a long hold. The Superman cameo served as a reminder that the character had survived the regime change in a way that Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman had not, and the series finally returns next week. 

	











	Though Gunn continued his practice of writing every episode, he only had time to direct the first of the five episodes HBO Max provided for review. But even with Greg Mottola (Superbad) and others getting behind the camera more often, Season Two still feels very much like a James Gunn production — including a revamped version of the delightful opening credits sequence where the cast does a new choreographed dance to a new song.  

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But in taking Peacemaker himself more seriously, and putting more of the comedic burden on the supporting cast, Season Two feels much more akin to the second Guardians film than the first. 


	Because the show's been gone so long, we get a blessedly thorough “previously, on Peacemaker” montage, including one scene with new footage that retcons the series into taking place in this new fictional universe. From there, Gunn gives the people exactly what they want, opening up with Peacemaker (a.k.a. Chris Smith, son of an abusive white nationalist supervillain) being harassed by his pet eagle, Eagly. Eagly wants to go out flying, but it's too cold, so instead Chris takes him into the pocket dimension where his father Auggie (Robert Patrick) stored his gear. The idea that this idiot could just casually walk through a rift in space to get to an infinite closet was just an absurd throwaway gag in the first season. But after Superman dealt with Lex Luthor endangering the planet by building his own pocket universe, Peacemaker's secret hideaway becomes the central plot point of these new episodes. Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) — father(*) of Rick Flag Jr. (Joel Kinnaman), whom Peacemaker killed in The Suicide Squad — is tasked with finding and shutting down any portals like this. But before that happens, Peacemaker finds that he can use this space to visit a parallel universe where his life turned out much better.

(*) In Gunn's Creature Commandos cartoon, Flag Sr. has gray hair and looks just old enough to have fathered Flag Jr. But Grillo — who has only 14 years on Kinnaman — doesn't dye his hair for the live-action role. So the references to the father-son dynamic — including several The Suicide Squad clips used as flashbacks — can feel on the silly side.  


	As we've been finding with the past few years of DC's rivals in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, multiverses can be a more exciting idea in theory than in practice. Often, they're just used as an excuse to bring back dead characters (or, in the case of Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom, to bring back old actors as new characters), which robs any current story of dramatic stakes. Gunn is trying to use this tactic for a smaller story, where Chris gets a taste of a life where he's not a joke, and where his backstory isn't as horrific, which forces him to confront how unhappy he is in his own life.

	This means we get a lot less of Peacemaker, lovable moron, and a lot more of Chris Smith, regretful and sensitive guy who's trying to do better. Cena's developed enough acting chops over the years that he can play this angle well, and make Chris into a genuinely sympathetic figure. But just as the later Guardians films lost a bit of their energy by making Star-Lord a primarily dramatic character, there are definitely stretches of this season that had me wishing Gunn would go back to giving Cena retrograde, infantile lines to deliver so that co-stars like Jennifer Holland and Danielle Brooks could roll their eyes at him. 

	











	Instead, Holland's bitter ex-spy Harcourt and Brooks' empathetic Adebayo are mostly on Chris' side from the jump this season. So the humor is placed on ancillary characters: Freddie Stroma's Adrian “Vigilante” Chase, who was already the more extreme/dumb version of Peacemaker; Steve Agee's John Economos, who can't believe how much trouble his friends keep getting him into; and a couple of new cast additions in Tim Meadows as John's coworker Langston Fleury and longtime Gunn favorite Michael Rooker as renowned eagle hunter Red St. Wild. Rooker unsurprisingly embraces the lunacy of his character, who dresses in Native American drag and tastes bird poop to track his prey. And Fleury more or less fills Peacemaker's old function on the show as the wildly overconfident guy who will say whatever tasteless, ignorant thing that comes into his head. Meadows is incredibly funny doing this, but it lands differently when those jokes are coming from the periphery rather than from the main character.

	The soundtrack is still loaded with over-the-top rock songs (Foxy Shazam is a big musical presence this year). The fight scenes are still inventive while everyone works with a far more modest budget than Gunn gets in his movies. And the cast still has good chemistry. But there's definitely a tone shift. And it remains to be seen in the concluding episodes whether Peacemaker is fully built to get more serious, or if Gunn would have been better off leaving the series primarily as an outlet for the kind of humor he can't really put into movies about Superman or Batman.   


The second season of Peacemaker debuts Aug. 21 on HBO Max, with episodes releasing weekly. I've seen the first five of eight episodes.

	Jeff Ihaza



	Rolling Stone's September cover star Steve Lacy is getting ready to release Oh Yeah? his follow-up to 2022's Gemini Rights. The Grammy-winning musician best known for the smash hit “Bad Habit” says that on this album, he's focused on being as transparent as possible, which means letting fans in on more of his personality. Today, he dropped “Nice Shoes,” a single that he describes as a “trailer” for his upcoming album. The track hints at some new sonic territory for Lacy, featuring a fast-paced jungle-inspired breakbeat. He maintains the elements of his classic sound, however, towards the song's end, which segues into a slow-rolling guitar melody that's classic Steve Lacy. 


	“I feel safe enough and close enough to start talking about it now, and get the title out and just get the energy in the air,” Lacy says of his upcoming album. “I've never worked where I kind of announce it while I'm still working on it. I feel like rappers work until the last minute.”

	











	Here's everything we know about Steve Lacy's upcoming album Oh Yeah? 


			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	It's been three years since Lacy's Grammy-winning album Gemini Rights. He says he started work on this next album shortly after. “I just kind of got in the studio right away.  I'm always making things. It's just what I do to hang out. I just make beats.”


	As for what inspired him to call his album Oh Yeah?, all Lacy says in his cover store is, “the question's important.” 

	











	On Friday, Lacy dropped “Nice Shoes,” his first new release since 2022. With lyrics that volley between playful and insightful (Lacy at one point muses on a “romantic boner,” as he describes it), the track leans on a fierce breakbeat that serves as a backdrop for Lacy's specific brand of songwriting. “Crazy how you could be sad and not notice,” he sings. “All I need is my guitar and serotonin.”

	Despite being best known for infectious hooks, Lacy says he approached lyrics far more intentionally on this new album. “When I first started making shit or producing stuff with the Internet, I would always make the beat, make a hook, and just give it away,” he says. “That was my process for a while, so words were always just kind of secondary. I'm like, ‘If my beat hard, this bass line hard, the chords hard, what else do we need?' But now I'm like, ‘OK, I want to say shit how I would say shit.' ”


	Matt Martians of the Internet, the experimental R&B where Lacy got his start, says he's heard some songs from the album and compares it to the pop standards of yesteryear. “When I heard the album, I said, ‘You really made a pop album. And not pop in the sense of current-day pop, but pop what it used to be as far as greats,' ” Martians says. “He is getting into areas that I feel like are very reminiscent of a pop of yesteryear, which is very good.”


	One of the more surprising elements of the songs on Oh Yeah is how Lacy incorporates synthesizers and other electronic sounds. Lacy says he developed an interest in collecting synthesizers. “I have a good amount of synthesizers. I actually spent a lot of money trying to get the famous vintage ones,” he says. “I got the Juno, but I end up mostly using one that cost me about 900 bucks. I use the cheaper one the most. It's all over the album, and I won't say what that is because got to gatekeep that.”

	Lacy, an L.A. native, spent time in Paris recording his album.“I just love it,” Lacy says of the city. “I love the color of all the beiges and the lights and how old everything is, even the lighting at night. It's just the vibe.” The city inspired his sense of directness on the album. He goes on to say, “I think it inspires me based on the clarity that I have being here.”

	











	While Lacy remains cryptic about when exactly Oh Yeah is set to drop, all signs indicate it'll be here in the near future

You can learn a lot about a whole lot about a person who loves Onion Delivery

It took nearly a year, but UFO 50 is finally on Nintendo Switch. The news — an announcement that was unceremoniously shoved into a montage during last week's Nintendo Indie Showcase — is a cause for celebration. The retro tribute is a staggering accomplishment that packs 50 original 8-bit games into one polished package. It's a perfect companion for a portable console that every Switch owner should consider checking out.

I've spent a lot of time with UFO 50 since its launch, putting nearly 100 hours into the collection on Steam Deck. In that time, I've had countless debates with friends about which games are the best in the bunch. No two lists are ever the same, and that's the beauty of UFO 50: It's an eclectic package that satisfies several personalities at once. You can tell a lot about a person based on their favorite game in the pack.

So, what does your favorite UFO 50 game say about you? After analyzing each game extensively, I am now able to clock the core essence of your personality with 99.999% accuracy based on which one you love. It's just science. And if you've yet to dig into the daunting collection at all, consider this an easy guide to figuring out where to start, organized by the “chronological” order in which they appear in the game. You can't go wrong with any game, but there's something in UFO 50 that's specifically for you, I promise.

UFO 50 is available now on Windows PC and Nintendo Switch.

U.S. Representative Anna Paulina Luna claimed that she has definitive proof that ""interdimensional beings"" that can move ""out of time and space"" exist.

Anna Paulina Luna is beaming up some out-of-this-world news.

The GOP Representative for Florida's 13th congressional district said she has reason to believe ""interdimensional beings"" exist, citing her political and military career as her reasoning why. 

Although Luna—who leads the House Oversight Task Force on declassification of federal secrets—admitted to Joe Rogan that she hasn't seen ""a portal open"" or ""a spaceship personally,"" she argued that other evidence proves their existence.

""Have I seen photo documentation of aircraft that I believe were not made by mankind? Yes,"" the 36-year-old explained on the Aug. 14 episode of the Joe Rogan Experience. ""Is there historical significance to this? Yes."" 

""Based on the photos that I've seen,"" she asserted, ""I'm very confident that there's things out there that have not been created by mankind.""

What are these Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), formerly known as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), which Luna claimed move ""out of time and space?"" 

""These energy things,"" she explained, ""I think that they can actually operate through the time spaces that we currently have. That's not something that I came up with on my own. That's based on stuff that we've seen, that is based on information that we've been told."" 

The politician—who is also a member of the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Caucus—pointed to the controversial claims made by former United States Air Force officer David Grusch during a 2023 congressional hearing that the government has a highly secretive UFO retrieval program.

""When you talk about the interdimensional aspect of these things preexisting outside of what we currently know as our own dimension, that stuff can kind of all sound crazy,"" Luna admitted to Rogan. ""At the end of the day, you know, my job as an investigator is to receive all the information and decipher it.""

She also shared that she had gone to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida after multiple Air Force pilots accused the military branch of covering up UAP incidents. 

Luna, who served in the Air Force, criticized the military's response to their inquiries, adding that she had received pushback from the Pentagon and the Secretary of Defense when asking for them to share information with Congress.

E! News has reached out to the Department of Defense for comment and has not yet heard back. 

Although Luna admitted that the conversation can seem unrealistic, she didn't ""look at it with a crazy lens and perspective.""

As she explained, ""You never know if we're the only ones out there, essentially.""

Not everyone shares Luna's beliefs on the matter, however. NASA's Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Independent Study Team member Joshua Semeter previously admitted that he doesn't believe there's enough evidence.

""His claims are two steps removed from being Earth-shattering: not only has he not shared any verifiable evidence—photographs, artifacts, or any other manner of data—but he also has not personally seen or touched any of the objects he references,"" he told Boston University Today of Grusch's testimony in 2023. ""In the long history of claims of extraterrestrial visitors, it is this level of specificity that always seems to be missing."" 

For celebs who've spoken about their otherworldly experiences, keep reading.

Courteney Cox

The one where Courteney Cox shares a ghost story.The Friends star told Howard Stern she had a delivery man ring her doorbell and inform her of an unexpected guest.""I answered it, got my package and he said, 'Do you know this house is haunted?'"" Courteney said on a 2022 episode of his SiriusXM show. ""And I go, 'Really? Why?' He goes, ‘Because there's someone standing behind you.' And I thought, ‘Oh s--t.'”This wasn't her only spooky experience, however. Courteney also recalled a scare she had in London. ""I'd just gotten there,"" the Scream alum added. ""So yeah, I was a little jet-lagged but I wasn't sleeping. I was sitting there, I closed my eyes to try to sleep and all of a sudden I saw these really scary faces—like old faces. I was like, 'OK, stop, stop, you gotta stop.' And then all of a sudden I was like, 'Mom? Dad? Auntie Em?' I don't know. I just kept seeing all these weird things.""After also seeing lights and a plant move, Courteney alerted her longtime love Johnny McDaid.""I was like, 'Johnny! Wake up! I'm seeing spirits!'"" the actress added. ""And he had all these waves around him too. And he goes, 'Courteney, you're asleep.' I said, 'No, I just woke you up! How can I be asleep?' He's like, 'Well, I'm asleep. There are no ghosts.' I did see them for sure.""Ultimately, Courteney warded them off with a request.""I said, 'Thanks for visiting last night. That was fun. Do not come back tonight cause I have to sleep,'"" she said. ""And I didn't see them again.""

Demi Lovato

Demi Lovato is confident her childhood home in Texas in haunted.""When I was a little girl, my mom walked into the room and I was talking to something,"" the singer recalled on a 2013 episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. ""And my mom was like, 'Who are you talking to?' I was like, 'It's the little girl in the picture frame. Her name is Emily.' And then my little sister ended up doing that when she was around the same age. But this time, she was like, 'It's the girl that lives in the closet.'""If that example didn't make you feel like you're having a heart attack, this one might. Demi remembered inviting friends over and telling them, ""Watch, something will happen."" And while pals would initially have their doubts, she said, odd things would then occur—like when her buddy texted someone saying ""I think this place is haunted"" and the word ""definitely"" was sent back multiple times.""He's like, 'Why'd you send it so many times?'"" the Grammy winner recounted. ""He goes, 'I didn't send it that many times.'""Still not convinced? Demi has even more proof.""My uncle actually was watching TV and all of a sudden this balloon floated down the stairs,"" she told Ellen DeGeneres. ""What balloon floats down, by the way? And then it turns the corner.""

Joey King

While Joey King starred in The Conjuring as a kid, she also had a frightful incident off-camera.""In the story, when the mom gets possessed, she gets all these bruises on her,"" the actress explained on a 2020 episode of The Howard Stern Show. ""And so during the filming of those particular scenes, I started having a lot of bruises show up on my body in bizarre places, like on my stomach, on my chest, like what?""Initially, Joey added, the makeup artists thought she was stealing their fake bruises as a prank. ""They tried to take my real bruises off with rubbing alcohol and oil,"" The Act alum continued. ""I'm like, 'I'm telling you, I'm not lying.'""Joey then visited her doctor to get some blood tests. ""All of a sudden, I'm told that I have this blood-thinning condition called ITP, where basically most of my red platelets drained from my body mysteriously,"" she shared. ""I'd never had a blood problem in the past. I've never had a blood problem since then. No one in my family has that.""As a result, Joey noted, she had to go to the hospital twice a day while filming the 2013 horror movie.""When I came home, my platelets were completely fine,"" The Kissing Booth star told Howard. ""Like, I was back up to the normal numbers and I've never since had a trace of that disorder ever.""

Ariana Grande

Just keep breathin' as you read about Ariana Grande's terrifying incident.The Grammy winner told Complex about the ""ghost/demon experience"" she had in Kansas City in 2013. After staying in a haunted castle, Ariana said, ""the next night we wanted to go to Stull Cemetery, which is known as one of the seven gates to hell on Earth.""I felt this sick, overwhelming feeling of negativity over the whole car and we smelled sulfur, which is the sign of a demon, and there was a fly in the car randomly, which is another sign of a demon,"" she recalled to the outlet. ""I was like, 'This is scary, let's leave.' I rolled down the window before we left and said, 'We apologize. We didn't mean to disrupt your peace.' Then I took a picture and there are three super distinct faces in the picture—they're faces of textbook demons.""The ""Thank U, Next"" singer said she deleted the photo after she tried to send the picture to her manager and got a message back that read, ""This file can't be sent, it's 666 megabytes."" Ariana also remembered once seeing a huge black cloud beside her bed.""I started crying,"" she added to Complex. ""I was on the phone like, 'What do I do, what do I do?' and they said, 'Tell it to eff off.' I thought, I'm not going to do that. It's going to upset it, so I'm just going to chill and not feed into it because all it wants is fear. It feeds on fear. I watched it move to the front of my bed and then I fell asleep on the phone. I woke up and it was gone.""

Octavia Spencer

Truth be told, Octavia Spencer doesn't seem to mind having a spirit in her house.""I grew up watching Westerns,"" she said on a 2021 episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. ""I bought this house, and it was owned by a guy who did Westerns. So I must have been a fan of his. I think he is my protector. I love him because he kind of sorts out the bad people that shouldn't be there. He runs them out.""And if you're wondering how exactly the ghost runs them out, allow the Oscar winner to explain.""If they stay at my place, they don't want to come back,"" she added. ""And that's how I know that they don't belong there. Because if you're a person that belongs there, everybody's like, 'Oh, you're place is so welcoming. It's so great.' And that's how I feel about it.""Although, Octavia admitted her ghost can be ""shady"" if she's gone for a long time, such as by randomly closing doors and turning off the lights. And while this spirit is welcome, the Hidden Figures star made it clear she isn't offering an open invitation.""I love my ghost,"" she noted. ""I just don't want you bringing your ghost to my house. I don't want anybody's ghost thinking they can be friends with my ghost. 'Cause my ghost can haunt me, but he doesn't haunt me. We have boundaries.""

Jennifer Aniston

Jennifer Aniston wasn't exactly friends with the ghost she says resided at a house she previously owned in Los Angeles.""The dishwasher would start to go, or the coffee maker would start to go or the stereo would just turn on at full volume,"" the Friends star told James Corden on a 2018 episode of The Late Late Show. ""And it was terrifying.""So, Jennifer continued, someone suggested she call a specialist to ""clear the house"" of the spirit.""I had someone come over to my house,"" The Morning Show actress shared. ""They had frankincense and they put it in a little dish and sort of start saying all these things. And the first corner that she went to, the dish cracked.""But that wasn't all. Jennifer recalled how a ""really, thick, thick, thick 1975 ashtray that was sitting on the table"" also cracked and that the specialist asked her to leave so she could talk to the spirit.As for what the spirit said? ""He hated my roommate,"" Jennifer replied, later adding she moved out and never told the roommate. ""I feel terrible but I couldn't say, 'It doesn't like you.' I mean that would be terrible.""

Miley Cyrus

It appears some ghosts can't be tamed—just ask Miley Cyrus.The singer once spoke about a spirit she said lived in her house.“I had a friend who a parent had passed away,"" she explained in a 2020 interview with 102.7KIISFM's JoJo Wright. ""And when they did, they know how much I love Elvis [Presley] and gave me all of their Elvis memorabilia.""However, Miley said the memorabilia was destroyed when her Malibu house caught fire in 2018. In one of the rooms of her L.A. home, the Grammy winner had a photo of her friend's late mom.""After that [fire] happened she started visiting my house in L.A,"" she added. ""It was like she kind of went up in this smoke of all this Elvis memorabilia.""Miley said it was like the fire ""released"" her friend's late mom, and she soon got rid of the picture.""She smoked cigarettes and I could smell smoke coming from the guest room, which is where the photo is,"" she said. ""My dogs would go insane. When I would be feeling it, my dogs would lose their mind. It actually happened only a couple nights ago, I thought that I, I feel like, saw her sitting on the couch kind of taunting my dogs, which is something she totally would've done. And my dogs were going nuts.""

Keanu Reeves

You'll want to speed on over to hear Keanu Reeves' ghost story.The Matrix star once revealed an unexplainable experience he had at his family's New York apartment when he was 6 or 7 years old.""There's a doorway,"" Keanu said on a 2014 episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!. ""All of a sudden, we're looking over there and this, like, jacket comes waving through the doorway. Just an empty—there's no head, there's no body, there's no legs. It's just there, and then it disappears.""While the John Wick actor wasn't too freaked out, he said his nanny was.""I was a little kid, and I was like, 'Well that was interesting,'"" he remembered. ""And then I looked over at the nanny and she's like this [jaw open]. And I'm like, 'Oh wow, so that was real. Oh, OK. Wow! Cool!'""

Vanessa Hudgens

Vanessa Hudgens isn't necessarily trying to break free from any spirits.In fact, the High School Musical alum appears to embrace her ability to connect. ""I've accepted the fact that I see things,"" she said on a 2022 episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show, ""and I hear things.""One incident that bops to the top of Vanessa's mind happened with a pull-along duck toy when she was 8 years old.""There was one of those on the dining room table,"" The Princess Switch actress continued, ""and I started walking and it just started going alongside me.""Now, Vanessa is trying to learn more.""I kind of shut it down for a while because it's scary,"" she told Kelly Clarkson. ""The unknown is scary. But I recently was like, 'No this is a gift and something that I have the ability to do. So, I'm gonna lean into it.' And I recently did my first real paranormal investigation with equipment and everything.""

Hugh Grant

Here's a story about a boy.Back in 2016, Hugh Grant said one of his sons would often ""stare into a corner"" of his room.""Other people started seeing things,"" the actor, who is a father of five, continued on The Late Late Show. ""Other kids would come and say, 'Who's that little boy over there?' Yeah, relations and nannies, completely out of control.""So Hugh decided to take action. ""I'm a rational person, well-educated, not an idiot,"" the Love Actually alum continued. ""I find myself ringing a ghostbuster.""He said the ghostbuster than came to the house with some sticks.""Her sticks went completely wild in his room,"" Hugh added. ""She said, 'Oh, it's so strong in here. I think I might throw-up.' I think it was all bollocks. Then she burnt about seven pounds of sage and banged a little drum, played an instrument or something and sang. And she said, 'All the spirits are gone.'""But were they? Hugh said he asked his son in the morning if he felt happier last night. ""He said, 'No, there was a little boy at my window,'"" the Notting Hill star added. ""So I think we need to move house now. Yeah, too haunted.""

 

Brian Cox

The succession of events Brian Cox experienced years ago in Edinburgh will give you the chills.""I was just trying to go to sleep and suddenly there was this rocking sound,"" the actor recalled on a 2023 episode of The Jonathan Ross Show, ""and the chair started to rock. And it started to rock across the room in front of my bed.""While the chair eventually stopped moving, Brian was still pretty freaked out by what he saw.""By this time, I got myself right under the covers,"" he continued. ""Because I thought, 'S--t, this is f--king awful.'""The Succession star managed to get some sleep, but was startled again the next morning.   ""The chair was still here,"" he added, ""and the floor was covered in these scratch marks.""

In East Freetown, a simple Starbucks cold brew bottle turned into something straight out of a ghost story.

David Eaton recently recorded a video showing the plastic cap on his coffee container moving on its own. No hands in sight, no wind, no explanation. Eaton said the eerie motion had been going on for several minutes before he even started filming.

“It's crazy,” he said. “I've had other paranormal activity in my house too. Just this week alone I was grabbed twice, but the weird thing is, I don't feel threatened.”

According to Eaton, strange happenings have been a part of life ever since he bought the home three years ago and even prior to that. Over the years, his daughter's boyfriend claims to have seen what looked like a little girl wandering inside. The activity was unsettling enough for Eaton to sage the home just two weeks ago, but the unexplained events haven't stopped.

“I don't know what it is,” he said. “But it's definitely there.”

Whether you're a believer in the paranormal or a skeptic searching for a logical explanation, Eaton's coffee cap video is just the latest chapter in a haunting mystery brewing in East Freetown.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","These 2 Iconic CW Horror Series Secretly Have More in Common Than Fans Realize","https://www.cbr.com/supernatural-the-vampire-diaries-connection/","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 05:10:00 GMT","

The CW has gone through many changes, from featuring young adult dramas to an expansive DC universe. But when Supernatural aired in 2005, horror was not in the zeitgeist. Gilmore Girls was in its heyday, and Dawson's Creek had just concluded. When the horror series aired, however, it started a franchise that would last a decade and a half. Eric Kripke created the series, which was in part inspired by the dynamic between Luke Skywalker and Han Solo.

Supernatural starred Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki as the demon-fighting Winchester brothers, who clashed with each other almost as much as monsters. Dean was the impulsive and hot-headed brother, while Sam was more compassionate and understanding. The series unpacked their familial trauma while hunting demons, drawing a line in the sand between humans and the creatures they hunted. This was a stark contrast to a horror series that would premiere only four years later.

While the boys on Supernatural beheaded vicious creatures like vampires, another series found romanticism in them. The Vampire Diaries premiered in 2009, adapted from L.J. Smith's series of romance books of the same name. With True Blood and Twilight a hot commodity, The Vampire Diaries would fit into pop culture. What didn't seem to fit into were the footsteps that Supernatural left behind.

Though airing on the same network, the two series had a different perspective on horror. The Winchesters were out for bloody revenge against monsters that had torn their family apart. Elena Gilbert found a soft spot in her heart for not just one vampire, but two. On occasion, Supernatural found common ground with monsters with a conscience, but that wasn't typically the status quo. Their father, John, had raised them to hate everything that went bump in the night because a demon had burned their mother alive in one of Supernatural's scariest cold opens.

 John's parenting was cruel and neglectful as he prioritized hunting demons over caring for his sons, who essentially lost a mother and a father that night. Dean and Sam had a reason to hate vampires and other creatures, while Elena did not. When she eventually found out that her boyfriend Stefan had to survive on human blood, she was afraid for only about an episode. When she saw his compassion and willingness to curb his urges, to find a better way to live, it was easier for her to look past the vampire issue.

Supernatural and The Vampire Diaries had different demographics as well. The Winchesters were in their mid to late 20s, while The Vampire Diaries was a series geared toward teens. Vampires were made out to be romantic figures because that is what would appeal to that age group. Twilight had been the litmus test for these types of stories and had shown that a human-vampire love triangle was the secret sauce for success.

Despite these inherently opposed values, however, The Vampire Diaries and Supernatural closed a gap between each other. Young women gravitated towards both shows, though it wasn't evident on the surface. Supernatural may appear to be a more adult series, but the quality of the writing was closer to the teen show than it would seem. Fans devoted themselves to both fandoms because both series were just about two brothers.

The Vampire Diaries may seem frivolous to some viewers, but the seductive love triangle was a Trojan horse for a truly heartbreaking story. The most interesting part of the teen romance was not the love story at all, but the inner conflict that drove the emotional stakes of the show. Like Supernatural, The Vampire Diaries succeeded because of the love that two brothers had for each other. Since the beginning, Damon and Stefan Salvatore fulfilled the classic older fraternal archetypes.

As the older brother, Damon was darker, more morally complex, while Stefan was the heart of the family. This wasn't always the case, however. Like in Supernatural, family trauma fueled the dynamic between the brothers that almost led to estrangement. At the height of the Civil War, Damon and Stefan were as close as any brothers could be. In a predictable turn of events, a woman came between them, but that wasn't the nail in the proverbial vampire coffin. It was the events that led the two brothers to become vampires.

Jealousy had always been an issue between the Salvatores, but that didn't stop their codependency. After being fed vampire blood, both brothers were killed, which started their transition into vampirism. Stefan completed the transition when he killed their father, but at the time, Damon was less interested in living forever. Without the love of their lives, Katherine Pierce, Damon saw no point in becoming a vampire. It was only upon Stefan's begging not to endure immortality alone that his older brother became a vampire. This began over a century of bad blood between the two that was only healed when both returned to Mystic Falls, Virginia, the place of their birth.

The estrangement between the brothers and their ultimate healing journey mirrored that of the Winchester brothers. Like the Salvatores, the Winchesters experienced a similar estrangement at the start of Supernatural. Sam had committed the ultimate sin when he abandoned John's crusade to go to college and have a normal life. Sam was always at odds with his brother and father, having issues with how he was raised.

He mourned his mother, and when his father went missing and the Yellow-Eyed Demon returned, he came back to the fold. Despite their differences, he and Dean banded together to find out exactly what happened to John Winchester. Their search for John was less than fruitful as they lost yet another member of the Winchester clan. This only proved to bring them closer. Hardship bonded more than one supernatural brotherhood. If it wasn't for the events of these television shows, neither family would have found the catharsis they needed.

What these families really need is therapy, but external conflict is the next best thing. At the start of both Supernatural and The Vampire Diaries, neither of the families would have thought that they would find absolution. Damon came to Mystic Falls for destroying Stefan, while Sam never would have returned to the family business had he not experienced another personal tragedy. Both these events started a chain of events that healed the wounds that the Salvatores and Winchesters had been harboring for so long.

Damon, in particular, was so wounded by his family that he was inexorably changed. In his human life, he was kind and sincere, but Stefan's betrayal set him on a path of darkness. Coerced into becoming a vampire, Damon had a right to resent Stefan. Still, he cared for him, watching his younger brother descend down a path of blood addiction. The once sweet boy leaned into vampirism, relishing the chase and devouring his victims. Damon's darkness was a stark contrast to the person he had been, and it was fair to say that wouldn't have happened had it not been for Stefan.

These emotional wounds would persist throughout the series, sometimes arising in the Salvatores' fight over the human Elena. The protagonist of the show didn't last the entirety of The Vampire Diaries, and when Nina Dobrev left following Season 6, it was just the Salvatore Show. Interestingly enough, The Vampire Diaries still functioned relatively the same. That was because Damon and Stefan's fraught relationship had powered The Vampire Diaries from the beginning.

 Without Elena present, the two could finally acknowledge what had been hurting them all this time. Stefan achieved the redemption he had been looking for by saving Damon and Mystic Falls, even if it meant sacrificing himself. At the end of The Vampire Diaries, Elena felt more like a footnote. The final moment was about Damon and Stefan meeting in the afterlife, which was the only thing that would mean happiness for one another. This is not dissimilar to the ending of Supernatural.

After 15 years, Supernatural finally came to a close familiarly, with the death of one of the brothers. Dean Winchester died from an unfortunately placed nail, which wasn't the most heroic ending for the demon hunter. That was also beside the point, because one day, he would be reunited with Sam in their own afterlife. The Winchesters were just as codependent as the Salvatores — if not more so — and no matter how many partners they had, the story had always been about them.

They overcame their estrangement and sacrificed themselves for each other countless times so they could finally be at peace. When viewing these series through that lens, The Vampire Diaries and Supernatural are essentially about the same thing. While the storytelling is not quite in the same realm, the all-encompassing love of people who would die for each other is the most compelling part of both shows.

The show's misguided first season exposed all the cracks that made its cancellation feel inevitable.

The end of The Vampire Diaries is filled with sacrifices, tears and bittersweet moments. Did all the characters get their happy endings?

Over two decades, the lead stars returned for a sequel sans the original director.

The actor gets candid about the iconic role he let slip away.

FOMO can cause One Piece viewers to skip certain arcs to catch up, but you would only be doing yourself a disservice if you skip Skypiea.

Dragon Ball Super's decision to bring back Future Trunks was the key ingredient for a great arc, but the recipe for disaster for DBZ's themes.","{'href': 'https://www.cbr.com', 'title': 'Comic Book Resources'}","other"

			From the Chicago Bean man to alien-powered pyramids, well-known monuments have long been at the centre of peculiar speculation

The news that a Chicago city councillor has been forced to deny that there is a man trapped inside the “Chicago Bean”, one of the city's best known tourist attractions, follows in a long tradition of well-known sites becoming shrouded in conspiracy theories.

Earlier this month protestors gathered at Millennium Park demanding the release of the so-called “man in the bean” while claiming that artist Anish Kapoor kidnapped a baby in 2004 and sealed him inside Cloud Gate (the sculpture's official name).

The theory quickly moved from obscure Reddit threads to an Instagram account with more than 35,000 followers.

When it comes to the planet's tourism hotspots, peculiar theories abound, from Parisian landmarks secretly exerting mind control over the local population to hidden rooms housing some of America's biggest secrets.

A slew of dystopic movies has trained us to expect alien motherships hovering over New York, so it's hardly surprising that Lady Liberty has ended up tangled in her fair share of intergalactic rumours.

Grainy footage regularly resurfaces online showing a mysterious flying object buzzing around her crown. Non-conspiracists label it a weather balloon, a drone or even a wayward military aircraft.

However in 2018, artist Joseph Reginella added his own twist. Known for planting fictitious public memorials across New York, Reginella erected a plaque at Battery Park commemorating a supposed 1977 “harbour tragedy” in which all six crew members of a tugboat vanished while investigating “what appeared to be a private aircraft crash” in New York Harbour. It was, of course, completely fabricated.

The most prominent theory that surrounds Gustav Eiffel's iron-clad behemoth originates from the tower's own origins. It was supposed to be temporary, but instead of dismantling it after the Exposition Universelle of 1889, better known in English as the 1889 Paris Exposition, the city gave its new landmark over to science and by 1903, it was doubling as a military radio antenna.

Legend has it that Nikola Tesla met Gustave Eiffel at the 1889 Paris Exposition, sharing his vision for wireless energy. The tower's height, steel frame and later role in long-distance communication fits neatly into the theory that it was secretly part of Tesla's abandoned Wardenclyffe network – a planned global system of 30 towers transmitting free energy.

The official line? Eiffel never worked with Tesla, and the tower's radio use was purely military. The conspiracy line? Powerful interests killed Tesla's free-energy dream before it could threaten the business of selling electricity.

When sculptor Gutzon Borglum envisioned Mount Rushmore in the 1920s, it wasn't intended just to be four presidential heads staring out over the South Dakota plains.

His original plan included an 800ft staircase leading to a grand “Hall of Records”, a cavern lined with bronze and glass cabinets, historic artefacts and inscriptions explaining America's story. Sadly cuts to his government funding meant he had to stick to the faces. The unfinished chamber was sealed behind a 1,200-lb granite slab, and officials insist there's nothing in there.

Of course, for conspiracy theorists, that's exactly what you'd say if you were hiding something. Depending on who you choose to believe, the room in fact contains lost Civil War cannons, almost a billion dollars of gold coins rescued from an early 1910s shipwreck, the original atomic bomb plans or (the old conspiracy classic) a direct tunnel to the Hollow Earth.

It's a ring of enormous stones in the middle of an English field and nobody quite knows why it's there. Archaeologists say it was built around 5,000 years ago as some kind of ceremonial or astronomical site. However, other theorists disagree.

Apparently Stonehenge was either a giant healing machine, a landing pad for extraterrestrials or an ancient portal used by druids to zip between dimensions. The perfect alignment of the stones with the summer and winter solstice only fuels the “alien tech” crowd, who insist no Bronze Age human could drag 25-ton slabs without some help from space. English Heritage maintains it was all good old-fashioned Neolithic muscle.

If you wanted to hide evidence of alien contact, you probably wouldn't put it in the middle of the Sahara in a structure taller than a 40-story building. Yet here we are.

The pyramids of Giza have spent 4,500 years inspiring awe, tourism and theories that insist they're actually high-voltage energy transmitters left behind by extraterrestrial contractors.

Their perfect geometry, astronomical alignments and the mystery of how millions of stone blocks were hauled into place have spawned theories ranging from “time machines” to “GPS markers for starships”. Some believers say the blocks were moulded, not quarried – ancient 3D printing, if you will. Egypt's official story is less cinematic: human sweat, copper tools and a lot of rope did the job.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Unsolved+Mysteries","Exploration Mysteries: Oakville Blobs","https://explorersweb.com/exploration-mysteries-oakville-blobs/","Fri, 15 Aug 2025 18:20:47 GMT","

On Aug. 7, 1994, the quaint town of Oakville, Washington, with a population of just a few hundred, experienced some odd weather. Rain with a chance of disease-inducing blobs of goo hammered down. Nearly 30 years later, the mystery of the Oakville Blobs remains unsolved. 

When the heavens opened at 3 am that night, most of the residents of Oakville were asleep. The few who happened to be out realized that the water droplets were not water at all. Instead, their windscreen wipers were smearing an odd, gooey, gelatinous substance over the glass. Witnesses described the rain as having a jelly-like consistency. The blobs were translucent and as small as a grain of rice.

When dawn came and the town woke up, they found their lawns, roads, and roofs covered in the tiny blobs. The curious townsfolk picked them up to investigate and sent samples to private labs. But soon after touching them, dozens of people fell ill. Resident Dotty Hearn got an ear infection, vertigo, and a bad stomach ache. Others suffered flu-like symptoms.

Around town, animals started to die. Some reports described dead animals frothing at the mouth, which usually happens in cases of contact with poisonous substances, severe stress, or rabies.

Local medical authorities got to work immediately. Researcher Mike McDowell found that the blobs contained two species of bacteria, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Enterobacter cloacae, which are common in humans and animals. They aren't too harmful, causing minor inconveniences such as skin or urinary tract infections. They are not usually a cause for concern if treated. However, the bacteria should not make people violently ill, to the point of hospitalization. 

Visually, the blobs resemble a gelatinous substance called star jelly. Star jelly is a natural, though mysterious, occurrence that scientists still don't understand.

A popular theory is that star jelly comes from meteorites falling to Earth, and that little pieces form gelatinous substances as they fall through the atmosphere. Star jelly has also been attributed to frog spawn, algae, and slime molds.

One theory posited that the blobs were remnants of jellyfish dispersed into the atmosphere. Some speculated that military bombing exercises in the Pacific Ocean could have destroyed jellyfish populations and lifted their remains into the air. However, aside from how ridiculous the theory sounds, the Oakville Blobs allegedly contained cells without nuclei, which is inconsistent with the structure of jellyfish cells.

According to a newspaper article from the Palm Beach Post dated Aug. 21, 1994:

The jellyfish theory began when townsfolk learned the Air Force was dropping live bombs into the Pacific Ocean about 10 to 20 miles off the coast of Washington. The idea was that jellyfish remains might have been blown up into the clouds, where they were later dispersed in rainfall.

Oakville residents reported encountering strange men in suits frequenting local establishments and asking questions. This encouraged the notion that they were government officials covering up the incident.

One theory maintained that the blobs came from passing planes. The Palm Beach Post says:

Another suggestion was that the blobs were a form of waste from aircraft toilets, sometimes referred to as ‘blue ice.'

No conclusive evidence has been found to support any of these theories, and there are no preserved blob samples to study.

The people of Oakville did not panic, but ultimately looked on the event as a potential tourism bonanza. Residents wanted to:

start a jellyfish festival where they shoot jellyfish into town with a cannon…the town's tavern is also concocting a new drink, ‘the jellyfish' made of vodka, gelatine, and juice.

The hype eventually died down until April 2025, when The Chronicle, a newspaper based in Centralia, Washington, reported that residents of Rochester, just 16km from Oakville, reported blobs falling from the sky. This time, the townsfolk reported no illnesses.

Time: August 10th, 9:00 AMLocation: Southern Italy
    


      A few days ago, a friend of mine observed a very bright spot in the sky during the daytime. He filmed it on August 10th at 9:00 AM local time from southern Italy, using a 1000 mm mirror telephoto lens. He managed to capture the object on video. At first glance, it looks like a weather balloon, but we couldn't figure out what the other two objects orbiting around it were. If they were parts connected to the balloon and moved by the wind, they should be rotating in the same direction. The video has been stabilized, but due to the high magnification, it appears a bit shaky. One of the objects appears to be flashing. The black circles that seem to move are actually dust particles on the camera sensor.What could it be and has anyone seen something similar?

            A divided federal appeals court is allowing President Donald Trump to downsize the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at this time, siding with the administration on its plans to reshape government agencies and its employees.
    


            Groups that represent CFPB employees or use the agency to protect consumers from predatory banking sued months ago, after Trump replaced the agency's director shortly after he took office and the administration paused the CFPB's efforts. The administration then canceled the agency's lease for its headquarters building, and terminated or planned to cut more than 80% of the agency's workforce.
    


            A trial level judge in Washington, Amy Berman Jackson, quickly stepped in to block the near-shuttering of the agency. But on Friday, the DC Circuit decided employees of the agency would need to challenge their loss of employment in other venues outside of the federal court district court first.
    


            The appeals court, however, reiterated that some functions of the CFPB, like responding to consumer complaints, can't be shut down. But the ruling Friday took at face value the Trump administration's argument it hasn't decided to shut down the CFPB in full, and cited the lack of existence of a memo specifying that the CFPB would be closed.
    


            “We agree with the government that there was no reviewable decision to shut down the CFPB,”  Judge Greg Katsas wrote in the opinion. Katsas and Judge Neomi Rao, who were both appointed to the bench in Trump's first presidential term, split from Judge Nina Pillard, an Obama appointee, in making the decision.
    


            The decision doesn't go into effect immediately, the appeals court also said, giving the groups that sued the ability to seek more appeals.
    


            Pillard disagreed with her colleagues on the bench over lessening the role of the courts in the case.
    


            “The notion that courts are powerless to prevent the President from abolishing the agencies of the federal government that he was elected to lead cannot be reconciled with either the constitutional separation of powers or our nation's commitment to a government of laws,” she wrote.
    


            Established after the 2008 financial crisis, the CFPB has long been a target of conservatives wanting to undermine financial regulations championed by Democrats in Congress.
    


            More appeals are possible, as are additional legal decisions on the law governing the CFPB.
    


            “It will be cold comfort to Plaintiffs if they ultimately succeed on the merits in their challenge to the CFPB's shutdown only to discover that Defendants have put the agency in a hole from which it can never fully recover,” Pillard also wrote in her dissent. “That would be the effect of the agency's decisions to fire all or virtually all employees who once worked at the agency, terminate every contract that supported their work, purge all the data they amassed, and ghost all the experts and organizations with whom they had built up beneficial working relationships.”

In this article

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said Friday that he will investigate Meta following a report that the company approved rules allowing artificial intelligence chatbots to have certain ""romantic"" and ""sensual"" conversations with children.

Hawley called on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to preserve relevant materials, including emails, and said the probe would target ""whether Meta's generative-AI products enable exploitation, deception, or other criminal harms to children, and whether Meta misled the public or regulators about its safeguards.""

""Is there anything - ANYTHING - Big Tech won't do for a quick buck?"" Hawley said in a post on X announcing the investigation.

Meta declined to comment on Hawley's letter.

Hawley noted a Reuters report published Thursday that cited an internal document detailing acceptable behaviors from Meta AI chatbots that the company's staff and contract workers should permit as part of developing and training the software.

The document acquired by Reuters noted that a chatbot would be permitted to hold a romantic conversation with an eight-year-old, telling the child that ""every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply.""

The Meta guidelines said: ""It is acceptable to describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness (ex: 'your youthful form is a work of art'),"" according to the Reuters report.

The Meta chatbots would not be permitted to engage in more explicit conversations with children under 13 ""in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable,"" the report said.

""We intend to learn who approved these policies, how long they were in effect, and what Meta has done to stop this conduct going forward,"" Hawley wrote.

A Meta spokesperson told Reuters that ""The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.""

""We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors,"" the Meta spokesperson told Reuters.

Hawley said Meta must produce documents about its Generative AI-related content risks and standards, lists of every product that adheres to those policies, and other safety and incident reports.

Meta should also provide various public and regulatory communications involving minor safety and documents about staff members involved with the AI policies to determine ""the decision trail for removing or revising any portions of the standard.""

Hawley is chair of the Senate Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which will carry out the investigation.

Meta has until Sep. 19 to provide the documents, the letter said.

Articles Details

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- New York lawmakers proposed a 0.2% excise tax on crypto/NFT transactions via Assembly Bill 8966, effective September 1, 2025.

- The tax targets transaction facilitators, not individuals, to fund upstate school substance abuse programs.

- Critics warn it could reduce market liquidity, drive traders/businesses out of New York, and shift trading strategies toward long-term holdings.

- The measure reflects New York's evolving crypto regulation, following its 2015 BitLicense framework, but lacks broad industry feedback.

New York State lawmakers have introduced a proposal that would impose a 0.2% excise tax on digital asset transactions, including those involving cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The initiative, known as Assembly Bill 8966, was introduced by Assemblymember Phil Steck on August 13, 2025, and is scheduled to take effect on September 1, 2025 [1]. The tax will apply to both the sale and transfer of digital assets and will be levied on entities that facilitate these transactions, rather than on individual buyers or sellers [2].

The primary objective of the tax is to generate revenue to support substance abuse prevention and intervention programs in upstate New York schools [3]. Steck, the bill's sponsor, has emphasized the importance of addressing public health concerns, stating that expanding these programs is essential to the well-being of students. The proposal is part of a broader trend of governments exploring new ways to regulate and tax the rapidly growing digital asset market.

Despite the relatively low tax rate of 0.2%, analysts suggest that it could have a significant impact on high-frequency traders and those engaging in large-volume transactions. The added cost may discourage such activity within New York, potentially leading traders to shift operations to exchanges outside the state [5]. This could result in reduced liquidity and market activity in New York-based platforms, which in turn may affect the state's position as a hub for cryptocurrency innovation and technology [6].

Critics of the proposal warn that the tax could also deter blockchain startups and crypto businesses from operating in New York, pushing them to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. The regulatory burden, combined with the cost implications of the tax, might undermine the state's ability to attract and retain digital asset companies [6]. Furthermore, some observers have speculated that the tax could influence trading strategies, encouraging longer-term holding behaviors to minimize exposure to the new levy [7].

The introduction of Assembly Bill 8966 reflects the ongoing evolution of New York's regulatory approach to digital assets. Since the implementation of the BitLicense framework in 2015, the state has played a pivotal role in shaping cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. The proposed tax could represent another milestone in this regulatory journey, influencing how other states and jurisdictions approach taxation in the digital finance sector.

The bill has yet to receive widespread commentary from major exchanges or industry leaders, with only Steck publicly outlining its intent. However, as the proposal moves forward, it is likely to attract increased attention from both supporters and detractors within the crypto ecosystem. The outcome of the legislative process will have broader implications for the market dynamics and regulatory environment in New York and beyond.

Sometimes the most magical thing about a movie is seeing how it came together. We can watch the final product and feel however it makes us feel, but that's usually disconnected from all the work that went into it. You rarely think about the different takes, different conversations, and intense work that go into every single second. Especially a film's biggest, most important emotional moment.

James Gunn's Superman is now available to watch at home, and part of the release is a 60-minute special feature called “Adventures in Making Superman,” which features footage from on set. To show just how intimate the feature gets, Gunn shared the below nearly seven-minute clip on his social media. It's from during the filming of the film's emotional climax when Superman gives Lex Luthor the speech about his flaws and humanity. As you'll see, actor David Corenswet didn't quite connect with the words, so he and Gunn really dug into it on the day. Their conversation is almost as heartwarming as the resulting performance. Check it out.

That's just movie-making magic right there. Actor and director, challenging each other to get on the same page. Making sure that the delivery of the speech tracks with everything that happened before. Each being totally open to what the other is saying. Even though Gunn wrote the script and is directing, he's genuinely interested in Corenswet's thoughts. And when they get on the same page, it nearly brings tears to the eyes of the director and his producer-fellow DC Studios president, Peter Safran.

The rest of the documentary, and several other features, are on the digital release, which is available now. And, later, people who purchase will have their download updated with a Gunn director commentary and more. We've got the details here.
