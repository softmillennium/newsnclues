                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rental car startup Kyte has shut down nearly one year after slashing staff and exiting most of its cities in the United States. Kyte fell behind on some of its loans earlier this year, according to the notice. That caused the company's top lender to repossess and liquidate Kyte's vehicle fleet. While Kyte passed its customer list to Turo, a number of users who had prebooked trips before the shutdown have complained that they're stuck waiting on refunds for hundreds of dollars. Founded in 2019, Kyte provided on-demand rental cars that it also delivered directly to customers' homes. Kyte grew to 14 markets and raised more than $300 million in financing over its lifetime, and started billing itself as the “best competitor to Hertz.” The business started coming apart in 2024, Volk told TechCrunch last year. Kyte was struggling to generate free cash flow in markets like Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, D.C. Volk said his team explored selling the business but decided to restructure and focus on reaching profit in the two biggest markets of San Francisco and New York City. TrueCar founder Scott Painter pivoted away from vehicle subscriptions in 2024 after struggling to build up a business called Autonomy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research out today highlights how they captured—for the first time—footage of human embryo implantation right as it's happening. The new method may allow scientists to better understand why embryos so often fail to implant, and someday improve fertility treatment, the researchers say. “The reason that we want to start studying implantation is because implantation is the main roadblock in human reproduction,” study author Samuel Ojosnegros, lead researcher of IBEC's Bioengineering for Reproductive Health group, told Gizmodo. New Human-Like Synthetic Embryos Could Uncover Cause of Miscarriages, Scientists Say Scientists have certainly learned a lot over time about how the human embryo develops. But there have been limitations to this research, Ojosnegros notes. We've only been able to study the first few days of the human embryo in real time, prior to implantation. These animal models are an important tool, but they can only tell us so much about how humans develop in the womb. Implantation is the first step of gestation, and it's only after an embryo embeds into the uterus that a pregnancy is considered to have actually begun. The team, additionally led by scientists Amélie Godeau and Anna Seriola, created a material that could mimic the outer uterine tissue that an embryo attaches to for implantation. With their creation in hand, they were now able to microscopically record how the human embryo implants itself. They also studied mouse embryos for comparison and noticed some important differences. The researchers note that only about 30% of embryos (whether from natural birth or in vitro fertilization) make it all the way to being born, and of those that don't, most are lost during implantation or immediately after. So simply being able to see how the process unfolds could provide vital clues on how to prevent miscarriages or otherwise improve fertility. Simple Drug Combo Could Prevent Repeat Miscarriages, Study Suggests The researchers plan to continue to study the ins and outs of embryo implantation, but they're also hoping to standardize the materials used for this research so that others can conduct their own similar experiments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sometimes the most magical thing about a movie is seeing how it came together. We can watch the final product and feel however it makes us feel, but that's usually disconnected from all the work that went into it. You rarely think about the different takes, different conversations, and intense work that go into every single second. Especially a film's biggest, most important emotional moment. James Gunn's Superman is now available to watch at home, and part of the release is a 60-minute special feature called “Adventures in Making Superman,” which features footage from on set. To show just how intimate the feature gets, Gunn shared the below nearly seven-minute clip on his social media. As you'll see, actor David Corenswet didn't quite connect with the words, so he and Gunn really dug into it on the day. Actor and director, challenging each other to get on the same page. Each being totally open to what the other is saying. Even though Gunn wrote the script and is directing, he's genuinely interested in Corenswet's thoughts. And when they get on the same page, it nearly brings tears to the eyes of the director and his producer-fellow DC Studios president, Peter Safran. And, later, people who purchase will have their download updated with a Gunn director commentary and more. Did you enjoy watching Gunn direct this scene?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new report this week by The Verge is adding to the speculation that the company is preparing to tighten its return-to-office policy, potentially requiring most employees at its Redmond headquarters to be on-site at least three days a week starting in January. In response to an inquiry from GeekWire, a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that the company is reviewing its flexible work guidelines, as it has in the past, but said no final decisions have been made. This follows an earlier report by Business Insider along similar lines. All of this comes at a sensitive moment for Microsoft's workforce, which has been impacted by more than 15,000 job cuts globally since May — including more than 3,000 in Washington state — amid record capital spending on AI infrastructure. An RTO policy change could further trim Microsoft's workforce through attrition. Other companies that tightened RTO rules have seen a similar dynamic. Amazon, the Seattle region's other tech giant, brought employees back five days a week. The reports come as Microsoft continues a multiyear expansion and redevelopment of its Redmond headquarters, where seven new East Campus buildings are open and more are under construction as part of a 17-building project designed in part to encourage in-person collaboration and productivity. Survey by Blind finds 91% of Amazon employees not happy about return-to-office policy Microsoft cuts nearly 3% of global workforce, about 6,000 jobs, in latest push for efficiency Amazon parents who got used to remote flexibility are frustrated by new 5-day in-office policy</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The DSA's Downtown Revitalization Dashboard for August shows that worker foot traffic in July was 66% of July 2019's daily average — the highest rate of monthly worker foot traffic since February 2020. “Those circumstances ultimately will negatively affect the city's tax base if not urgently addressed.” In its Q2 report, commercial real estate company Colliers said Seattle's vacancy rate rose to 32.4%, up from 28.7% a year ago. The firm expects vacancy to rise further in the coming quarters but also said “improving RTO adherence and economic clarity could support stronger leasing activity in late 2025 and into 2026.” Colliers noted new leases in downtown Seattle for tech companies including Stackline (Madison Centre), Carta (Columbia Center), and Supio (Century Square). The company occupies three floors and there are plans to take over another next year, with room for 220 more workstations. Elsewhere, “AI House,” a first-in-the-nation hub designed to bring entrepreneurs, investors, students and community leaders together to enhance collaboration on artificial intelligence, got up and running this spring along the waterfront at Pier 70. Real estate firm JLL noted the vacancy created by global health nonprofit PATH, which moved from a 111,000-square-foot space downtown to new headquarters in the Fremont neighborhood. DSA has been in lockstep with Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell about boosting downtown activity. Seattle is two years into Harrell's Downtown Activation Plan to revitalize the city core post-pandemic, but the mayor is facing a tough re-election battle against challenger Katie Wilson. According to her website, the mayoral candidate said she supports a potential vacancy tax for commercial property owners and office-to-housing conversions.

I've got 3D printers and lots of low-power single board computer (SBC) and related items in my office, so what do I do with them? Of course I had the crazy idea to 3D print my own file / media server. I'm not designing this from scratch, rather I am using the excellent Modular Attached Storage Stack (MASS) from Haydn Bao. MASS is a compact and modular NAS enclosure that has been designed by Bao to print on many of the best budget 3D printers. I printed 99% of my parts using an Elegoo Centauri Carbon, and 1.5KG of Elegoo Rapid PETG filament. Because it prints TPU (flexible filament) extremely well and I need four feet to stop the case sliding around the desk. The brains for this project is a LattePanda Mu with an Intel N100 and a mini-ITX motherboard. I'll be installing a Linux based operating system and to manage the drive, OpenMediaVault. Right now, I have a plethora of 3D printed parts which have been printed over the past week. I'll have a breakdown of the times and amount of filament used over the entire build process, and I will have links to key tools and products used so you can make your own. I know what you are going to ask. The simple answer is, because I can and I want to give my Elegoo Centauri Carbon a real project so it can show just how good it is. So join me in this live blog as I show you the ups and downs of 3D printing your own NAS device. Raise your hand if you thought the 3D printing was going to be the hardest part? The 3D printed MASS case has been an absolute joy and I am happy to throw $27 to the designer for such a great experience. It 3D printed extremely well, went together with ease and it looks and feels like a super expensive piece of kit. The LattePanda Mu is a great Intel N100 board, and the full evaluation board is essentially a mini-ITX motherboard, but the port placement is terrible for this project. So I'll be looking for an alternative over the next few weeks. Add to that the SATA port issue, requiring a BIOS update and DIP switch settings changes, means that I spent far too much time chasing issues than having fun. I got there in the end, but for 24 hours I was slowly losing my confidence in the project. OpenMediaVault is a powerful piece of software and well worth investing your time and effort into. For now I am going to slowly fill up this new server and understand more about what it can do for my workflow. Its largely been great fun, apart from the moments of sheer terror and panic as I tried to fix multiple problems that were ultimately there from the start. You've all been patient, thanks for following me along this rollercoaster of a live blog! The 4TB drive is connected and ready to share across my network. Before you do anything, change the default admin password from openmediavault to something less likely to get hacked. The drive should be listed, if not, click on the spyglass to search for it. Select the drive and click on wipe (second icon) to wipe the drive ready for use. Obviously do not delete data that you want to keep. Click on Storage >> File Systems and click on the + to create a new file system. Click on the Device, and then Save. Go back to Storage >> File Systems and click on the Play button to mount an existing file system. Select your freshly created file system and make sure to write the configuration changes (big yellow banner warning.) I also set the permissions so that anyone can read and write from the shared folder. In a production environment I would not do that, I would create groups and users with granular levels of access and permissions. Scroll down to Save and then write the pending changes. Click on the + to create a new share. Add any extra features such as a Recycle Bin, then click Save and write the configuration changes. Now create a user who can log in to the shared folder. Now open the Windows File Manager and click on Network. The server, OPENMEDIAVAULT should be there. Double click on the drive and enter your user details. The shared folder "Fileshare" is available, and we can store our files on the network drive. Yes, finally something has gone right! All it took was digging out a "spare" 4TB NVMe SSD and PCIe adapter, reflashing the OpenMediaVault (OMV) ISO image to a USB drive (it went really weird and buggy), installing OMV to the eMMC of the LattePanda Mu, then setting up the 4TB drive in OMV, then Samba / SMB. The share works across my Windows 10 and Ubuntu 24.04 systems and this, finally, makes me happy! I have a lot of spare PC parts laying around, but sadly only two Mini ITX motherboards. I'm having BIOS flashing issues, I borked it once, didn't fancy fixing it all over again. So I have gone to plan D. Using a PCIe based breakout board. I have plenty of these, but the free MASS case design is not compatible, I would need to print the premium model and sadly I do not have time. I wanted to use the spare 3.5 inch 4TB Seagate drive that resides in a drawer, but alas that is not destined to be. So lets get this drive installed, OpenMediaVault re-installed and get this project over the line! I powered up the server with the USB installed, and logged in, no remote SSH connections here, I am sat right in front of the server. So, I booted from Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS via my Ventoy USB flash drive, created for the PC First Aid Toolkit. I then mount the USB drive, copy the contents to the Desktop and then make a file called FPT executable via chmod that'll work, right? The 3D printing part of this project was super smooth, enabling SATA on the LattePanda Mu Full Evaluation Carrier Board is not. Looking in the manual for the Lattepanda Mu Full Evaluation Board (dev board) it seems that SATA is only enabled if... Welcome to the final day for this project, and I've not got much time to diagnose the SATA issue, so lets crack on! The LattaPanda Mu development board has its own BIOS, and so does the Mu itself. Because those BIOS cannot see the Ethernet ports and a NAS without Ethernet is a bit useless. Also a NAS with no SATA storage is equally as useless. My plan is to check the BIOS for any weird things that I have missed. I've got an old WD Black 1TB NVMe SSD and I use it for testing PCIe performance on single board computers. I wondered if NVMe was working on the board, so I grabbed an M.2 to PCIe adapter and plugged it in. I tried a readily available SATA SSD, just to see if the system could see that. I've inserted the hard disk, a spare Seagate 4TB drive that I used with building Raspberry Pi powered NAS. The connections for power and data have been done, and the HDD retainer is in place so my drive should now tumble to an untimely death. An ultra quiet Noctua NF-P14S Redux 140mm, 1500 PWM fan has been connected and is set to force cool air in from the bottom of the case, over the hard drive(s) and to the N100 which has its own cooling system. So why doesn't OpenMediaVault see the drive? I think I need to check the manual to see if the SATA ports are enabled by default. I checked the motherboard manual, there is a jumper to change, just next to the clock battery. I changed it to enable SATA ports 1 and 2. The HDD sliders, best printed in TPU but I chose PETG because I didn't read that bit, fix to the screw points on your chosen 3.5 inch hard disk drive. But if you get them the wrong way round, the screw heads will not slide into the channel and you will get a 20 minute headache, well I did anyway. You'll need some M3.5 screws, common in PC builds, to secure the slider to the drive. There is no other mechanical means to secure the drive. In this case, please don't tip your server until everything is secure and in place. The bay module is where up to four 3.5 inch hard disk drives will be slotted into place. The module is made from two 3D printed halves, front and back. The instructions say to use four screws, but there are eight screw holes. I put four in, and everything is solid. If you've got spare screws, go for eight and pray that you never need to open it up. Screw access is tight, you'll need a long PH2 screwdriver to get down there. Luckily I have a Wera Vario that can just get into the recesses. Everything is assembled, but I have one last job to do. This could've been generated by moisture in the filament (but it was a brand new, unopened pack), retraction settings, or even Z-hop. To clean them up I use a hot air rework station (something I reviewed for the best soldering irons and stations page) at 150C and 50% air speed to melt the wisps away. Do be careful doing this, you don't want to damage your print, or more importantly, yourself! Ok, so I have OpenMediaVault (OMV) installed on the eMMC drive of the LattePanda Mu and all appears to be working. I erroneously thought that I could install OMV inside of Ubuntu Server, but according to the website I need to download a specific ISO and install using that. I've built OMV servers before, but they were always built around a Raspberry Pi and so my brain thought that was the process. Its installed, so now I can consider the test complete, and now I can move on to building the drive bays! After taking the front panel off I have access to the USB ports and I can boot from a copy of Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS Server and install the OS before moving onward. I've connected up the server to my Elecrow CrowView Note, a laptop with no brains and designed to interface with a Raspberry Pi on Nvidia Jetson. But with the right cables you can connect anything to it, including this server! I chose to install Ubuntu on to the 64GB eMMC drive that comes with the N100, it should be fast enough for booting and running the OS. If not, there is an M.2 NVMe option that I can use. I thought the project was dead before it got going. I want to install Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS on the LattePanda Mu. I tried plugging in a USB C Steam Deck dock into the solitary USB C port. This is an example of a concept that I used to teach. I really should take my own advice, sometimes! In my haste yesterday, I forgot to talk about the quickest 3D print in the project. clips that insert in to cut-outs around the case. They simply push into the space designed for them If you need to take the top panel off, use a guitar plectrum, Lego brick separator or a plastic spudger. I wouldn't use metal as it will damage the plastic. Ok, my next job is to do a smoke test on the build. Then install a Linux OS to make sure that all of this work hasn't been wasted. I did not expect the build to come out like this. I am truly stunned, and I can't wait to start work on the next part, the drive bays which can hold up to four 3.5 inch drives, and it even has rails to pull the drives in and out of the bays! I'm actually enjoying it, no hype or hint of falsehood, I am having a great time. First of all I inserted some M3 nylon standoffs into the top and bottom sections of the APU where my LattePanda board resides. Because my other brass M3 standoffs weren't long enough so I had to improvise. Don't make my mistake, get yourself a selection of screws for PC case building. Mine are on the way from Amazon. Following the instructions, I'm using M3 20mm self tapping countersunk screws to secure the 3D printed sections together. When screwing into plastic, make sure that you are committed to the task, unscrewing and re-screwing will only weaken the build. Personally, I would've liked to have seen threaded inserts melted into the screw holes, but time and talent did not allow this time. I lined up the screws, and carefully screwed them in until I felt them "bite". To do this I used a small Wera ratcheting screwdriver from my PC first aid tool kit, which also has a 3D printed project hidden inside it. Once they are lined up, I bring out the big guns. The HOTO Electric Screwdriver that myself and a few other editors own. I now carry on with the build process, I have clips and case sides to add. The LattePanda Mu's Mini ITX development board sadly does not have common ATX-style power connectors, but it does have a 5525 DC barrel jack for an external power brick. It also has a power button on the motherboard, so what is my problem? Well, the rear panel of the MASS case has a breakout for a 16mm push button, or a standard PC key switch but the LattePanda development board doesn't have a conventional breakout for power buttons, case LEDs etc. I dug out my trusty UNI-T UT58C multimeter, set it to continuity, and probed the four test points with the power off! So I soldered on some wires, and tested the connection with a 16mm button from my collection. Better mechanical grip and they reduce the risk of shorts. I tested this setup before committing to the wiring, and all went well so I made the fix permanent using some Kapton tape and better soldering. Haydn Bao's Modular Attached Storage Stack (MASS) project oozes quality. From the 3D printable models to the instructions, I can see that I will have a lot of fun building this kit. The MASS Instructables and project page show off both the free and premium versions of the kit and Bao is meticulous in detailing the differences, so that we have an informed choice as to what model we want to print. Optional mounts for 2x2.5" drives in a 3.5" bay Optional: use keyboard switch as power button Optional: use keyboard switch as power button I downloaded the free kit and opened the ZIP archive and found lots of parts to print and an optional section (which I used for a few parts) for parts to augment your build. Loading these parts into a slicer, in my case Elegoo's fork of Orca Slicer, Elegoo Slicer, and I can clearly see that these parts have been designed with ease of printing in mind. They come pre-oriented for best printing and Bao has designed supports directly into the parts. A great mix that illustrates the build process in words and pictures. How to attach the parts together, their orientation, what screws to use and advising on optional parts for your build. Now, I have to use them to build my server, but first I need to perform a little surgery on my LattePanda Mu, specifically the power button!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House has created a spreadsheet that rates hundreds of companies for their loyalty, according to a new report from Axios. And while that may not be entirely shocking news, given Donald Trump's way of doing business, it's worth stepping back and asking how news of a loyalty scorecard by a sitting president would've been received in the pre-Trump era. The rankings on the loyalty spreadsheet are currently determined by a given company's perceived support of the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, a budget package that passed in July and is poised to strip healthcare from at least 17 million people while lowering taxes on the wealthiest Americans. That support is gauged by social media posts, press releases, ads, and more, according to Axios. The spreadsheet reportedly contains 553 companies and trade organizations, each getting one of three ratings of support for Trump: Strong, moderate, or low. Examples of companies that were “good partners,” according to Axios, include Uber, DoorDash, United, Delta, AT&T, and Cisco. And while it's entirely possible the rankings are solely determined by public displays of support, it's impossible to ignore the financial contributions those companies have often made to Trump. AT&T, Delta, United, Uber, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi each contributed $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, according to CNBC. Cisco didn't donate to Trump's inauguration, but spoke glowingly about the president shortly after he was elected in 2024. Trump has insisted on fealty to his far-right agenda and has set out to crush anyone who doesn't fall in line. That includes some of the largest companies in America, which have dutifully met with Trump to kiss the ring and sing his praises. And Axios notes it will be used whenever lobbyists approach the Trump regime with requests. “If groups/companies want to start advocating more now for the tax bill or additional administration priorities, we will take that into account in our grading,” the White House official is quoted as telling Axios. It all sounds like a mafia-style operation, of course. Trump has always been a transactional president and isn't shy about shaking down anyone who he thinks isn't sufficiently deferential to his whims. Even if Trump doesn't like someone, he seems willing to bring them back into the “loyal” camp as long as they play along. For example, Trump recently criticized the CEO of Intel, Lip-Bu Tan, calling him “highly conflicted” and insisting he needed to resign over supposed ties to China. Tan denied the allegations, met with Trump, and now we have reports from Bloomberg that the U.S. government might take a stake in Intel and might use funds from the Chips Act to do it. Unfortunately, Trump's empire isn't just his collection of private businesses these days. Trump is also working on getting a 15% cut from Nvidia and AMD on chips shipped to China in what's being characterized as a “revenue-sharing agreement.” That deal seems unconstitutional, according to Fortune, but that doesn't seem like it will matter in the long run. The U.S. public was absolutely scandalized when it learned of President Richard Nixon's enemies list in 1973. But in the second Trump era, this kind of loyalty ranking from the White House is just a tiny drop in an ocean of bizarre news that defies the norms of another age.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Smart ring maker Ultrahuman is acquiring women's health technology company viO HealthTech to launch advanced cycle and ovulation tracking, the company announced on Friday. Thanks to the acquisition, the company is launching a new plug-in for the Ultrahuman Ring AIR called “Cycle and Ovulation Pro.” The plug-in will allow users to accurately track their cycles, get fertility planning support with ovulation confirmation, and detect patterns like early or late ovulation. Cycle and Ovulation Pro use a temperature-sensing algorithm originally developed for viO's OvuSense fertility monitors. “Most menstrual tracking platforms are built for women with regular 28-day cycles,” Ultrahuman wrote in a press release. “In reality, the majority have diverse cycle patterns — and those with conditions like non-bleeding, PCOS, endometriosis, or thyroid disorders often don't get an accurate or supportive experience. Ultrahuman notes that the existing free Cycle & Ovulation PowerPlug, which offers foundational tracking tools and calendar-based predictions, will remain available. Cycle and Ovulation Pro is available starting Friday as a premium PowerPlug in the Ultrahuman app for $3.99 per month or $39.99 per year for users in the U.S., U.K., EU, Australia, and Canada.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since launching in May 2023, ChatGPT's app for iOS and Android devices has reached $2 billion in global consumer spending, according to a new analysis by app intelligence provider Appfigures. Grok's average monthly consumer spending is estimated at $3.6 million, or 1.9% of ChatGPT's. This data suggests that other consumer chatbots still have a way to go to catch up with ChatGPT's dominance on mobile devices, even if the numbers don't provide a complete picture of the AI companies' overall revenue. Consumers, teams, and businesses can also subscribe to AI plans on the web, and the companies generate revenue in other ways, too, like via their APIs. Rather, this new data offers a window into the apps' traction with consumers, who discover and pay for these AI assistants via the mobile app stores. It's also worth noting that when xAI's Grok launched in November 2023 (after ChatGPT), Grok didn't initially have stand-alone iOS or Android apps. Grok only became available on mobile devices through its own iOS app as of early January 2025 and has been on Google Play since March 4. Still, ChatGPT's lifetime global spending per download is $2.91, compared to Claude's $2.55, Grok's $0.75, and Copilot's $0.28, Appfigures found. Germany is the second-largest market, accounting for 5.3% of ChatGPT's lifetime total spending. ChatGPT's lead can also be seen in terms of downloads. (That puts X owner Elon Musk's recent complaints about the App Store's alleged favoritism of ChatGPT in its Top Charts into better context.) In 2025 so far, ChatGPT's app has been downloaded 318 million times, or 2.8x more than the 113 million it saw during the same period last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GeekWire's startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. And this time, I'm also getting in on the fun with “Taylor's Take” — my quick thoughts on each company are below. It also taps into AI to provide guidance for meal plans, shopping, and cooking. VC View from Jessica Kamada: “Deglaze is for the cooking/baking enthusiast who finds joy in the kitchen, but wants to make it as efficient as possible. Deglaze differentiates itself from other ‘meal planning/cooking' apps in the productivity category like Ollie by leaning more heavily into the emerging category of niche interest communities (i.e. Auggie) with surprise & delight consumer features like ‘cook mode' and a community feel where users can follow their favorite chefs. As a freemium app, the monetization at scale is a concern, but if they can monetize their cooking creator community of chefs, they may be on to something.” Taylor's Take: I can see this being beneficial for a wide range of users — from those who just want to organize grocery lists and meal plans, to more experienced cooks who love following recipes. The app seems ripe for various revenue models, and this is an experienced founding team. He was also a solutions architect at IT services company Denali. A new generation and diverse population was introduced to the game. With multiple new apparel brands (Malbon, Eastside Golf) making golf cool again, the modern golfer may be open to technology that supports their new hobby. The question is if GolfGuiders can grow the community large enough to evolve from a free app to a premium must-have golf companion.” Taylor's Take: I'm a big-time golfer, so this one caught my attention. But I'm not sure what would make me stick around on the app, or get me opening it on a daily basis. There's also stiff competition from existing golf apps such as 18Birdies. I do like the idea of more specialized media and community networks that focus on a topic. The business: A back-end platform for AI coding agents. Insforge provides authentication, databases, storage, functions, real-time updates, and more — all optimized for AI agents rather than human developers. The company generates revenue off subscriptions and has raised $1.5 million to date. Leadership: CEO Hang Huang was a senior product manager at Amazon and earned his MBA from Yale last year. CTO Tony Chang was a software developer at Databricks. As a consumer investor, I'm investing in companies that would be customers of Insforge. Agentic infrastructure like Insforge will be paramount to teams reaching that future faster.” Taylor's Take: This one combines a bunch of hot trends — AI agents, virtual coders, natural language commands, infrastructure, etc. The software aims to turn tedious scrolling into a visual-first curated experience. Leadership: Founder Zeynab Raeesy spent more than seven years at Amazon in applied science roles. There is an obvious market opportunity in fashion search and shopping agents, as new fashion brands come online constantly, making consumers heads spin. However, new players are entering the market quickly with big investment behind them such as Daydream and Doji. The pie is likely big enough for multiple players. Taylor's Take: Shopping for clothes online could really use a refresh, and perhaps AI will shake things up. I'm curious about the business model and whether this could be used as a white-label solution for online shops. If things go well, this could be ripe for an acquisition by a larger retailer wanting to offer customers a more personalized experience. Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI data centers demand gigawatts of power that the U.S. grid is struggling to supply. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A U.S. analyst of Chinese technology said that the country has already solved its energy problem — at least in terms of power for its AI infrastructure. Rui Ma, founder of Tech Buzz China, posted on X that the country's massive investments in advanced hydropower and nuclear technologies meant that its “electricity supply is secure and inexpensive.” This is in contrast to the U.S., where many AI data centers are disrupting its electricity grid and supply, resulting in a lack of supply and price increases for every user. In the U.S., it has come to the point that tech giants are building their own power plants — with Elon Musk importing one to power his data centers and companies, like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, Nvidia, and more investing in the research and development of nuclear reactors. However, it seems that this is not a problem for China. More than that, it's also continually expanding its output, with one expert telling the publication that it “adds more electricity demand than the entire annual consumption of Germany, every single year.” Some argue that the power is delivered by heavily polluting coal plants, but China is also investing massively in renewable energy projects. In fact, the new data centers are welcomed, as they help stimulate demand in a market that has an excess of power production. Nevertheless, electricity oversupply doesn't seem to be an immediate concern, as most of China's power plants are state-owned. Beijing also plans its energy production well in advance, allowing it to prepare for prospective demand, like the AI data center boom. Beijing is developing a network to create a marketplace that will sell surplus capacity, but it is still facing challenges, especially with latency and different ecosystems. Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg said that power constraints will limit AI growth, and that new power plants aren't being built fast enough to satisfy AI's insatiable demand. If the U.S. does not address this issue sooner, it risks lagging behind China even if it has more powerful and efficient hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The mastermind behind RRR, the incredible blast of a Tollywood blockbuster that caused an international craze, S.S. Rajamouli, is making his cinematic return. And while it's not for the long-gestating sequel talk for RRR, the filmmaker promises a new icon set to speed his way across the world in his next film, seemingly potentially called Globetrotter, starring Telugu movie star Mahesh Babu. I mean, a motorcycle revs up on some ancient ruins, with pans that don't reveal Babu's look for the film. The anticipation is killing us because, in between shots of locations of an epic scale, sleek action, and a giant swinging spiked ball (Indiana Jones‘ boulder found rolling itself back into its cave), the title cards promise a “new magnum opus riding soon” and a full trailer we can't seem to find! Don't go to YouTube to try; you'll find a ton of AI-generated “notion” concept dupes masquerading as the real thing. Back in 2022, during promotion for RRR, Rajamouli described the upcoming picture as such: “My next film with Mahesh Babu will be a globetrotting action adventure. It's going to be a kind of James Bond or Indiana Jones film with Indian roots,” the director said in a quote shared by The Hindustan Times. That's definitely the vibe we got from this teaser, and we are already seated if we're getting a kick-ass Bond-meets-Jones spy hero, served in an RRR-style multi-genre seven-layer-cake treat of a movie. RRR was based on a family story concept that mashed up two historic cultural Indian legends played by N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan, but here they channel action spectacle that also feels a bit like it has Mission Impossible franchise potential. The poster for what's known as Globetrotter touts a first reveal in November of 2025, and we hope that's on an international scale. Stay tuned here at io9 for more updates on Globetrotter… if that's what the film is even called by the time we learn more.

Powered by a jet-engine-inspired motor and a physics tendency called the Coanda effect, it offered six ways to style your hair with (supposedly) minimal heat damage. At the time, there was nothing else like it. HairTok and beauty editors everywhere were sold. Dyson now sells three versions of its Airwrap, and the market is saturated with dupes and competitors at a fraction of the price. After testing it for several weeks on my long, frizz-prone hair, I can say it's faster, smarter, and easier to use; but it's not necessarily a must-have if you already have a decent multistyler. Dyson's new Co-anda 2x comes in two finishes—ceramic pink and jasper plum—and is available in two configurations tailored to your hair type: straight+wavy and curly+coily. Both kits come with six attachments and a presentation case. Visually, it looks a lot more like the Airwrap ID than the original Airwrap, and it feels noticeably lighter in hand. The wand itself is slimmer and more compact, which makes it easier to maneuver during longer sessions. I could rough-dry my roots in about three minutes, which is about two minutes faster than usual. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Each attachment is embedded with RFID chips that auto-adjust heat and airflow based on your last-used settings. Not a revolutionary change, but it is nice not to have to toggle settings every time I switch attachments. You can also pair it with Dyson's app, which offers tutorials based on your hair type and goals. It's a cleaner look, but it can get finicky if you're used to adjusting settings mid-styling. If you've already purchased previous Airwrap attachments, unfortunately, they're not compatible with this new model due to its slimmer design. Also, like most Dyson tools sold in the US, it's 120-volt only, so don't plan on packing it for your Euro vacay. I used the Co-anda 2x on freshly washed, sometimes air-dried hair for three weeks, cycling through each attachment to see how it held up against its predecessors. I've used the original Airwrap off and on, and I've tested other multistylers, like the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) and the T3 Aire 360 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). This bundle comes with six attachments: a pre-styling dryer, a round brush, 1.2- and 1.6-inch curling barrels, an anti-snag loop brush, and—my personal favorite—the new Airsmooth straightener. The curly+coily kit swaps in a diffuser and tension comb instead of the Airsmooth and 1.2-inch curling barrel. It smoothed and curled my ends into soft C-bends in under 20 minutes. The heat was gentle enough that my hair didn't feel singed afterward. I didn't get flat-iron-level glassiness, but it was close enough for a polished look. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The loop brush and round brush both felt upgraded, with longer bristles that don't snag or tug at damp ends. I got solid volume and frizz control from both, and they felt gentler at my roots. The curling barrels were redesigned with squared-like tips, which makes them easier to grip, but the results were the same: airy curls that deflated within a couple of hours unless I sprayed them stiff with hairspray. That's always been my biggest gripe with the Airwrap. It's better at blowouts than long-lasting curls, and the technology hasn't improved on that front. What I appreciated most was not having to fiddle with settings every time I swapped attachments. If you already own an Airwrap or a decent dupe, you don't need to upgrade. But if you don't own a multistyler, and have the budget to spare, this is the version I'd buy. It's undeniably expensive, but you get the smoothest Airwrap to date.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. 3D printing technology is evolving at breakneck speed, and features considered cushy add-ons five years ago are now becoming everyday essentials. I checked my notes, and during my time at Tom's Hardware, I have reviewed one hundred 3D printers, both resin and FDM. I'm well past that number if you also count several machines that we had to pass on due to unforeseen circumstances, or the handful of personal printers I acquired for fun. The features I look for have evolved over the years, and many that come standard on some new printers used to require you to manually modify your machine. I started printing with the popular 2017 Creality CR10S, which swiftly became well-modded. It needed an upgraded hotend, a Raspberry Pi for Octoprint, Capricorn tubes, a custom spool holder, bed leveling wheels, and, after flinging its glass plate to the floor, a new magnetically attached flexible PEI build plate. Modding your 3D printer was common practice back then, especially if you had an Ender. When I reviewed 2022's new “luxury” Ender 3 S1 Pro, I had to explain that the exorbitant $479 price tag was because it included about $350 worth of mods. Ironically, my “no mods needed” Ender 3 S1 Pro didn't stay stock for long. It's still my favorite machine for running TPU because it's slow, steady, and has an extruder that grabs filament like a pitbull. A new machine launches, looking like the pinnacle of perfection, but give it a year, and manufacturers will come up with something faster, smarter, bigger, or more colorful, and we pull out our wallets once again. Looking back at these last 100 reviews, I've come up with a list of the best 3D printing mods that have become non-negotiable standards. If I wanted to scare a group of makers around an evening bonfire, I would weave a tale of blood-curdling horror: 3D printers without auto bed leveling. If your first printer was a Bambu Lab, you've been spared the pain of manual bed leveling. Even early Prusa MK2s with their fancy, built-in PINDA probes might require a “live adjust Z” to perfect the print. Cheap printers often compounded the problem by shipping with warped beds that needed to be physically shimmed with layers of tape or tinfoil. Now we have an assortment of probes, sensors, and lasers to analyze a printer's surface and save an accurate bed mesh for future reference. Early machines often had permanently fixed print surfaces, or if you were lucky, a stiff plate clipped in place. Go back a bit further, and printers didn't even have heaters. Plates might be optimized for adhesion, but not removal. Successfully printing on a glass bed without the use of glue stick, painter's tape, or hairspray was something to brag about. Pioneered by Wham Bam Systems, flexible plates with a variety of coatings for every filament are now the norm. Today, I'd be shocked to find a 3D printer without some kind of miracle-coated flex plate. I wrote a whole list of my favorite aftermarket build plates here. We can thank Klipper for the original mod, which added extra processing power to the 8-bit boards on early 3D printers through an external Raspberry Pi. Klipper gave machines a performance boost by offloading motion planning to the Pi and adding input shaping and pressure advance for smoother prints at speed. My old Ender 3 S1 Pro went from trudging along at 45mm/s to a zippy 150mm/s with this accessory. Now, manufacturers are putting bigger brains in their machines and using either Klipper or a homebrew version of input shaping. Again, we can thank Bambu Lab for making a popular mod standard issue: remote access. If you were already adding a Pi for Klipper, why not use OctoPrint, too? Fun Fact: In the early days, Wi-Fi wasn't added because people were too lazy to walk an SD card over to their printer. It was also done because many 3D printers used a cheap Micro SD Card, a tiny sliver of plastic that was easily lost on your desk, in your couch cushions, or in the huge gap between the card slot and the printer case. Gaining remote access to your 3D printer meant never looking for a lost micro SD card again. Even the extremely budget-priced Elegoo Centauri Carbon came with a decent, if poorly lit, camera. Combined with our new obsession with mobile apps, you can check your print progress from upstairs, the office, or even the grocery store. Gone are the days of converting security cameras into printing babysitters, though Prusa Research will still let you use an old iPhone to monitor machines through Prusa Connect if you're feeling old school. 3D printing in full, glorious color used to be a pipe dream. In 2021, I dreamed of saving up for a Mosaic Palette, which could feed eight colors to my little Ender 3 Pro. Needless to say, turning an Ender into a tool changer to draw on your prints was difficult and didn't work well. I'm happy to report that printing in 4, 5, or 25 colors is now pretty easy, if not cheap. Click here if you want to see our current favorite picks for multicolor 3D printers, and taste that rainbow.

Dubbed the “microwave brain,” this experimental processor can juggle two jobs at once: crunching ultrafast data streams and talking wirelessly, all inside a footprint small enough for a smartwatch. Traditional chips march data through binary logic gates in sync with a clock. Cornell's design instead pushes information through tunable microwave waveguides, letting patterns emerge and be recognized in real time at tens of gigahertz with no waiting or bottlenecks. Each waveguide acts like a “physical neuron,” where the microwave signal's amplitude, phase, and frequency can be shaped to represent data features. These features interact and interfere with each other in the analog domain, producing a rich set of patterns before the signal is ever digitized. This physical mixing and propagation essentially perform the feature extraction and transformation that digital networks usually achieve through multiple software layers. Instead of storing values in memory and repeatedly performing huge numbers of calculations, it lets the microwave network itself handle the heavy lifting. Crucially, that accuracy held steady across both simple and complex jobs, without the extra circuitry and error correction digital systems typically require. Because the hardware is naturally sensitive to changes in signal behavior, its uses extend beyond AI computation. It could watch for anomalies in wireless traffic, track radar targets, or decode crowded radio channels. With further refinements, the team believes it could even sit inside personal devices, running local AI models without leaning on cloud servers.
