                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SharpLink reported $103 million in net losses for the three-month period ending on June 30—a stark contrast to its nearly $12 million net income during the same quarter last year. The report marks SharpLink's first earnings report since the firm announced its pivot to an Ethereum-centered corporate strategy in May. SharpLink's executives attributed the recent losses to a $87.8 million non-cash impairment loss on its LSE holdings, a tokenized version of staked ETH that allows holders to use their tokens while earning rewards for locking them up on the Ethereum network. They also pointed to stock-based compensation linked to their strategic advisory agreement with blockchain infrastructure firm Consensys worth $16.4 million. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) “So there's no confusion for our investors, I want to state plainly that this… is a non-cash loss and is a result of the company following the current accounting practices,” SharpLink Gaming Chief Financial Officer Robert DeLucia said Friday on an earnings call with analysts. Ethereum ETF Inflows Outpace Bitcoin ETFs for Fifth Straight Day The company's lackluster earnings came as Ethereum's price slid below $4,400 earlier Friday, just a day after coming within striking distance of its record price of more than $4,800. The retracement followed a hotter-than-expected producer-price index report and amid handwringing over U.S. President Donald Trump's meeting on Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The tokens are worth a combined $3.23 billion as of writing time, according to data provider CoinGecko.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- Stellar Lumens (XLM) emerges as institutional capital reshapes crypto markets in 2025, transitioning from niche remittance tool to global financial infrastructure. - Technical analysis highlights XLM's $0.42 support and $0.50 breakout potential, with institutional buyers targeting $0.60–$0.77 as key resistance is breached. The cryptocurrency market has long been a playground for retail speculation, but 2025 marks a pivotal shift as institutional capital begins to reshape the landscape. Among the most compelling narratives is that of Stellar Lumens (XLM), a blockchain platform poised to capitalize on surging demand for scalable, low-cost cross-border solutions. Stellar's appeal to institutional investors lies in its unique value proposition: a decentralized network capable of processing 1,000 transactions per second at near-zero cost. This has attracted major players such as PayPal, which launched its stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), on the Stellar network in June 2025. By leveraging Stellar's infrastructure, PayPal aims to expand its “PayFi” ecosystem, enabling seamless remittances and everyday payments for millions of users. Similarly, Societe Generale-FORGE (SG-FORGE) has integrated its EUR-backed stablecoin, EURCV, onto Stellar, aligning with EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) regulations. The Stellar network's Total Value Locked (TVL) surged 80% to $150 million in Q2 2025, driven by corporate and institutional participation. Active enterprise wallets now number 9.69 million, with 5,000–6,000 new institutional addresses added daily. For instance, Taurus, a digital asset infrastructure provider, launched custody and issuance platforms on Stellar, offering institutional-grade security for tokenized assets. XLM's price action in Q2 2025 has been nothing short of remarkable. After a 261.12% 24-hour surge, the token has consolidated within a $0.42–$0.43 range, with institutional buyers consistently stepping in at the $0.42 support level. Technical analysts highlight a critical breakout above the descending trendline, with Fibonacci extensions and Elliott Wave models pointing to a near-term target of $0.47. If XLM breaches $0.50—a key psychological and technical resistance—further gains to $0.60–$0.77 are likely. Stellar's partnerships with IBM, MoneyGram, and Flutterwave have cemented its role in cross-border remittances, reducing transaction costs by up to 70% compared to traditional banks. In emerging markets, where financial inclusion remains a challenge, Stellar's collaboration with Tala and UNDP has enabled non-custodial wallets and blockchain-based microfinance solutions. These initiatives not only expand Stellar's user base but also validate its utility in real-world applications. Regulatory alignment has been a cornerstone of Stellar's institutional appeal. This is particularly critical in jurisdictions like the EU and the U.S., where MICA and SEC regulations demand rigorous compliance frameworks. Its institutional-grade infrastructure, regulatory readiness, and strategic partnerships position it as a key player in the tokenization of real-world assets and cross-border finance. However, caution is warranted: the crypto market remains volatile, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and regulatory shifts could impact momentum. Entry Points: Consider accumulating near the $0.42–$0.43 support zone, with a stop-loss below $0.40 to mitigate downside risk.3. As institutional capital continues to flow into the ecosystem, XLM's breakout potential is not just a technical possibility but a structural inevitability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Reserve continued its relaxation of crypto oversight on Friday with a move to shut down a two-year-old supervisory program intended to keep a special eye on banks' crypto ties, instead folding that task back to its day-to-day oversight work. In April, the Federal Reserve withdrew its earlier crypto guidance that directed bankers to get approvals from the government supervisors before engaging in new crypto activity. The initiative followed closely in the aftermath of the 2023 crisis in which three U.S. lenders closely associated with technology and crypto clients — Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank — failed about five months earlier. The crypto industry and U.S. banking regulators have been through a tumultuous few years in which digital assets firms and insiders have complained of an organized campaign from government entities to cut them off from bank services — a campaign the industry and its Republican lawmaker allies call Operation Chokepoint 2.0.

Digital Currency Group (DCG) has initiated legal action against its bankrupt lending arm, Genesis Global Capital LLC, seeking repayment related to a $1.1 billion support package issued during the crypto market crash of 2022. According to court filings, the note's principal was to be reduced in line with any recoveries from 3AC's collateral. DCG now contends that Genesis recorded gains on that collateral exceeding the original $1.1 billion note, yet still owes DCG more than $105 million plus interest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hive Digital, a Bitcoin miner turned data center infrastructure provider, reported record revenue and earnings in its fiscal first quarter, driven by strong growth in high-performance computing (HPC) hosting services alongside its core mining business. Although mining remains Hive's primary revenue driver, the company is increasingly leveraging advanced AI chips to expand its HPC business. Executives Frank Holmes and Aydin Kilic told Cointelegraph that they aim for the HPC segment to reach a $100 million annual run rate by next year. Company shares were down slightly following the earnings report, with HIVE last seen trading around $2.20. Last week, CleanSpark reported record revenue and profits, boosted by surging BTC prices. Similarly, last month MARA Holdings posted a sharp revenue increase, driven by higher Bitcoin valuations and expanded mining operations. Related: Bitcoin miners and AI firms compete for cheap sustainable energy Hive was among the first Bitcoin miners to repurpose part of its infrastructure for HPC and AI — a trend that has only accelerated across the industry. Earlier this week, TeraWulf announced a $3.7 billion AI hosting agreement with Fluidstack, an AI infrastructure provider, with Google backing Fluidstack's lease obligations. In return, Google received 41 million TeraWulf shares as part of the deal. Core Scientific is a prominent example of a Bitcoin miner whose pivot to AI revived its struggling business after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy during the last crypto bear market. The company was later acquired by CoreWeave in a $9 billion deal. Hut 8 has deployed over 1,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs as part of its expansion into cloud-based AI computing. In its latest quarterly earnings report, the company said it is working to “commercialize AI data center opportunities.” Related: Jack Dorsey's Block targets 10-year lifecycle for Bitcoin mining rigs Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, fintech, and iGaming industries.</p>

Protocol AI (PROAI) has working technology today – live testnet processing 50,000 TPS with AI-optimized execution. But here's the killer – Protocol AI works TODAY. Lightchain investors wait eighteen months hoping promises materialize. Protocol AI offers 98% APY from real platform revenue – deployment fees, marketplace commissions, subscriptions. Lightchain proposes “variable rewards based on network participation.” One delivers concrete returns, the other delivers corporate speak. Lightchain attracted VCs seeking safe 3-5x over years. Protocol AI's community presale attracts crypto natives understanding exponential growth. When institutions discover PROAI, early investors will already be rich. Smart money recognizes the pattern – superior technology at microscopic valuation. Daily Protocol AI contributions exceeded Lightchain's entire weekly raise yesterday. Lightchain might not even launch by then. PROAI wins this race before Lightchain reaches the starting line.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flows into spot ETFs and treasury-style corporate buys have put a bid under ETH, while DeFi bellwether Uniswap (UNI) rides the same tide. At the same time, Remittix (RTX) keeps popping up on watchlists thanks to a clear listing catalyst investors can actually circle on the calendar. Here's a grounded look at cycle-top scenarios for each. ETH is trading near prior-cycle highs, with live boards showing price in the mid-$4.6K–$4.7K band and a market cap solidly in second place. Analysts describe a “catch-up” move as ether closes the gap on bitcoin's new highs helped by favorable macro, ETF demand and recent network upgrades that tightened fees and boosted throughput. That combination is why desks still like upside follow-through if key levels hold. For a cycle-top Ethereum Price Prediction, recent coverage points to five-figure targets: Fundstrat's team floats $12k–$15k by end-2025 if institutional participation and ETF inflows stay firm. Market updates this week framed ETH as inches from its 2021 peak, with the run aided by record ETF interest and corporates adding ether to treasuries evidence that the “buyer base” is diversifying beyond retail. UNI tracks DeFi risk; when on-chain activity and volumes expand, the token usually follows. Live data places UNI near the low-$11s with deep daily turnover. Technicians flag a key resistance band; clearing it could open a path to the high-teens or low-$20s in this cycle if DeFi keeps heating up. Recent roundups cluster 2025 targets in the $16–$25 zone, with some technical notes pointing higher if Uniswap can break and hold above long-term resistance. Remittix isn't competing on memes; it's building PayFi rails low-fee, cross-chain transfers that land as money in bank accounts. Traders tend to front-run events like this because they often pull in fresh liquidity and kick off price discovery. Recent features also highlight a beta wallet scheduled for September 15th 2025, launching with Ethereum and Solana connectivity another date investors can pencil in. UNI's cycle-top odds hinge on DeFi breadth breakouts put $16–$25 in play, with upside if long-term resistance finally gives way. If this bull phase keeps rewarding delivery and real flows, all three have room just for different reasons. Risk Warning: Trading may result in the loss of your entire capital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. The images, shared on X by blockchain investigator ZachXBT, came from an unnamed source who managed to access one of the workers' devices. They offer a rare look into the methods used by hackers tied to North Korea's state-backed operations. The group appears to be made up of just six people, but they control at least 31 false identities. Using these identities, they have applied for developer roles in crypto and blockchain projects. Evidence suggests one of the workers interviewed for a full-stack engineer position at Polygon Labs. In other cases, they prepared scripted interview answers, claiming past work for companies like OpenSea and Chainlink to gain credibility. Once hired, they often worked remotely through platforms like Upwork, using AnyDesk for access to company systems and VPNs to hide their locations. A spreadsheet found on one device listed $1,489.80 in expenses for May, detailing the costs of their ongoing operations. ZachXBT previously alleged that Favrr's chief technology officer, known as “Alex Hong,” and some other developers were in fact North Korean workers using false identities. The group's online activity also revealed their research interests, from asking if ERC-20 tokens could run on Solana to searching for AI development companies in Europe. North Korean-linked teams have been behind some of the largest crypto thefts on record, including a $1.4 billion exploit of the exchange Bitbit earlier this year. Over time, they've taken millions from protocols by posing as contractors and remote workers. Their tactics aren't always complex, but they work in volume — sending out enough applications that some inevitably slip through. Once inside, they can quietly gather data, siphon funds, or lay the groundwork for future attacks. ZachXBT says crypto and tech firms need to be more thorough in screening hires. He added that a lack of cooperation between tech companies and freelance platforms makes it easier for such groups to stay active. The US Treasury has already taken action, sanctioning two people and four companies linked to a similar North Korean IT worker network in July. The move reflects growing concern over how state-backed cyber teams are targeting private companies — often hiding in plain sight.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York Assembly Member Phil Steck has introduced legislation imposing a 0.2% excise tax on all digital asset transactions, including crypto and NFT sales or transfers. Assembly Bill A08966, introduced August 13 and referred to the Ways and Means Committee, would take effect September 1, 2025, marking another state-level attempt to generate revenue from the growing crypto sector. The bill defines digital assets broadly as any asset “issued, transferred, or both, using distributed ledger or blockchain technology,” encompassing digital currencies, coins, and non-fungible tokens. The proposed tax comes as global jurisdictions pursue diverse approaches to crypto taxation, ranging from total bans in China to innovation-friendly frameworks in Switzerland and Singapore. While Thailand wants to exempt taxation, taxing countries are progressing gradually. Most recently, Indonesia's crypto tax revenue jumped 181% to $38 million in 2024, driven by transaction volumes reaching $39.67 billion as the country's crypto user base exceeded 20 million people. The Indonesian government raised taxes on foreign exchanges from 0.2% to 1% while keeping domestic platform increases modest at 0.21%, attempting to shift activity toward regulated local platforms. Mining operations face doubled VAT from 1.1% to 2.2%, with special income tax rates ending in 2026. The survey found 84% of current crypto holders would buy more if the government implemented a flat 20% capital gains tax, while 12% of non-holders said they would start investing under reformed tax rules. Earlier this year, Ukraine also proposed an 18% personal income tax plus 5% military levy on virtual asset gains, with preferential rates of 5-9% for specific categories. While countries are working towards their taxation framework, China maintains a total ban on all cryptocurrency activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership, as of June 2025, extending earlier prohibitions to support the state-backed digital yuan. In fact, China goes as far as enforcing through active asset seizures and criminal penalties for violations, which remains the major country in the region with low crypto appetite. Singapore, however, offers rigorous licensing through the Monetary Authority with finalized stablecoin regulatory frameworks, attracting blockchain innovation while implementing strict compliance requirements. Similarly, Hong Kong has positioned itself as an Asian crypto center with licensing for exchanges, custody services, and comprehensive stablecoin oversight. 🇭🇰 Hong Kong SFC tightens crypto custody rules after global security incidents result in $3B losses as hackers move funds 75 times faster than exchange alerts.#HongKong #Cryptohttps://t.co/zffDuuT6aI Contrary to the Asian mixed stance, the European Union's MiCA regulation has unified regulation that requires comprehensive licensing for crypto asset service providers with strict anti-money laundering and consumer protection rules. The framework harmonizes regulation across member states while maintaining innovation-focused oversight approaches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase believes crypto markets may be on the cusp of a full-scale altcoin season, with institutional demand for Ethereum playing a central role and a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in September setting the stage for retail inflows. Stronger-than-anticipated macro conditions and clearer regulatory frameworks have helped fuel that momentum. At the same time, altcoin market capitalization has jumped more than 50% since July to $1.4 trillion. Altcoin Season is comingAs September approaches, the transition to a full-scale altcoin season is likely.Our positive 3Q25 outlook stems from macro trends such as potential Fed rate cuts and expected regulatory advancements.More key themes in this Monthly Outlook report ↓— Coinbase Institutional 🛡️ (@CoinbaseInsto) ETH Market Cap Jumps 50% Since July on Treasury Buys Still, Coinbase noted that conditions are aligning for a broader rally as September approaches. Its market cap has grown 50% since early July, powered by demand from digital asset treasuries and a growing narrative around stablecoins and real-world assets. Bitmine Immersion Technologies alone has acquired 1.2m ETH after raising $20b, with capacity to purchase $24.5b worth. Together, top institutional holders now control nearly 3 million ETH, about 2% of the supply. Tokens linked closely to Ethereum, including Arbitrum, Ethena, Lido DAO and Optimism, have all moved in step with ETH. Of these, only Lido has rallied sharply, gaining 58% this month. Coinbase said Lido's rise reflected both its exposure to ETH and a US SEC staff statement earlier in August that liquid staking tokens are not securities under certain conditions.Alt Season Not Fully Here, But Conditions Are Building While institutional flows dominate the ETH story, Coinbase said retail capital is also waiting to move. More than $7.2 trillion currently sits in US money market funds, the largest stockpile on record. These balances represent what the firm called “missed opportunity costs” caused by high traditional valuations, trade uncertainties and lingering doubts about growth. The firm's liquidity index, which tracks stablecoin issuance, trading volumes, orderbook depth and free float, has also begun to recover after six months of decline. “The recent decrease in Bitcoin dominance suggests an early rotation of capital into altcoins rather than a full-scale altcoin season at this stage.</p>

Mesh, the  crypto payments network, announced additional investments from PayPal Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Uphold, Mirana Ventures (venture partner for ByBit), SBI Investment, Overlook Ventures, Kingsway Capital, Moderne Ventures and CE-Ventures, bringing total capital funding to more than $130 million.

This support positions the company to “accelerate its impact on the global payments industry.”

Mesh's technology supported the launch of PayPal's Pay with Crypto service, which allows consumers “to pay with a wide range of cryptocurrencies and eligible wallets.”

Mesh's technology enables consumers to “pay using 100+ wallets and cryptocurrencies through Mesh's SmartFunding orchestration engine.”

This allows PayPal merchants to tap into a “growing $3 trillion market with over 650 million crypto users.”

Most of the funds were settled “with the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin.”

Mesh's technology was used to “instantly transfer the investment.”

With integrations across Coinbase, Binance, ByBit, OKX, and more, Mesh's technology “reaches hundreds of millions of users.”

This new funding will accelerate its expansion “across the global payments industry, scaling APIs, expanding product development, and powering hundreds of crypto and payments platforms.”

All of this will hopefully position the company for “dominance in crypto payments as stablecoins drive the next wave of adoption.”

Mesh's SmartFunding technology reportedly “eliminates friction in crypto payments, enabling users to pay with any digital asset while merchants receive instant settlement in stablecoins, such as PYUSD, or fiat.”

This approach addresses the mismatch problem where “users often hold different cryptocurrencies than what merchants prefer, ensuring a seamless checkout experience with the benefits of blockchain technology.”

With the stablecoin market having a market cap over $200 billion and powering $27.6 trillion in transaction volume, consumers and merchants “want stable assets like stablecoins and local currency.”

Mesh is “unlocking liquidity, making these assets fungible with its SmartFunding orchestration engine.”

Founded in 2020, Mesh is building the “global crypto payments network, connecting exchanges, wallets, and financial services platforms to enable digital asset payments and conversions.”

By unifying these platforms into a single network, Mesh is enabling “an open, connected, and secure ecosystem for digital finance.”

PayPal Ventures is the global corporate venture arm of PayPal.

They invest for financial return in “six areas of high strategic relevance to PayPal, including fintech, payments, commerce enablement, artificial intelligence, blockchain & cryptocurrency, and regulatory/cyber technology.”

Through the expertise, experience, and network of PayPal Ventures – and the companies they invest in – they are “helping to bring transformative solutions to market faster.”
