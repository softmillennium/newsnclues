	Disney Branded Television has given a series greenlight to the supernatural dramady “Coven Academy,” which follows a trio of teenage witches-in-training.


	The series is a single-camera project from Tim Federle, the creator of the Emmy-winning “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” starring a young Olivia Rodrigo. “Coven Academy” was ordered to pilot in March. Now, the show will premiere on Disney+ and Disney Channel sometime in 2026.

	Set in New Orleans, the series promises a “thrilling, witty blend of magic, mystery and teen drama.” It follows aspiring teenage witches who are “bound by destiny to guard their city against dangerous, ancient forces.” Per the logline, “Between unraveling dark secrets, mastering volatile magic, and facing off against distractingly cute rivals, they must also navigate the heartbreaks and deep bonds that come with growing up.”

	The series stars Malina Pauli Weissman (“Ick,” “A Series of Unfortunate Events”) as Briar, Tiffani Thiessen (“Alexa and Katie,” “White Collar,” “90210”) as Miss Graves, Malachi Barton (“Zombies 4: Dawn of the Vampires”) as Jake, Louis Thresher (“Boarders”) as Ollie, Jordan Leftwich (“Family Switch”) as Sasha and Ora Duplass (“Their Town”) as Tegan. Recurring guest stars include Brendon Tremblay (“Descendants: Wicked Wonderland”) as Alexander, Swayam Bhatia (“Zombies 4: Dawn of the Vampires”) as McKenna, and Keegan Connor Tracy (“Once Upon a Time”) as Tamora.

	











	“'Coven Academy' is an innovative format that blends supernatural intrigue with the friendships, challenges and self-discovery of the teenage experience,” said Ayo Davis, president of Disney Branded Television. “Under Tim Federle's creative leadership, this magical high school comes alive with a breakout cast, continuing our tradition of creating stories and stars that connect deeply with today's generation.”


	Federle wrote and directed the pilot, and he serves as executive producer alongside Kimberly McCullough and Bronwyn North-Reist, head of creative at Federle's Chorus Boy Productions. Federle is also executive producing the upcoming live-action comedy “Vampirina: Teenage Vampire,” coming to Disney Channel on Sept. 12.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling on him to clarify and retract “dangerously reckless” comments he made during an interview with a racist radio host in which he appeared to entertain the idea of the State Department designating American Muslim institutions as terrorist organizations based on a debunked, Islamophobic conspiracy about the Muslim Brotherhood. “Your response, whether intentional or not, appeared to raise the possibility that the State Department is trying to find a way to weaponize federal terrorism laws against CAIR and other American Muslim institutions based on a debunked conspiracy theory. Our mission is to enhance the public's understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice, and empower American Muslims. CAIR has spent 30 years vocally speaking up against all forms of bigotry, including anti-Black racism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism and antisemitism, as well as all forms of unjust violence, including hate crimes, ethnic cleansing, genocide and terrorism. “CAIR has played a leading role in debunking the arguments of both anti-Muslim extremists and Muslim extremists who attempt to paint Islam as a religion of wanton violence. In fact, CAIR condemned terrorism so often that ISIS once put a target on our national executive director. “The truth is that CAIR is an independent American nonprofit organization that operates in full compliance with federal, state, and local laws. CAIR is not—and has never been—a member, chapter, offshoot, or affiliate of any foreign organization.” CAIR's letter to Rubio also noted that the conspiracy theory that the Muslim Brotherhood controls American Muslim institutions has been repeatedly debunked by experts, and that both the State Department and the Justice Department under prior administrations have rejected baseless calls to target American Muslim institutions like CAIR. “The real reason anti-Muslim hate groups and pro-Israel lobby group obsessively target CAIR and other American Muslim institutions is because of our steadfast advocacy for Palestinian rights. To these groups, whose top priority is protecting the Israeli government from criticism, any American Muslims who recognize that Palestinians are human beings worthy of freedom are a threat who must be smeared and silenced. These hate groups fear that American Muslims will continue to become more civically engaged and politically impactful, leading to the reorientation of American foreign policy in a more just and humane direction. CAIR called on Rubio to clarify his remarks and affirm that the State Department will not misuse federal terrorism laws to target American Muslim institutions based on conspiracy theories or their exercise of free speech. CAIR also vowed to carry on its civil rights and advocacy work, including advocating for an end to the genocide in Gaza, regardless of threats and smears from extremist voices.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In East Freetown, a simple Starbucks cold brew bottle turned into something straight out of a ghost story. David Eaton recently recorded a video showing the plastic cap on his coffee container moving on its own. Eaton said the eerie motion had been going on for several minutes before he even started filming. “I've had other paranormal activity in my house too. Just this week alone I was grabbed twice, but the weird thing is, I don't feel threatened.” According to Eaton, strange happenings have been a part of life ever since he bought the home three years ago and even prior to that. Over the years, his daughter's boyfriend claims to have seen what looked like a little girl wandering inside. The activity was unsettling enough for Eaton to sage the home just two weeks ago, but the unexplained events haven't stopped. “I don't know what it is,” he said. Whether you're a believer in the paranormal or a skeptic searching for a logical explanation, Eaton's coffee cap video is just the latest chapter in a haunting mystery brewing in East Freetown.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Created by **Eric Kripke**, the series followed brothers **Sam (Jared Padalecki)** and **Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles)** as they hunted demons, ghosts, and gods across America in their iconic 1967 Impala ("Baby"). Originally planned for 3–5 seasons, its unexpected 15-year run cemented it as the longest-running American fantasy series, spanning 327 episodes. The Kripke Era: Foundations of a Mythos (Seasons 1–5)** After their mother's death by the **Yellow-Eyed Demon (Azazel)**, John Winchester (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) raises Sam and Dean as hunters. Sam leaves for Stanford but rejoins Dean after his girlfriend Jessica dies identically to their mother. The brothers search for John while battling urban-legend monsters, uncovering Sam's emerging psychic powers. The season climaxes with a car crash after John is possessed by Azazel. John sacrifices himself to save Dean, who is resurrected with a **one-year death sentence**. Sam dies but is resurrected after Dean sells his soul to a demon. Azazel's death frees hundreds of demons from Hell. The brothers clash with thief **Bela Talbot** and ally with the demon **Ruby (Genevieve Cortese)**, who aids their fight against **Lilith**—the demon holding Dean's contract. Dean is rescued from Hell by the angel **Castiel (Misha Collins)**. Heaven's plan to trigger the Apocalypse is revealed. With allies like Crowley (Mark Sheppard), they trap both Lucifer and Michael in Hell using the **Four Horsemen's rings**. Dean retires with Lisa, while Sam returns mysteriously. | 1 | Azazel | Sam's psychic powers | John trades life for Dean | Expanding the Universe: New Threats and Lore (Seasons 6–11)** *Post-Kripke seasons that escalated stakes to cosmic levels. Sam returns soulless, while Castiel allies with **Crowley** to absorb souls from **Purgatory**, becoming a self-proclaimed god. The Winchesters destroy their leader **Dick Roman** but are stranded in Purgatory. Angels fall to Earth after Castiel steals grace. Dean's demonic corruption forces Sam to seek a cure. The Endgame: Family Legacies and Final Battles (Seasons 12–15)** *Converging storylines leading to the Winchesters' ultimate sacrifice. Resurrected by Amara, **Mary Winchester** struggles with hunting. The **British Men of Letters** target Sam and Dean, while Lucifer fathers a Nephilim son, **Jack**. Mary and Lucifer are trapped in an alternate world ruled by **Michael**. Sam and Dean rescue Mary but unleash Michael. Jack absorbs Michael's grace but turns destructive after his soul deteriorates. **Chuck (God)** is revealed as the Winchesters' manipulator. Jack absorbs his power to become the new God. - **Creative Evolution**: Kripke's initial "monster-of-the-week" vision shifted focus to Sam/Dean's bond after recognizing Padalecki/Ackles' chemistry. - **Cultural Touchstones**: The Impala (changed from a Mustang for its imposing aesthetic), fan conventions, and meta-episodes like "The French Mistake" became iconic. - **Legacy**: Despite criticism of later seasons' repetitiveness, the show maintained a devoted "SPN Family" fandom. - **Potential Revival**: Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles have teased a **2025 limited series**, citing a "five-year break" post-finale as ideal. - **Spin-offs & Comics**: *The Winchesters* (2022) was canceled after one season, but a new **comic series (Oct 2025)** will bridge Seasons 1–2. - **Cast Reunions**: Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins will share scenes in *The Boys* Season 5, fueling revival hopes. *Supernatural* blended horror, humor, and heart across 15 seasons, transforming from a road-trip monster hunt into a saga about defiance, family, and self-determination. With its universe still expanding through comics and potential revivals, the Winchester legacy endures—proving that "saving people, hunting things" remains an eternal mission. As Dean would say: "Driver picks the music. Criminal Minds premiered in 2005 as a grim exploration of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU), distinguished by its psychological depth and unflinching portrayal of serial killers. The early seasons established core dynamics: Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin) mentored the genius Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler), while Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson) balanced leadership with familial strife. It was a regular Sunday afternoon when I discovered that my grandpa wasn't just the quiet, slightly forgetful old man who loved knitting scarves and watching reruns of The Twilight Zone. No, as it turns out, Grandpa had once been a secret agent—one who didn't exactly fit the suave, mysterious image I had in mind.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The news that a Chicago city councillor has been forced to deny that there is a man trapped inside the “Chicago Bean”, one of the city's best known tourist attractions, follows in a long tradition of well-known sites becoming shrouded in conspiracy theories. The theory quickly moved from obscure Reddit threads to an Instagram account with more than 35,000 followers. When it comes to the planet's tourism hotspots, peculiar theories abound, from Parisian landmarks secretly exerting mind control over the local population to hidden rooms housing some of America's biggest secrets. A slew of dystopic movies has trained us to expect alien motherships hovering over New York, so it's hardly surprising that Lady Liberty has ended up tangled in her fair share of intergalactic rumours. Grainy footage regularly resurfaces online showing a mysterious flying object buzzing around her crown. However in 2018, artist Joseph Reginella added his own twist. It was supposed to be temporary, but instead of dismantling it after the Exposition Universelle of 1889, better known in English as the 1889 Paris Exposition, the city gave its new landmark over to science and by 1903, it was doubling as a military radio antenna. Legend has it that Nikola Tesla met Gustave Eiffel at the 1889 Paris Exposition, sharing his vision for wireless energy. The tower's height, steel frame and later role in long-distance communication fits neatly into the theory that it was secretly part of Tesla's abandoned Wardenclyffe network – a planned global system of 30 towers transmitting free energy. Eiffel never worked with Tesla, and the tower's radio use was purely military. Powerful interests killed Tesla's free-energy dream before it could threaten the business of selling electricity. When sculptor Gutzon Borglum envisioned Mount Rushmore in the 1920s, it wasn't intended just to be four presidential heads staring out over the South Dakota plains. His original plan included an 800ft staircase leading to a grand “Hall of Records”, a cavern lined with bronze and glass cabinets, historic artefacts and inscriptions explaining America's story. It's a ring of enormous stones in the middle of an English field and nobody quite knows why it's there. Archaeologists say it was built around 5,000 years ago as some kind of ceremonial or astronomical site. Apparently Stonehenge was either a giant healing machine, a landing pad for extraterrestrials or an ancient portal used by druids to zip between dimensions. English Heritage maintains it was all good old-fashioned Neolithic muscle. If you wanted to hide evidence of alien contact, you probably wouldn't put it in the middle of the Sahara in a structure taller than a 40-story building. The pyramids of Giza have spent 4,500 years inspiring awe, tourism and theories that insist they're actually high-voltage energy transmitters left behind by extraterrestrial contractors. Their perfect geometry, astronomical alignments and the mystery of how millions of stone blocks were hauled into place have spawned theories ranging from “time machines” to “GPS markers for starships”. Some believers say the blocks were moulded, not quarried – ancient 3D printing, if you will. Egypt's official story is less cinematic: human sweat, copper tools and a lot of rope did the job.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have examined scientific articles and media publications from the last 30 years devoted to the search for extraterrestrial life. They analyzed in which aspects and promises scientists were overly optimistic, and in which journalists distorted everything. So far, no life has been found beyond Earth, but publications about the prospects for such research continue to appear one after another. At the same time, it is difficult to give a simple answer as to whether modern science is really sure of its existence. Researchers from Leiden University attempted to figure this out. In a study recently published in PLOS One, they took a bunch of studies, press releases, and newspaper articles on the subject from 1996 to 2024 and analyzed what they were overly optimistic about and what they were not. In particular, sources included The New York Times (United States), The Guardian (United Kingdom), Folha and Estadão (Brazil), Público (Portugal), and El País (Spain). The study showed that expectations regarding technology helping to find life beyond Earth are relatively high. Approximately one-fifth of press releases and news articles contained such content. There is much more manipulation in newspaper publications. After all, there is so much unknown in the Universe, and in order to develop new bold theories, we need to move beyond what we see here and now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The CW has gone through many changes, from featuring young adult dramas to an expansive DC universe. Gilmore Girls was in its heyday, and Dawson's Creek had just concluded. Eric Kripke created the series, which was in part inspired by the dynamic between Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. While the boys on Supernatural beheaded vicious creatures like vampires, another series found romanticism in them. The Vampire Diaries premiered in 2009, adapted from L.J. With True Blood and Twilight a hot commodity, The Vampire Diaries would fit into pop culture. What didn't seem to fit into were the footsteps that Supernatural left behind. The Winchesters were out for bloody revenge against monsters that had torn their family apart. Elena Gilbert found a soft spot in her heart for not just one vampire, but two. On occasion, Supernatural found common ground with monsters with a conscience, but that wasn't typically the status quo. Their father, John, had raised them to hate everything that went bump in the night because a demon had burned their mother alive in one of Supernatural's scariest cold opens. John's parenting was cruel and neglectful as he prioritized hunting demons over caring for his sons, who essentially lost a mother and a father that night. When she eventually found out that her boyfriend Stefan had to survive on human blood, she was afraid for only about an episode. Supernatural and The Vampire Diaries had different demographics as well. The Winchesters were in their mid to late 20s, while The Vampire Diaries was a series geared toward teens. Vampires were made out to be romantic figures because that is what would appeal to that age group. Twilight had been the litmus test for these types of stories and had shown that a human-vampire love triangle was the secret sauce for success. Despite these inherently opposed values, however, The Vampire Diaries and Supernatural closed a gap between each other. Young women gravitated towards both shows, though it wasn't evident on the surface. The Vampire Diaries may seem frivolous to some viewers, but the seductive love triangle was a Trojan horse for a truly heartbreaking story. Like Supernatural, The Vampire Diaries succeeded because of the love that two brothers had for each other. This wasn't always the case, however. At the height of the Civil War, Damon and Stefan were as close as any brothers could be. In a predictable turn of events, a woman came between them, but that wasn't the nail in the proverbial vampire coffin. Jealousy had always been an issue between the Salvatores, but that didn't stop their codependency. After being fed vampire blood, both brothers were killed, which started their transition into vampirism. Stefan completed the transition when he killed their father, but at the time, Damon was less interested in living forever. Without the love of their lives, Katherine Pierce, Damon saw no point in becoming a vampire. It was only upon Stefan's begging not to endure immortality alone that his older brother became a vampire. This began over a century of bad blood between the two that was only healed when both returned to Mystic Falls, Virginia, the place of their birth. Sam had committed the ultimate sin when he abandoned John's crusade to go to college and have a normal life. Sam was always at odds with his brother and father, having issues with how he was raised. He mourned his mother, and when his father went missing and the Yellow-Eyed Demon returned, he came back to the fold. Despite their differences, he and Dean banded together to find out exactly what happened to John Winchester. Their search for John was less than fruitful as they lost yet another member of the Winchester clan. This only proved to bring them closer. Hardship bonded more than one supernatural brotherhood. If it wasn't for the events of these television shows, neither family would have found the catharsis they needed. Damon came to Mystic Falls for destroying Stefan, while Sam never would have returned to the family business had he not experienced another personal tragedy. Both these events started a chain of events that healed the wounds that the Salvatores and Winchesters had been harboring for so long. In his human life, he was kind and sincere, but Stefan's betrayal set him on a path of darkness. Still, he cared for him, watching his younger brother descend down a path of blood addiction. Damon's darkness was a stark contrast to the person he had been, and it was fair to say that wouldn't have happened had it not been for Stefan. Without Elena present, the two could finally acknowledge what had been hurting them all this time. Stefan achieved the redemption he had been looking for by saving Damon and Mystic Falls, even if it meant sacrificing himself. This is not dissimilar to the ending of Supernatural. After 15 years, Supernatural finally came to a close familiarly, with the death of one of the brothers. Dean Winchester died from an unfortunately placed nail, which wasn't the most heroic ending for the demon hunter. That was also beside the point, because one day, he would be reunited with Sam in their own afterlife. The Winchesters were just as codependent as the Salvatores — if not more so — and no matter how many partners they had, the story had always been about them. They overcame their estrangement and sacrificed themselves for each other countless times so they could finally be at peace. When viewing these series through that lens, The Vampire Diaries and Supernatural are essentially about the same thing. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anna Paulina Luna is beaming up some out-of-this-world news. The GOP Representative for Florida's 13th congressional district said she has reason to believe "interdimensional beings" exist, citing her political and military career as her reasoning why. Although Luna—who leads the House Oversight Task Force on declassification of federal secrets—admitted to Joe Rogan that she hasn't seen "a portal open" or "a spaceship personally," she argued that other evidence proves their existence. "Have I seen photo documentation of aircraft that I believe were not made by mankind? "Based on the photos that I've seen," she asserted, "I'm very confident that there's things out there that have not been created by mankind." What are these Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), formerly known as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), which Luna claimed move "out of time and space?" "These energy things," she explained, "I think that they can actually operate through the time spaces that we currently have. The politician—who is also a member of the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Caucus—pointed to the controversial claims made by former United States Air Force officer David Grusch during a 2023 congressional hearing that the government has a highly secretive UFO retrieval program. "When you talk about the interdimensional aspect of these things preexisting outside of what we currently know as our own dimension, that stuff can kind of all sound crazy," Luna admitted to Rogan. She also shared that she had gone to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida after multiple Air Force pilots accused the military branch of covering up UAP incidents. Luna, who served in the Air Force, criticized the military's response to their inquiries, adding that she had received pushback from the Pentagon and the Secretary of Defense when asking for them to share information with Congress. News has reached out to the Department of Defense for comment and has not yet heard back. Although Luna admitted that the conversation can seem unrealistic, she didn't "look at it with a crazy lens and perspective." As she explained, "You never know if we're the only ones out there, essentially." Not everyone shares Luna's beliefs on the matter, however. NASA's Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Independent Study Team member Joshua Semeter previously admitted that he doesn't believe there's enough evidence. "His claims are two steps removed from being Earth-shattering: not only has he not shared any verifiable evidence—photographs, artifacts, or any other manner of data—but he also has not personally seen or touched any of the objects he references," he told Boston University Today of Grusch's testimony in 2023. For celebs who've spoken about their otherworldly experiences, keep reading. The one where Courteney Cox shares a ghost story.The Friends star told Howard Stern she had a delivery man ring her doorbell and inform her of an unexpected guest. "I answered it, got my package and he said, 'Do you know this house is haunted?'" Courteney said on a 2022 episode of his SiriusXM show. He goes, ‘Because there's someone standing behind you.' And I thought, ‘Oh s--t.'”This wasn't her only spooky experience, however. Courteney also recalled a scare she had in London. "I'd just gotten there," the Scream alum added. I was sitting there, I closed my eyes to try to sleep and all of a sudden I saw these really scary faces—like old faces. And then all of a sudden I was like, 'Mom? I just kept seeing all these weird things. "After also seeing lights and a plant move, Courteney alerted her longtime love Johnny McDaid. "And he had all these waves around him too. "Ultimately, Courteney warded them off with a request. Do not come back tonight cause I have to sleep,'" she said. "And I didn't see them again." "When I was a little girl, my mom walked into the room and I was talking to something," the singer recalled on a 2013 episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. "And my mom was like, 'Who are you talking to?' And then my little sister ended up doing that when she was around the same age. '"If that example didn't make you feel like you're having a heart attack, this one might. Demi remembered inviting friends over and telling them, "Watch, something will happen." And while pals would initially have their doubts, she said, odd things would then occur—like when her buddy texted someone saying "I think this place is haunted" and the word "definitely" was sent back multiple times. "He's like, 'Why'd you send it so many times?'" "He goes, 'I didn't send it that many times. "My uncle actually was watching TV and all of a sudden this balloon floated down the stairs," she told Ellen DeGeneres. "What balloon floats down, by the way? While Joey King starred in The Conjuring as a kid, she also had a frightful incident off-camera. "And so during the filming of those particular scenes, I started having a lot of bruises show up on my body in bizarre places, like on my stomach, on my chest, like what? "Initially, Joey added, the makeup artists thought she was stealing their fake bruises as a prank. "They tried to take my real bruises off with rubbing alcohol and oil," The Act alum continued. '"Joey then visited her doctor to get some blood tests. "All of a sudden, I'm told that I have this blood-thinning condition called ITP, where basically most of my red platelets drained from my body mysteriously," she shared. "I'd never had a blood problem in the past. I've never had a blood problem since then. No one in my family has that. "As a result, Joey noted, she had to go to the hospital twice a day while filming the 2013 horror movie. "When I came home, my platelets were completely fine," The Kissing Booth star told Howard. "Like, I was back up to the normal numbers and I've never since had a trace of that disorder ever." Just keep breathin' as you read about Ariana Grande's terrifying incident.The Grammy winner told Complex about the "ghost/demon experience" she had in Kansas City in 2013. After staying in a haunted castle, Ariana said, "the next night we wanted to go to Stull Cemetery, which is known as one of the seven gates to hell on Earth. "I felt this sick, overwhelming feeling of negativity over the whole car and we smelled sulfur, which is the sign of a demon, and there was a fly in the car randomly, which is another sign of a demon," she recalled to the outlet. "I was like, 'This is scary, let's leave.' I rolled down the window before we left and said, 'We apologize. We didn't mean to disrupt your peace.' Then I took a picture and there are three super distinct faces in the picture—they're faces of textbook demons. "The "Thank U, Next" singer said she deleted the photo after she tried to send the picture to her manager and got a message back that read, "This file can't be sent, it's 666 megabytes." Ariana also remembered once seeing a huge black cloud beside her bed. "I started crying," she added to Complex. and they said, 'Tell it to eff off.' I watched it move to the front of my bed and then I fell asleep on the phone. I woke up and it was gone." Truth be told, Octavia Spencer doesn't seem to mind having a spirit in her house. "I grew up watching Westerns," she said on a 2021 episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. "I bought this house, and it was owned by a guy who did Westerns. So I must have been a fan of his. I love him because he kind of sorts out the bad people that shouldn't be there. "And if you're wondering how exactly the ghost runs them out, allow the Oscar winner to explain. "If they stay at my place, they don't want to come back," she added. Because if you're a person that belongs there, everybody's like, 'Oh, you're place is so welcoming. And that's how I feel about it. "Although, Octavia admitted her ghost can be "shady" if she's gone for a long time, such as by randomly closing doors and turning off the lights. And while this spirit is welcome, the Hidden Figures star made it clear she isn't offering an open invitation. "I just don't want you bringing your ghost to my house. Jennifer Aniston wasn't exactly friends with the ghost she says resided at a house she previously owned in Los Angeles. "So, Jennifer continued, someone suggested she call a specialist to "clear the house" of the spirit. "I had someone come over to my house," The Morning Show actress shared. "They had frankincense and they put it in a little dish and sort of start saying all these things. Jennifer recalled how a "really, thick, thick, thick 1975 ashtray that was sitting on the table" also cracked and that the specialist asked her to leave so she could talk to the spirit.As for what the spirit said? "He hated my roommate," Jennifer replied, later adding she moved out and never told the roommate. It appears some ghosts can't be tamed—just ask Miley Cyrus.The singer once spoke about a spirit she said lived in her house.“I had a friend who a parent had passed away," she explained in a 2020 interview with 102.7KIISFM's JoJo Wright. "And when they did, they know how much I love Elvis [Presley] and gave me all of their Elvis memorabilia. "However, Miley said the memorabilia was destroyed when her Malibu house caught fire in 2018. "It was like she kind of went up in this smoke of all this Elvis memorabilia. "Miley said it was like the fire "released" her friend's late mom, and she soon got rid of the picture. "She smoked cigarettes and I could smell smoke coming from the guest room, which is where the photo is," she said. It actually happened only a couple nights ago, I thought that I, I feel like, saw her sitting on the couch kind of taunting my dogs, which is something she totally would've done. You'll want to speed on over to hear Keanu Reeves' ghost story.The Matrix star once revealed an unexplainable experience he had at his family's New York apartment when he was 6 or 7 years old. "All of a sudden, we're looking over there and this, like, jacket comes waving through the doorway. "While the John Wick actor wasn't too freaked out, he said his nanny was. And I'm like, 'Oh wow, so that was real. "One incident that bops to the top of Vanessa's mind happened with a pull-along duck toy when she was 8 years old. "There was one of those on the dining room table," The Princess Switch actress continued, "and I started walking and it just started going alongside me. "Now, Vanessa is trying to learn more. "I kind of shut it down for a while because it's scary," she told Kelly Clarkson. But I recently was like, 'No this is a gift and something that I have the ability to do. So, I'm gonna lean into it.' "Other people started seeing things," the actor, who is a father of five, continued on The Late Late Show. "Other kids would come and say, 'Who's that little boy over there?' Yeah, relations and nannies, completely out of control. "I'm a rational person, well-educated, not an idiot," the Love Actually alum continued. "Her sticks went completely wild in his room," Hugh added. "She said, 'Oh, it's so strong in here. Then she burnt about seven pounds of sage and banged a little drum, played an instrument or something and sang. And she said, 'All the spirits are gone. Hugh said he asked his son in the morning if he felt happier last night. "He said, 'No, there was a little boy at my window,'" the Notting Hill star added. "So I think we need to move house now. The succession of events Brian Cox experienced years ago in Edinburgh will give you the chills. "I was just trying to go to sleep and suddenly there was this rocking sound," the actor recalled on a 2023 episode of The Jonathan Ross Show, "and the chair started to rock. And it started to rock across the room in front of my bed. "While the chair eventually stopped moving, Brian was still pretty freaked out by what he saw. "By this time, I got myself right under the covers," he continued. "Because I thought, 'S--t, this is f--king awful. '"The Succession star managed to get some sleep, but was startled again the next morning. "The chair was still here," he added, "and the floor was covered in these scratch marks."
