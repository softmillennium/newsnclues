Order suggests president might be ready to launch nuclear strike against Russia as tensions rise over Ukraine war

Donald Trump has said that he has deployed nuclear-capable submarines to the ‚Äúappropriate regions‚Äù in response to a threatening tweet by Russia's former president Dmitry Medvedev, suggesting that he would be ready to launch a nuclear strike as tensions rise over the war in Ukraine.

In a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump wrote that he had decided to reposition the nuclear submarines because of ‚Äúhighly provocative statements‚Äù by Medvedev, noting he was now the deputy chairman of Russia's security council.

Medvedev had earlier said that Trump's threats to sanction Russia and a recent ultimatum were ‚Äúa threat and a step towards war‚Äù.

‚ÄúI have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,‚Äù Trump responded. ‚ÄúWords are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences, I hope this will not be one of those instances.‚Äù

He did not specify whether he was referring to nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines.

Medvedev, who was sidelined when Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, is also an avid fan of X, formerly Twitter, where he often posts aggressive and curiously worded attacks against western countries and leaders in the evening in Moscow.

Earlier this week, Medvedev had attacked Trump for shortening his timeline for Russia to make progress toward peace with Ukraine from 50 days down to just 10, saying that he was ready to impose sanctions and other financial penalties against Russia if it didn't comply.

‚ÄúTrump's playing the ultimatum game with Russia: 50 days or 10,‚Äù Medvedev wrote in a post. ‚ÄúHe should remember 2 things: 1. Russia isn't Israel or even Iran. 2. Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country.

‚ÄúDon't go down the Sleepy Joe road!‚Äù he added, referring to the former US president Joe Biden.

Trump has voiced frustration with Putin, who he said had been stalling on Trump's efforts to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, a campaign promise that he said that he could achieve in just 24 hours. On Thursday he described Russia's continued attacks on civilian areas as ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù.

‚ÄúI go home. I tell the first lady, ‚ÄòYou know, I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.' She said, ‚ÄòOh, really? Another city was just hit,'‚Äù he said in at the White House last month.

Putin has not responded to Trump's ultimatum. On Friday, he said he wanted a ‚Äúlasting and stable peace‚Äù in Ukraine but gave no indication that he was willing to make any concessions to achieve it, after a week in which Russian missiles and drones again caused death and destruction across Ukraine.

‚ÄúWe need a lasting and stable peace on solid foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and would ensure the security of both countries,‚Äù said Putin, speaking to journalists on Friday, a week before a new deadline imposed by Trump for hostilities to cease.

Putin has periodically claimed to be interested in peace, but only on terms wholly unacceptable to Kyiv. Last week, the third round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul, but broke up in less than an hour and have so far led to no agreements except on prisoner exchanges.

In an apparent reference to Trump's comments, Putin said on Friday: ‚ÄúAs for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general rule.‚Äù

Containment slips for megafire in Grand Canyon and large blaze in Utah as hot and dry weather fans flames

Two wildfires burning in the western United States ‚Äì including one that has become a ‚Äúmega-fire‚Äù on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon ‚Äì are so hot that they are spurring the formation of ‚Äúfire clouds‚Äù that can create their own erratic weather systems.

In Arizona, the wind-whipped wildfire that destroyed the Grand Canyon Lodge is 9% contained and has charred more than 164 sq miles (424 sq km) to become the largest fire now burning in the continental US and one of the top 10 largest in recorded Arizona history. Getting around it would be roughly like driving from New York City to Washington DC.

Another large fire in Monroe, Utah, has burned 75 sq miles (194 sq km) since 13 July and is 11% contained, officials said on Thursday. Evacuation orders were issued on Wednesday for several towns in the fire's path, and scorched power poles caused electricity to be shut off in other nearby communities in south-central Utah.

Spencer Cox, Utah's governor, declared an emergency on Thursday as wildfires grew around the state and planned to visit Monroe on Friday.

Towering convection clouds known as pyrocumulus clouds have been spotted over Arizona's blaze for seven consecutive days, fueling the fire with dry, powerful winds, fire information officer Lisa Jennings said. They form when air over the fire becomes superheated and rises in a large smoke column. The giant billowing clouds can be seen for hundreds of miles and can resemble an anvil.

Their more treacherous big brother, a fire-fueled thunderstorm known as the pyrocumulonimbus cloud, sent rapid winds shooting in all directions this week as a smoke column formed from the Utah fire then collapsed on itself, fire team information officer Jess Clark said.

‚ÄúIf they get high enough, they can also create downdrafts, and that's something we really watch out for because that can quickly spread the fire and can be very dangerous for firefighters who are doing their work on the ground,‚Äù Jennings said.

Multiple fire crews in Utah were forced to retreat on Wednesday as the unpredictable climate created by the clouds threatened their safety, officials said. Fire crews in both Utah and Arizona had better control of the blazes, but containment has been slipping as the fires grow rapidly.

The same type of cloud, which the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has dubbed the ‚Äúfire-breathing dragon of clouds‚Äù, recently formed a fire tornado that tore through an eastern Utah neighborhood with wind speeds estimated at 122 miles per hour.

‚ÄúThink of the fire as kind of like a hot-air balloon, so it adds buoyancy and things rise as a result,‚Äù said Derek Mallia, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Utah who studies pyrocumulonimbus clouds and tracks fires in Utah and Arizona. ‚ÄúYou get this towering thunderstorm over the fire, and just like any other thunderstorm it gets really windy underneath it. Because it's the west, these thunderstorms tend to be very dry.‚Äù

These clouds, he said, may appear more frequently as the climate crisis causes a longer fire season, drought conditions and extreme weather events.

A megafire, although not a formal scientific term, generally is a fire that has burned at least 156 sq miles, or about half the size of New York City.

The Dragon Bravo fire on the North Rim of Grand Canyon national park surpassed that mark in the latest update on Thursday. It was sparked by lightning on 4 July and being managed by the park to benefit the landscape.

About a week later, officials switched to suppressing it as conditions deteriorated, with hot, dry and windy weather pushing the flames toward the Grand Canyon Lodge and the historic cabins that surround it. The fire destroyed dozens of buildings and forced the closure of the North Rim for the rest of the season as hundreds of firefighters struggled to gain an upper hand.

Thursday marked the eighth straight day of historically dry conditions, Jennings said. Humidity levels have been in the single digits, fuel moisture levels are extremely low and wind gusts were expected to crank up to 35mph.

The pyrocumulus clouds have reached heights of at least 25,000ft (7,620 meters), and fire behavior analyst Arthur Gonzales said they could go higher.

The direction of the wind has been fairly consistent for crews working the Dragon Bravo fire. Although they have been strong, the predictability has allowed fire managers to more easily position crews on the fire lines. But when pyrocumulus clouds form and the winds become less predictable, Jennings said firefighters often have to be pulled back to safety.

Hot, dry winds fanned the flames of the Monroe Canyon fire on Thursday as firefighters worked to contain the spread. The fire has burned 12 power poles, and many homes have been without electricity since Wednesday afternoon.

The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for extreme fire danger in much of central and south-west Utah this week.

In Antimony, Utah, 54 miles south of Monroe, the town's 123 residents were without power on Thursday afternoon. Mayor Kasey King, who was helping people gather food and supplies at a community center, said they could be without power for a week.

The power company, Garkane Energy Cooperative, said it was working to restore power as quickly as possible and has brought in backup generators.

Marnie Reynolds, a resident of Antimony, worried for the town's many elderly residents. She has been using a camp stove to offer hot meals to neighbors and is using a generator to help people refrigerate groceries and medications.

‚ÄúWe have been facing a lot of challenges, but we have the best community,‚Äù she said.

In Richfield, Utah, 10 miles north of Monroe, Lee Stevens said his yard was coated in ash. He and his wife, who has asthma and is sensitive to the smoke, have not yet been told to evacuate but are making preparations in case the fire spreads.

The National Interagency Fire Center said on Thursday that even with fewer square miles having burned so far this year than average, many parts of the country remain vulnerable to new starts and fast-moving flames.

Former Green Beret Anthony Aguilar recounted the horrific story of the small child who was just grateful for food.

A small, emaciated Palestinian boy in Gaza named Amir was killed by Israeli forces just moments after receiving aid from American contractors in May, former U.S. Green Beret Anthony Aguilar has recounted. The horrific incident took place during his 45 days in Gaza with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) ‚Äî and was one of over 800 killings of Palestinian aid seekers near GHF sites.

In interviews this week, Aguilar said that on May 28, just two days after GHF sites first opened in Gaza, he and another U.S. guard encountered a boy, who he identified as Amir. Aguilar said that he and the other contractor thought Amir may be hurt, because he was carrying only small bags of rice, flour, and lentils that he picked up from the ground. They waved him over.

‚ÄúThe [American contractor] standing next to me ‚Äî this young boy holds his hand, and he kisses it. Then he comes to me, and he holds my hand, and he kisses it,‚Äù Aguilar said in an interview with Tucker Carlson, explaining that kissing hands is a sign of deep respect in Arab cultures. He said that he and the other U.S. veteran he stood next to were ‚Äútouched.‚Äù

Aguilar shared pictures of Amir with news outlets. The young boy is small and skinny, his bare feet covered in dust. He looks no older than 10 or 12.

‚ÄúHe was very emaciated. He had no shoes on, his pants were tattered, he had a kind of a rope or string holding his pants up. Filthy. Probably hasn't bathed in months, probably hasn't eaten in days,‚Äù Aguilar said. ‚ÄúI put my arm on his left shoulder and I look at him. I can feel the bones in his shoulder. I can feel the weakness in his arm. I can feel the vulnerability. And I can feel the desperation.‚Äù

The child, Amir, walked 12 kilometers on foot and kissed the hand of Anthony Aguilar, the resigned American officer from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, in a plea for aid. Shortly after, Israeli soldiers killed Amir at the same location. pic.twitter.com/IZ02IakEBL

Amir left with the crowd to exit the GHF site, as Israeli forces and American contractors ended the aid distribution as they often did, with tear gas, pepper spray, and bullets. Outside the GHF site was an active Israeli combat zone, where Israeli soldiers were firing machine guns. And Amir, along with a number of people who left, was promptly shot by Israeli forces and killed, Aguilar said. 

‚ÄúAmir didn't make it home. He walked 12 kilometers to get some food, picked up scraps off the ground cause that's all that was left, because the eight-minute mayhem took all of the food. And by the time he got there, walking with no shoes, hungry and tired, the only thing left for him was to pick up some remnants off the ground,‚Äù said Aguilar. ‚ÄúAnd when he left, he was killed by the IDF.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Because they lack discipline. They lack standards. And they lack basic human decency,‚Äù he said.

The story of Amir is one of numerous similar incidents that Aguilar says he encountered during his 45 days with GHF in Israel and Gaza. This week, he did a series of media interviews speaking out about what he saw, with Israeli forces committing war crime after war crime, he's said ‚Äî and the U.S. standing in complicity. 

In at least one case captured on video by Aguilar, he says that U.S. contractors have also opened fire on Palestinians. In another instance, Aguilar said that he was told by Israeli soldiers to shoot at children at the aid distribution site, and he refused. He was then disciplined by a higher up within the U.S. firm overseeing GHF operations, Safe Reach Solutions, with the executive telling him to never say no to a client ‚Äî in this case, the Israeli military.

GHF has tried to discredit Aguilar, saying that he was fired and that he is disgruntled and spreading ‚Äúfalse allegations.‚Äù But Aguilar has refuted these claims, showing documentation of his contract termination and saying that he left his contract early because his concerns over the GHF mechanism were dismissed.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Over 80 percent of Americans are already concerned about the price of groceries and many are struggling to stay afloat.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday used emergency authority to impose high tariff rates on imports from dozens of American trading partners, including Canada ‚Äî a move that economists criticized as a senseless approach to global trade that will further increase costs for consumers who are already struggling to get by.

Trump outlined the new tariff rates in executive orders signed just ahead of his arbitrary August 1 deadline for U.S. trading partners to negotiate a deal with the White House, whose erratic, aggressive, and legally dubious approach has alarmed world leaders.

Under the president's new orders, Canadian goods that are not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will face 35% import duties, while steel and aluminum imports will face a 50% tariff rate.

Trump claimed Canada ‚Äúhas failed to cooperate in curbing the ongoing flood of fentanyl and other illicit drugs.‚Äù But Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney hit back in a statement early Friday, noting that Canada ‚Äúaccounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile we will continue to negotiate with the United States on our trading relationship, the Canadian government is laser-focused on what we can control: building Canada strong,‚Äù Carney added. ‚ÄúCanadians will be our own best customer, creating more well-paying careers at home, as we strengthen and diversify our trading partnerships throughout the world.‚Äù

Economist Brad Setser said that while the impact of the higher tariff on Canadian imports could be muted because of the exemption of USMCA-covered products such as oil, the 35% rate is still ‚Äúinsane‚Äù and ‚Äúdumb.‚Äù

‚ÄúSame with the high tariff on Switzerland. Crazy,‚Äù Setser wrote, pointing to the 39% rate for Switzerland imports. ‚ÄúThis isn't just protectionism, it is bad protectionism ‚Äî and will have all sorts of unintended consequences.‚Äù

The new tariff rates for Canadian goods will take effect Friday while the higher rates for other nations such as Brazil (50%), India (25%), and Vietnam (20%) won't kick in until next week ‚Äúto give Customs and Border Protection officials time to prepare,‚Äù The Washington Post reported. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs, which are effectively taxes paid by importers ‚Äî who often pass those costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices.

‚ÄúTrump's definition of ‚Äòwinning' is hitting the American people with ever-higher taxes,‚Äù Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, wrote late Thursday.

Recent U.S. economic data indicates that Trump's tariffs are already putting upward pressure on prices ‚Äî and companies are using the president's trade chaos as an excuse to drive up prices further and pad their bottom lines.

The Tax Foundation noted earlier this week that ‚Äúa variety of food imports‚Äù will be impacted by Trump's tariffs, likely leading to ‚Äúhigher food prices for consumers.‚Äù More than 80% of Americans are already concerned about the price of groceries and many are struggling to stay afloat, according to survey data released Thursday by The Century Foundation.

Baker warned Thursday that even nations that have agreed to trade frameworks with the U.S. are not out of the woods.

‚ÄúDeals are meaningless to Trump. He'll break them in a second any time he feels like it,‚Äù Baker wrote. ‚ÄúI trust everyone negotiating with Trump understands that fact.‚Äù

Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs could face a prison sentence ‚Äúsubstantially higher‚Äù than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges.

They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. 3 sentencing.

In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed.

Each prostitution-related charge carries a potential maximum 10 years in prison.

Awaiting sentencing, Sean (Diddy) Combs' seeks release on $50-million bond

Prosecutors said after the verdict that they thought federal sentencing guidelines meant to prevent wide disparities in sentencings for the same crimes would likely call for a prison term of four to five years. But they said Thursday they believe the guidelines range ‚Äúwill be substantially higher,‚Äù raising the risk Combs will flee.

Judge Arun Subramanian will have wide latitude in determining a sentence and can choose to ignore the guidelines, which are not mandatory. Combs' lawyers have said they believe the guidelines, if properly calculated, will call for 21 to 27 months in prison.

On the day of the verdict, prosecutors won a bail fight after defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo argued Combs should be freed immediately on bail.

Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a ‚Äúlack of danger to any person or the community.‚Äù But he said Agnifilo could renew the request.

In doing so Tuesday, Agnifilo cited other cases he said were comparable to Combs' conviction in which defendants were granted bail. And he cited severe conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Combs has been held since his September arrest at a New York hotel.

He also said Combs was being treated unfairly for engaging in a ‚Äúswingers‚Äù lifestyle in which he and his girlfriends sometimes invited male sex workers to join them in multiday marathon sex performances.

Prosecutors said in their filing Thursday that Combs' conviction on the prostitution-related counts carried a mandatory requirement that he remain in jail prior to sentencing, unless he could prove exceptional circumstances, which they said he cannot.

They said he should also remain in prison as a danger to the community, a claim that Agnifilo disputed in his papers.

‚ÄúSean Combs will not be violent to anyone. As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,‚Äù Agnifilo wrote earlier this week.

Prosecutors also said conditions at the federal lockup had improved considerably before Combs was arrested. A federal judge in January 2024 had blasted conditions at the jail, including its extensive lockdowns and inadequate medical care.

Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.

‚ÄúThe defendant's extensive history of violence ‚Äî and his continued attempt to minimize his recent violent conduct ‚Äî demonstrates his dangerousness and that he is not amendable to supervision,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúThe defendant utterly fails to establish by clear and convincing evidence, as required, that he does not pose a danger to the community.‚Äù

Cases of HIV among Russian soldiers have soared 2,000% since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a new report reveals, attributing the rise both to unprotected sex and drug use among troops, and political decisions made by the Kremlin.

According to the report from Carnegie Politika, cases detected in the Russian armed forces increased by 13 times by the end of 2022, and by 20 times by the end of 2024.

"The demographic and economic losses Russia will suffer as a result of this outbreak will have repercussions for decades and may ultimately even exceed the damage it has sustained from its invasion of Ukraine," the report said.

It attributes the rise to several factors including blood transfusions for wounded soldiers, reusing syringes in field hospitals, and soldiers engaging in unprotected sex and drug use.

The report also highlights the wider HIV situation in Russia which since 2022 has been among the top five countries worldwide for new HIV cases, behind South Africa, Mozambique, Nigeria, and India.

"There is no objective reason why HIV should be decreasing across the world ‚Äî except in Russia. The factors behind this are purely political," the report said.

The Kremlin has taken several steps that have contributed to the rise, often in the name of defending what it calls "traditional values."

Russia placed British musician Elton John's charity that focuses on HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and awareness on its list of "undesirable organizations" over what it called "promotion of non-traditional sexual relations," the Russian Prosecutor General's Office said on April 3.

The non-profit, which was launched in 1992 and is based in the U.S. and the U.K., says it works in over 90 countries "to increase access to health care, tackle LGBTQ+ stigma, and end AIDS."

In their statement, Russian prosecutors claim the charity is "focused on the promotion of non-traditional sexual relations, Western family models, and gender reassignment."

The U.S. president added that Ukraine has suffered an estimated 8,000 military deaths since January, not including missing personnel. 

At least four oil tankers carrying Russian crude are idling off India's western coast as Indian refiners reconsider purchases under sanction pressure from the United States and the European Union.

"Customs must become a modern service-oriented institution that meets European Union standards and works with full integrity to support the state budget," Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said.

"In fact, the issue was not only Repin's nationality and identity, but also the fact that this painting is a landscape from Chuhuiv, and Repin himself wrote that it was Chuhuiv," art historian Oksana Semenik said.

"As for any disappointments on anyone's part, all disappointments arise from excessive expectations," Vladimir Putin said.



"There is no objective reason why HIV should be decreasing across the world ‚Äîexcept in Russia," the report said.

Despite heavy militarization and a surge in state defense orders since the start of the war against Ukraine, Russia's industrial production growth has begun to slow.

Germany has already delivered three Patriot systems to Ukraine, the German Defense Ministry said. 

The measures target five companies and one individual based in Iran, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, allegedly involved in sourcing sensitive technology for the Iranian Aviation Manufacturing Company (HESA).

The news coincides with Donald Trump's announcement of a 25% tariff on India starting on Aug. 1.

Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city's military administration, said that as of the morning of Aug. 1, the Russian attack had killed 31 people. At around 10:40 a.m. local time, rescuers recovered three more bodies.

Trump said he found Russia's latest attacks against Ukraine "disgusting" and said the Kremlin has "about eight days" to make a deal or face sanctions.

Russian forces launched 72 Shahed-type drones from Russia's Millerovo, Kursk, and Primorsk-Akhtarsk airfields against Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine's Air Force.

Six out of 10 Americans fault president for financial struggles and eight out of 10 worry about tariffs' impact

Americans are struggling financially, grappling with debt and the rising cost of living, and are blaming the Trump administration and corporate interests for worsening economic outlooks for working families, according to a new poll.

Six out of 10 Americans place blame on the Trump administration for driving up their cost of living, according to a poll conducted by Morning Consult for the Century Foundation, which asked 2,007 Americans how they are managing the high cost of living in the US economy, who they think is to blame and what are the solutions.

Sixty three per cent said Trump had had a negative impact on grocery prices, and 61% said he had had a negative impact on the cost of living. Nearly half, 49%, said the Trump administration had had a negative impact on their finances. Nearly eight out of 10 Americans, including 70% of Republicans, fear that Trump's tariffs will increase the price of everyday goods.

‚ÄúDonald Trump has simultaneously raised prices on everyday goods through a reckless approach to tariffs, a decimation of programs that help Americans afford healthcare, education, food and childcare, and then kneecapping federal regulators who keep banks and other big businesses from swindling consumers,‚Äù said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of the Century Foundation.

‚ÄúThis has created an alarming set of market conditions. Americans are left on their own to face high prices and low earnings, are building their own safety nets from a web of financial products, credit cards, buy now, pay later loans, payday loans and student debt, and companies have been given the green light to manipulate these products to boost their own profits without having to worry about following the law.‚Äù

According to the poll, more than six out of 10 Americans said it had become more difficult to find a good paying job, buy a home and afford childcare.

More than four out of five Americans, 83%, said they were concerned about the cost of groceries, with 46% saying they were very concerned. Some 47% said they were worried about being able to pay their rent or mortgage, 64% said they were worried about affording an unexpected medical expense.

About 48% said they believed they would have trouble affording an unexpected $500 bill without borrowing. One in four said it would be ‚Äúvery difficult‚Äù.

A quarter of those surveyed said they spent at least three hours a day worrying about their finances and ability to afford basic necessities. Another 25% of respondents said they or someone in their household had skipped meals in the past year in order to make ends meet, and 26% said they had fallen behind on their monthly bills over the past year.

Americans also fear things are getting worse economically, with 76% of those polled saying they fear a looming economic recession.

Corporations and billionaires were seen as a big factor behind this financial anxiety, with 51% saying they believe corporations have had an active role in making life more difficult for average people over the past 25 years, and 52% saying billionaires have made life tougher.

Half of those polled also believe congressional Republicans have made life more difficult, with 41% believing Democrats have made life more difficult.

‚ÄúMillions of Americans, across parties, across backgrounds, are deeply anxious, and they're struggling to afford basics like housing and health care. Donald Trump is making these struggles worse,‚Äù said Rachel West, senior fellow at the Century Foundation.

‚ÄúAmericans believe the outsized influence of corporations and the wealthy has made their lives harder, and the risks they're taking to cope with high costs like taking on debt and tapping into their savings should sound an alarm for policymakers.‚Äù

In Moscow, the ‚ÄòThe Birth of Scale' architectural exhibition has come to a close at the National Centre RUSSIA. The project was dedicated to the history of urban planning in the country and aimed to introduce ordinary citizens to the major achievements of domestic architecture. Over several months, tens of thousands of people visited the exposition, including numerous international experts.

Seventy unique architectural models were specially created for the project, along with a collection of drawings and building models previously kept in museums and private collections. According to the organizers, this allowed visitors to trace the evolution of Russian architecture ‚Äì from ancient structures to contemporary megaprojects.

‚ÄúThe outcome was, in some sense, predetermined because the idea of the exhibition was to introduce our citizens to what architecture really is, and who these people ‚Äì architects ‚Äì are, who for a thousand years have been shaping our country... So many people said they learned for the first time what architecture is and how amazing it is in our country, and what incredible projects have been created across different eras... I think that's the best recognition of our work,‚Äù said Andrey Chernikhov, chief curator of ‚ÄòThe Birth of Scale', in an interview with RT.

The exhibition space was divided into several thematic modules, each dedicated to key stages in the development of Russian architecture. Each presented model ‚Äútold a unique story about the boldness of engineering thought, aesthetic excellence, and the aspiration to reach new heights,‚Äù according to organizers. Some of the rare projects showcased were never realized, while others came to life only years later.

‚ÄúThe entire team completed this exhibition in just two months. Outstanding builders, remarkable set designers, excellent curators, and several wonderful teams, including from the National Centre RUSSIA, were involved,‚Äù noted Chernikhov.

The exhibition also drew the attention of international architects, who spoke at the event's panel sessions. Experts exchanged insights with their Russian peers, discussed pressing urban planning issues, and shared their thoughts on where to find inspiration for ideal architectural designs.

‚ÄúIt's crucial to turn to one's roots and traditions ‚Äì this is of primary importance. Economic feasibility also plays a huge role. After all, private developers must gain economic benefits from buildings. And finally, we live in an era of climate crises, so today's architecture must account for environmental considerations as much as possible,‚Äù said Rajendra Kumar, an Indian architect and Director of the School of Architecture and Design at Lovely Professional University, in an interview with RT.

One of the key events on the final day of the exhibition was the panel discussion ‚ÄòArchitecture of the Future: Trends and Forecasts for 2050'. During the discussion, experts talked about the most significant trends, challenges, and prospects for the industry.

‚ÄúModern architecture is facing new challenges that also present opportunities. Particularly, the rise of artificial intelligence and its potential impact on all of us. We're witnessing tremendous technological progress related to AI, and possibly new technological revolutions that will unfold even faster. The architect's role will only become more important,‚Äù said Nadia Tromp, South African architect and founder of Ntsika Architects.

Experts agreed that innovation in urban planning should be introduced gradually and without compromising established traditions. They emphasized that architecture is not merely about constructing buildings, but about conveying meaning.

‚ÄúWe often assume that artificial intelligence and similar technologies are inevitable. But I believe we must look at it differently. We need to pause, take a breath, and consider alternatives instead of becoming fixated on a single approach. We must propose something new‚Äîmore sustainable, more rational, and respectful of the diversity of our planet and cultural systems. We should combine new technologies with traditions,‚Äù said Egyptian architect Walid Arafa, founder of Dar Arafa Architecture.

At the exhibition's closing ceremony, the National Centre RUSSIA and the Yakov Chernikhov Architectural Charitable Foundation announced the winners of the nationwide online competition for young architects, ‚ÄòCreative Hub'. Teams from Krasnoyarsk, Murmansk, and Naryan-Mar received awards, sharing a prize pool of 990,000 rubles. According to the organizers, the funds will support the professional development of the laureates.

‚ÄúArchitecture is the only form of art that we cannot avoid. That's why it's so important for every one of us, and for the state as a whole. It objectively and uncompromisingly reflects the state of our society, our culture, ideology, and spiritual values, and it influences the shaping of future generations,‚Äù summarized Natalia Shashkova, Director of the Shchusev Museum of Architecture.

Yoon's charge of insurrection is punishable by death or life imprisonment and he also faces a string of other investigations led by special prosecutors.Kim Hong-Ji/The Associated Press

South Korea's ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol, who is in detention while on trial and facing various criminal probes, lay on the floor of his cell on Friday and refused to leave it for questioning, a spokesperson for a special prosecutor said.

Yoon was removed from office in April by the Constitutional Court over his botched attempt last year to declare martial law and is now being investigated by a special prosecution team formed under new President Lee Jae Myung.

Prosecutors investigating influence-peddling allegations connected to Yoon and his wife had tried to get him to comply with an arrest warrant and attend questioning voluntarily, a spokesperson for the special prosecution said.

‚ÄúBut the suspect stubbornly refused to do so, while lying on the ground, not dressed in a prison uniform,‚Äù Oh Jung-hee told a news briefing. She said investigators would try again to bring him in, even if they had to use force.

Yoon was dressed only in his undershirt and underwear when prosecutors came to his cell, the Yonhap News Agency reported, citing the special prosecution.

Yu Jeong-hwa, one of Yoon's lawyers, told Reuters that bringing up what he was wearing in a small space where the temperature was close to 40 degrees Celsius (104¬∞F) was a public insult to his dignity and showed how the state was violating inmates' human rights.

The former president was put back in a solitary cell at the Seoul Detention Center in July, as prosecutors investigating his short-lived declaration of martial law in December sought additional charges against him.

Yoon is already on trial for insurrection, a charge which is punishable by death or life imprisonment.

He also faces a string of other investigations led by special prosecutors including one into scandals surrounding his wife, former First Lady Kim Keon Hee, where the couple allegedly exerted inappropriate influence over elections.

Yoon has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyers have accused prosecutors of conducting a politically-motivated witch hunt.

The former president has repeatedly rejected requests by prosecutors to appear for questioning, citing health issues.

His lawyers said on Thursday that he was unwell due to preexisting conditions, including a condition that meant there was a risk of him losing his eyesight.

In a reference to Yoon's position as a former top prosecutor, Oh, the spokesperson for the special prosecution, said the case was being closely scrutinised by the public.

‚ÄúThe suspect has consistently highlighted the importance of laws, principles, fairness and common sense and through this case people are watching if the law applies equally to everyone,‚Äù Oh said.

Separately, investigators requested that Yoon's wife Kim, who has also denied any wrongdoing, attend questioning on August 6. Kim's lawyers have said she would cooperate with the investigation.

Pictures have been released of the woman beaten unconscious during a public brawl in Cincinnati in a possibly racially motivated assault.

The victim, a white woman from Russia known as Holly, was punched in the face after intervening in the melee to come to the aid of a man being attacked by a group.

Photographs of the aftermath show Holly, a single mother, according to reports, with deep purple bruising around her swollen right eye and a split lip.

She is said to have spent several days in hospital being treated for severe concussion and other injuries before returning home to Russia.

Footage from the attack on Saturday has attracted the attention of leading figures including JD Vance, the vice president, and Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and former senior advisor to President Donald Trump.

Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant attorney general in the US Justice Department, suggested the attack may have been motivated by race and that federal hate crime charges could be brought.

‚ÄúNobody in our great nation should be the victim of such a crime, and where race is a motivation, federal law may apply,‚Äù she said.

Sharing the pictures online, Republican state Senator Bernie Moreno said: ‚ÄúThis is Holly. She wanted to have a nice evening out with friends. Instead, she got this.

‚ÄúHolly gave me permission to release the photos so that others will never suffer what she did. We need and deserve change.‚Äù

Videos of the attack have circulated widely, leading to speculation it was racially motivated, although there is no evidence at this stage.

Two black men, Montianez Merriweather, 34, Jermaine Matthews, 39, and one woman, Dekyra Vernon, 24, have been charged with felonious assault, assault and aggravated riot.

Cincinnati councilwoman Victoria Parks, in an online post that has been condemned by conservative politicians and public figures, said the pair ‚Äúbegged for that beat down. I am grateful for the whole story‚Äù.

Ms Parks made the comment on a video showing an excerpt of the brawl in which a white man slaps the cheek of a black man's face before being set upon and beaten to the ground by the mob.

Ms Parks has defended her comments, saying that ‚Äúwhen a black person is hit by a white person, generations of frustration, pain and terror is released‚Äù.

In an interview with Local 12, a Cincinnati news channel, she said: ‚ÄúWhen I first saw the brawl, I was devastated. But then I realized that there was more to the story.

Asked if they ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù being beaten, she replied: ‚ÄúNobody deserves a beating.‚ÄúThere is such [sic] thing as inappropriate actions, and there are consequences to actions.‚Äù

Cincinnati police have said there is video evidence of the Caucasian victim being hit by the suspects before the slap.

The melee broke out just after 03:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Saturday, according to Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge.

Footage of the incident went viral after being posted online, including to a local crime-focused Facebook page.

A white man is seen reaching out to slap a black man dressed in a red T-shirt while the pair argue surrounded by a group.

Several people are then seen kicking, punching and throwing themselves at the man while he attempts to protect himself.

He falls to the floor and multiple people stamp on the man's head.

Another clip, apparently later in the altercation, shows Holly being punched in the face by a man and collapsing on the street.

The FBI and the Department of Justice have confirmed a federal investigation into the assaults is ongoing.

Mr Merriweather appeared in court Thursday, where his family claimed afterwards the fight has only drawn so much attention and outrage because of race.

‚ÄúIf it was an African American woman who got knocked out‚Ä¶ We wouldn't have been going through all this,‚Äù one of his unidentified loved ones told WLWT news outside the courthouse.

Desire Merriweather, Mr Merriweather's cousin, expressed sympathy for the victims but insisted her relative is not a ‚Äúracist,‚Äù pointing to his biracial son as evidence.

Mr Merriweather was indicted earlier in July on weapons charges and a count of receiving stolen property, but was released on bail after paying 10 per cent of a $4,000 (¬£3,000) bond.

Records indicate Mr Merriweather is now being held on $500,000 bond and that Bond has been set at $200,000 for Ms Vernon and $100,000 for Mr Matthews.

The FBI and the Department of Justice have confirmed a federal investigation into the assaults is ongoing.

Vivek Ramaswamy, an Ohio gubernatorial candidate who has claimed to have spoken with Holly, said in a post on X ‚ÄúShe's a single working mom who went to a friend's birthday party.

‚ÄúIt's unconscionable that there were no police present in that area of Cincinnati on a Friday night, or even an ambulance to take her to the hospital.‚Äù

The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History (NMAH) has removed explicit reference to President Donald Trump from an impeachment exhibit, a spokesperson said on July 31.

A temporary label containing information about Trump's two impeachments had been on display since September 2021 at the Washington museum, but was meant to be a short-term addition to its exhibits, the spokesperson said.

            The world of chess has been going through somewhat of an evolution in recent years, and it's showing no signs of slowing down.
    


            The ancient game's popularity boom has been well documented, owing in part to the rise of online formats during the Covid-19 pandemic and the reputational boost provided by mainstream media, such as the Netflix series ‚ÄúThe Queen's Gambit.‚Äù
    


            Since then, chess' move to online platforms has accelerated and its now currently debuting at the Esports World Cup (EWC) this week.
    


            The tournament, hosted and part-funded by Saudi Arabia, was held for the first time in 2024 and brought together professional gamers, publishers and fans from across the world for an eight-week competitive gaming bonanza.
    


            Earlier this year, it was announced that chess would be included in the 2025 edition, with the best players in the world competing for a $1.5 million prize pool ‚Äì playing a new format which is deemed more accessible to an esports audience.
    


            In a bid to compete in the new event, top esports teams set about signing some of the best chess players on the planet. Team Liquid, one of the biggest esports teams, didn't hold back and signed Norwegian world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen, arguably the greatest chess player of all time.
    


            Carlsen, who has also been an ambassador for the EWC, spoke to CNN Sports ahead of this year's tournament about how the game can benefit in the digital era.
    


            ‚ÄúI think this is a massive moment for chess,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúChess has become more and more online over the last few years, especially since Covid when we couldn't host live tournaments.
    


            ‚ÄúOnline was what we had and those online tournaments became bigger and bigger, and it feels like this is the next step to have these hybrid events.‚Äù
    


            While many players, including Carlsen, want to keep the traditional over-the-board chess alive, the transition to online platforms has coincided with changes in the game's format.
    


            With online games getting quicker, the goal for the EWC's competition was to create a version which would stay true to tradition while incorporating elements associated with fast-paced esports games.
    


            The result was the creation of a 10+0 format, which will give both players 10 minutes to make their moves without any chance to add additional time, increasing the chances of blunders as players battle against the clock.
    


            The change, although radical when you compare to what the game was like less than 20 years ago, feels very natural to Carlsen.
    


            ‚ÄúThe funny thing about chess is that it is a bit of an ancient game and an analog game,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it's also kind of made for the digital age because it's so simple to translate.
    


            ‚ÄúMost of the time when I'm practicing chess, it's always on a screen, whether it's a phone, a computer or a tablet.
    


            ‚ÄúThen when I get to tournaments, the pieces feel a bit strange and I don't feel like I quite see the board the same way.‚Äù
    


            The International Chess Federation (FIDE) is still very much considered the home of classic chess, but its CEO Emil Sutovsky told CNN Sports earlier this year that the game's governing body is supportive of the emerging esports partnership.
    


            He said FIDE was involved in early conversations with organizers, before Chess.com became the natural partner on which to stage the EWC.
    


Chess.com has been one of the main driving forces behind the transition to online formats, allowing anyone with an internet connection to practice and play chess wherever they are in the world.
    


            Carlsen, who became a grandmaster at 13, says the online world has opened the world of chess to a new audience.
    


            ‚ÄúIt's a fantastic thing that we have this new digital age, where information is so easily available,‚Äù he told CNN Sports.
    


            ‚ÄúIt means that the game is much more accessible to fans. You have engines that can show you how the games are going and it sort of demystifies the game.
    


Youngest ever chess world champion Gukesh Dommaraju returns home to rock star welcome in India



            ‚ÄúAll these tools make it so much easier for both kids and adults to improve on their chess a lot and I think that's part of why you're seeing a lot of kids these days, they become very, very strong at a very early age.
    


            ‚ÄúKids routinely become grandmasters at earlier ages. The audience is getting younger as well, and more and more digital. So it's really an exciting time.‚Äù
    


            The chess competition got underway on Tuesday, with Carlsen making the final following an incredible semifinal against fellow grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura, which was only settled following armageddon. The world No. 1 will take on GM Alireza Firouzja on Friday in the championship match with the winner taking home $250,000.

Ukrainian leader says talks should go ahead if Putin's remarks are ‚Äòsignals of a genuine willingness to end the war'

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to Putin's comments, repeating that Ukraine is ready for talks at the leaders' level ‚Äúat any time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have heard the statements coming out of Russia.

If these are signals of a genuine willingness to end the war with dignity and establish a truly lasting peace ‚Äì and not merely an attempt to buy more time for war or delay sanctions ‚Äì then Ukraine once again reaffirms its readiness to meet at the level of leaders at any time.‚Äù

He continued by explaining why a direct meeting is needed to conduct talks.

‚ÄúWe understand who makes the decisions in Russia and who must end this war. The whole world understands this too,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúUkraine proposes to move from exchanges of statements and technical-level meetings to talks between leaders.

The United States has proposed this.

Ukraine had supported it.

What is needed is Russia's readiness.‚Äù

Zelenskyy also pointedly thanked US president Donald Trump for his work on ending the conflict, seemingly acknowledging how much depends on his response to Putin's latest attacks.

‚Ä¶ and on that note, it's a wrap!

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for direct talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin instead of limited technical talks by officials, saying ‚Äúwe understand who makes the decisions in Russia‚Äù (14:23).

His comments came after Putin said he wanted ‚Äúa lasting and stable peace,‚Äù but offered no sign that he is willing to make any concessions and reasserted his targets in Ukraine and bragged about Russian troops advancing on the frontline (13:46, 13:56, 16:45).

Earlier today, Ukraine confirmed that 31 people died as a result of a recent Russian attack on Kyiv, with over 150 injured (10:24).

A meeting of the UN security council on the situation in Ukraine was planned for later today.

Elsewhere, Germany confirmed it was working on moving first elements of the Patriot missile system into Ukraine ‚Äúin the coming days‚Äù (11:43, 12:33).

Poland marked the 81st anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, with sirens wailing across the country's capital and traffic coming to a halt to commemorate the largest military effort taken by a European resistance movement during the second world war.

Every year, the entire city take part in dozens of events around the anniversary, joined by dwindling number of veterans in attendance, with the Warsaw Uprising Museum playing a central role to the proceedings.

Europe's top court questioned the legitimacy of the ‚Äúsafe countries‚Äù list Italy uses to send migrants to Albania and fast-track their asylum claims, in a fresh blow to a key plank of the government's migration policy, Reuters reported.

Conservative prime minister Giorgia Meloni's office, in a statement, called the court ruling ‚Äúsurprising‚Äù and said it ‚Äúweakens policies to combat mass illegal immigration and defend national borders.‚Äù

Reuters noted that the Luxembourg-based ECJ said Italy is authorised to fast-track asylum rejections for nationals coming from countries on a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù list ‚Äì a principle at the heart of the Albania scheme.

It also said Italy is free to decide which countries are ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, but also warned that such a designation should meet strict legal standards and allow applicants and courts to access and challenge the supporting evidence.

The ECJ said that a country might not be classified ‚Äúsafe‚Äù if it does not offer adequate protection to its entire population, effectively agreeing with Italian judges that had raised this issue last year, Reuters said.

The Lithuanian army has found a drone, believed to be Russian-made, that entered Lithuania from Belarusian airspace earlier this week, amid concerns about growing Russian provocations.

AFP noted that the drone entered Lithuania in the early hours of Monday, with members of the public recording its flight over parts of the country's capital Vilnius before it disappeared.

The military said in a statement that it believed it to be a Gerbera decoy drone, which it uses during its invasion of Ukraine with the aim to overhelm and distract air defences, AFP said.

The drone was found in the Gaiziunai military training grounds, near a town that hosts the international Nato battalion.

A similar incident happened earlier this month, with some the country's leaders getting moved to bomb shelters in response.

France said it could not seize women's contraception products estimated to be worth $9.7m that the United States plans to destroy, after media reports suggested the stockpile would be incinerated in the country.

The contraceptives ‚Äì intended for some of the world's poorest countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa ‚Äì were bought by the US foreign aid agency USAID under former president Joe Biden.

The administration of Biden's successor Donald Trump, which has slashed USAID and pursued anti-abortion policies, confirmed last month it planned to destroy the contraceptives, which have been stored in a warehouse in the Belgian city of Geel.

France's government has come under pressure to save the contraceptives, with women's rights groups calling the US decision ‚Äúinsane‚Äù.

But France's health ministry told AFP today there was no legal way for it to intervene.

The health ministry told AFP that the government had ‚Äúexamined the courses of action available to us, but unfortunately there is no legal basis for intervention by a European health authority, let alone the French national drug safety authority, to recover these medical products.

‚ÄúSince contraceptives are not drugs of major therapeutic interest, and in this case we are not facing a supply shortage, we have no means to requisition the stocks,‚Äù it added.

Let's quickly catch up on other European news today.

in Kyiv

Vladimir Putin has said he wants a ‚Äúlasting and stable peace‚Äù in Ukraine but given no indication that he is willing to make any concessions to achieve it, after a week in which Russian missiles and drones again caused death and destruction across Ukraine.

‚ÄúWe need a lasting and stable peace on solid foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and would ensure the security of both countries,‚Äù said Putin, speaking to journalists on Friday, a week before a new deadline imposed by Donald Trump for hostilities to cease.

Trump has said if Russia and Ukraine do not come to an agreement to end the war by next Friday, 8 August, he will impose a package of economic sanctions on Russia.

Before he took office, Trump had promised to end the war in 24 hours, but since he became president his repeated overtures to Putin have achieved minimal results.

In recent weeks, Trump has markedly changed his rhetoric on the conflict, appearing less conciliatory to Putin and more amenable to enhanced support for Ukraine. He called Russia's continued attacks on civilian areas ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù on Thursday.

Last month Trump said he was ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù with Putin. ‚ÄúWe'll have a great conversation. I'll say: ‚ÄòThat's good, I'll think we're close to getting it done,' and then he'll knock down a building in Kyiv,‚Äù he told the BBC.

Seemingly referencing Trump's comments, Putin said on Friday: ‚ÄúAs for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general rule.‚Äù

The death toll from a series of Russian strikes on Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday rose sharply on Friday, to 31, after rescuers found more than a dozen bodies in the rubble of an apartment block that had collapsed after one of the strikes. There were five children among the dead, including a two-year-old, while 159 people were wounded in the attack, one of the worst to hit the Ukrainian capital in more than three years of full-scale war.

As to Putin's claims that Russian army is advancing in Ukraine, an AFP analysis of data from the US-based Institute for the Study of War, or ISW, appears to confirm that claim.

AFP said that Russia's military advance accelerated for a fourth straight month in July, with greatest gains since November.

In one month, the Russian army took 713 square kilometres (275 square miles) of Ukrainian territory, while the Ukrainians reclaimed 79 square kilometres, the analysis said.

This has resulted in a net gain of 634 square kilometres compared with 588 square kilometres in June, 507 square kilometres in May, 379 square kilometres in April, and 240 square kilometres in March.

These figures include territories fully or partially controlled by Russia and those claimed by it.

Meanwhile, Zelenskyy has just disclosed that he spoke with UK prime minister Keir Starmer, discussing the need to scale up drone production and associated financial needs, and to move on sanctions.

The conversation started with Starmer's condolences for the Russian attack on Kyiv, which killed 32, and their discussion on ‚Äúhow to stop the killings, provide greater protection for our people, and force Russia to end this war.‚Äù

The Ukrainian president said that, despite bullish rhethoric coming from Moscow, ‚ÄúRussia genuinely fears‚Äù sanctions, ‚Äúno matter how hard it pretends that it couldn't care less.‚Äù

‚ÄúSanctions are undoubtedly working ‚Äì and there will be more. We are working with everyone on coordinated restrictive measures.‚Äù

Zelenskyy also said he spoke with Starmer about ‚Äúcoordination of actions‚Äù with US under Trump and ‚Äúpossible formats for peace negotiations at the level of leaders.‚Äù

He ended:

‚ÄúWe are also preparing for active diplomatic engagement with our partners in Europe and the United States. We aligned our positions ahead of upcoming international events.‚Äù

Following Zelenskyy's comments, his most senior aide Andriy Yermak said in his trademark blunt style that ‚Äúit's long past time for Russians to move from empty talks and living in a fantasy world to facing reality.‚Äù

He said that ‚Äúa meeting of leaders is possible ‚Äì it's Russia that doesn't want it.‚Äù

‚ÄúToo many statements about ‚Äòwanting peace' while missile strikes continue ‚Äî and not a single real step toward peace from Moscow.

Where is the ceasefire the United States proposed back in March ‚Äì the one we agreed to?

President [Trump] is doing a great deal to achieve peace.

President Zelenskyy shares the principle of peace through strength.

It's time for Russia to stop lying on the bench and start getting specific.‚Äù

WASHINGTON, August 1. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing tariffs ranging from 15% to 41% on the European Union and more than 60 other countries.

The document has been published by the White House.

The tariffs will take effect on August 7. The nations that are expected to face the highest tariffs include Iraq (35%), Serbia (35%), Switzerland (39%), Laos (40%), Myanmar (40%), and Syria (41%).

Apart from countries, the list also includes the Falkland Islands, on which the US is imposing a 10% tariff, and Taiwan (20%).

According to the order, goods from the countries not listed in the document "will be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10%."

Trump also signed a separate executive order, raising tariffs on Canada from 25% to 35%, which had been introduced over the country's failure to take sufficient measures to combat fentanyl smuggling into the US.

On July 26, Taiwanese citizens went to the polls and voted on whether to recall 24 of their 113 representatives‚Äîor 21 percent of the legislature. It was an unprecedented moment in the island's democratic history. Citizens have recalled individual Taiwanese legislators in the past, but never before have they attempted to recall politicians en masse.

The recalls were ultimately defeated. But their very occurrence, and the months of campaigning that preceded them, highlight a fundamental challenge in Taiwan's politics: deep polarization. Taiwan's two main political parties, the center-left Democratic Progressive Party and the center-right Kuomintang, increasingly despise each other. Many DPP politicians have suggested the KMT is too sympathetic to China and may be collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party. The DPP's leader, Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, even said that recalling politicians was necessary to remove ‚Äúimpurities‚Äù from society. Numerous KMT politicians, meanwhile, have accused Lai of brutal, authoritarian behavior. During the campaign, KMT leader Eric Chu compared the DPP to the Nazis and Lai to Adolf Hitler. The island's third-biggest party, the KMT-aligned Taiwan People's Party, also deeply detests the DPP government. The TPP's leader is facing corruption charges, and the party claims it is being politically persecuted.

Taiwan's parties, in other words, portray their opponents not just as politically different but as autocratic traitors. They see themselves, meanwhile, as democracy's saviors. This deep-seated animosity has led to extreme governmental dysfunction‚Äîwhich is what prompted citizens to mobilize the recall efforts. The KMT and TPP control the legislature, where they consistently oppose Lai's endeavors. Taiwan's progressives, furious at the resulting obstruction, thus gathered enough signatures to vote on recalling roughly a third of the KMT's legislators. Their failure means that extreme polarization will continue to plague the island's government. In fact, the hatred and gridlock could intensify.

There is still an outside chance the DPP could win the six seats it needs to gain control of the legislature. Seven more KMT legislators are facing recalls at the end of August. But even if the recall efforts succeed, the island as a whole will remain riddled with divisions‚Äîwhich means it will be in a weak position to deal with growing geopolitical threats. Over the last several years, Beijing has become increasingly aggressive toward Taiwan. The People's Liberation Army has conducted more drills around the island, and senior Chinese leaders have been more blunt about the possibility of military action. To handle this challenge, Taiwan's citizens and officials will need to be willing to fight for all of the island, not just for their partisan affiliates. Taiwanese leaders will have to create a unified course of action. Instead, right now, they are prioritizing defeating one another over defending the nation.

Across the United States and Europe, analysts and policymakers frequently cite Taiwan as a paradigm of democracy‚Äîan inspiring example of how a polity can transform itself from a brutal dictatorship into a thriving liberal state. There is, after all, much about the island to celebrate. It is rich and prosperous, with a powerful civil society and free and fair elections.

But that isn't the whole story. Taiwan's parties may respect the freedom of the press and the results of contests. But they do not respect one another, and neither do their supporters. Taiwanese citizens suffer not simply from polarization but from affective polarization, where they actively resent people who hold different views and see them as less trustworthy at best and treacherous at worst. Citizens sharply disagree not just about policy but about their island's core values and future trajectory.

Taiwan's polarization encompasses many different issues. But it is most dangerous on the question of how best to handle Beijing. Only a small minority of citizens in Taiwan want to join the People's Republic of China, and almost everyone believes they belong to a separate political entity. But Taiwan's citizens do not agree on how to protect themselves from Beijing. For the KMT, Taiwan must maintain strong ties with the People's Republic, leaning into the island's Chinese heritage in order to assure Beijing of their shared-if-separate connection. The DPP, by contrast, believes there is no way to appease the mainland's leaders. Instead, it thinks Taiwan can only survive by building a powerful military and strengthening ties with anyone other than Beijing, and particularly with Washington. The DPP also believes that close relations with China threaten Taiwan's ability to maintain its own identity, distinct from the mainland's.

The divide over China has fueled polarization in Taiwan for decades. But it has grown worse over the last several years‚Äîpartially thanks to China's growing threat. Now, the parties see their opponents as dangerous to Taiwan's freedom. To much of the DPP, the KMT-TPP coalition has been systematically undermining democracy by pushing through a series of controversial reforms to increase legislative power over the president and by slashing and freezing large swaths of the national budget on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. The KMT and TPP accuse the DPP of being antidemocratic warmongers who are using their power to systematically silence opposition, giving Beijing an excuse to attack.

Both supporters and opponents of the recall elections see these issues as existential in nature. For supporters, the recall was, and is, a matter of national survival. The current crop of KMT legislators has failed to govern competently and is allowing the CCP to erode Taiwanese democracy. Opponents of the recall argued that the DPP seeks to remove the opposition so it does not need to compromise and that full DPP control of the presidency and the legislature will remove checks and balances essential to democracy. As the recall has unfolded, the parties have further demonized the other side. Legislators have even physically attacked one another in the middle of parliamentary debates. Any sympathy for the other position is akin to treason.

Taiwan's intense polarization comes at a particularly inopportune time. Over the last few years, China's threats to the island have grown. Beijing is sending planes and ships into Taiwan's airspace and waterways more often and for longer periods. The People's Liberation Army now carries out regular drills around the Taiwan Strait. And China's leadership has become more belligerent in its statements. Last year, for example, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that ‚Äúthe people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family. No one can sever our family bonds, and no one can stop the historical trend of national reunification.‚Äù

Taiwan's divisions make it very hard for the island to handle this menace. Consider, for example, the dispute over its budget. Lai and the DPP have called for increasing defense spending. The KMT-led coalition, meanwhile, has called for decreasing it. The dispute between the two ended up freezing billions in military spending, some of which remains locked. This freeze not only weakens Taiwan's armed forces but also its relationship with the United States. The Trump administration has demanded that Taipei dramatically increase defense expenditures if it wants continued aid. The DPP and KMT, meanwhile, have increasingly different views on the United States. In an April poll, we found that 50 percent of DPP supporters see the United States as a trustworthy or very trustworthy ally, whereas just three percent of KMT supporters and ten percent of TPP supporters think so.

Taiwan will need a national consensus to respond effectively to threats from Beijing. If some citizens see others as evil, and some leaders are portrayed as villains, they may not feel the kind of patriotism required to fight together. If China invades under Lai's tenure, for instance, many KMT and TPP voters and leaders will blame the president and his administration for provoking Beijing. They might then refuse to defend the island. In a survey conducted in March by Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research, 85 percent of DPP supporters said they were willing to fight for the island in the event of an invasion, compared with 48 percent of KMT voters and 54 percent of TPP voters.



Partisans, of course, might change their minds if the People's Liberation Army starts bombing their neighborhoods. Nothing unifies a society quite like an invasion. But it would take time before Taiwan's divided population rallied around the flag, and time is a luxury Taipei may lack. In fact, the island would need to rush into action even in the face of a lesser crisis. If Beijing quarantines or blockades Taiwan, for example, the island's leaders would face a narrow political window in which to define the crisis and coordinate a timely response, before messaging from partisan media takes over. If officials fail to establish a shared narrative and voters retreat into their ideological echo chambers, Taiwan will lose strategic advantages.

Beijing would also do everything it could to foster internal disarray. For example, if the Chinese Communist Party cut off Taiwan's access to outside communication, it could spread narratives claiming the UN supports its blockade and that no assistance is coming to the island. Beijing, after all, already carries out plenty of disinformation operations to deepen Taiwan's polarization and foment division. For instance, in both the 2020 and 2024 presidential races, watchdog organizations in Taiwan documented mass social media campaigns from the mainland trying to convince voters that democracy is not worth it or that a vote for the DPP is a vote for war.

Beijing's campaigns have created plenty of headaches for Taiwanese officials. But the island's society would be polarized over the question of China even without mainland efforts. Research on Beijing's nonstop disinformation campaigns have found it has decidedly mixed effects on political opinion, often backfiring. Many of Beijing's efforts to scare Taiwanese citizens invoke more cringe than panic. China, in other words, is often adding fuel to a fire that is already raging.

Taiwan's polarization is a serious security threat. But the island has shown resilience amid even greater challenges in the past. In less than 40 years, Taiwan has successfully charted a path from martial law and authoritarian rule to free and fair elections, despite its contested geopolitical status. There are good reasons to think it can surmount polarization.

The first is that not everyone in Taiwan is a staunch partisan. Polls show that roughly 40 percent of voters do not outwardly identify with any party. Not everyone in this pool is actually nonpartisan; plenty of voters say they are independents but, in practice, always vote one way. Still, there are plenty of Taiwanese voters who shift between camps or want compromise from their leaders. In fact, the recall movement has generated a small but growing sense of solidarity between moderate DPP supporters and moderate KMT ones. They are jointly frustrated over the legislature's incompetence‚Äîand frightened by Beijing's interference in Taiwanese democracy (which was evident throughout the recall campaigns).

The island's leaders have also shown their ability to deliver when faced with emergencies. During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan was able to present a remarkably unified front to combat the outbreak. Its political leadership quickly joined together in describing the virus as a national security threat, prompting a whole-of-society approach to prevent the spread of the disease. As a result, the island was quite successful at managing the pandemic, especially compared with the many countries, where governments struggled to get full public buy-in to health measures.

None of this means Taiwan's leaders have to see eye to eye on how to deal with Beijing. There is room for healthy debate. But politicians need to avoid ad hominem attacks, accusations of treason, and demonizing swaths of society. The island's leaders must show greater cooperation when it comes to matters of defense. Extreme or provocative rhetoric does not increase the relative level of peace in the Taiwan Strait. And by partially collaborating over China, Taiwan's leaders might be able to broadly heal the island. Defending its current democratic system and way of life, after all, is the one thing that most Taiwanese agree is essential. Finding some points of consensus on this fundamental issue might thus be the first step toward overcoming polarization.

 Dalia Dassa Kaye

During the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel achieved stunning military success against what seemed to be formidable adversaries. Yet Israel didn't translate its military success into active diplomacy; if it had, the region and Israel's position in it might look very different today. Israel may not have thought it had a choice to make back then: it didn't believe it had viable Arab partners for peace, and its military dominance was far from assured, as demonstrated just six years later when Egypt launched a surprise attack and started the Yom Kippur War.

The situation is different today. After its 12-day war with Iran in June, Israel is in a far superior military and regional position than it was in 1967. It has neutered its most serious regional threats, and it has been decades since an Arab state fought a war with Israel. It has steadily degraded its nonstate adversaries, scoring surprising military and intelligence wins against Hezbollah in Lebanon last summer and continuing its decapitation of Hamas's leadership in Gaza. Its attack against Iran achieved undeniable military success in damaging Iran's nuclear and missile facilities, and it demonstrated deep intelligence penetration through its brazen killing of Iran's top military leadership and nuclear scientists. U.S. President Donald Trump's subsequent decision to join the attack boosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu domestically.

Israel's wins are not without limits, of course. Experts have questioned the full extent of damage to Iran's nuclear program, and the strikes may have only strengthened the Iranian leadership and increased its motivation to cross the nuclear threshold. Houthi missile and drone attacks against Israel have also continued, suggesting that the diminishment of Iran's proxy network is a work in progress. The Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir, acknowledged in remarks in late July that ‚ÄúIran and its axis remain in our sights; the campaign against Iran isn't over.‚Äù Still, despite these remaining challenges, the overriding Israeli perception is that the regional balance sheet is working in its favor.

This is arguably Israel's moment to leverage this favorable strategic landscape and convert its military success into diplomatic capital, restarting talks with the Palestinians that could create long-term stability and encourage more of Israel's Arab neighbors to normalize relations. After the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat used his military achievements to advance a strategic decision to make peace.

But Netanyahu is not steering his country in that direction. His desire for ‚Äútotal victory‚Äù has fueled a relentlessly destructive military campaign in Gaza and beyond with little regard for the damage it has wreaked on the country's regional and global relationships, not to mention the dire human consequences.

To the extent that Netanyahu is thinking ahead, he sees the military successes of the past 18 months as an opportunity for Israel to forge a new regional order while pursuing a maximalist agenda. Netanyahu believes that he can pursue normalization and nonbelligerency agreements with Arab powers such as Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria without making serious concessions on the Palestinian issue or unduly limiting Israel's freedom of military action across its borders. Even if Israel makes some limited headway on such agreements once the Gaza war finally ends, regional deals that do not address the core Israeli-Palestinian conflict will have little or no domestic support within neighboring states and are more likely to lay the ground for renewed conflict.

In early July, in remarks during his third White House visit with Trump in less than six months, Netanyahu reflected on how Israeli success might bring new opportunities: ‚ÄúI think that everyone understands that the situation has changed,‚Äù he boasted. ‚ÄúIran was essentially running Syria, directly through Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been brought to its knees. Iran is out of the picture. So I think this presents opportunities for stability, for security, and eventually for peace.‚Äù

Many observers hoped that the Israeli-Iranian cease-fire in June would revitalize diplomacy on Gaza after months of stalemate. With Netanyahu's success against Iran, this logic went, Netanyahu would no longer fear that ending the war would threaten his political survival. Indeed, polling indicates that most Israelis want an end to the fighting in Gaza to facilitate the release of the Israeli hostages that Hamas continues to hold. Talks to establish a cease-fire did in fact resume on July 6 in Doha, but they did not yield an agreement‚Äîand the deal under discussion was merely a short-term pause in fighting and a limited hostage and prisoner release, not a full end to the war.

Meanwhile, Israeli leaders continue to press ahead with plans to relocate Gazans into limited ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù areas in southern Gaza, with the wider objective largely understood to be the eventual removal of Gazans from the strip, measures that Israeli scholars and even Moshe Yaalon, the former Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, say would amount to war crimes. Israeli officials seem to believe that Trump supports their plans to displace Gazans, plans that track with Trump's earlier proposal to resettle Palestinians outside of Gaza and transform it into a ‚ÄúRiviera of the Middle East.‚Äù

Although Israel says it does not want to stay in Gaza, it now controls much of it. When asked about postwar conditions, Israel's ambassador to the UN told The Guardian, ‚ÄúI think we will make sure in terms of security, we have the ability to act in Gaza, very similar to what's happening today in Judea and Samaria,‚Äù the term some Israelis use to describe the occupied West Bank. In other words, Israel's military occupation of the territories will likely continue into the foreseeable future, and Israel could escalate by annexing the West Bank and even parts of Gaza.

All of this suggests that Israel's war with Iran has not altered Netanyahu's long-standing views of the region. For him, military wins demonstrate that strength pays off, making compromise with the Palestinians unnecessary for his wider regional aims. In this reading, the region will have to accommodate Israeli preferences, and not vice versa. From Netanyahu's perspective, Arab leaders are eager to benefit from Israel's technological and military prowess. Although the Arab world galvanized in opposition to Israel's war in Gaza with summits and statements, none of the parties to the Abraham Accords have pulled out. Egypt and Jordan have not suggested undoing their peace treaties with Israel; Jordan even assisted in Israel's defense against Iranian attacks last year. Arab states issued statements condemning Israeli strikes against Iran last month, but Netanyahu has long believed that these states are fundamentally aligned with Israeli efforts to clip Iran's wings, seeing Iran, not Israel, as the region's most significant strategic threat. But regional realities are unlikely to be as accommodating as Netanyahu may believe, even with Trump's support.

The most sought-after regional deal is between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse viewed as a key leader of the Arab and Islamic world. The Biden administration exerted considerable effort to broker such a deal, with Netanyahu even announcing at the United Nations in September 2023 that Israel was on the ‚Äúcusp‚Äù of a historic agreement with Saudi Arabia. Although it was never clear a deal was as close as Netanyahu claimed, the Saudis significantly hardened their position in the wake of the Gaza war. Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud reflected consistent Saudi positions when he bluntly stated that normalization with Israel is ‚Äúoff the table until we have a resolution to Palestinian statehood.‚Äù

Israelis may believe that once the Gaza war is out of the headlines, the Saudis will settle for less; a deal with Israel, after all, would put the Saudis in further good graces with Trump and provide economic, intelligence, and security benefits. But the Saudis are unlikely to share this calculus. Saudi Arabia has found other ways to please Trump without focusing on Israel, including promises of hefty economic investments and arms deals during Trump's visit to the kingdom in May. The Saudis have also expended so much political capital in linking normalization with Israel to a Palestinian state that they are unlikely to settle with just lip service to the cause‚Äîand the current Israeli leadership is not even providing that.



Israel's war with Iran has only further complicated Arab positions. Regional powers such as Saudi Arabia have been normalizing ties with Iran in recent years, in large part to stay out of Iran's cross hairs. The Saudis and other Gulf Arab states are focused on domestic priorities and economic diversification plans, and wars are not good for business. Although Israel's neighbors no doubt welcomed the degradation of Iranian military capabilities, they did not celebrate Israel's attacks, which put the region on the brink of full-scale war. Indeed, Iran's retaliatory strike on the U.S. base in Qatar, designed to limit casualties and avoid further escalation, nonetheless was a potent reminder that the Israeli-Iranian-U.S. conflict puts Gulf states in harm's way. The Saudis have continued to engage the Iranians and promote diplomacy over military conflict, as evidenced by Saudi Arabia's hosting of the Iranian foreign minister in his first visit to a Gulf state since the Iranian attack on Qatar.

Israel's Arab neighbors may welcome keeping Iran in a box but also worry about a completely unrestrained Israel, which is increasingly seen as a regional destabilizer, not a regional savior. In Syria, for instance, a common perception is that Israel is encouraging divisions and undermining the new government's attempts to unify the country. In mid-July, after a recent spate of sectarian violence in Syria's south, Israel launched airstrikes on Syrian government facilities in Damascus. Israeli officials claimed their intent was to protect Syria's Druze minority ‚Äúowing to the deep covenant of blood with our Druze citizens in Israel‚Äù and to ‚Äúensure the demilitarization of the region adjacent to our border with Syria.‚Äù But Syrian leader Ahmed al-Shara characterized the Israeli intervention as a plot to divide Syria and destabilize the country. Thomas Barrack, a close ally of Trump who is serving as the U.S. special envoy to Syria and U.S. ambassador to Turkey, said the Israeli strikes were ‚Äúpoorly timed‚Äù and complicated efforts to stabilize the region.

Indeed, the Israeli strikes on Damascus underscore how Netanyahu is not only misreading the situation with his Arab neighbors but potentially with Trump. The Trump administration has been focused on getting a deal between Israel and Syria ever since the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2024. The new Syrian leadership was uniquely interested in new security agreements since it wanted economic relief to rebuild the country. To that end, the Trump administration backed lifting sanctions on Syria, and the president demonstrated U.S. political support for the new government through his high-profile meeting with Shara in Riyadh in May. The Trump administration will want to see its political and economic investments in Syria pay off through an Israeli-Syrian deal‚Äîideally even announcing Syria's joining of the Abraham Accords. But Netanyahu has made such a deal more difficult with Israel's aggressive military posture inside Syria, a posture some analysts see as overreach that is making unnecessary enemies even as Syria currently has little capacity to harm Israel.

Netanyahu may be correct in surmising that Israel's neighbors respect its new position of strength, but he is repeatedly misjudging their reactions when that strength lacks a political purpose and ignores their interests. Arab leaders already facing significant domestic challenges will have a hard time achieving extensive normalization deals with Israel when there is hostile sentiment toward Israel among Arab publics. By pursuing his current course toward the Palestinians, Netanyahu may very well end up with a forever war in Gaza, unrest in the West Bank, constant ‚Äúmowing the lawn‚Äù efforts in Iran, and no progress toward normalization with Arab neighbors‚Äîall while the country's international image suffers as never before.

There are other ways forward. Israeli leaders could take Arab proposals seriously, proposals that are seeking to bring humanitarian relief and stabilize and rebuild Gaza without Hamas and without forcing Gazans to leave their homes. The Israeli government has rejected these Arab initiatives, as has the Trump administration.

Israel can make other choices, and it has done so before. Previous Israeli prime ministers understood that Israel's conflict with the Palestinians is its most serious existential threat. Netanyahu has tried instead to demonstrate that it is possible to marginalize the Palestinians and emasculate their national aspirations without sacrificing Israel's ultimate acceptance into the region or its own security.

Shimon Peres was ridiculed for talking about a new Middle East based on economic cooperation and regional integration built on a foundation of peace with the Palestinians. But talk of a new peaceful Middle East today, one based on Israeli military dominance with no political horizon for Palestinians, is no less fantastical. And worse, it will be far more dangerous, bringing Israel right back to where it started.

MOSCOW, August 1. /TASS/. Imuron-vac, a Russian vaccine for immunotherapy of bladder cancer, developed by the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, has been registered by the Russian Health Ministry and is being used for post-surgery treatment of patients, the center's Director Alexander Gintsburg told TASS.

"Yes, it has been registered. <...> And it is being successfully used for immunotherapy after surgical treatment of bladder cancer," he said.

In his words, the vaccine is also being exported to countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, where it is in great demand. The delivery of a large batch of the medicine to Armenia is now being planned.

The scientist went on to say that the trials of the vaccine have been successfully completed, returning valuable data.

The Trump administration has mostly respected the USMCA, and that's a big reason why the impact of tariffs on Canada has not been more sharply negative.Christopher Furlong/Reuters

After Mexico got a 90-day extension to continue negotiations with Washington, there was a glimmer of hope that the third amigo in the North American trade pact would get the same treatment. Nope.

Aug. 1 was U.S. President Donald Trump's deadline for a slew of countries, including Canada, to do ‚Äúdeals‚Äù or face a new round of tariffs. The arrangement was basically this: Accept higher tariffs ‚Äì 15 per cent across the board is the new baseline ‚Äì or get hit with even higher tariffs. If you retaliate, you'll also get hit with higher tariffs.

Before July 31 was out, many countries learned that they were on the punishment list. Canada is, with the president ordering a 35-per-cent tariff to go into effect on Friday. The excuse is fentanyl, but don't take it personally. It's just a legal pretext, and a thin one at that. The other excuse is that we retaliated.

Canadians had been waiting to find out whether Mr. Trump would follow through on his threat, and now we have our answer. What we don't know is what happens next. 

The unknowns includes what other tariffs Mr. Trump could threaten or impose in the months to come; what exactly he wants from Canada; whether any of the trade walls he's erecting while bypassing Congress's constitutional authority will be knocked down by the courts; and how long this one-way trade war against much of the world will last.

But there are some things we know. We know how the Canadian economy is doing in the face of tariffs. And we can predict how it is likely to do in the face of higher or lower tariffs. 

Trump raises tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% as trade deal remains elusive

On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada modelled three possible tariff futures, and their impact on this country.

So far, the Canadian economy has been holding up relatively well, under the circumstances. There are a couple of circumstances to keep in mind. 

Canada, far more the European Union, China or Japan, is dependent on trade with the U.S. The EU exports about twice as much in goods and services to the U.S. as Canada, but the Canadian economy is one-tenth the size of the EU's. If the U.S. imposes the same tariffs on Canada and the EU, the harm to Canada will be much greater.

However, Canada is currently subject to considerably lower effective tariffs than most other U.S. trading partners. Even after everything Mr. Trump has announced ‚Äì from a 25-per-cent tariff, now raised to 35 per cent, to global sectoral levies on steel, aluminum, cars, lumber and some copper products ‚Äì the bulk of Canadian exports remain shielded. 

The reason is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Royal Bank of Canada estimated that, after Mr. Trump's first rounds of tariffs, almost 90 per cent of Canadian exports entered the U.S. duty free in April. This week's modelling from the Bank of Canada assumes that 100 per cent of energy exports and 95 per cent of all other exports are compliant with the USCMA. They still enter the U.S. tariff-free or nearly tariff-free, with the exception of products subject to sectoral tariffs.

We don't know what tomorrow will bring, but that's where the central bank believes things stood as of last Sunday. It estimates that tariff-free access to the U.S. for most Canadian goods, combined with high sectoral levies on a short-list of targeted sectors, mean that Canada's exports to the U.S. face an average 5-per-cent Trump tariff.

That's considerably lower than the Trump taxes on U.S. imports from most other countries. Imports from China have been hit this year with an average 29-per-cent tariff, while those from the rest of the world face an average Trump tax of 11 per cent, according to the Bank of Canada.

The Trump administration has so far mostly respected the USMCA ‚Äì though who knows what the future holds ‚Äì and that's why the impact of tariffs on Canada has not been more negative. Thursday's executive order, raising the our-excuse-is-fentanyl tariff to 35 per cent from 25 per cent, continues to apply only to non-USMCA goods. Again, the Bank of Canada says that's zero per cent of energy exports, and only 5 per cent of the rest.

The USMCA is Canada's ace. But how long will it continue to be playable?

The central bank estimates that the economy contracted 1.5 per cent in the second quarter of 2025. But if tariff rates had remained where they were prior to Thursday night, the bank expected modest growth to return in the second half of this year. That story should not be much altered by Mr. Trump's latest announcement. Again, the additional 10 percentage points of duties applies to less than 5 per cent of Canada's U.S. exports.

In the Bank of Canada's tariff ‚Äúde-escalation‚Äù scenario, U.S. levies on China are reduced slightly, those on the rest of the world are lowered more substantially, and tariffs on Canada are cut in half. Canada also gets rid of any retaliatory tariffs, and most other countries do likewise. The result is slightly more robust Canadian economic growth for the remainder of 2025, and growth continuing through to 2027.

But in the ‚Äúescalation‚Äù scenario, the Canadian economy would take a bigger hit. The assumption in this potential future is that U.S. tariffs on the rest of the world go much higher, and there would be more trade retaliation. Canada and Mexico would still enjoy a tariff advantage, but they would each be hit with an across the board 10-per-cent U.S. tariff‚Äìwith no USMCA exception.

The Bank of Canada says the result would be a Canadian recession this year, followed by a return to growth in 2026. 

The good news is that, even under the central bank's tariff worst-case scenario, our economy would be knocked back only briefly. We would be growing again in just six months. A new round of somewhat higher and considerably broader tariffs from the White House will not put this country into a permanent state of recession. Our economy can find its feet, and relatively quickly.

However, though the Bank of Canada's model suggest that the wounds would be manageable, it also says that the scars, though small, could be enduring. 

The central bank estimates that, by the end of 2027, the country's gross domestic product would be 1.6 per cent less under the tariff escalation scenario than in the event of de-escalation. 

And even the de-escalation scenario has slightly higher U.S. tariffs on Canada than during the pre-Trump era. That means a small but possibly permanent hit to the size of this country's economy.

The Canadian economy can weather whatever tariffs are thrown at us. But the lower the tariffs, the better.

            A federal judge in California on Thursday extended temporary protected status for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem previously determined that conditions in the migrants' home countries no longer warranted the protections, which prevent them from being deported and allow them to work in the US.
    


            Temporary protected status designations for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal were scheduled to end August 5. And protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans to reside and work lawfully in the US for more than 25 years were set to expire September 8. The secretary said both Honduras and Nicaragua had made ‚Äúsignificant progress‚Äù in recovering from 1998's Hurricane Mitch.
    


            The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal.
    


            The terminations are part of a broad effort by the Republican administration to deport immigrants en masse, by going after people who are in the country illegally but also by removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the US on a temporary basis.
    


            Noem can grant temporary protected status to people of various countries already in the US if conditions in the home country prevent a safe return, such as natural disaster or political instability.
    


            The Trump administration has already terminated TPS for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan, Nepal and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits at federal courts.
    


            Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argue that Noem's decisions were not based on objective analysis of conditions at home countries, but predetermined by President Donald Trump's campaign promises and motivated by racial animus. They say designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less.
    


            ‚ÄúThey gave them two months to leave the country. It's awful,‚Äù said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs, at a hearing Tuesday.
    


            The government argues that Noem has clear and unreviewable authority over the TPS program and that her termination decisions reflect the administration's objectives in the areas of immigration and foreign policy.
    


            Justice Department attorney William Weiland said it is not a pretext to have a different view of a program that provides temporary safe harbor.
    


            ‚ÄúIt is not meant to be permanent,‚Äù he said Tuesday.

Palestinians carry humanitarian aid in Gaza on June 16. Prime Minister Mark Carney's announced Wednesday that Canada intends to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in September.Jehad Alshrafi/The Associated Press

Reem Sultan's uncle was killed in Gaza last December, her aunt died of malnutrition in January. Her cousin's family of six, including children, perished when their home was bombed in May. Another cousin who went to retrieve and bury their bodies died in an air strike, killed while grieving the dead. 

In all, the resident of London, Ont., has lost 15 close relatives in the Middle East conflict, but a tally of extended family members reaches closer to 100. So while Ms. Sultan welcomes the news that Canada intends to recognize the state of Palestine, she says more is needed than just words. 

‚ÄúIt is a significant step in aligning Canada with other countries in the world,‚Äù said Ms. Sultan, a pharmacist, in an interview on Thursday. 

‚ÄúBut at the same time, it's very important to emphasize that what is needed right now is to ensure that we end the genocide in Gaza, and for the government to take immediate action to save lives of Palestinians. What good is statehood if it's built on the graves of an entire population?‚Äù

Israel has rejected allegations it is committing genocide in Gaza in the war with Hamas.

What does Canada's recognition of a Palestinian state mean in practice?

Canada's plan to recognize Palestinian statehood prompts swift, divided reaction

Prime Minister Mark Carney's announcement Wednesday that Canada intends to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in September has been met with both cautious hope and urgent demands from Canadians with deep ties to the region. 

Seen by many as an overdue recognition of Palestinian rights, the move has also been criticized as a symbolic gesture with little meaning without change on the ground. Others take issue with the timing. 

Former justice minister Irwin Cotler, a noted human-rights advocate and Canada's first Envoy on Preserving Holocaust Remembrance and Combating Antisemitism, supports Mr. Carney's intention to recognize an independent and democratic Palestinian state. However, he said it should have followed the mandated requirements under international law rather than trusting in good faith that the necessary conditions can be met. 

The Montevideo Convention, signed in 1933, sets out widely accepted criteria for statehood: a permanent population, a defined territory, a functioning government and the ability to engage in foreign relations.

Mr. Carney had said that Canada's ‚Äúintention is predicated‚Äù on the Palestinian Authority's commitment to essential reforms, including that president Mahmoud Abbas hold general elections in 2026 in which Hamas would be unable to take part. 

‚ÄúI have been a supporter of ‚ÄòTwo states for two peoples' for more than 55 years now, not as an idle or lazy slogan, but one which presupposes a mutual acknowledgment of each other's legitimacy, and right to live in peace and security; and two democratic, rights-protecting states side-by-side,‚Äù Mr. Cotler wrote in an e-mail to The Globe and Mail. 

‚ÄúWhat we don't need is another authoritarian or terrorist-supporting state in the Middle East.‚Äù

Izzeldin Abuelaish, a Palestinian doctor who is now a professor of medicine and public health at the University of Toronto, said Canada's move is a step in the right direction but that more action is required. He cited as an example the need for Canada to stop sending arms to Israel.

Dr. Abuelaish said more than 70 of his family members have been killed in the conflict with Israel, and he wonders whether his relatives in northern Gaza will witness Canada's recognition of Palestinian statehood this fall. 

‚ÄúAre they going to be alive in September, to enjoy it, to celebrate it, to give them hope, to inspire them to keep moving forward?‚Äù Dr. Abuelaish said.

‚ÄúIt's an urgent situation. This war crime of starving the people, depriving them from the essential needs, needs to stop.‚Äù

Montreal resident Stuart Lubarsky lost five family members when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7.

‚ÄúWe've been wanting a two-state solution since the existence of Israel, so I have no problem with the recognition of Palestine as an independent state,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt's just this is not the right time, in my opinion ‚Äì not under these circumstances.‚Äù

Mr. Lubarsky said he wouldn't agree with Canada's position until the hostages that were taken by Hamas are returned. 

Ben Losman, a core organizer with Toronto Jewish Families, a group dedicated to ending both anti-Palestinian racism and antisemitism in the Toronto District School Board, said the recognition is an overdue and necessary step. 

‚ÄúGrowing up in a Jewish community, the idea that we would prevent genocide from ever taking place ever again was something that was very much a part of my Jewish education, Jewish identity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLike so many people, I've been horrified to find that the perpetrators of genocide are the Israeli government.‚Äù

Mr. Losman said Canada's recognition ‚Äúmust be paired with an immediate comprehensive, two-way arms embargo and efforts to establish the free flow of aid immediately throughout Gaza.‚Äù

Karen Golden, a Toronto-based lawyer and Israeli citizen who worked for years in Jerusalem, met Bashar Alshawwa at an environmental conference last year, shortly after the Gaza native arrived in Canada from Ramallah. The pair soon became friends, sharing many family dinners with their partners and children.

As their connection grew deeper, they often found themselves asking why such partnerships between Jewish and Palestinian communities remain so rare. They believe Canada's announcement is a step toward peaceful co-existence. 

‚ÄúI'm hopeful and optimistic that it reduces the polarization and divisions we've been seeing in Canada,‚Äù Mr. Alshawwa said Thursday. ‚ÄúThis recognition is a reflection of this country's commitment for justice as part of its core identity. It's stating that Canada won't keep allowing for such atrocities happening around the clock in Palestine.‚Äù

Ms. Golden and Mr. Alshawwa have been advocating in Canada as part of Standing Together, an anti-war organization in Israel that has called for a ceasefire and protested human-rights abuses in the troubled region. 

Ms. Golden said she is disappointed by the swift condemnation from major Jewish groups of Canada's decision this week. 

‚ÄúBy conflating anti-war sentiments with antisemitism, they're denying ‚Äì without any empathy ‚Äì that Palestinians are equal humans deserving of equal rights as Jewish people,‚Äù she said.

            President Donald Trump just set new tariffs for every country around the world, solidifying his extreme break with America's long-standing trade policy.
    


Tariffs on the vast majority of goods America imports are set to rise ‚Äì even from the handful of countries that negotiated individual trade deals. The higher tariffs continue Trump's reversal of the decades of globalization that made America's massive services economy the envy of the world ‚Äì but contributed to its long decline in manufacturing.
    


            With just a few hours to go before its self-imposed August 1 trade deadline, the White House provided key details about its new trade policy late Thursday ‚Äì and, along with it, its new tariff plan.
    


            Here's what to know about the latest set of tariffs:
    


            The White House announced Thursday that the ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù tariff for goods coming into the United States will remain at 10%, the same level that was implemented on April 2.
    


            But that 10% rate will apply only to countries with which the US has a trade surplus ‚Äì countries to which the United States exports more than it imports. That applies to most countries, a senior administration official said.
    


            A 15% rate will serve as the new tariff floor for countries with which the United States has a trade deficit. About 40 countries will pay that new 15% tariff. That tariff will be lower for many of those nations than the April 2 ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs, but it will be higher for a handful.
    


            And more than a dozen countries have tariff rates that are higher than 15%, either because they agreed to a trade framework with the United States or because Trump sent their leaders a letter dictating a higher tariff. The senior administration official said those countries have among the highest trade deficits with the United States.
    


            The White House identified 26 countries whose goods will be subjected to US tariffs greater than 15%. A senior administration official claimed these countries have excessive trade deficits with the United States.
    


            In addition, Mexico and Canada will continue to face higher tariffs for goods that are not exempt under the US-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement. Mexico on Thursday agreed to a 90-day continuation of the current 25% tariff rate the US currently places on those items. Non-exempt Canadian goods imported to the United States will face a 35% as of Friday at 12:01 am ET ‚Äì up from a 25% tariff previously.
    


            The new tariff regime will not go into effect Friday, as had been expected.
    


            Instead, the tariffs will be implemented on August 7 to give Customs and Border Protection sufficient time to make the necessary changes to collect the new duties.
    


Canada's tariffs are an exception ‚Äì those will go into effect Friday.
    


            The only major trading partners that didn't see tariff rates change on Friday were the United Kingdom, China and Mexico. Trump signed a trade framework with the UK and China. However, the deal signed with China expires in less than two weeks, which means those tariffs could soon increase.
    


            With Mexico, Trump had threatened to raise tariffs to 30% at 12:01 am. But after a conversation with Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, on Thursday, he extended Mexico's previous tariff rate for another 90 days.
    


            Over the past month, Trump announced a handful of other trade agreements. It's unclear whether they'll be finalized, but it appears those countries might have avoided rates above what's in their deals.
    


            For instance, goods from the European Union were set to face 30% tariffs. The agreement reached over the weekend, however, calls for 15% tariffs for most goods. That's the same rate goods from South Korea and Japan will be taxed at.
    


            That's still higher than the 10% rate goods have been tariffed at since April, though.
    


            That's a question actively being debated. Trump has cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose country-specific tariffs.
    


            In May, the Court of International Trade found Trump overreached his legal authority doing so. Oral arguments for the administration's appeal kicked off Thursday, and a panel of judges appeared skeptical that Trump had the power to levy tariffs using those emergency powers.
    


            Of particular issue was the unprecedented use of the IEEPA to levy tariffs, especially because the law makes no mention of tariffs to begin with.
    


            Several judges also questioned Trump's rationale behind declaring an economic emergency. The president has previously stated that US trade deficits with other countries, that is, when the US imports more than it exports, merit a national economic emergency requiring tariffs to correct.
    


            Judge Raymond Chen, however, questioned: ‚ÄúCan the trade deficit be a extraordinary and unusual threat when we had trade deficits for decades?‚Äù
    


            It may take weeks, or even months, before the appeals court reaches a verdict. After that, it could still be challenged before the Supreme Court. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, Trump has plenty of levers to pull to roll out new tariffs and keep many in place.
    


            Technically, he did. New tariff rates were set to go into effect Friday ‚Äì and they will now mostly go into effect August 7.
    


            The president has given no indication he'll pause these tariffs any further, though.
    


            However, he's said that about past tariff deadlines only to extend them later on. In short, everything, including the tariff rates that just went in place, is subject to change at the publishing of a Truth Social post.
    


            The tariff changes evoke Trump's ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù in April, when he similarly hiked import taxes across the board. The move threw financial markets into chaos and stoked fears of a global recession.
    


            Trump ultimately delayed the ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù April tariffs hours after they took effect, later setting August 1 as the new deadline for trade agreements on pain of higher tariff rates. The president told some countries what rates they would face on that day absent new agreements but appeared to leave other nations in the dark.
    


            Inflation has stayed relatively tame through Trump's earlier tariff rounds, but that could change as higher rates kick in.  Already, companies including Procter and Gamble and Walmart have said tariff-related price increases are underway.

LONDON, August 1. /TASS/. Rock legend Ozzy Osbourne was laid to rest on the grounds of his mansion in Buckinghamshire, southeast England, in accordance with his last will, The Daily Mirror reported.

The private ceremony was held on July 31, and was attended by a narrow circle of family and close friends.

According to the report, the funeral was attended by Ozzy's Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi, Bill Ward and Geezer Butler, as well as James Hetfield from Metallica and Elton John.

Fans were leaving toys and flowers outside the mansion, which the rock star bought in 1993.

The newspaper reported that although Osbourne spend most of his time in Los Angeles, California, he returned to his home country shortly before the farewell concert in Birmingham. The musician gave his last show 17 days before death.

Osbourne died on July 22 at the age of 76.

WASHINGTON, August 1. /TASS/. The US administration is set to impose anti-Russian sanctions when the 10-day period expires, even though they may have no serious effect on the situation around Ukraine, US President Donald Trump told reporters.

"We're going to put sanctions. I don't know that sanctions bother him [Russian President Vladimir Putin]. You know, they know about sanctions. I know better than anybody about sanctions, and tariffs, and everything else. I don't know if that has any effect but we're going to do it," he said.

"But this is a war that should have never happened. This is a war that wouldn't have happened if I were president, and this is [former US President Joe] Biden's war. This was a stupid war <‚Ä¶>, should have never gotten into this war," he added.

The American leader previously set a 50-day deadline for reaching agreements between Russia and Ukraine, after which he promised to impose 100% trade duties against Moscow and its trading partners. On Monday, Trump said he was disappointed with Russia and the progress of the settlement, and reduced the deadline to 10-12 days. Trump believes that Russia and Ukraine should reach a peaceful settlement agreement by August 8, said John Kelley, Acting US Representative at the United Nations.

Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the Kremlin had had taken note of Trump's statement.

Constitutional Accountability Center President Elizabeth Wydra and constitutional attorney Mark Smith weigh in on how the Supreme Court limiting nationwide injunctions on federal judges will impact the birthright citizenship ruling.

A federal appeals court will hear oral arguments Friday afternoon in a challenge to President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship in the U.S., one of several lower court cases that took shape after the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in June. 

The three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit agreed this summer to hear arguments in two consolidated cases centered on the matter, O. Doe. v. Trump, and the State of New Jersey v. Trump, joining several other appeals courts in reviewing the legality of Trump's executive order.

The hearing comes roughly five weeks after the Supreme Court partially sided with the Trump administration in a case centered on the birthright citizenship order. Justices narrowed when lower courts can issue so-called "universal injunctions" blocking the president's orders from taking effect nationwide. 

Trump signed his birthright citizenship executive order on his first day in office. It seeks to clarify the 14th Amendment, which states, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."

NINTH CIRCUIT REJECTS TRUMP'S BID TO REINSTATE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP ORDER

Instead, the language put forth by the Trump administration, and subsequently blocked, would have clarified that individuals born to illegal immigrant parents, or those who were here legally but on temporary non-immigrant visas, are not citizens by birthright.

The Supreme Court declined to rule on the merits, instead giving the Trump administration 30 days to outline how it would enforce the order ‚Äî effectively punting the issue back to the lower courts. So far, the administration hasn't found much success there.

A federal judge in New Hampshire issued a nationwide injunction last month blocking Trump's order from taking force, and certified as a class all infants born in the U.S. who would be denied citizenship under the order. 

Arguments before the First Circuit come just one week after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals also blocked Trump's birthright citizenship order from taking force nationwide. 

Judges on the Ninth Circuit voted 2-1 to block the order, siding with the Democratic-led states in ruling it unconstitutional.

They also ruled it "is impossible to avoid this harm" caused by the order "absent a uniform application of the citizenship clause throughout the United States," prompting them to issue the nationwide injunction. 

"The district court below concluded that a universal preliminary injunction is necessary to provide the states with complete relief," U.S. Circuit Judge Ronald Gould, writing for the Ninth Circuit majority, said in the ruling.

"We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a universal injunction in order to give the states complete relief."

It's unclear how judges on the First Circuit will rule. But their oral arguments come days after the Trump administration detailed new specifics on how it plans to enforce its order in question. 

Guidance from roughly half a dozen U.S. agencies outlines these new requirements for parents. One document published by the Social Security Administration outlines new requirements parents will need to meet to prove their child is a U.S. citizen at birth.  

"With respect to citizenship, an SSN applicant may currently demonstrate U.S. citizenship by providing a birth certificate showing a U.S. place of birth," a document from SSA said. 

"Once the EO takes effect, a birth certificate showing a U.S. place of birth will not be sufficient documentary evidence of U.S. citizenship for persons born after the EO takes effect."

The policy, which remains halted by the lower courts, is widely unpopular. 

More than 22 U.S. states and immigrants' rights groups have sued the Trump administration to block the change to birthright citizenship, arguing in court filings that the executive order is both unconstitutional and "unprecedented."

And to date, no court has sided with the Trump administration's executive order seeking to ban birthright citizenship, though multiple district courts have blocked it, including in wake of the Supreme Court ruling, from taking effect.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) ‚Äî A Milwaukee man who killed a 19-year-old college student on their first date and spread her body parts around the area was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

A jury convicted Maxwell Anderson in June of first-degree intentional homicide, mutilating a corpse, arson and hiding a corpse in connection with Sade Robinson's death last year. He maintained his innocence throughout the trial.

During a sentencing hearing that was by turns somber, emotional and horrifying, Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Laura Crivello repeatedly questioned how Anderson could commit such a heinous crime. Prosecutors related details of how Anderson cut up Robinson's body and dumped one of her legs near a playground.

Robinson's mother, Sheena Scarbrough, said Anderson ‚Äúmessed the entire community up‚Äù and deserves no protection in prison. 

‚ÄúJudge, I'm asking this demon be respectfully returned back to hell as soon as possible,‚Äù Scarbrough said. 

Robinson's father, Carlos Robinson, suggested to the judge that someone dismember Anderson.

‚ÄúEverything that he did should be done to him,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo man should be able to live after what he did. That's just how I feel. I can't get past this. I can't.‚Äù




First-degree intentional homicide in Wisconsin carries a mandatory life sentence. The only question for Anderson was whether the judge would allow him to seek parole.

Anderson's attorney, Tony Cotton, asked the judge to make Anderson eligible for parole after 25 years. He argued that Anderson served in the U.S. Navy and suffers from obvious mental health issues. 

Cotton acknowledged that Anderson has been convicted of multiple misdemeanor disorderly conduct counts in connection with domestic violence but they're not significant offenses compared to most homicide defendants. He added that he has concerns about Anderson's safety in prison.

‚ÄúThat is a real consideration,‚Äù Cotton said. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, there is not mob justice in this country.‚Äù

Anderson told the judge that he's innocent and plans to appeal his convictions. He didn't elaborate, although Crivello later noted that Anderson had told an investigator that some stranger must have kidnapped Robinson after she left his apartment following their date.

‚ÄúI hope true justice will be delivered,‚Äù Anderson said Friday.

Crivello refused to offer Anderson a chance at parole. She dismissed Anderson's claims of innocence, saying his view of reality ‚Äúdiffers from the rest of the world.‚Äù Trailing off at times and shaking her head, she said he's irredeemable, called his crimes ‚Äúunconscionable‚Äù and likened the case to something out of a horror novel.

‚ÄúIt's beyond imaginable to not know whether your child is dead or alive, and then learn they're dismembered and disgraced, is beyond understanding,‚Äù she said. 

She also sentenced Anderson to 7 1/2 years on the dismemberment count and a year and a half on the arson charge. Online court records indicate she dismissed the fourth count of hiding a corpse on Friday after Cotton argued Anderson can't be convicted of both mutilating and hiding a corpse.

Anderson and Robinson, a student at Milwaukee Area Technical College, met at a bar in March 2024 a week before her death. Surveillance video and cellphone text and tracking records show they spent the late afternoon and early evening of April 1 drinking at two bars before heading back to Anderson's apartment.

Photos on Anderson's phone show Anderson groping Robinson as she lay face down on his couch. Prosecutors have argued she was incapacitated and couldn't resist.

Surveillance video shows her car leaving his apartment early on the morning of April 2 and arriving at a park along the Lake Michigan shoreline. Prosecutors maintain that's where he cut her body into pieces. He later burned her car behind an abandoned building and took a bus home.

Searchers discovered one of Robinson's legs in the park and her other leg and a foot near a playground close to where he burned the car. A human torso and an arm believed to be Robinson's remains washed up on a beach in suburban South Milwaukee. 

Her head is still missing.

Former President Joe Biden appeared to slur and stumble through multiple parts of his speech July 31, 2025, in Chicago.

Former President Joe Biden touted appointing Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court, during a slur-filled speech at the National Bar Association's 100th annual gala at the Hyatt in Chicago Thursday evening ‚Äî just hours after one of his top aides testified before the Republican House Oversight Committee for their investigation into the former president's fitness for office. 

Biden slurred on multiple occasions during the night, including while discussing serving as the vice president to the first Black president, former President Barack Obama, and selecting Kamala Harris as his vice president. Harris was the first woman of Black and South Asian heritage to serve in the role. 

Likewise, Biden said he also selected demographically diverse judges during his administration.

Former President Joe Biden said he also selected demographically diverse judges during his administration. 

"I promised to have an administration that looked like America and appoint a bench that looked like America," Biden said. "And I kept my promise. I appointed the most demographically diverse ‚Ä¶ slate of judges ever in the history of the United States of America. The top of that list, one of the greatest lawyers I've ever met, Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman on the United States Supreme Court."

"Justice Jackson, as you witnessed earlier this week, has proven herself to have the wisdom and the character that I saw in her when I nominated her. Appointed 13 Black women to the Courts of Appeals of the United States Federal Court, more than every other president in American history combined," he said. "For other historic firsts as well, for historic, for Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, Muslim Americans, by the way, I didn't just appoint Ivy League judges."

The National Bar Association originally formed in Iowa before Black attorneys were permitted to join the American Bar Association, and is now made up of 66,000 members working in law who advocate for civil rights and diversity. 

Those who attended the event included Jackson, as well as Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, MSNBC pundit Joy-Ann Reid and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

Biden and his allies have faced allegations of concealing the truth about Biden's mental fitness while in office, following his debate performance against President Donald Trump on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, where Biden struggled to answer seemingly basic questions.

Multiple books have been written in 2025 detailing Biden's final days in office, his deteriorating mental faculties and challenges within the Democratic Party as a result of his decision to withdraw from the election. 

Additionally, several investigations are ongoing on Capitol Hill concerning Biden's mental decline. For example, the House Oversight Committee is examining the cover-up of Biden's cognitive decline and potentially unauthorized executive actions taken during his presidency.

Earlier Thursday, longtime Biden aide Michael Donilon appeared before the House Oversight Committee and told lawmakers that he could have raked in a total of $8 million if Biden had won re-election in 2024, Axios first reported. 

Fox News Digital reached out to Biden's spokesperson for comment and has not yet received a reply.

Seventeen Democratic officials accused President Donald Trump's administration of unlawfully intimidating health care providers into stopping gender-affirming care for transgender youth in a lawsuit filed Friday.

The complaint comes after a month in which at least eight major hospitals and hospital systems ‚Äî all in states where the care is allowed under state law ‚Äî announced they were stopping or restricting the care. The latest announcement came Thursday from UI Health in Chicago.

Trump's administration announced in July that it was sending subpoenas to providers and focusing on investigating them for fraud. It later boasted in a news release that hospitals are halting treatments.

The Democratic officials say Trump's policies are an attempt to impose a nationwide ban on the treatment for people under 19 ‚Äî and that's unlawful because there's no federal statute that bans providing the care to minors. The suit was filed by attorneys general from 15 states and the District of Columbia, plus the governor of Pennsylvania, in U.S. District Court in Boston.

‚ÄúThe federal government is running a cruel and targeted harassment campaign against providers who offer lawful, lifesaving care to children,‚Äù New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.

Trump and others who oppose the care say that it makes permanent changes that people who receive it could come to regret ‚Äî and maintain that it's being driven by questionable science.




Since 2021, 28 states with Republican-controlled legislatures have adopted policies to ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have a right to enforce those laws.

For families with transgender children, the state laws and medical center policy changes have sparked urgent scrambles for treatment.

The Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, the biggest public provider of gender-affirming care for children in teens in the U.S., closed in July.

At least seven other major hospitals and health systems have made similar announcements, including Children's National in Washington D.C., UChicago Medicine and Yale New Haven Health. 

Kaiser Permanente, which operates in California and several other states, said it would pause gender-affirming surgeries for those under 19 as of the end of August, but would continue hormone therapy.

Connecticut Children's Medical Center cited ‚Äúan increasingly complex and evolving landscape‚Äù for winding down care.

Other hospitals, including Penn State, had already made similar decisions since Trump returned to office in January.

Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA, an organization that advocates for health care equity for LGBTQ+ people, said the health systems have pulled back the services for legal reasons, not medical ones.

‚ÄúNot once has a hospital said they are ending care because it is not medically sound,‚Äù Sheldon said.

Trump devoted a lot of attention to transgender people in his campaign last year as part of a growing pushback from conservatives as transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance on some fronts. Trump criticized gender-affirming care, transgender women in women's sports, and transgender women's use of women's facilities such as restrooms.

On his inauguration day in January, Trump signed an executive order defining the sexes as only male and female for government purposes, setting the tone for a cascade of actions that affect transgender people. About a week later, Trump called to stop using federal money, including from Medicaid, for gender-affirming care for those under 19.

About half of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of transgender issues, an AP-NORC poll found. But the American Medical Association says that gender is on a spectrum, and the group opposes policies that restrict access to gender-affirming health care.

Gender-affirming care includes a range of medical and mental health services to support a person's gender identity, including when it's different from the sex they were assigned at birth. It includes counseling and treatment with medications that block puberty, and hormone therapy to produce physical changes, as well as surgery, which is rare for minors.

In March, a judge paused enforcement of the ban on government spending for care.

In April, Attorney General Pam Bondi directed government investigators to focus on providers who continue to offer gender-affirming care for transgender youth. ‚ÄúUnder my leadership, the Department of Justice will bring these practices to an end,‚Äù she wrote.

In May, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a report discouraging medical interventions for transgender youth and instead focusing solely on talk therapy. The report questions adolescents' capacity to consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility. The administration has not said who wrote the report, which has been deeply criticized by LGBTQ+ advocates.

In June, a Justice Department memo called for prioritizing civil investigations of those who provide the treatment.

In July, Justice Department announced it had sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics involved in gender-affirming care for youth, saying they were part of investigations of health care fraud, false statements and other possible wrongdoing.

And in a statement last week, the White House celebrated decisions to end gender-affirming care, which it called a ‚Äúbarbaric, pseudoscientific practice‚Äù

Kristen Salvatore's 15-year-old child started hormone therapy late last year at Penn State Health. Salvatore said in an interview with The Associated Press before the lawsuit was announced that it was a major factor in reduced signs of anxiety and depression. Last month, the family received official notice from the health system that it would no longer offer the hormones for patients under 19 after July 31, though talk therapy can continue.

Salvatore has been struggling to find a place that's not hours away from their Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, home that would provide the hormones and accept Medicaid coverage.

‚ÄúI'm walking around blind with no guidance, and whatever breadcrumbs I was given are to a dead-end alleyway,‚Äù she said.

The family has enough testosterone stockpiled to last until January. But if they can't find a new provider by then, Salvatore's child could risk detransitioning, she said.

The Israeli Defense Force released video on Tuesday they claim shows Hamas terrorists operating inside a UNRWA base near Rafah.

The U.S. State Department issued a devastating report to Congress on the terrorism-plagued U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) that provides aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, determining that the agency needs to be abolished and is beyond reform.

According to a U.S. State Department public assessment to Congress that was independently obtained by Fox News Digital, "The Administration has determined UNRWA is irredeemably compromised and now seeks its full dismantlement."

According to the State Department document, the Trump administration demanded in March 2025 that UNRWA "return all remaining unspent balances of U.S. funding in its accounts." The UNRWA Washington office said it would do so, "but has not yet completed the action." In May, the State Department said it is working "to cease U.S. participation in all working-level UNRWA bodies" at the United Nations. 

The Washington Free Beacon first reported news of the State Department report.

The U.S. government pulled the plug on UNRWA funding in January 2024 and has not resumed aid to the corruption-scarred agency. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's move calling for the wholesale dissolution of UNRWA adds a new layer of pressure on the U.N. and key donor nations to UNRWA (Japan and Germany) to reassess the viability of UNRWA.

The Biden administration had given UNRWA $1 billion in U.S. taxpayer funding since 2021 before the freeze in 2024 went into effect.

Former Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said in February 2024 that dozens of individuals employed by UNRWA were directly involved in the atrocities carried out against Israeli civilians on Oct. 7.

Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon told the U.N. in January that UNRWA must close its operations in Jerusalem.

In August 2024, Fox News Digital reported the U.N. fired nine employees from UNRWA who likely participated in the Hamas slaughter of 1,200 people, including more than 30 Americans, on Oct. 7 in southern Israel.

Israel's Knesset (Parliament) overwhelmingly banned UNRWA because of its reported support for Hamas terrorism. The U.S. has classified Hamas as a foreign terrorist organization. Israel, U.S. lawmakers, and watchdog organizations have also provided evidence to the U.N. over the years that UNRWA glorifies Palestinian terrorism and antisemitism. 

Fox News Digital sent press queries to the State Department and UNRWA.

LONDON (AP) ‚Äî On a charming cobblestone street tucked away in London's East End, a pub proudly hangs out a sign that reads ‚ÄúOldest riverside pub in London.‚Äù Across the Thames River, a pub with a different name makes the same bold claim.

The unofficial title of the oldest riverside pub in the city has long been disputed, with both the Mayflower and the Prospect of Whitby laying claim to the title.

The two contenders can be found along a quiet stretch of the Thames, far from the city's crowded souvenir shops and tourist sites, serving up traditional British dishes ‚Äî from steak and ale pie to sticky toffee pudding ‚Äî with a side of history.

The Mayflower is named after the Pilgrim Mayflower ship, which set sail from the site in 1620 to begin its journey to America. Though it only got its name in 1957, it is said to have some of the ship's original timbers incorporated into its structure.

Today, pubgoers who can prove direct descent from one of the Mayflower passengers can sign its ‚ÄúDescendants Book.‚Äù

Every night, tourists step out of black cabs at the doors of the two pubs, trading the capital's modern skyscrapers for the storied streets of London's East End, lined with quaint terraced houses and red brick warehouses.

In both pubs they enter spaces where old paintings hanging on dark paneled walls and other mementos of their histories seem to leave the contemporary world behind. 

‚ÄúThere really is a feeling that you might have stepped back in time and could be drinking beer with sailors or pirates or anybody from any Dickens novels really,‚Äù said Emily Godwin, a Londoner who has been to both. She spoke while sipping a pint of lager with friends at the Prospect on a recent summer evening.

The Prospect boasts a pewter bar ‚Äì the longest of its kind in Britain ‚Äî where the infamous ‚ÄúHanging Judge Jeffreys‚Äù is said to have watched the many hangings that took place at the nearby ‚ÄúExecution Dock.‚Äù Early on, the pub was known as the Devil's Tavern due to its association with thieves and smugglers. A hanging noose outside serves as a reminder of the pub's grisly history.

It ‚Äúfeels like such a pocket of history in London,‚Äù Godwin said. ‚ÄúSo much of London's East End feels very new and trendy, and the Prospect feels like it's barely changed.‚Äù

British pubs have always been at the center of social life, with locals coming together over a pint, even in times of war and economic hardship. But the last five years have been challenging for the industry as pubs contended with the COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs.

This year an estimated 378 venues are set to shutter across England, Wales, and Scotland, according to the British Beer and Pub Association.

‚ÄúWhen a pub closes, it puts people out of a job, deprives communities of their heart and soul and hurts the local economy,‚Äù said Emma McClarkin, head of the BBPA.

Pubs across the country have been forced to find new ways to attract customers.

History is a big draw for pubgoers, with a trip to a traditional British pub coming in high on tourists' London bucket lists, raising the stakes of the Prospect and the Mayflower's competition.

The Prospect claims it was established in 1520, with its original flagstone surviving an arson attack in 1666 ‚Äî the same year as the Great Fire of London. The pub was outside of the city limits at that time and was not affected by the conflagration that gutted the medieval city.

Justin Billington, assistant manager at the Prospect, said some people date the pub to its full reconstruction in 1774 after the 1666 fire. But he doesn't see it that way, noting that it operated continuously. The day after the fire, the workers rolled out a barrel of beer that had survived the flames and locals showed up with their tankards, drinking vessels, and enjoyed a drink on the spot.

There were several reconstructions in the pub's subsequent history, but none withstood the salt water and shifting foundations of the Thames, Billington explained. Not, that is, until 1774 when the retired captain of a merchant ship called ‚ÄúThe Prospect‚Äù rebuilt it using the ship.

‚ÄúThis rebuild held and continues to hold on for dear life,‚Äù he said.

If the pub was actually established in 1774, that would make the Mayflower ‚Äî established in the 16th century ‚Äî older.

But there are no hard feelings between the pubs as Billington described their competition as a ‚Äúloving rivalry.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe compete against each other to be the oldest, and to serve the best food and drink,‚Äù he said.

But the question remains: How can either pub definitively claim the title?

Unlike the title of the ‚ÄúOldest pub in England,‚Äù held by the Porch House in southern England, which is said to date to the 10th century, there is no official certification for the oldest pub in London.

Guinness World Records said it has not formally awarded the title because of the complexities created by numerous name changes, relocations and reconstructions.

‚ÄúThere are lots of very old pubs that might make a claim to being oldest, but it could be contested because it could be argued they weren't always in ‚ÄòLondon,'‚Äù English historian and author Jacob Field said. ‚ÄúMany pubs have changed name over time, making it hard to claim they are the oldest.‚Äù

The communities of sea creatures push the boundaries of what we know about life.

The Titanic lies about 12,500 feet under the ocean. The pressure down there is so immense that even submersibles supposedly built for those conditions can, as we know, tragically fail.

Now imagine taking a sub nearly three times deeper.

That's what an international team of scientists did last summer. Led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the researchers took a manned submersible to the bottom of deep-sea trenches in an area in the northwest Pacific Ocean, roughly between Japan and Alaska. They reached a depth of more than 31,000 feet.

The researchers weren't looking for a shipwreck. They were interested in what else might be lurking on the seafloor in trenches so deep that no light can reach them.

It was there that they found something remarkable: an entire ecosystem of animals, living in the darkness. Even more incredibly, those animals ‚Äî and the animals they eat ‚Äî derive energy not from sunlight but from chemical reactions. Through a process called chemosynthesis, deep-sea microbes turn chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide into organic compounds, including sugars, forming the base of the food chain. The discovery was published in the journal Nature.

Aboard a deep-sea vessel called Fendouzhe, which was equipped with cameras and lights, the researchers encountered abundant wildlife communities, including fields of marine tube worms peppered with white marine snails. The worms have a symbiotic relationship with chemosynthetic bacteria that live in their bodies. Those bacteria provide them with a source of nutrients in exchange for, among other things, a stable place to live.

Among the tube worms the scientists encountered white, centipede-like critters ‚Äî they're also a kind of worm, in the genus macellicephaloides ‚Äî as well as sea cucumbers.

The researchers also found a variety of different clams on the seafloor, often alongside anemones. Similar to the tube worms, the clams depend on bacteria within their shells to turn chemical compounds like methane and hydrogen sulfide that are present in the deep sea into food.

This was the deepest community of chemosynthetic life ever discovered, according to Mengran Du, a study author and researcher at the Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who was on the submersible. Du declined to comment on whether the expedition had anything to do with the potential for deep-sea mining in this region.

‚ÄúDiving in the submersible was an extraordinary experience ‚Äî like traveling through time,‚Äù Du told Vox by email. ‚ÄúEach descent transported me to a new deep-sea realm. As a diving scientist, nothing compares to the thrill of gazing through the observation window with my own eyes.‚Äù

Unlike other deep-sea ecosystems ‚Äî which feed on dead animals and other organic bits that fall from shallower waters ‚Äî these trench communities are likely sustained in part by methane produced by microbes buried under the seafloor, the authors said. That suggests that wildlife communities may be more common in these extremely deep trenches than scientists once thought.

‚ÄúThe presence of these chemosynthetic ecosystems challenge long-standing assumptions about life's potential at extreme depths,‚Äù Du said.

Update, August 1, 10 am ET: This story was originally published on July 30 and has been updated to include more details shared by a researcher involved in the expedition.

            The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History last month removed a board that referenced President Donald Trump's two impeachments from an exhibit on the American presidency.
    


            In a statement to CNN on Thursday, The Smithsonian Institution said the decision, which was first reported by The Washington Post, was made after a review of the museum's ‚Äúlegacy content‚Äù this year.
    


            Unmentioned in the statement was Trump's executive order earlier this year that appeared crafted to direct the Smithsonian to soften or distort forthright discussions about certain aspects of American history, which could include the legacy of racism in the United States and parts of Trump's own history-making but controversial first term.
    


            The exhibit had last been updated in 2008 and included information about the impeachments of Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, and the impeachment process against President Richard Nixon, who resigned over the Watergate scandal before he could be formally impeached.
    


            Trump is the only president in American history to be impeached twice; in 2019 on charges alleging he unlawfully solicited Ukraine to influence the 2020 presidential election, and in 2021 for his actions related to the insurrection at the US Capitol that year. He was acquitted both times by the Senate.
    


            In September 2021, the Smithsonian placed a board over the exhibit which read: ‚ÄúCase under redesign (history happens*)‚Äù and referenced Trump's two impeachments.
    


            ‚ÄúOn December 18, 2019, the House impeached Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,‚Äù the reference to Trump's first impeachment read. ‚ÄúThe charges focused on the president's solicitation of foreign influence in the 2020 presidential election and his defiance of Congressional subpoenas. President Trump was acquitted in January 2020.‚Äù
    


            ‚ÄúOn January 13, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached twice,‚Äù the reference to his second impeachment read. ‚ÄúThe charge was incitement of insurrection, based on repeated ‚Äòfalse statements' challenging the 2020 election results and his January 6 speech that ‚Äòencouraged ‚Äî and foreseeably resulted in ‚Äî lawless action at the Capitol. Because Trump's term ended on January 20, his acquittal on February 13 made him the first former president tried by the Senate.‚Äù
    


            The Smithsonian said in a statement that the board ‚Äúwas intended to be a short-term measure to address current events at the time, however, the label remained in place until July 2025.‚Äù
    


            The statement added: ‚ÄúA large permanent gallery like The American Presidency that opened in 2000, requires significant amount of time and funding to update and renew. A future and updated exhibit will include all impeachments.‚Äù
    


            The statement did not say when the exhibit would be updated.
    


            Asked about the removal of references to Trump's impeachment, a White House spokesperson said in a statement, ‚ÄúUnfortunately for far too long the Smithsonian museums have highlighted divisive, DEI exhibits which are out of touch with mainstream America.‚Äù
    


            ‚ÄúWe are fully supportive of updating displays to highlight American greatness,‚Äù spokesperson Davis Ingle said. ‚ÄúThe Trump administration will continue working to ensure that the Smithsonian removes all improper ideology and once again unites and instills pride in all Americans regarding our great history.‚Äù
    


            Trump's order aimed at the Smithsonian is just one example of his efforts to exert his influence on American cultural, athletic and artistic institutions and browbeat them into eliminating aspects of their work.
    


            They include his efforts to take over the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, to have the Washington Commanders football team to revert back to their old name and to stop the participation of transgender people in women's sports.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) ‚Äî An appeals court in Bosnia-Herzegovina confirmed Friday an earlier court ruling that sentenced the pro-Russia Bosnian Serb president, Milorad Dodik, to one year in prison and banned him from politics for six years over his separatist actions as tensions mount in the fragile Balkan state.

 Dodik rejected the court ruling and added that he will continue to act as the Bosnian Serb president as long as he has the support of the Bosnian Serb parliament.

He said he is not surprised by the verdict, which he called ‚Äúa clear political decision‚Äù orchestrated by Bosnian Muslims in collaboration with the European Union.

‚ÄúI expect complete support from Serbia, we will turn to Russia for support, we will write a letter to the new U.S. administration,‚Äù Dodik said.

The EU said in a brief statement that the ‚Äúverdict is binding and must be respected.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe EU calls on all parties to acknowledge the independence and impartiality of the court, and to respect and uphold its verdict,‚Äù the statement said.

Dodik's lawyers said they will appeal the court ruling to Bosnia's highest court.

Dodik has repeatedly called for the separation of the Serb-run half of Bosnia to join Serbia, which prompted the former U.S. administration to impose sanctions against him and his allies. Dodik was also accused of corruption and pro-Russia policies.

Dodik's separatist threats have stoked fears in Bosnia, where a 1992-95 war erupted when the country's Serbs rebelled against independence from the former Yugoslavia and moved to form a ministate with the aim of uniting it with Serbia. About 100,000 people were killed and millions were displaced.




The U.S.-sponsored Dayton Accords ended the war and created two regions in Bosnia, Republika Srpska and the Bosniak-Croat Federation, which were given wide autonomy but kept some joint institutions, including the army, top judiciary and tax administration. Bosnia also has a rotating three-member presidency made up of Bosniak, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats.

Dodik has repeatedly clashed with the top international envoy overseeing the peace, Christian Schmidt, and declared his decisions illegal in Republika Srpska. The Dayton peace agreement envisages that the high representative can impose decisions and change laws in the country.

Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) led Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley by 6 percentage points in the first major poll of the 2026 North Carolina Senate race.

The Emerson College poll, obtained by Politico, showed Cooper with 47% compared to Whatley's 41%, with 12% unsure. Cooper has a massive lead among independents, with 47% supporting him and 28% supporting Whatley.

Part of the disconnect is a lack of name recognition for Whatley, a first-time candidate. Nearly two-thirds of voters polled did not know or were unsure of Whatley, compared to just 16% for Cooper. Cooper enjoyed a majority favorability rating, while Whatley enjoyed 17% favorability and a 16% unfavorability rating.

‚ÄúWith over a year to go until the North Carolina U.S. Senate race, Whatley's low name recognition presents both a challenge and an opportunity, while only 17% view him favorably, nearly two-thirds of voters either don't know him or are unsure,‚Äù Emerson College Polling executive director Spencer Kimball said in a statement. ‚ÄúThat leaves room for his campaign to define him before his opponent does. In contrast, Cooper enters the race with significantly higher name recognition and a more favorable public image.‚Äù

Polls are likely to get closer as the high-stakes matchup nears ‚Äî 41.5% of voters said they'd support the Democrat in congressional races, and 41.3% said they'd support the Republican candidate. With the North Carolina Senate race set to be one of the most expensive of the 2026 cycle, nearly every voter will likely have an opinion about Whatley one way or another come November of next year.

The two are competing to replace Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who announced he would not run for reelection amid clashes with President Donald Trump. Friday's poll largely vindicated his decision, giving him a paltry 30% approval rating, with 43% of voters viewing him unfavorably.

GOP UNITES BEHIND WHATLEY AHEAD OF HIGH-STAKES SHOWDOWN WITH COOPER IN NORTH CAROLINA

‚ÄúSenator Tillis' retirement aligns with his weak favorability: just 41% of Republican voters view him favorably, while 35% view him unfavorably,‚Äù Kimball said. ‚ÄúHe's also underwater with independents, with 43% unfavorable and only 27% favorable.‚Äù

Democrats view North Carolina as one of their most likely pickups in 2026. They need to flip four seats to obtain control of the Senate.

President Donald Trump's Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke with Fox News Digital at the National Governors Association (NGA) about her collaboration with state governors.

Colorado Springs, Colo. ‚Äì Despite Democrats protesting President Donald Trump's plan to dismantle the Department of Education, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said returning education to the states is a "nonpartisan issue."

"I'm not getting push back, because if it were just Democrat states or Republican states that were doing well or doing poorly, that would be one thing, but it's many of the states on both sides of the aisle. That's why this is really a nonpartisan issue," McMahon explained in an exclusive interview at the National Governors Association (NGA) summer meeting.

The Education Secretary participated in discussions with governors from both parties at the Colorado Springs, Colo., meeting, and her department announced the release of roughly $6.8 billion in previously frozen federal funds for K-12 programs ahead of her panel discussion with the outgoing NGA chair, Gov. Jared Polis, D-Colo.

"It's just incredibly important that if we are going to return education to the states, we have to talk to the governors," McMahon emphasized. "What's meaningful to them? How can we work together? This is both sides of the aisle because, clearly, education is a nonpartisan issue."

Trump signed an executive order earlier this year to dismantle the Department of Education, fulfilling one of his key campaign promises during the 2024 presidential election. 

McMahon explained that returning education to the states "just means giving them back the part that is now provided by the federal government, and they're anxious for it."

In a joint statement on behalf of the NGA, Polis and incoming NGA chair Gov. Kevin Stitt, R-Ok., said they were "thankful these bipartisan discussions with Secretary McMahon and other key officials during the NGA Summer Meeting led to the distribution of these education funds," adding that they are "proud our advocacy helped secure this vital support for states and districts."

The Education Secretary, the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), explained to Fox News Digital that participating in events like NGA, having discussions with governors from both parties and visiting as many states as possible is critical to understanding America's diverse educational landscape. 

McMahon said she has already visited different types of schools, from charter schools to public schools, to learn the best practices across the country.

"Every state does have different needs," McMahon said. "There's no one size fits all, but what I hear with every governor and almost every educator coming in, is what we are stressing, which is literacy."

A Department of Education report released earlier this year revealed that American students' reading skills have continued to decline since the COVID-19 pandemic, and their math skills have barely improved. 

Despite the dismal report, McMahon said "the future for education is very bright" because the Trump administration has called attention to the "Nation's Report Card," which reveals "how the United States doesn't compare all that favorably with the rest of the world."

"The president is very keen on making sure that those levels rise, so that the United States takes its rightful place as one of the leaders in education in the world," McMahon explained.

And when asked how the Education Secretary would address teachers who are anxious about the dismantling the Department of Education, McMahon said she is focused on ensuring best practices are carried out nationwide, while empowering states to deliver for teachers' individual needs.

"[Teachers] are working with their school boards, they're working with their principals and superintendents and their governors to have the best policies in their states," McMahon said. "This is a win for teachers because governors are already talking about that teachers should be paid fairly, that they should be allowed to innovate in the classroom, that they shouldn't spend their time doing paperwork and regulatory compliance. They should be able to spend that time with the students."

"Let's let teachers teach. This is all good," McMahon explained.

BRUSSELS (AP) ‚Äî President Donald Trump's administration says it is weighing what to do with family planning supplies stockpiled in Europe that campaigners and two U.S. senators are fighting to save from destruction. 

Concerns that the Trump administration plans to incinerate the stockpile have angered family planning advocates on both sides of the Atlantic. Campaigners say the supplies stored in a U.S.-funded warehouse in Geel, Belgium, include contraceptive pills, contraceptive implants and IUDs that could spare women in war zones and elsewhere the hardship of unwanted pregnancies.

U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Tommy Pigott said Thursday in response to a question about the contraceptives that ‚Äúwe're still in the process here in terms of determining the way forward.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we have an update, we'll provide it,‚Äù he said.

Belgium says it has been talking with U.S. diplomats about trying to spare the supplies from destruction, including possibly moving them out of the warehouse. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Florinda Baleci told The Associated Press that she couldn't comment further ‚Äúto avoid influencing the outcome of the discussions.‚Äù 

The Trump administration's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, which managed foreign aid programs, left the supplies' fate uncertain. 

Pigott didn't detail the types of contraceptives that make up the stockpile. He said some of the supplies, bought by the previous administration, could ‚Äúpotentially be‚Äù drugs designed to induce abortions. Pigott didn't detail how that might impact Trump administration thinking about how to deal with the drugs or the entire stockpile.




Costing more than $9 million and funded by U.S taxpayers, the family planning supplies were intended for women in war zones, refugee camps and elsewhere, according to a bipartisan letter of protest to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio from U.S. senators Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, and Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski.

They said destroying the stockpile ‚Äúwould be a waste of U.S. taxpayer dollars as well as an abdication of U.S. global leadership in preventing unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and maternal deaths ‚Äî key goals of U.S. foreign assistance.‚Äù

They urged Rubio to allow another country or partner to distribute the contraceptives. 

Concerns voiced by European campaigners and lawmakers that the supplies could be transported to France for incineration have led to mounting pressure on government officials to intervene and save them.

The executive branch of the European Union, through spokesman Guillaume Mercier, said Friday that ‚Äúwe continue to monitor the situation closely to explore the most effective solutions.‚Äù 

The U.S. branch of family planning aid group MSI Reproductive Choices said it offered to purchase, repackage and distribute the stock at its own expense but ‚Äúthese efforts were repeatedly rejected.‚Äù The group said the supplies included long-acting IUDs, contraceptive implants and pills, and that they have long shelf-lives, extending as far as 2031.

Aid group Doctors Without Borders said incineration would be ‚Äúan intentionally reckless and harmful act against women and girls everywhere.‚Äù

Charles Dallara, the grandson of a French former lawmaker who was a contraception pioneer in France, urged President Emmanuel Macron to not let France ‚Äúbecome an accomplice to this scandal.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo not allow France to take part in the destruction of essential health tools for millions of women,‚Äù Dallara wrote in an appeal to the French leader. ‚ÄúWe have a moral and historical responsibility.‚Äù

More than 50,000 discrepancies have been discovered in the state of New York's voter registration rolls, including deceased registrants, placeholder or fictitious birthdates, and duplicate entries, according to an election security watchdog's findings shared with the Washington Examiner.

Among the alarming revelations, the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a law firm focused on voting integrity, found 49,933 out-of-state double registrants, who are voters simultaneously registered in New York and at least one other U.S. state.

PILF cross-referenced voting registration files for New York registrants who also appear on other state voter rolls. Based on comparative analysis between voter datasets, the majority of interstate duplicates came from Florida (24,873). Other overlaps were with North Carolina (6,247) and New Jersey (5,724).

PILF additionally detected 2,823 inter-county duplicates inside New York's statewide database, including 1,018 pairs marked as ‚Äúactive‚Äù registrants across multiple counties.

At least 3,845 registrant records in New York were flagged for containing placeholder, potentially fake, or implausible dates of birth, such as ‚Äú1850-01-01,‚Äù despite recent voting activity.

WHAT ARE THOUSANDS OF INELIGIBLE VOTERS DOING ON THE ROLLS?

For example, the registration rolls incorrectly listed a woman's birth year as ‚Äú1901,‚Äù but the Brooklyn voter in question was actually born in 1941.

According to PILF's investigation, six registrants had died as far back as 1998, yet remained actively registered on the rolls, while four registrants could not be matched to any known Social Security number or credit data at those addresses. The only proof of existence was the New York voter roll, per PILF, raising questions about their identities and voting eligibility.

PILF also identified 6,788 instances of duplicated and even triplicated registrants, in which duplications at identical residential addresses were generated.

The PILF research team studied same-address duplicates along common causes of duplication, such as missing Social Security information, typographical errors (e.g., misspelling of names), hyphenated or married-name confusion, and nickname variations. Notably, missing or transposed Social Security numbers can stifle standard de-duplication procedures, PILF says.

PILF flagged the tens of thousands of questionable voter registrations in a memo sent Monday to the New York State Board of Elections.

‚ÄúThese are critical failures that put election security at risk,‚Äù PILF president J. Christian Adams said in a statement. ‚ÄúNew York needs to start addressing these issues now.‚Äù

Accordingly, PILF is requesting a meeting with the state's election board to discuss reforms and the voter registration data.

When the Washington Examiner contacted the New York State Board of Elections for comment, a public information officer confirmed receipt of PILF's letter and said counsel is reviewing it at this time.

PILF previously conducted similar reviews in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maine, as part of nationwide efforts to clean up registration rolls ahead of high-stakes races. The results were similarly egregious, with PILF detecting 18,453 deceased registrants on Maine's voting rolls.

The legal group is calling for greater transparency and collaboration with local election officials to fix these problems before out-of-date or inaccurate data affects future elections.

‚ÄúThis is not just a New York issue,‚Äù PILF research director Logan Churchwell added. ‚ÄúOur work in multiple states proves that voter roll maintenance is falling behind across the country. But New York's numbers are some of the worst we've seen yet.‚Äù

PILF's letter looped in Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, and former PILF litigation counsel Maureen Riordan, now the DOJ's chief voting oversight officer.

At the direction of President Donald Trump via executive order, the DOJ has been contacting a number of states, including election battlegrounds, seeking access to their respective registration rolls. The stated purpose is ensuring state-by-state compliance with federal voting law. Reportedly, all states will eventually be contacted about their adherence to federal election regulations.

To date, the DOJ has contacted election officials in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.

In response to one request, Maine's Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat who infamously tried to boot Trump from the state's 2024 presidential primary ballot, told the DOJ to ‚Äúgo jump in the Gulf of Maine.‚Äù

BATTLEGROUNDS NEVADA AND WISCONSIN AMONG STATES WITH VOTER ROLLS UNDER DOJ SCRUTINY

At a hearing last week on voter roll maintenance standards at the House Administration Committee, which has oversight over federal elections, PILF's president advocated for full disclosure of voting data. ‚ÄúWithout transparency, you can't know what's going on, and that's why it's so important,‚Äù Adams told the congressional committee.

In opening statements, the top Democrat on the panel accused Republicans, who want to limit voting rights to eligible Americans, of engaging in regressive practices that bring the country back 200 years.

‚ÄúFor over 200 years, our republic has marched towards a fuller, freer system of governance, expanding access to the ballot for more and more Americans,‚Äù ranking member Rep. Joe Morelle (D-NY) said. ‚ÄúBut as we've seen time and time again in the topic of today's hearing, clearly indicates House Republicans seem to want to retreat from that important promise.‚Äù

Morelle claimed that ‚Äúillegal‚Äù GOP-led voter purges, particularly targeting non-citizen voting, are restricting voting rights without due process. ‚ÄúVoter purges represent a coordinated effort by my friends on the other side of the aisle to manipulate elections ‚Äî to, in effect, make American elections less American,‚Äù the New York Democrat said.

THERE IS ONLY ONE REASON DEMOCRATS WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR NONCITIZENS TO VOTE

‚ÄúThere was a time in America when both Republicans and Democrats would have both been in favor of cleaning dead voters from the rolls,‚Äù PILF communications director Douglas Blair told the Washington Examiner. ‚ÄúThis should be a bipartisan issue. It's deeply disappointing that Public Interest Legal Foundation has seen such pushback to something that used to be common sense.‚Äù

A number of key documents related to the ‚Äúmanufactured‚Äù Russiagate scandal are still heavily redacted or not yet declassified years later, despite efforts by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, among others, to make information about the start of the Trump collusion investigation public.

As President Donald Trump's administration continues to release individual documents, here is some of the information that is still outstanding.

FBI Director Kash Patel reportedly found thousands of sensitive Russigate-related documents hidden away in what he described as a secret room at the bureau, and among them was an annex to a special counsel report that the Trump administration declassified this week.

BONGINO SAYS HE FOUND FBI ROOM WITH HIDDEN COMEY-ERA EVIDENCE

Patel turned over the trove of documents to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who ultimately released the annex on Thursday. The now-declassified annex to former special counsel John Durham's final report on the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation provided more detail about intelligence suggesting that Hillary Clinton's campaign planned to enlist the FBI in a plot to tie Trump to Russian election activities.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe is expected to declassify underlying intelligence, including the annex, used in Durham's investigation. 

RUSSIAGATE DEFINITIVE TIMELINE: HOW NEW INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENTS FIT IN

In the summer of 2016, then-CIA Director John Brennan briefed then-President Barack Obama on intel that Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was concocting a scheme to tie Trump, her election opponent, to Russia.

Ratcliffe, as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, declassified Brennan's handwritten notes, which documented that meeting. Former FBI Director James Comey and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper were also at the Brennan-Obama briefing.

JAMES COMEY AND JOHN BRENNAN UNDER INVESTIGATION BY DOJ FOR TRUMP-RUSSIA INQUIRY

According to the heavily redacted meeting minutes, on July 28, 2016, Brennan's briefing disclosed a plan from one of Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisers ‚Äúto vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.‚Äù Clinton approved the plan, Durham found. The annex, declassified on Thursday, described how an operative at a George Soros-led foundation also helped develop the plan.

On Sept. 7, 2016, the CIA forwarded an investigative lead, referring the intelligence about Clinton's plan to the FBI for appropriate action. The memorandum, containing many redactions, mentioned ‚Äúan exchange‚Äù discussing Clinton's plan to tie Trump to Russia ‚Äúas a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.‚Äù

The rapid release of records is exposing how top Obama administration officials advanced discredited Trump-Russia narratives during the 2016 presidential election while simultaneously neglecting to take procedural investigative steps against Hillary Clinton based on, in some instances, far more credible allegations.

On July 23, Grassley and Rep. Rick Crawford (R-AR), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to Patel requesting that the FBI fully investigate ‚Äúuntapped information‚Äù they said the bureau ignored in its investigation of Clinton's usage of a private email server for official communications as secretary of state.

Their request is a follow-up inquiry in response to the FBI's recent declassification of an appendix, known as the ‚ÄúClinton annex,‚Äù to the Justice Department inspector general's June 2018 report reviewing the department's handling of the Clinton email investigation. The annex's release earlier this month was the result of Grassley's yearslong efforts to obtain the then-classified appendix.

FBI IGNORED KEY EVIDENCE IN CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION, DOJ WATCHDOG REVEALS

According to the newly declassified Office of Inspector General findings, this ‚Äúunevaluated material‚Äù that the lawmakers are seeking, concerning hacked State Department data, has been stored within several thumb drives inside a northern Virginia offshoot office of the FBI's Washington Field Office since 2018.

The ‚Äúvast majority of this data has never been reviewed by the FBI, including for counterintelligence purposes,‚Äù the watchdog report found, due to sensitivity concerns at the time pertaining to the disclosure of potentially privileged victim information.

In the letter addressed to Patel, Grassley and Crawford said the FBI, under the direction of Comey, ‚Äúshockingly‚Äù overlooked evidence in the agency's possession, even though department officials acknowledged in memorandum drafts that analyzing the thumb drives was necessary to conduct a ‚Äúthorough and complete investigation‚Äù and ‚Äúassess the national security risks‚Äù associated with Clinton's server use.

‚ÄúLiterally, an entire collection of data, including ‚Äòreports purporting to analyze or characterize intercepted U.S. communications' and information concerning ‚Äòcyber intrusions into U.S. entities' were simply swept away into the dark confines of history ‚Äì until now,‚Äù the lawmakers told Patel. ‚ÄúWe refuse to allow this dereliction of duty to continue, and trust that your leadership will immediately seek to rectify this oversight by prior DOJ and FBI leadership.‚Äù

KASH PATEL PREVIEWS NEW RUSSIAGATE INFORMATION WILL PROVIDE ‚ÄòACCOUNTABILITY'

Grassley and Crawford urged that the material at issue be ‚Äúimmediately dug out from hiding and properly assessed‚Äù in order ‚Äúto correct this historic investigative and national security failure.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe revelations contained in the declassified OIG appendix are at the heart of why the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) became distrusted by so many under your agency's prior directors: a failure to impartially conduct its law enforcement and intelligence mission,‚Äù they wrote.

The massive Senate Intelligence Committee report, now regarded as Russiagate gospel among establishment Democrats, still contains walls of redactions spanning a considerable percentage of the 1,313-page publication.

Democrats are suddenly citing the congressional committee's report, which was about Russian election activities at large, not specifically the targeting of Trump, to affirm their Trump-Russia collusion claims.

SENATORS STAND BY 2016 RUSSIA ELECTION MEDDLING REPORT DESPITE GABBARD'S CLAIMS

The bipartisan panel found ‚Äúextensive‚Äù Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race.

Much of the report remains redacted five years after the fifth and final installment was released.

For instance, in Volume 5: Counterintelligence Threats and Vulnerabilities, the Senate Intelligence Committee introduced a new allegation suggesting that Russian-Ukrainian operative Konstantin Kilimnik, an associate of Trump 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort, ‚Äúmay have been connected‚Äù to the Russian military intelligence's hack and leak of Democratic Party material. However, the report's discussions on the matter were redacted.

PAUL MANAFORT CONCEDES HE GAVE TRUMP CAMPAIGN POLLING DATA TO THE RUSSIANS

Manafort's involvement is ‚Äúlargely unknown,‚Äù according to the redacted report, but ‚Äútwo pieces of information‚Ä¶raise the possibility of Manafort's potential connection to the hack-and-leak operations.‚Äù Details of said information were also redacted.

In 2018, the FBI publicly released heavily redacted copies of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants targeting former Trump adviser Carter Page. The document, spanning 412 pages, included the initial October 2016 surveillance application along with three 90-day renewals, all approved for spying on Page.

To date, all four FISA warrant applications and accompanying approvals remain riddled with redactions. Blocks of information were still blacked out in 2020 iterations of the FISA filings provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of the panel's FISA abuse investigation. At the time, DOJ officials said the submissions contained ‚Äúminimal redactions.‚Äù

FBI DIRECTOR ADMITS: YES, SURVEILLANCE OF CARTER PAGE WAS ILLEGAL

Also in 2020, a judge denied legal efforts to compel additional declassification of the Page documents. Plaintiffs in the Freedom of Information Act lawsuit unsuccessfully sought further FISA disclosures, including complete versions of 21 redacted pages.

Ultimately, the DOJ concluded that there was insufficient evidence to authorize the extended electronic surveillance of Page.

According to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order, the DOJ assessed that two of the FISA applications involved ‚Äúinsufficient predication to establish probable cause to believe that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power‚Äù and that court authorizations for the pair of warrants ‚Äúwere not valid.‚Äù

Aside from one guilty plea ending in probation for a former FBI lawyer, no one has been held accountable for the FBI's misconduct in the FISA process, particularly the unlawful surveillance of Page using misleading and error-filled applications. Who else was involved in the surveillance scheme is a pressing question long in need of an answer.

Key elements of the FBI Christopher Steele debriefing document, which was declassified during Trump's final full day of his first term, remain out of view behind redactions, such as the British ex-spy's descriptions of a ‚Äúparticular sub-source in greater detail.‚Äù

DOJ INSPECTOR GENERAL FINDS 17 ‚ÄòSIGNIFICANT ERRORS OR OMISSIONS' IN CARTER PAGE FISA APPLICATIONS

Previously released FBI interview notes detailing the bureau's discussion with Steele and his business partner back in 2017 are also still redacted at pertinent parts. In 2020, Grassley publicly shared a slightly less redacted version of the notes, but many of the withholdings persisted.

Buried below were significant, paragraph-length redactions related to Russian analyst Igor Danchenko, the ‚Äúprimary sub-source‚Äù for Steele's dossier, and how the anti-Trump dossier was assembled and accordingly disseminated.

Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., discusses the court ruling that allowed President Donald Trump to maintain control over the California National Guard amid anti-I.C.E. riots on ‚ÄòFox Report.'

Only 250 National Guard members will remain in Los Angeles after the Pentagon announced Thursday it would be canceling the deployment of additional troops as anti-ICE protests in the city have quieted down.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered 1,350 National Guard members to leave the city, while a couple hundred will stay to protect federal personnel and property, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Roughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines were sent to LA in June to gain control over riots against immigration raids in the city. The federal move was made despite objections from state and local leaders, including Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who filed a lawsuit in an attempt to end the federal deployment. 

Half of the National Guard troops were withdrawn about two weeks ago and the Marines were ordered to leave a few days later.

Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass wrote on X Wednesday night that the departure of more troops was "another win for Los Angeles," adding: "We will continue this pressure until ALL troops are out of L.A."

"These troops have families and jobs," she wrote in a separate X post on Thursday. "They could've been responding to actual danger or helping communities prepare for fire threats. Instead, they were forced to guard two office buildings for months."

National Guard troops were mostly in the city protecting two federal buildings ‚Äì the ICE office and detention facility downtown. Some have also been shielding federal agents while they carry out immigration raids.

California leaders argued that the federal deployment was unnecessary and escalated tensions in the city as protests continued against the Trump administration's deportations and immigration raids in the area. While protests are still taking place, the majority of them have remained small and scattered.

Newsom said in a statement that President Donald Trump's "political theater backfired."

"The women and men of our military deserve more than to be used as props in the federal government's propaganda machine," Newsom said.

After California sued to stop the federal deployment of the National Guard, Newsom argued in June that the Trump administration violated the law when it deployed the troops. Newsom also asked the judge to block the troops from helping carry out immigration raids.

A lower court initially ordered Trump to return control of the National Guard to Newsom, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later temporarily blocked the order.

Criminal defense attorney Dina Doll says Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs' fame helped him hire a top-tier legal team ‚Äî something most defendants can't afford. The entertainment mogul was convicted of prostitution-related offenses but acquitted Wednesday of sex trafficking and racketeering charges.

(Elizabeth Williams via AP)











NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs could face a prison sentence ‚Äúsubstantially higher‚Äù than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges.

They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. 3 sentencing. 

In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed.

Each prostitution-related charge carries a potential maximum 10 years in prison.

Prosecutors said after the verdict that they thought federal sentencing guidelines meant to prevent wide disparities in sentencings for the same crimes would likely call for a prison term of four to five years. But they said Thursday they believe the guidelines range ‚Äúwill be substantially higher,‚Äù raising the risk Combs will flee.

Judge Arun Subramanian will have wide latitude in determining a sentence and can choose to ignore the guidelines, which are not mandatory. Combs' lawyers have said they believe the guidelines, if properly calculated, will call for 21 to 27 months in prison.




On the day of the verdict, prosecutors won a bail fight after defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo argued Combs should be freed immediately on bail.

Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a ‚Äúlack of danger to any person or the community.‚Äù But he said Agnifilo could renew the request.

In doing so Tuesday, Agnifilo cited other cases he said were comparable to Combs' conviction in which defendants were granted bail. And he cited severe conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Combs has been held since his September arrest at a New York hotel.

He also said Combs was being treated unfairly for engaging in a ‚Äúswingers‚Äù lifestyle in which he and his girlfriends sometimes invited male sex workers to join them in multiday marathon sex performances. 

Prosecutors said in their filing Thursday that Combs' conviction on the prostitution-related counts carried a mandatory requirement that he remain in jail prior to sentencing, unless he could prove exceptional circumstances, which they said he cannot.

They said he should also remain in prison as a danger to the community, a claim that Agnifilo disputed in his papers.

‚ÄúSean Combs will not be violent to anyone. As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,‚Äù Agnifilo wrote earlier this week.

Prosecutors also said conditions at the federal lockup had improved considerably before Combs was arrested. A federal judge in January 2024 had blasted conditions at the jail, including its extensive lockdowns and inadequate medical care.

Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.

‚ÄúThe defendant's extensive history of violence ‚Äî and his continued attempt to minimize his recent violent conduct ‚Äî demonstrates his dangerousness and that he is not amendable to supervision,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúThe defendant utterly fails to establish by clear and convincing evidence, as required, that he does not pose a danger to the community.‚Äù

Wisconsin researchers recently discovered a 145-year-old shipwreck in a murky river ‚Äì and it was a complete surprise.

The Wisconsin Underwater Archaeology Association (WUAA), the organization that led the trip, confirmed the discovery to Fox News Digital. The ship was found near the city of Oshkosh.

Historians believe the sunken vessel is the L.W. Crane, built in 1865. It sank in 1880. 

MARINE EXPERTS FIND LIKELY REMAINS OF 18TH-CENTURY TREASURE SHIP THAT WAS LOST FOR CENTURIES

"We knew the Crane was in the area, [and] that finding her remains was a possibility," WUAA president Brendon Baillod told Fox News Digital. 

"But we had assumed that she was most likely buried in the bottom."

Experts believe the 90-foot-long wreck may be that of the L.W. Crane, a vessel last seen ablaze and cut loose from its dock. (Wisconsin Historical Society; Wisconsin Underwater Archaeology Association)

He noted that diving the wreck is not feasible, as the Fox River has very low visibility due to suspended sediment. 

They used an archaeological-grade sidescan sonar manufactured in Sweden to find the ship's remnants.

"We were amazed that her entire hull was still visible on the bottom," Baillod said.

The discovery was also publicized by the Wisconsin Historical Society (WHS), which posted about it on Facebook in July. 

Speaking to Fox News Digital, WHS maritime archaeologist Jordan Ciesielczyk described the situation as "a happy accident, and completely unexpected."

MYSTERIOUS 18TH-CENTURY WARSHIP UNEARTHED AT GROUND ZERO SITE GETS NEW HOME

The WHS joined the trip to survey another shipwreck in the area, the Berlin City. That vessel was built in 1856 and sank in 1870. 

"[The Berlin City] is another river steamboat, like the L.W. Crane," Ciesielczyk said. 

"These small steamboats would carry freight and passengers up and down the Fox and Wolf Rivers."

"We were amazed that her entire hull was still visible on the bottom," said WUAA president Brendon Baillod, seen at left.  (Wisconsin Historical Society)

At the time of the trip, the WHS was unaware of any other shipwrecks in the area, the expert added.

"We were going upriver between two of the previous survey areas and kept scanning the bottom as we went along when suddenly this wreckage came up on our screen," Ciesielczyk said. 

"It was very exciting!"

"It's a very strong possibility that this wreck is the L.W. Crane."

Ciesielczyk pointed to "context clues" ‚Äì including the ship's size, shape and location ‚Äì as strong evidence the wreck is the L.W. Crane.

"In the summer of 1880, the barge L.W. Crane caught fire and was cut loose from its slip where it burned and sank into Fox River roughly in the area where this wreck was discovered," the archaeologist said. 

Poor visibility and fast-moving currents make diving in the Fox River extremely difficult, even for experienced teams. (Wisconsin Historical Society)

"100 yards away from this wreck are the remaining stone bridge caissons for the former railroad bridge on the river bottom."

"The shipwreck we discovered was 90 feet long and 20 feet wide, which is roughly the same size as the L.W. Crane. It's a very strong possibility that this wreck is the L.W. Crane."

Diving in the Fox River is "very challenging" with the rough currents and poor visibility.

Ciesielczyk noted that no artifacts have been discovered near the site, but that doesn't mean they don't exist ‚Äì further research is planned.

Future exploration, however, won't be easy. Ciesielczyk said diving in the Fox River is "very challenging" with the rough currents and poor visibility.

Having gone diving "in a different part of the Fox River on another shipwreck years ago, I couldn't see my hands in front of my face," he recalled.

The latest discovery is one of many long-lost shipwrecks that have been identified in the Midwest in recent months. 

In May, the WHS announced that a fisherman stumbled upon a historic shipwreck in Lake Michigan.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) ‚Äî A federal judge ruled on Thursday against the Trump administration's plans and extended Temporary Protected Status for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua.

Temporary Protected Status is a protection that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States, preventing from being deported and allowing them to work. The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It's part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem can extend Temporary Protected Status to immigrants in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe to return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions. Noem had ruled to end protections for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining that conditions in their homelands no longer warranted them.

The secretary said the two countries had made ‚Äúsignificant progress‚Äù in recovering from 1998's Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history.

The designation for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal was scheduled to end Aug. 5 while protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans who have been in the U.S. for more than 25 years were set to expire Sept. 8.

U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco did not set an expiration date but rather ruled to keep the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is Nov. 18.




In a sharply written order, Thompson said the administration ended the migrant status protections without an ‚Äúobjective review of the country conditions‚Äù such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua.

If the protections were not extended, immigrants could suffer from loss of employment, health insurance, be separated from their families, and risk being deported to other countries where they have no ties, she wrote, adding that the termination of Temporary Protection Status for people from Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua would result in a $1.4 billion loss to the economy.

‚ÄúThe freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood,‚Äù Thompson said.

Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argued that Noem's decisions were predetermined by President Donald Trump's campaign promises and motivated by racial animus. 

Thompson agreed, saying that statements Noem and Trump have made perpetuated the ‚Äúdiscriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.‚Äù

‚ÄúColor is neither a poison nor a crime,‚Äù she wrote.

The advocacy group that filed the lawsuit said designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less.

‚ÄúThey gave them two months to leave the country. It's awful,‚Äù said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs at a hearing Tuesday.

Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio Garc√≠a told The Associated Press, ‚ÄúThe judge recognized the need of the (TPS holders) to be able to work in peace, tranquility and legally.‚Äù

He recalled that during the first Trump administration, there was a similar legal challenge and the fight took five years in the courts. He hoped for a similar outcome this time that would allow the Hondurans to remain in the U.S.

‚ÄúToday's news is hopeful and positive and gives us time and oxygen, hopefully it will be a long road, and the judge will have the final word and not President Trump,‚Äù he said.

Meanwhile in Nicaragua, hundreds of thousands have fled into exile as the government shuttered thousands of nongovernmental organizations and imprisoned political opponents. Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega and his wife and co-President Rosario Murillo have consolidated complete control in Nicaragua since Ortega returned to power two decades ago.

In February, a panel of U.N. experts warned the Nicaraguan government had dismantled the last remaining checks and balances and was ‚Äúsystematically executing a strategy to cement total control of the country through severe human rights violations.‚Äù

The broad effort by the Republican administration 's crackdown on immigration has been going after people who are in the country illegally but also by removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the U.S. on a temporary basis.

The Trump administration has already terminated protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits at federal courts.

The government argued that Noem has clear authority over the program and that her decisions reflect the administration's objectives in the areas of immigration and foreign policy.

‚ÄúIt is not meant to be permanent,‚Äù Justice Department attorney William Weiland said.

A California federal judge on Thursday delayed the end dates of temporary protected status designations previously reserved for an estimated 61,000 people from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal until the Department of Homeland Security revoked those deportation protections.

The ruling represents a setback for the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda as it seeks to deport illegal immigrants and foreign nationals who have overstayed their time in the United States.

U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson of San Francisco temporarily blocked the federal government from terminating the TPS protections and work permits for thousands of migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The Biden-appointed judge scheduled a Nov. 18 hearing on the matter.

The TPS designations for an estimated 7,000 Nepalese were previously set to end Aug. 5, and those for 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans were set to lapse on Sept. 8. The migrants from Central America have resided in the United States for more than 25 years, ever since Hurricane Mitch hit the region in 1998.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem determined the deportation protections for those three groups of migrants, among others, were no longer necessary since conditions in their native countries have improved.

For instance, Noem said earlier this month that Honduras ‚Äúhas taken all of the necessary steps to overcome the impacts of Hurricane Mitch‚Äù and that ‚ÄúHonduran citizens can safely return home.‚Äù

Judge Thompson concluded the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their argument that Noem's decision to terminate TPS protections was motivated by ‚Äúracial animus.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn totality, Plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence demonstrating racial and discriminatory animus in support of their Fifth Amendment claim. Color is neither a poison nor a crime,‚Äù Thompson wrote in the 37-page order.

‚ÄòTEMPORARY' IN NAME ONLY: HOW TPS ALLOWS FOREIGNERS TO STAY IN THE US FOR YEARS

‚ÄúThe freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream,‚Äù she said at the start of the court document. ‚ÄúThat is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees.‚Äù

In recent weeks, the DHS has revoked TPS designations for an estimated 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, 160,000 Ukrainians, and thousands more from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Several lawsuits are pending in federal courts.

Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler announced Friday she is stepping down from her role at the central bank, creating an important vacancy at a time when President Donald Trump is pushing for lower interest rates.

In a letter addressed to Trump, Kugler, 55, did not state a reason for her decision to leave, only noting that she will be returning to Georgetown University as a professor in the fall.

"It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System," Kugler wrote. "I am especially honored to have served during a critical time in achieving our dual mandate of bringing down prices and keeping a strong and resilient labor market."

Kugler's term was set to expire at the end of January 2026. A Biden nominee, she joined the Board of Governors in September 2023, filling the unexpired term of Lael Brainard, who left to serve as an Biden economic advisor. As a governor, Kugler was a permanent voter on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.

Her resignation now paves the way for Trump to put his own nominee in for the board. Two of his prior appointments, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, voted against the decision at Wednesday's meeting to hold the Fed's key rate steady, instead indicating they wanted to lower. Kugler was absent for the vote.

Kugler of late has expressed generally hawkish views, expressing support for holding rates steady until the impact Trump's tariffs are having on inflation becomes clearer.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell wished Kugler well, saying "She brought impressive experience and academic insights to her work on the Board."

In this article

A jury in Miami has determined that Tesla should be held partly liable for a fatal 2019 Autopilot crash, and must compensate the family of the deceased and an injured survivor damages of $329 million.

The payout includes $129 million in compensatory damages, and $200 million in punitive damages against Tesla. Attorneys for the plaintiffs had asked the jury to award damages of around $345 million. The trial in the Southern District of Florida started on July 14.

The suit centered around who shouldered the blame for the deadly crash in Key Largo, Florida. A Tesla owner named George McGee was driving his Model S electric sedan while using the company's Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system.

While driving, McGee dropped his mobile phone that he was using and scrambled to pick it up. He said during the trial that he believed Enhanced Autopilot would brake if an obstacle was in the way. His Model S accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 miles per hour, hitting a nearby empty parked car and its owners, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle.

Naibel Benavides, who was 22, died on the scene from injuries sustained in the crash. Her body was discovered about 75 feet away from the point of impact. Her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, survived but suffered multiple broken bones, a traumatic brain injury and psychological effects.

"Tesla designed Autopilot only for controlled access highways yet deliberately chose not to restrict drivers from using it elsewhere, alongside Elon Musk telling the world Autopilot drove better than humans," Brett Schreiber, counsel for the plaintiffs, said in an e-mailed statement on Friday. "Tesla's lies turned our roads into test tracks for their fundamentally flawed technology, putting everyday Americans like Naibel Benavides and Dillon Angulo in harm's way."

Following the verdict, the plaintiffs' families hugged each other and their lawyers, and Angulo was "visibly emotional" as he embraced his mother, according to NBC. 

Tesla told NBC that it plans to appeal and said, "Today's verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla's and the entire industry's efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology."

The verdict comes as Musk, Tesla's CEO, is trying to persuade investors that his company can pivot into a leader in autonomous vehicles, and that its self-driving systems are safe enough to operate fleets of robotaxis on public roads in the U.S.

Tesla shares dipped 1.5% on Friday and are now down 25% for the year, the biggest drop among tech's megacap companies.

The verdict could set a precedent for Autopilot-related suits against Tesla. About a dozen active cases are underway focused on similar claims involving incidents where Autopilot or Tesla's FSD‚Äî Full Self-Driving (Supervised) ‚Äî had been in use just before a fatal or injurious crash. 

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration initiated a probe in 2021 into possible safety defects in Tesla's Autopilot systems. During the course of that investigation, Tesla made changes, including a number of over-the-air software updates.

The agency then opened a second probe, which is ongoing, evaluating whether Tesla's "recall remedy" to resolve issues with the behavior of its Autopilot, especially around stationary first responder vehicles, had been effective.

The NHTSA has also warned Tesla that its social media posts may mislead drivers into thinking its cars are capable of functioning as robotaxis, even though owners manuals say the cars require hands-on steering and a driver attentive to steering and braking at all times.

A site that tracks Tesla-involved collisions, TeslaDeaths.com, has reported at least 58 deaths resulting from incidents where Tesla drivers had Autopilot engaged just before impact.

President Donald Trump on Friday fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, hours after the agency reported that job growth in the U.S. had slowed to a near-halt.

In a Truth Social post that also directed even more fire at Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump accused BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer of being a political appointee who was manipulating jobs data.

"I was just informed that our Country's "Jobs Numbers" are being produced by a Biden Appointee, Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, who faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's [Harris'] chances of Victory," Trump wrote.

"We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified," he added.

CNBC has reached out to the BLS for comment. NBC News confirmed that McEntarfer has been fired. The BLS operated under the Department of Labor, whose commissioner, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, is a Trump appointee.

The stunning demand came the same day that the BLS reported a gain of just 73,000 nonfarm jobs in July, below market expectations. In addition, the bureau revised the two previous months down sharply, cutting a combined 258,000 from the prior counts, putting the three-month growth rate at a paltry 35,000. It was the biggest two-month downward revision since April 2020, the early days of the Covid crisis.

Trump and congressional Republicans have repeatedly criticized the BLS over the years for its data collection. In particular, the large revisions have been a target.

In his spending plan this year, Trump proposed an 8% reduction in staff at the bureau, raising questions over the integrity of its counts on employment, consumer prices and multiple other economic metrics. The bureau has had to impute a growing amount of estimated data into a number of its reports.

"Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes," the president wrote. "McEntarfer said there were only 73,000 Jobs added (a shock!) but, more importantly, that a major mistake was made by them, 258,000 Jobs downward, in the prior two months. Similar things happened in the first part of the year, always to the negative."

Prior to Friday's report, Trump repeatedly has championed the strength of the labor market. After the June numbers had been released initially, the White House put out a statement calling it a "June Boom."

The weak jobs report Friday preceded a sharp drop in markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off more than 500 points and the tech-focused Nasdaq off more than 2%. Treasury yields also slumped.

"I can't believe what I just saw," said Peter Mallouk, president and chief investment officer of Creative Planning. Trump's social media post seemed like a parody or satire at first, Mallouk said.

"This is not healthy," he added. "We can't have a set of numbers come out and fire somebody that served under numerous administrations in various roles because you don't like the numbers."

Along with his tirade against McEntarfer and the BLS, Trump for at least the third time Friday tore into the Fed's Powell, who has advocated that the central bank not lower interest rates until it has a better idea of how the president's tariffs will impact inflation.

"The Economy is BOOMING under 'TRUMP' despite a Fed that also plays games, this time with Interest Rates, where they lowered them twice, and substantially, just before the Presidential Election, I assume in the hopes of getting 'Kamala' elected ‚Äì How did that work out?" Trump wrote. "Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should also be put 'out to pasture.'"

The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy arm, on Wednesday voted to keep its benchmark interest rate steady, where it has been since December. However, following the weak jobs report, futures markets priced in a strong possibility the Fed will cut in September.

President Donald Trump on Friday said that he ordered two nuclear submarines "to be positioned in the appropriate regions" in response to warnings made to the United States this week by high-ranking Russian official Dmitry Medvedev.

Medvedev in a social media post on Monday wrote that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine "is a threat and a step towards war."

"Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country," Medvedev wrote on X that day.

Trump earlier Monday had said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners.

On Friday, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, "Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that."

"Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences. I hope this will not be one of those instances," Trump said. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"

Medvedev, in his tweet Monday, wrote, "Trump's playing the ultimatum game with Russia: 50 days or 10‚Ä¶ He should remember 2 things."

"1. Russia isn't Israel or even Iran. 2. Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war," Medvedev wrote.

"Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country. Don't go down the Sleepy Joe road!" Medvedev added, referring to former President Joe Biden.

Trump in a Truth Social post on Thursday warned Medvedev about his rhetoric, while also taking a shot on Russia's trading partnership with India.

I don't care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care," Trump wrote. "We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World.

"Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together," Trump said. "Let's keep it that way, and tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he's still President, to watch his words. He's entering very dangerous territory!"

Medvedev responded Thursday with a statement saying, "If a few words from a former Russian president can provoke such a nervous reaction from the sitting and supposedly formidable president of the United States, then clearly Russia is entirely in the right and will continue on its chosen path."

"As for his remarks about the 'dead economies' of India and Russia and 'venturing into dangerous territory,' perhaps he should revisit his favorite movies about the living dead and recall just how dangerous the mythical 'Dead Hand' can be," Medvedev said.

The Dead Hand is Russia's system for automatically launching nuclear strikes if a nuclear attack is detected against the country.

Two sexual abuse victims of Jeffrey Epstein and the family of late Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre on Friday blasted President Donald Trump after learning that Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell had been transferred to a less restrictive prison in Texas from Florida.

"This move smacks of a cover up," Epstein victims Annie Farmer and Maria Farmer, as well as Giuffre's relatives said in a statement.

"President Trump has sent a clear message today: Pedophiles deserve preferential treatment and their victims do not matter," the statement said, noting that the two women and Giuffre's family had not been notified of Maxwell's transfer before media reports of it.

Maxwell's transfer to minimum security camp in Bryan, Texas, came after two days of meetings she and her lawyer had last week in Tallahassee, Florida, with a top Justice Department official.

That official, Deputy Attorney Todd Blanche, is Trump's former criminal defense lawyer.

Trump is a former friend of Epstein and Maxwell.

"It is with horror and outrage that we object to the preferential treatment convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has received," the statement said.

"Ghislaine Maxwell is a sexual predator who physically assaulted minor children on multiple occasions, and she should never be shown any leniency," the statement said.

"Yet, without any notification to the Maxwell victims, the government overnight has moved Maxwell to a minimum security luxury prison in Texas," the statement said.

"This is the justice system failing victims right before our eyes. The American public should be enraged by the preferential treatment being given to a pedophile and a criminally charged child sex offender. The Trump administration should not credit a word Maxwell says, as the government itself sought charges against Maxwell for being a serial liar," the statement said.

"This move smacks of a cover up. The victims deserve better," the statement said.

Mawell's lawyer, who confirmed the transfer to NBC, did not explain why the 63-year-old was transferred from the federal minimum security prison in Tallahassee.

A senior administration official told NBC News, "Any false assertion this individual was given preferential treatment is absurd."

"Prisoners are routinely moved in some instances due to significant safety and danger concerns," the official said.

Jack Scarola, a lawyer who represents 20 Epstein victims, told NBC News, "The victims of the Epstein/Maxwell conspiracy continue to endure the emotional pain of every development in the negotiations with Ghislaine Maxwell."

"They wait anxiously and expect to be afforded full access to all relevant information concerning the criminal conduct that has so severely damaged them," Scarola said. "Then, once properly informed, they look forward to having their voices be heard with respect to any action concerning Ms. Maxwell that might be contemplated."

Maxwell was convicted at trial in 2021 of crimes related to grooming underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Blanche met with Maxwell for hours last week after saying he was interested in learning whether she had information about other potential abuses of girls and women in Epstein's orbit.

Blanche asked Maxwell "maybe about 100 different people," her lawyer David Oscar Markus said last week.

Blanche's meeting raised questions about whether the Trump administration will seek a reduction of Maxwell's sentence or whether President Donald Trump will pardon her.

The Justice Department and Trump have been criticized for nearly a month for failing to release evidence accumulated in an investigation into Epstein despite prior promises to make that information public.

The New York Sun first reported that Maxwell had been transferred from her prison in Florida.

Epstein died in August 2019 from a jailhouse suicide, weeks after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.

Ghislaine Maxwell, the sex offender accomplice of Jeffrey Epstein, has been moved from a low-security federal prison in Florida to a less restrictive federal lockup in Texas, her attorney confirmed to NBC News on Friday.

Maxwell's transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons minimum security camp in Bryan, Texas, came after two days of meetings she and her lawyer had last week in Tallahassee, Florida, with a top Justice Department official.

Mawell's lawyer did not explain why the 63-year-old was transferred from the federal minimum security prison in Tallahassee.

Manhattan Shooting:

It was just after 1:30 a.m., and Jessica Tisch was walking the eerie quiet of 345 Park Avenue, surveying the detritus of a deadly attack.

As the scrunch of broken glass cut the silence and blood still glistened on the floor, a distraught Tisch confronted her most challenging moment yet as New York City's police commissioner. Mere hours earlier, a lone gunman with an assault rifle stalked this very space, ending the life of four people before taking his own.

In this article

Ford is recalling 312,120 vehicles in the U.S. as loss of power brake assist while driving can extend stopping distance and increase the risk of a crash, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Friday.

The recall affects certain 2025 Lincoln Navigator, F-150, Expedition, Bronco, and Ranger vehicles.

The agency flagged that the Electronic Brake Booster (EBB) module might fail while driving or using the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) feature, causing a loss of power brake assist.

As a remedy, the EBB module software will be updated over-the-air (OTA) or by a dealer, free of charge, NHTSA said.

OpenAI has secured $8.3 billion in new capital as part of its $40 billion fundraise, according to a person familiar with the transaction. 

The fresh capital comes as the artificial intelligence company's business accelerates. 

Annual recurring revenue jumped to $13 billion, up from $10 billion in June, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential financial information, and is projected to top $20 billion by year-end. 

Paid business users of ChatGPT have climbed to five million from three million just months ago, they said. The round was completed ahead of schedule and was five times oversubscribed.

DealBook was first to report the transaction.

The raise underscores surging investor appetite for AI platforms as competition intensifies among leading model makers.

Dragoneer Investment Group contributed $2.8 billion to the round, the person said, joining Blackstone, TPG, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue, Altimeter, D1 Capital, Tiger Global, and Thrive Capital. 

While Dragoneer was the largest investor in this latest tranche of funding, SoftBank remains the lead backer of the broader $40 billion fundraising effort.

Rivals are also raising massive sums. 

Anthropic, one of OpenAI's chief competitors, is in talks to secure between $3 billion and $5 billion in new funding led by Iconiq Capital at a potential $170 billion valuation, CNBC confirmed. That follows a $3.5 billion round in March that valued the startup at $61.5 billion.

Both OpenAI and Anthropic are courting Middle Eastern capital to finance their ambitions.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently signaled a willingness to reverse his previous stance against Gulf sovereign wealth funds, warning in a leaked memo shared with Wired that it's become "substantially harder to stay on the frontier" of AI development without tapping that money. 

OpenAI, meanwhile, is working with Emirati firm G42 to build a massive data center in Abu Dhabi.

Two Federal Reserve officials who voted this week against holding a key interest rate in place explained their decisions Friday, both indicating that the central bank is making a mistake by waiting to ease policy amid rising threats to the labor market.

Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman both said they wanted a quarter percentage point reduction, as they see tariffs having only a temporary impact on inflation. They said staying on hold, as the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee has done since December, poses risks to the economy.

In separate statements, Waller and Bowman laid out their reasons for dissenting, the first time two governors have done so since 1993. The committee voted 9-2 to hold, and the differences of opinion reflect "a healthy and robust discussion," Waller said.

The pair released the statements just prior to a Labor Department report showing that nonfarm payrolls rose by just 73,000 in July, below expectations, while the June and May counts were revised lower by a combined 258,000 and showed virtually no growth for both months.

"There is nothing wrong about having different views about how to interpret incoming data and using different economic arguments to predict how tariffs will impact the economy," Waller wrote. "But, I believe that the wait and see approach is overly cautious, and, in my opinion, does not properly balance the risks to the outlook and could lead to policy falling behind the curve."

Further, Waller insisted that inflation impacts from President Donald Trump's tariffs have been "small so far" and could continue in that vein.

Both he and Bowman ‚Äî Trump appointees during his first term ‚Äî did not advocate for the kind of dramatic cuts Trump has pushed. The president has suggested the federal funds rate, which sets a target that banks use for overnight lending but spills over into many other rates, should be as much as 3 percentage points lower.

Waller suggested something more gradual ‚Äî cutting by as much as 1.5 percentage points, at a slow pace as the committee monitors impacts from policy easing.

Similarly, Bowman backed "gradual cuts" as she also said tariffs are having only limited impact on prices. In fact, she said that without the duties, the Fed's key inflation measure would be below 2.5% "and considerably closer to our 2 percent target."

"With tariff-related price increases likely representing a one-time effect, it is appropriate to look through temporarily elevated inflation readings," said Bowman, who also serves as the Fed's vice chair for bank supervision. "I see the risk that a delay in taking action could result in a deterioration in the labor market and a further slowing in economic growth."

Trump has been unrelenting in his criticism of the Fed for not cutting. In a Truth Social post Friday morning, he again tore into the central bank, and Chair Jerome Powell in particular.

"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell, a stubborn MORON, must substantially lower interest rates, NOW. IF HE CONTINUES TO REFUSE, THE BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL, AND DO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HAS TO BE DONE!" Trump said.

Joby Aviation and defense manufacturing giant L3Harris announced a partnership Friday to develop a next-generation military craft that can be piloted or fly autonomously.

The partnership brings together Joby's hybrid vertical take-off and landing, or VTOL, aircraft and L3's expertise in military systems and certification.

The companies expect to begin testing this fall, followed by operational demonstrations in 2026, according to the release.

"Conflicts like Russia, Ukraine, are really changing how people think about, you know, low altitude aviation generally," Joby executive chairman Paul Sciarra told CNBC's Morgan Brennan. "Getting something out there that can move very quickly from demonstration to deployability felt especially important."

Jon Rambeau, president of Integrated Mission Systems at L3Harris, said initially the project will focus on use cases like airborne surveillance, reconnaissance and contested logistics applications.

"We're going to target ... the broader government exercises that the military services hold periodically, and see if we can fit some of those use cases into those larger exercises," Rambeau told Brennan.

The announcement comes as government spending is under scrutiny and the U.S. military works to bolster the technology in battlefield operations, adding artificial intelligence with autonomous vehicles and drones.

"I think the branches are questioning whether or not you know the right approach for low altitude support is, you know, $30 million crude Apaches, or whether or not it's something that is smaller, cheaper and autonomous ‚Äî it has the ability to adapt to flexible payloads," Sciarra said.

Joby is known for its commercial air taxis, which are electric. The company delivered its first electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft to the United Arab Emirates at the end of June, where it is working toward a 2026 launch.

The new military vehicle with L3, based on Joby's S4 craft, will be developed with a gas turbine, according to the release.

Joby, which is still working on Federal Aviation Administration approval for its aircraft, recently announced an expansion of manufacturing and hopes to double production at its California hub.

Shares of Joby are up more than 100% this year. L3Harris stock is up 30% so far in 2025.

Ray Dalio, founder of one of the biggest hedge funds Bridgewater, has dumped his remaining shares in the firm and stepped aside from its board.

Bridgewater completed the final sale of Dalio's equity shares, wrapping up his management transition started in 2022, according to a person familiar with the matter. Dalio will continue to be a significant investor in Bridgewater's strategies and a mentor, the person said.

The billionaire has been selling his equity for years. To facilitate the final transition of his ownership, Bridgewater raised capital from existing investors and employees. Co-CIOs Bob Prince and Greg Jensen are two significant equity holders, the person said.

"We share our congratulations to Ray ‚Äì he will always be our cherished founder, is a mentor to many, and remains a longstanding client with significant investments in Bridgewater's strategies," Bridgewater CEO Nir Bar Dea and Co-Chair Mike McGavick said in a July 21 letter to clients seen by CNBC. "Ray has always described the transition as a 'dream come true' and we're excited to have made it a reality together."

The Wall Street Journal first reported Dalio's stake sale. The founder seemingly confirmed the transition in a LinkedIn post.

Dalio, who founded Bridgewater in 1975, has focused on macro strategies, such as trading currency and fixed income markets based on economic trends. Dalio stepped down as Bridgewater's chief executive officer in 2017 and chairman at the end of 2021.

"I have been asked a lot about how I feel about passing along Bridgewater after having started and built it over the last 50 years," Dalio said in the LinkedIn post. "I am thrilled about it because I love seeing Bridgewater alive and well without me ‚Äî even better than alive and well with me."

Bridgewater enjoyed solid gains in the first half of 2025, with its Pure Alpha fund up 17% and its All Weather fund rising 8%, the person said.

President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" includes trillions of dollars of tax breaks, including a new charitable deduction for most filers ‚Äî and there's an easy way to maximize it, experts say.

When filing taxes, you claim the greater of your itemized tax breaks or the standard deduction. But 90% of filers don't itemize, according to the latest IRS data, which means they can't take the charitable deduction.

This changes in 2026 with a new charitable tax break for non-itemizers, worth up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married couples filing jointly. The deduction only applies to cash gifts.

"This is a big deal," said Justin Miller, partner and national director of wealth planning at Evercore Wealth Management.

Trump's new charitable deduction is similar to a temporary measure enacted during the pandemic, which was worth up to $300 for single filers or $600 for joint filers for 2021. Roughly 48 million filers claimed that deduction on their 2021 returns, according to IRS data.

With a bigger charitable deduction coming for non-itemizers in 2026, here are some key things to know, according to financial experts.

If you don't itemize deductions and plan on making a smaller year-end charitable gift this year, you might reconsider the timing if there is flexibility, experts say.

"It seems like a no-brainer to just do it in January and capture a little benefit that you wouldn't otherwise achieve," said certified financial planner Edward Jastrem, chief planning officer at Heritage Financial Services in Westwood, Massachusetts.

By donating funds in 2026 rather than 2025, you could be eligible for the new charitable deduction for non-itemizers. Of course, you should consider whether it aligns with your overall financial planning strategy.

"I would caution all taxpayers claiming these deductions that they still need to keep appropriate records," Miller said.

Gifts of any amount require a bank record or written receipt from the organization, including the charity name, amount and date of the contribution, according to the IRS.

If you donate $250 or more, you need what's known as a "contemporaneous written acknowledgement," or CWA, with further detail from the organization.

You must have the CWA on or before the earlier of:

Marcus Lemonis ‚Äî the multimillionaire entrepreneur known for dishing out tough love tactics and advice to small businesses across the US ‚Äî returned to reality television this summer.

"Every episode, I'm meeting businesses at a crossroads," he told viewers during the double episode premiere of Fox's "The Fixer."

"I'm not a consultant. I don't believe in handouts. I'm a capitalist."

From 2013 to 2021, Lemonis also hosted another reality show, CNBC's "The Profit." Its premise was similar to that of "The Fixer": Lemonis offered capital and advice to what were described as "struggling" small businesses in exchange for partial ownership and being put "100% in charge." The show was a hit and turned Lemonis into a minor celebrity.

It also resulted in a sprawling mess of lawsuits, arbitrations, confidential settlements, and small business owners who say that Lemonis damaged their companies and reputations.

Of the roughly 100 businesses featured on "The Profit," more than 50 filed lawsuits, engaged in mediation talks, or settled with Lemonis and NBCUniversal over the harm they say they endured.

While some of these disputes were known, the scale of the fallout has not been previously reported. Business Insider has learned that in 2021, NBCUniversal, CNBC, Comcast, Lemonis, and the show's production company settled for $11 million, with 40 companies that appeared on "The Profit" paid $275,000 each.

Arbitrators and federal judges dismissed several fraud and misconduct claims against Lemonis. In two cases, NBCUniversal, Lemonis, and their affiliated companies secured more than $20 million in judgments, loan repayments, and legal fee awards after lawsuits filed by companies that appeared on the show went to arbitration.

Business owners have accused Lemonis and NBCUniversal of aggressive tactics, broken promises, loading on debt, and deals that unraveled after filming. Business Insider interviewed more than a dozen people involved with the show and reviewed thousands of pages of court records, correspondence, and confidential settlement documents.

Lemonis and NBCUniversal have denied the allegations, saying the CEO was only trying to help companies already in trouble. In court and public statements, they've argued they disclosed key risks of appearing on the show.

In an interview with Business Insider, Lemonis said he had won "any claim that was ever brought against me."

"I know I didn't do anything wrong. I have a clean conscience. I sleep at night very well," Lemonis said. He declined to discuss the settlement agreement and didn't respond to subsequent follow-up questions.

"The only money that I could ever think of that got spent was mine," Lemonis said. "And the amount of money that I ever got out of the businesses ‚Äî including loans, interest, in any business of any kind ‚Äî this isn't specific to any business ‚Äî was zero."

Now, Fox has brought Lemonis back to the air with a familiar concept. Fox declined to comment.

Lemonis, 51, got his start selling cars and hustling RVs, snapping up dealerships in the early 2000s that he rolled into a national chain. He became the CEO of Camping World in 2006 and took the RV giant public a decade later. As his profile grew, he styled himself as a sharp-tongued, blue-collar mogul ‚Äî part businessman, part showman. In 2024, he took over as executive chairman of Beyond, Inc., the parent company of Bed Bath & Beyond, shortly after the home goods brand declared bankruptcy. He was appointed principal executive officer a year later.

"The Profit" first aired in July 2013, part of an attempt by CNBC ‚Äî NBCUniversal's business news channel ‚Äî to find programming for the after-market hours.

The idea was simple. Lemonis promised to invest his money, often in exchange for an ownership stake, to help revamp small businesses across the country. He would negotiate on-air, handshake agreements with business owners and declare himself "100% in charge" before implementing a slew of changes. If owners expressed doubt, Lemonis and producers told them to "trust the process," business owners alleged in legal and mediation records.

The show took off on social media and, within three years, CNBC said it was its most-watched original series telecast with 1.9 million viewers.

In early 2021, Gerard Fox, a Los Angeles-based litigator with a background in high-profile commercial and entertainment law, sent a series of letters to lawyers at Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal. The letters, which have been reviewed by Business Insider and have never previously been reported on, were put together on behalf of dozens of participants on "The Profit," detailing what they described as their negative experiences with the show.

After Fox sent his letters, both sides entered into mediation, according to one person involved, heading off potential litigation by many of the businesses. The settlement agreement was signed by senior executives at Comcast, NBCUniversal, CNBC, Lemonis, and the production company, and included non-disparagement clauses for the companies involved and a reciprocal confidentiality clause. Parties on both sides of the settlement denied wrongdoing.

One of the small business owners said they took the money because they feared that otherwise, "NBC and Lemonis will throw $millions at us and in the end squash us," according to emails among business owners discussing the settlement.

Gerard Fox declined to comment for this story. After a lawsuit he filed on behalf of another business that appeared on the show was dismissed in federal court, a judge sanctioned Fox, saying she was misled about the terms of that dismissal.

"The goal of 'The Profit' was to help participants find a path to success for businesses that were often close to failure," a CNBC spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. "While some did not succeed, the show aimed to help businesses get to profitability and shine a light on the challenges that face small business owners across the country."

In a document prepared for the mediation, the network said it had no role in the deals between Lemonis and the businesses, and that it wasn't responsible for how those deals turned out.

Many business owners declined to comment, with some citing contracts they signed prior to filming that stipulated heavy fines for speaking about the show.

In 2023, NBCUniversal and the production company settled with five more businesses, which were represented by the law firm Quinn Emanuel, according to court documents. That same year, NBCUniversal also settled with the owners of an Illinois marina company who claimed that their business was disparaged on the show. Lemonis was not a party to these settlements.

Stephen Marmer, a psychiatrist who has taught at UCLA's School of Medicine, was hired by the attorney Fox on behalf of the companies for the settlement discussions. Marmer wrote in a report how, after interviewing 48 of the business owners or their family members, many described damage to their confidence or self-trust, humiliation in front of vendors or staff, or alienation from family members and business partners.

At least five people said they had been suicidal or engaged in suicidal ideation, according to the report.

"If the narratives presented in these interviews reflect what actually happened to those whom I interviewed, I can see how they were injured and how and why their symptoms arose," Marmer concluded. "Most of them will need ongoing treatment to recover from the PTSD and gaslighting they experienced."

"I was surprised that CNBC stuck with him as long as they did," said Dan Isenhart, a longtime employee at the Southern California wine shop Amazing Grapes, which filed for bankruptcy three years after appearing on the show and was not part of the settlement. "He caused a lot of heartache for a lot of people."

For some companies, appearing on "The Profit" was a boon. Mike Anderson said revenue for his and his brother's business, now focused on screen printing, is 10 times what it was when they filmed their show. "It's a night-and-day difference," Anderson said.

Another business owner, Ana Quincoces, said her ongoing relationship with Lemonis has been fruitful, including work he directed her way. The two considered opening a restaurant together, she said. Quincoces added that her prior experience with reality TV ‚Äî she appeared on "The Real Housewives of Miami" ‚Äî may have better prepared her for the experience.

Not all feel the same.

By 2021, Steve Weissmann's business, Tumbleweed Tiny House, was bankrupt, embroiled in litigation it would ultimately lose, and millions of dollars in debt to Lemonis.

In 2017, when Weissmann appeared on "The Profit," he described his business in court documents as successful, making millions in revenue, and meeting with potential investors. "We were growing at 60 percent compound annual growth rates, which is very successful growth," he told Business Insider. "But we were losing money as we grew too fast."

He said that he initially applied to be on the show because he was impressed by Lemonis's reputation as a business guru.

On the first day of filming, Lemonis expressed concern at the way Weissmann accounted for customer deposits, Weissmann said.

When Weissmann asked Lemonis what the future of the company looked like to him, Lemonis responded, "You not going to jail," according to a transcript from the taping.

When he went home after filming, Weissmann said he held his wife while they cried, and she vomited. Weissmann, who said that his accounting was above board, said he decided to take the deal offered on-air or risk being called a criminal on TV. The footage never aired.

What did make it to air was Weissmann telling Lemonis, "I'm running on the edge." They ultimately verbally agreed to a deal that involved Lemonis loaning $3 million to the business in exchange for 75% ownership. It also involved a radical change to Tumbleweed's business model. Lemonis told Weissmann to move Tumbleweed away from custom builds and toward standard units.

Weissmann told Business Insider he questioned the move ‚Äî most customers preferred custom models, he said ‚Äî but agreed.

According to statements in court filings, after the episode aired, Lemonis eventually stopped responding, and Tumbleweed was left with excess inventory from the production of standard units. After months of turning down orders for custom homes, Tumbleweed started to run out of cash, according to statements in court documents. Along the way, Tumbleweed also took on loans of around $2.8 million from a Lemonis company to stay afloat.

Less than three years after appearing on "The Profit," in 2020, Tumbleweed filed for bankruptcy, which Weissmann called "devastating." He said he wasn't involved in the $11 million settlement because he was already involved in these proceedings.

A Lemonis company sued Weissmann a year later, seeking the nearly $3 million in principal and interest on loans made to Tumbleweed, for which Weissmann was a guarantor. Lemonis' lawyers argued that the bankruptcy filing had triggered an immediate obligation to pay back the money.

Weissmann responded by filing a counterclaim and then a lawsuit against NBCUniversal, Lemonis, the production company, alleging fraud and breaches of fiduciary duty, among other claims.

The case went to arbitration, as required by the show's participation contract. An arbitrator sided with the defendants, writing "the weight of the evidence shows that Lemonis was attempting to 'save' Tumbleweed, not have it fail, even if he did not ultimately succeed."

In early July, a judge confirmed a $14.4 million arbitration award to NBCUniversal, Lemonis, Camping World, and the production company against Weissmann and Tumbleweed, including $7.7 million in attorney fees.

Lemonis and NBCUniversal secured another win in 2023. An arbitrator awarded $7.1 million, including more than $6 million in attorney fees, to NBCUniversal, the production company, and Camping World after the trustee of the bankrupt design firm Precise Graphix lost in arbitration. The arbitrator cited "the complete failure of competent, credible evidence" to support the trustee's allegations, which included fraud and breach of contract.

Other business owners allege that Lemonis took advantage of companies he pledged to help, according to interviews and legal records reviewed by Business Insider. Many of the allegations of exploitative business practices were also detailed in a 2018 Inc. Magazine article.

In one 2016 lawsuit, the owners of a Pennsylvania-based restaurant franchise, My Big Fat Greek Gyro, said they applied in hopes of expanding and selling more franchises. While filming, the lawsuit said, they agreed to a deal with Lemonis for $350,000 in exchange for a 55% stake in the business.

Once the cameras were off, the lawsuit alleged, the owners were told to return the check they received from Lemonis, and that it was just a "prop" for the show. The owners claimed that they never received the money, and that Lemonis used the promised funds for renovations, changed the businesses' name to The Simple Greek, while ultimately "freezing" them out of their business after establishing a new LLC that was owned by a Lemonis company.

"Prior to the show, we were collectively making about $160,000 a year," one owner said in a 2022 deposition. "Eighteen months into the show, we had no income."

The lawsuit, which alleged, among other things, fraud, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty, is ongoing in state court. Lawyers for Lemonis have called the claims "baseless," arguing he invested millions of dollars to try to "salvage plaintiffs' floundering business," and allegations of misconduct were, in reality, Lemonis "operating the business pursuant to his undisputed decision-making powers as the controlling owner of The Simple Greek."

In a 2020 lawsuit filed by the New York company Bowery Kitchen Supplies, the owner alleged that after agreeing to an on-air deal for $350,000 in exchange for 33% of the business, a producer took back the "prop" check.

Like the Greek restaurant owners, he alleged that he never received the promised funding, and that Lemonis made drastic changes to the business, including liquidating hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of inventory and shutting down the store for costly renovations, leaving the business deep in debt. The case was later dismissed as part of the 2021 settlement.

At least 10 companies or business owners filed for bankruptcy after appearing on the show, court records show. Another 17 closed down, according to the letters that Fox, the attorney, sent to Comcast.

The 2021 settlement talks were not the first time that participants on the show attempted to notify NBCUniversal about their complaints, according to Fox's letters and other records obtained by Business Insider.

In 2013, a business owner hired an attorney to prevent NBCUniversal from airing their episode, after they said misrepresentations were made during filming, the letters say. The network declined, and the episode came out.

The daughter of a business owner who appeared on the show also said online that her family was humiliated by Lemonis and the production company. The executive producer told her in late 2014 that "CNBC lawyers had seen the post and were not happy," and that she'd be sued by the network if she didn't take it down, the letters said.

That year, the family member of a different business owner wrote to CNBC's president and chairman; NBCUniversal's CEO; and several other network executives. She said the show portrayed her family in a false light and defamed them, according to the letters. In 2015, another owner sent "a detailed letter" to NBCUniversal, "informing them of the fraud and defamation that the show and Lemonis perpetrated on him," according to the letters.

While speaking on the "Shark Tank Podcast" in 2015, Lemonis said that following one of the episodes, he "got emails from the family and aunts and uncles and cousins and how upset they were that I had portrayed them that way."

CNBC aired the show's final episode in September 2021.

Now, as another batch of businesses appear on Fox's "The Fixer," Steve Weissmann says he wishes he'd never said yes to "The Profit."

"We have been diminished in a way that we never deserved to be," Weissmann told Business Insider. "I was on a reality television show and made to look like an idiot."

President Donald Trump isn't saving the SAVE plan.

The Department of Education announced earlier in July that interest charges for student-loan borrowers on the SAVE plan are restarting on August 1 after being paused for a year while the plan was facing legal challenges.

SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden, intended to give borrowers more affordable monthly payments with a shorter timeline to debt relief. The plan was blocked in July 2024, and 8 million enrolled borrowers have been in a forbearance without interest accumulating.

That relief is officially over. The department said that it is restarting interest charges on SAVE accounts to comply with the court order that blocked the plan, although the order did not explicitly provide instructions on handling the interest charges. Interest rates vary depending on when the loan originated. Today's undergraduate direct rate is 6.39%.

Linda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, said in a statement that she recommends borrowers "quickly transition to a legally compliant repayment plan," like income-based repayment, to avoid balance growth.

Business Insider has spoken with dozens of student-loan borrowers grappling with changes to debt relief and repayment in the last year. Share your story by emailing asheffey@businessinsider.com and read more here:

Some Democratic lawmakers previously criticized the interest charge restart and urged the administration to reverse course. On July 14, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Chuck Schumer sent a letter to McMahon saying that the restart is "devastating for millions of American families."

"It defies logic and the law that a months-old preliminary injunction against SAVE, which makes no mention of the interest-free forbearance, requires you to start charging interest to millions of borrowers in forbearance now," they wrote.

The lawmakers also cited a backlog in income-driven repayment plan processing that would make it difficult for borrowers on SAVE to switch to a new plan. While the department said in its press release announcing the interest charges that borrowers who switch to a new plan "can expect quick and timely processing," the department in May reported a backlog of nearly 2 million income-driven repayment applications.

The income-based repayment plan, which the department specifically mentioned as a viable option for SAVE borrowers, is also facing a debt relief processing delay. The department posted on Federal Student Aid that loan forgiveness through IBR plans is paused to update payment counts without providing a timeline for when relief will resume.

For now, borrowers can choose to remain on SAVE while interest accumulates, or they can switch to a new plan and make payments. Due to Trump's spending law, student-loan borrowers will have two repayment options beginning July 2026: a standard repayment plan or a new Repayment Assistance Plan that forgives borrowers' balances after 30 years.

The new plans are less generous than existing ones, including the SAVE plan, which Trump's spending law eliminates.

These changes come amid Trump's broader plans to dismantle the Department of Education. The Supreme Court ruled that the department can proceed with firing nearly 1,400 workers, and limited staff means likely hurdles in carrying out the student-loan repayment overhaul.

Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, said on Wednesday that the Trump administration's tariff policy would saddle the automaker with a $2 billion bill while benefiting its Japanese rivals.

"Our tariff bill is $2 billion, and that's a net number," Farley said in an earnings call. The company had projected a tariff hit of $1.5 billion in its last quarter.

Farley told analysts he expected automakers to adopt a regional rather than globalized approach toward their businesses. In addition to tariffs, Farley said the change was being driven by the rise of electric vehicles and new carbon regulations.

"We increasingly see Europe, North America, and Asia becoming kind of regional businesses with tariff rates that are aligned for those three or four regions," Farley said.

"This is quite a fundamental change," he added.

Representatives for Ford did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Farley said in an interview with Bloomberg on the same day that the Trump administration's reduced tariffs on Japan would give its Asian rivals a "meaningful" cost advantage. Last week, President Donald Trump said the US would lower its tariffs on Japan to 15% from 25%.

The reduced tariffs, lower labour costs, and favorable exchange rates "really advantage their export," Farley said.

A Kentucky-built Ford Escape could cost $5,000 more than a Japanese-made Toyota Rav4, while a Michigan-made Ford Bronco might be undercut by a Toyota 4Runner to the tune of $10,000, Farley added.

Farley told Bloomberg that Ford was working with the Trump administration to "minimize our tariff expense so that we can get more competitive."

"But the bottom line is our plan at Ford is not to compete in those commodity segments," he continued.

This isn't the first time Farley has talked about the challenges Ford faces in the face of a new slate of tariffs. Farley said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this year that Trump's 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico was a "windfall for South Korean and Japanese companies."

"In our guidance, we can handle a couple of weeks of tariffs. If it goes beyond that, obviously, it will be billions and billions of incremental profit headwinds for the company," Farley told the outlet in February.

On Wednesday, Ford's shares fell by nearly 1.6% in after-hours trading. The company's shares are up by 9.8% year to date.

When asked about Farley's remarks, the White House said in a statement to Business Insider that the Trump administration is in "constant touch with the auto industry."

"The administration is simultaneously working with our domestic steel, aluminum, and copper industries to ensure that they can meet the needs of American industry by expanding production right here at home," Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House, said.

"Revitalizing the American auto, steel, aluminum, and copper industries are not mutually exclusive goals," he added.

August 1, 12:00 a.m. ‚Äî This story has been updated with comments from Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House.

On Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy scrambled to calm investor concerns over growth at the company's cloud and AI business.

Wall Street wasn't buying it.

Jassy fielded tough analyst questions about AWS's growth and its position in the AI race. The stock tumbled 7% in after-hours trading, weighed down by disappointing profit guidance and Jassy's vague responses on AI.

During the call, Jassy was asked about rival companies' "significantly faster cloud growth." AWS reported revenue growth of 17%, a far slower rate than Microsoft and Google's cloud businesses.

Jassy said AWS has a much bigger revenue base, which makes comparing growth rates difficult. He also said AWS has better security and functionality than peers, while stressing its "pretty significant" leadership position in cloud market share.

"It's a $123 billion annual revenue run rate business, and it's still early," Jassy said, referring to AWS's annualized sales figure. "It is a very unusual opportunity that we're very bullish about."

The Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak followed up by asking about Wall Street's "narrative right now that AWS is falling behind" in AI, with concern about losing share to competitors.

Jassy launched into a sprawling response, calling the AI market "early" and "top-heavy," dominated by a handful of popular models and apps. He pointed to AWS's lower-cost Trainium AI chip as a potential draw for customers seeking better price performance. He rattled off new agentic tools and developer features and then circled back to familiar territory, comparing today's AI shift to the early days of the original cloud boom, which AWS pioneered.

"Remember 85% to 90% of global IT spend is still on-premises," Jassy said. "If you believe that equation's going to flip, which I do and we do, you have a lot of legacy infrastructure that you've got to move."

Colin Sebastian, a senior research analyst at Baird, told BI that despite AWS's continued growth, the market's reaction was concerning.

"Contrasting with Azure and Google Cloud Platform growth, it's hard to disprove the emerging Wall Street narrative that competitors are gaining ground and momentum from AWS," he said.

During the call, Jassy added that AWS still had capacity issues across electricity, chips, and server components, with power being the "single biggest constraint." He said it would most likely take several quarters to meet the demand shortage.

One encouraging sign for AWS is that its cloud market share has barely budged over the past year. In the second quarter, the top three cloud providers' market share was virtually flat, with AWS at 30%, and Microsoft and Google each holding 20% and 13%, respectively, according to Synergy Research.

Amazon's spokesperson declined to comment.

 Ethereum's 10th anniversary celebration was marked by an uptick in institutional demand for Ether as an alternative treasury reserve asset, prompting Wall Street to look past Bitcoin. 

Ethereum's 10th anniversary was marked by a significant milestone in terms of institutional crypto adoption, as cryptocurrency treasury firms surpassed $100 billion in collective investments on Thursday.

Ethereum's 10th birthday brought renewed corporate interest in Ether (ETH), which saw the 10 largest corporate crypto treasury firms amass over 1% of the total Ether supply since the beginning of June, according to a Tuesday report by Standard Chartered.

The bank predicted that corporations will eventually hold 10% of the total Ether supply, which may see the world's second-largest cryptocurrency surpass the bank's year-end target price of $4,000 per Ether.

Ether's corporate adoption is ‚Äúhappening faster than with Bitcoin during its early treasury adoption phase,‚Äù since Ether enables corporations to tap into staking yields and ‚Äúactively generate value,‚Äù  Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at Brickken asset tokenization platform, told Cointelegraph.

Ethereum celebrated its 10-year anniversary on Wednesday, with renewed institutional momentum fueling hopes that Ether (ETH) could challenge its all-time high set in November 2021.

Over the past decade, Ethereum has become the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) blockchain, with nearly $85 billion in total value locked (TVL) at the time of writing.

Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, circulated an early version of the white paper in 2013. The project raised $18.3 million in its initial coin offering (ICO) and officially launched in 2015 as a blockchain for smart contracts. Its cryptocurrency, Ether, now ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin (BTC).

Here's a look back into Ethereum's first decade, featuring the ICO boom, DeFi summer and the rise and fall of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Corporate cryptocurrency treasuries are emerging as a new class of public companies bridging traditional finance and digital assets, signaling increasing institutional interest in crypto.

Corporate cryptocurrency treasury firms, including Strategy, Metaplanet and SharpLink, have collectively amassed about $100 billion worth of digital assets, according to a Galaxy Research report released Thursday.

Bitcoin (BTC) treasury firms hold the lion's share, with over 791,662 BTC worth about $93 billion on their books, representing 3.98% of the circulating supply. Ether (ETH) treasury firms hold 1.3 million ETH tokens, worth more than $4 billion, representing 1.09% of the Ether supply, the report said.

Corporate buyers are becoming a key source of Ether liquidity alongside US spot ETH exchange-traded funds, which recently posted 19 consecutive days of net inflows, a record for the products.

Since July 3, the Ether ETFs amassed $5.3 billion worth of ETH as part of their record winning streak, Farside Investors data shows.

More corporate buying and continued ETF inflows may help Ether surpass the $4,000 psychological mark, which is also the year-end price target of Standard Chartered, the bank said in a Tuesday research report.

‚ÄúWe think they may eventually end up owning 10% of all ETH, a 10x increase from current holdings,‚Äù the bank said, adding that Ether treasury firms have more growth potential than Bitcoin treasuries, from a ‚Äúregulatory arbitrage perspective.‚Äù

Abu Dhabi-based Bitcoin miner Phoenix Group launched a $150 million strategic cryptocurrency reserve, becoming the first publicly listed company on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) to establish a digital asset treasury.

The company said Thursday the reserve includes 514 Bitcoin (BTC) and 630,000 Solana (SOL), describing it as a long-term holding strategy.

This makes Phoenix Group the first company listed on the ADX to establish a strategic cryptocurrency treasury, the company said in an announcement shared with Cointelegraph.

‚ÄúHolding Bitcoin and other strategic digital assets isn't just about exposure. It's about alignment,‚Äù said Munaf Ali, co-founder and CEO of Phoenix Group. ‚ÄúWe believe in the long-term value these networks represent, and our treasury strategy reflects that belief.‚Äù

Phoenix Group was one of the five most-traded and best-performing stocks on the ADX in the second quarter of 2025 after its share price rose by over 72% from April to June.

Increasingly more Bitcoin mining companies are considering altcoins as part of their balance sheet, signaling more institutional demand for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin.

Publicly listed Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies became the largest Ether (ETH) treasury firm after announcing plans to acquire up to 5% of Ether's supply.

Japanese investment firm Metaplanet is seeking to raise 555 billion yen ($3.73 billion) through a new stock offering to support its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy.

The company, which is known as ‚ÄúAsia's Strategy,‚Äù announced Friday that it will issue perpetual preferred shares to fund its goal of acquiring 210,000 Bitcoin (BTC) by the end of 2027. The shares will offer up to a 6% annual dividend, depending on market conditions and investor demand.

‚ÄúThe Company intends to actively pursue equity financing as part of its ‚ÄòBitcoin Strategy,' which aims to acquire 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúWe believe that introducing Bitcoin-backed preferred shares represents a pioneering effort to fill this gap.‚Äù

Metaplanet's stock offering comes a day after Cointelegraph reported corporate crypto treasury firms had surpassed $100 billion in collective investments, with Bitcoin-focused treasuries amassing $93 billion worth of that value.

Continued corporate accumulation from the likes of Strategy and Metaplanet, paired with the growing money supply, could push Bitcoin's price above $132,000 before the end of 2025 based on Bitcoin's correlation with the global M2 money supply.

Strategy, the world's largest corporate Bitcoin treasury firm, has launched similar capital-raising efforts. On July 22, the firm announced a new type of Bitcoin-backed stock pegged to $100 per share with an initial monthly dividend of 9% annually.

Decentralized finance platform Veda has appointed a former US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official to its ranks as it ramps up efforts to expand crosschain yield products aimed at institutional investors.

TuongVy Le, who spent nearly six years at the SEC as chief counsel and senior adviser in the Enforcement Division and the Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, has joined Veda as general counsel, the company announced Tuesday.

During her SEC tenure, Le advised Congress on early drafts of digital asset legislation and served on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Global Markets Advisory Committee.

According to her LinkedIn profile, Le was involved in some of the SEC's earliest crypto enforcement actions.

She served in the SEC's Enforcement Division from 2016 to 2021, a pivotal period in the agency's crackdown on unregistered securities offerings tied to initial coin offerings (ICOs). 

During that time, the SEC brought actions against the promoters of BitConnect's lending program and against LBRY, alleging both conducted unregistered securities offerings. In 2021, the agency also initiated one of its earliest DeFi-related enforcement actions, charging Blockchain Credit Partners with securities fraud.

Introduction

On July 31, 2025, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins delivered a major policy address at the America First Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., unveiling ‚ÄúProject Crypto‚Äù‚Äîa Commission-wide initiative to modernize securities regulation in support of President Trump's vision of the United States as the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the world.‚Äù Framing the moment as a defining opportunity for American leadership in digital finance, Atkins outlined a regulatory agenda focused on integrating ‚Äúon-chain‚Äù (on blockchain technology) software systems into US markets, enabling decentralized finance, and launching a new ‚Äúinnovation exemption‚Äù to accelerate the commercial deployment of novel technologies. His remarks signal a significant shift toward a more flexible regulatory posture that could shape the future of the US digital asset market for years to come.

American Leadership in the Age of Digital Finance

To secure US leadership in the digital finance era, Atkins unveiled Project Crypto as a Commission-wide initiative to modernize securities rules and regulations to enable America's financial markets to move on-chain. Atkins highlighted the GENIUS Act and Congress's ongoing efforts to pass market structure legislation and described the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets (PWG) Report as ‚Äúthe blueprint to make America first in blockchain and crypto technology.‚Äù Rejecting the prior ‚Äúregulation-by-enforcement‚Äù approach, Atkins committed to reshoring crypto businesses and directed Commission staff to:

Encouraging Crypto Asset Distributions to Return to the US

Atkins announced that he has directed SEC staff to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework to bring crypto asset distributions back to the US in order to eliminate reliance on offshore structures and provide legal clarity for innovators. Specifically, he said he instructed SEC staff to:

Atkins emphasized his view that most crypto assets are not securities and that being classified as a security should not be a deterrent to development. He expressed support for crypto asset securities that offer features like voting rights and distributions. Atkins also rejected the need for premature decentralization or offshore structuring and advocated instead for a regulatory environment that encourages innovation and includes American investors.

Choice Among Custodians and Trading Venues

Atkins stressed that market participants must have ‚Äúmaximum choice‚Äù in how they custody and trade crypto assets. He reaffirmed his strong support for self-custody, calling it a ‚Äúcore American value,‚Äù while recognizing that many investors will continue to rely on SEC-registered intermediaries like broker-dealers and investment advisers.

To address this and implement the PWG Report's recommendation to modernize the SEC's custody rules, Atkins directed SEC staff to evaluate how to adapt the existing custody regime to accommodate crypto assets, including through exemptive relief and potential rule changes. He also called for allowing market participants to operate across multiple business lines under the most efficient licensing structure possible and expressed support for regulatory flexibility that protects investors without imposing unnecessary burdens.

Horizontal Integration of Product Offerings

Atkins identified enabling ‚Äúsuper-apps‚Äù as a key priority of his chairmanship. He defined them as platforms that allow securities intermediaries to offer a wide range of services‚Äîincluding trading in crypto asset securities, non-security crypto assets, crypto services (such as asset ‚Äústaking‚Äù), and traditional securities‚Äîunder a single license. He asserted that the federal securities laws do not prohibit SEC-registered venues from listing non-securities today. Accordingly, Atkins directed SEC staff to:

Atkins also called on the SEC and other regulators, consistent with the PWG Report, to streamline licensing structures and avoid duplicative regulatory burdens, emphasizing the importance of regulatory efficiency and competition.

Integrating On-Chain Systems in Securities Markets

Atkins directed SEC staff to update outdated rules and regulations to support the integration of on-chain software systems into US securities markets. He explained that these systems vary in structure‚Äîsome are fully decentralized and operate without intermediaries, while others have identifiable operators. Both models, he emphasized, should be accommodated within the regulatory framework. Atkins stressed the importance of enabling decentralized systems, such as automated market makers, which facilitate non-intermediated financial activity. He noted that while federal securities laws have traditionally assumed the presence of intermediaries, regulation should not impose intermediaries where markets can function without them.

Atkins also stated that the SEC will work to protect pure publishers of software code, clarify the distinction between intermediated and disintermediated activity, and establish practical rules for intermediaries operating on-chain. These systems, he said, should not be stifled by duplicative or unnecessary regulation. Atkins acknowledged that to implement this vision, rule changes may be necessary, including potential amendments to Regulation NMS to accommodate tokenized securities trading.1

Commercial Viability as the Guiding Principle

Atkins concluded by calling for a more flexible regulatory posture that prioritizes commercial viability. He proposed a new ‚Äúinnovation exemption‚Äù to allow novel business models and technologies to enter the market quickly, even if they don't fit neatly within existing SEC rules. This exemption would be principles-based, requiring compliance with core objectives of federal securities laws without imposing rigid or incompatible requirements.

Atkins suggested that conditions under the exemption could include periodic reporting, use of whitelisting or ‚Äúverified pool‚Äù functionality‚Äîwhich restrict transactions to pre-approved, compliant participants‚Äîand limitations on tokenized securities that do not comply with standards like ERC-3643, which embeds features such as identity verification and transfer restrictions. He emphasized that both SEC staff and market participants should evaluate new models with an eye toward practical implementation and market readiness.

Conclusion

Atkins's speech marks a major shift in the SEC's approach to digital assets. With the launch of ‚ÄúProject Crypto,‚Äù the Commission is moving toward a proactive regulatory framework aimed at making the US a global leader in blockchain finance. While guidance, rulemaking and the ‚Äúinnovation exemption‚Äù are still underway, a federal pathway for the blockchain industry is becoming apparent. Market participants should actively monitor key developments (including the GENIUS Act, the PWG Report, and market structure legislation), consider engaging directly with the Crypto Task Force, and review their business structure, products, and compliance programs to position themselves for this new regulatory framework.2

Tyler Winklevoss, the CEO of crypto exchange Gemini, is at the center of a rift over support of President Donald Trump's nominee to run the obscure-but-highly-relevant regulatory agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.



He thinks former CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz is a bad choice, and he's been talking with officials from the Trump administration about it, he told CoinDesk in an interview. That coincides with the White House slamming the brakes on a necessary step in Quintenz's confirmation process in the Senate.



The administration didn't give the Senate Agriculture Committee a full explanation when it halted Quintenz's committee vote this week that would have advanced his approval to a final Senate floor vote. And the White House didn't immediately respond to questions from CoinDesk about what's getting in the way of the nominee, who until recently served as the regulatory chief for a16z crypto and is on the board of prediction-markets firm Kalshi, though the White House has reportedly continued to back the nomination.



"Many in our industry have significant concerns about this nomination," Winklevoss told CoinDesk. "Mr. Quintenz is not aligned with the president's stated agenda and objectives."

Winklevoss and his twin brother, Cameron, fellow co-founder of Gemini and other shared business interests, are among the prominent crypto insiders who've occupied a front seat ‚Äî literally ‚Äî in the White House's recent campaign to elevate the U.S. digital assets industry. When Trump hosted a White House crypto summit, the brothers were seated among the primary guests. And when the president signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law, they were sitting in the front row beside other prominent figures, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Tether CEO Paulo Ardoino.

Trump even mentioned the brothers in his remarks about the first big crypto legislative win. So they've come to occupy a prominent place in the president's view of the crypto industry, raising questions about whether Gemini can get Quintenz booted from consideration.



At this late stage in the confirmation process, a significant delay or starting over could weigh on the industry's policy priorities. While the CFTC may largely be invisible to the U.S. public, its importance for the crypto space has been sharply rising as lawmakers in Congress get closer to passing legislation that would set up crypto markets regulation in the U.S. But Tyler Winklevoss argued it would be a mistake to put Quintenz in charge.



The Gemini CEO contends that Quintenz has the wrong views on protecting developers, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), federal spending and is raising ethical red flags with reported communications he's made on behalf of the company he serves as a board member, Kalshi.





"Quintenz supports prosecuting smart contract developers," Winklevoss said, calling it a "disqualifying position."

"Smart contract developers need to be protected in order for innovation to flourish and to realize President Trump's vision of making America the crypto capital of the world," he said.

In October 2018, then-Commissioner Quintenz gave a speech on smart contracts, saying that a developer should potentially be seen as legally liable if they could recognize their work would be used to skirt government regulations. With Roman Storm, a developer behind Tornado Cash, currently awaiting his jury verdict in a U.S. criminal trial, the question of a software developer's liability is at the forefront.



The industry has a strong take on this matter, arguing that creators shouldn't be punished for how their creations are used. In much the same way that manufacturers of cars and firearms communication technologies aren't pursued by criminal prosecution for how their products are used by bad actors, the sector argues that digital assets innovators similarly shouldn't be on the hook for how their platforms and tools are utilized downstream, as long as the products are not actively managed by those who wrote the code.



The industry position seems to fall in line with a speech Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins gave on Thursday to announce his agency's "Project Crypto," in which one of its effort will be "protecting pure publishers of software code."





In his objections to Quintenz, Winklevoss also flagged recent reports on the former commissioner's communications with the CFTC as a private citizen, as he allegedly sought information on the competitors to prediction market platform Kalshi, where he serves on the board of directors.

Winklevoss said recent revelations of emails sought under the Freedom of Information Act, in which Quintenz and an associate seem to have requested insight into the agency's work and deliberations on Kalshi rivals, "raise serious questions."

The CFTC has waged a longstanding battle over regulation of the prediction markets. The position of the previous leadership under Chairman Rostin Behnam was that the activity should be regulated as gambling, and he had concerns over the agency policing political elections ‚Äî one of the high-profile arenas of prediction betting. Behnam's agency fought the industry in court, including Kalshi, though it recently abandoned that dispute.



While CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline Pham has argued the agency took the wrong path, she said it's difficult to reverse its position on event contracts, which she characterized as "a sinkhole of legal uncertainty and an inappropriate constraint on the new administration."

Winklevoss also raised issue with Quintenz's remarks on the likely need of more money and resources at the CFTC as it takes on oversight of a swath of U.S. crypto activity.



"The Trump Administration wants to cut red tape and deregulate," Winklevoss said. "This nominee continues to advocate for dramatically increasing budgets and overregulation that will lead to regulatory capture."



In his Senate confirmation hearing, Quintenz suggested a significant budget boost will probably be needed if the CFTC is eventually tasked as the leading federal regulator for the crypto markets.



However, the question of funding has long been central to discussions on crypto legislation to overhaul CFTC authority. Republicans have routinely acknowledged that the agency is likely to seek more resources to allow it to oversee a broad new area of the financial sector and ‚Äî for the first time ‚Äî actively regulate a spot market, meaning a market where actual assets are traded, such as bitcoin BTC$114,887.46.



When asked about it in a CoinDesk TV interview this week, top Trump crypto adviser Bo Hines granted that the agency may need more resources.



"Congress is well aware that the CFTC might require some additional labor, but I think that's something that we can easily get done through legislation," Hines said.





The Gemini co-founder also interpreted some of Quintenz's past comments on central-bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as being open to discussion on a U.S. version ‚Äî a possibility that's treated as toxic by Republican politicians and most of the crypto industry. But Quintenz's remarks in 2020 were relatively superficial, suggesting that it'd be important that the CFTC "stays abreast of legal and regulatory questions" around the government tokens, which he described in public remarks as an "area of particular interest to me."



Even an interest should be disqualifying, Winklevoss contends.



"You should not be interested in CBDCs or entertaining that kind of totalitarian technology," he said. "That in itself is disqualifying and against everything our industry stands for."



From congressional candidates up to Trump, Republican lawmakers have painted the concept of CBDCs as a government campaign to seek control and surveillance over citizens' finances. But the idea never progressed further than a discussion point with some Democratic lawmakers and a topic of technical study among regulators and has never risen to an active project in the U.S., as China and Europe moved to implement government-backed digital currencies.

Federal Reserve officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, had routinely said they wouldn't act without Congress and the White House, and if the central bank were ever to issue a digital dollar, the officials said transactions should be managed by U.S. banks and not the government.





The pause in Quintenz's confirmation process has thrown up some significant questions about the future leadership of the CFTC. The five-member commission currently has only two members ‚Äî one from each party ‚Äî and both of them have said they're leaving soon. That could potentially leave a freshly confirmed chairman alone atop the agency.



But if Quintenz's nomination is abandoned or significantly delayed, people familiar with Acting Chairman Pham's plans suggest she's eager to move on, potentially in the coming weeks. If she can't stay to chair the commission, it raises questions about what happens next ‚Äî whether President Trump would be under pressure to shove the Democratic commissioner, Kristin Johnson, out of the CFTC, so the agency wouldn't be taken over by a Democrat's agenda, and how long the CFTC may be without an official chairman.



The Senate is heading into its August recess, leaving its Washington work behind for a while. Even if things get back on track, his final confirmation vote by the overall Senate could be further delayed.



If Quintenz does continue through the process and become chairman, some legal experts have cast doubt on the strength of policymaking from a single commissioner on what's meant to be a five-member group.



"I think when looking at the quorum rules, the agency can still act," former CFTC Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero told CoinDesk TV in a Thursday interview with Jennifer Sanasie. "But is that the best way to act?"



She suggested the potential investors in the space ‚Äî including from traditional financial institutions ‚Äî "they are all going to want some certainty." And that can be provided, she said, by the White House nominating more names and getting a full commission confirmed by the Senate, "but we haven't seen that, yet."



When questioned about the value of having both parties represented on the commission during his confirmation hearing, Quintenz declined to second-guess Trump's nomination process.



"The president is the head of the executive, and the president will make his own decisions," he said.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

Even as crypto finds growing traction on Wall Street and among retail investors, few people regard the blockchain technology that powers it as useful or relevant to their day-to-day lives. A crypto startup called Subzero Labs wants to change this, and it plans to launch its own blockchain designed for use beyond just speculation.

‚ÄúWe're doing something for the real-world users,‚Äù Ade Adepoju, cofounder and CEO of Subzero Labs, told Fortune.





The startup announced Friday that it had raised $20 million in a seed round led by the crypto investment firm Pantera Capital. Other participants included the crypto venture capital company Variant, the venture arm of Coinbase, and the crypto desk of the high-frequency trading firm Susquehanna.





Adepoju declined to detail his startup's valuation. The deal, which closed in the first quarter of the year, was for equity and token warrants, or allocations of a yet-to-be-released cryptocurrency, he said. 





Adepoju, who is 30 years old and lives in New York City, is a longtime engineer. Early in his career, he worked at the chipmaker AMD, moved over to the laptop giant Dell, and then got a job at the streaming titan Netflix. In 2021, he decided to take the plunge into crypto when he joined the startup Mysten Labs as an engineer.




Founded by former Meta developers, Mysten Labs is one of the main companies behind the Sui blockchain, whose tech stems from Mark Zuckerberg's failed attempt to launch his own stablecoin. Adepoju helped build Sui from conception to launch, but, in early 2024, he took a career break. ‚ÄúI wanted to take a step back and observe what it meant to make a network actually successful,‚Äù he said.





As he pondered his next move, he linked up with his cofounder Lu Zhang, also a former employee of Mysten Labs, and decided to get into the business of launching his own blockchain. Together, the two created Subzero Labs, which currently has 20 employees.





Some might argue that, at a time when there are dozens of active blockchain projects, the world is not exactly clamoring for another one. In response, Adepoju argues that none are good enough yet to run real-world applications. ‚ÄúWhen you actually ask, ‚Äòdo we need another one?' it's like asking, ‚Äòdo we need another iPod?'‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo, we don't, but we definitely need an iPhone.‚Äù





He's hoping his new blockchain, dubbed Rialo, will be that iPhone. An acronym, Rialo stands for ‚ÄúRialo isn't a layer 1.‚Äù Layer-1 blockchains are like Ethereum, which is a decentralized network of servers that processes and stores data. Layer 2s are blockchains built on top of layer-1 blockchains.





Adepoju says Rialo isn't a layer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In fact, he's reluctant to compare it to any existing crypto products. He does say the blockchain is designed for non-crypto developers and that it allows engineers to replicate tools usually implemented outside a blockchain. These include the ability to access information, like a FICO score, elsewhere on the internet without the need of an oracle, or outside data provider.




‚ÄúCameras used to ship with laptops. They used to be separate,‚Äù he said, referring to external video cameras people used to connect to their computers in the early 2000s. ‚ÄúThey got bundled. These things happen with every technology.‚Äù

Oops, something went wrong

Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) executive chairman Michael Saylor has doubled down on the company's Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) Bitcoin acquisition strategy.

What Happened: Speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Friday, Saylor emphasized that Bitcoin is "digital capital" and highlighted that Strategy's business model revolves around acquiring BTC and issuing structured credit products ‚Äî including preferred stock, backed by it.

He dismissed concerns about the size of Strategy's position, arguing that owning even up to 7% of the total Bitcoin supply is not excessive, especially for a public company leading the way in digital asset treasury management.

Strategy now holds 628,791 BTC, or roughly 3% of Bitcoin's total fixed supply, valued far above acquisition levels.

Saylor underlined the firm's disciplined, long-term BTC accumulation strategy.

He forecasted that Bitcoin could deliver a 30% annual return over the next 20 years, outpacing traditional assets.

"We don't want to own all the Bitcoin, we're just part of the first wave," Saylor said, referencing over 160 public companies now integrating BTC into their balance sheets.

Saylor further argued that once regulation catches up, even tech giants like Apple and Microsoft will opt to hold Bitcoin over fiat, treasuries or gold.

When asked about his signature orange tie, Saylor quipped, "The future is orange, Joe."

Why It Matters: Strategy just reported its strongest quarterly profit ever, bolstered by Bitcoin's rally and growing investor interest in BTC-backed structured products.

Its latest offering, a $2.5 billion issue of Bitcoin-linked securities, is the largest IPO of 2025 so far, showing deep market demand.

The company also launched product lines like "Strike" and "Stretch", designed to cater to various investor risk profiles, from leveraged Bitcoin equity to principal-protected, yield-generating instruments.

For Q2, Strategy posted $114.49 million in revenue, exceeding forecasts of $112.96 million, for a year-over-year growth of 2.7% and a BTC yield of 19.7%.

A DIVIDED federal appeals court has overturned the fraud conviction of a former product manager at OpenSea, the world's largest marketplace for non-fungible tokens, in what prosecutors called the first insider trading case involving digital assets.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan agreed with Nathaniel Chastain that erroneous jury instructions could have led to his conviction merely for acting unethically, by misusing information that had no real value to his employer.

London, United Kingdom, August 1st, 2025, Chainwire



Powered by $HAMIE tokenomics and Abstract Chain, the game marks a major step in the platform's mission to transform digital culture.

The Hamieverse, a purpose-driven Web3 ecosystem combining gaming, AI mentorship, and immersive storytelling, announced today the development of its first on-chain game, to be built on Abstract Chain. The new game represents a major milestone in Hamieverse's mission to fuse entertainment with self-development and real-world impact.

The upcoming title is designed to merge immersive storytelling with blockchain-powered gameplay, drawing from the rich lore of the Hamieverse comic series and forthcoming novel. Built on Abstract Chain, the game leverages the platform's robust front-end and back-end capabilities to deliver a seamless user experience.

‚ÄúEvery day, billions run in circles chasing progress that never comes. Buried in debt, drained by meaningless jobs, and starved of purpose, we've accepted the trap. Hamie was born to shatter it,‚Äù said Mateen Mohammed, the Hamieverse's founder.

Purpose-Driven Gaming in Web3

In contrast to many blockchain games criticized for unbalanced mechanics, the Hamieverse is committed to fair, skill-based systems that reward strategy, learning, and consistent engagement.

Each gameplay element connects to a four-stage philosophical framework representing personal transformation and the Hamieverse's ethos:

To support this journey, Hamie AI functions as a personal digital mentor, offering mindset support, tailored insights, and behavioral tools to accelerate progress.

Built on Abstract Chain

The decision to build on Abstract Chain was guided by a shared belief that solving blockchain's user experience problem will finally bring mass adoption. ‚ÄúWe chose Abstract because it aligns perfectly with both our vision and our standards,‚Äù said the Hamieverse founder. ‚ÄúOur goal is to create meaningful, engaging, and accessible experiences. Abstract's tech stack allows us to onboard Web2 without friction or pain points. We're not just launching on a blockchain, we're aligning with a movement.‚Äù

Tokenomics Designed for Integrity

The Hamieverse ecosystem will be powered by the $HAMIE token, with a model intentionally designed to prioritize contribution over speculation. Features include:

August Launches and Real-World Impact

Meanwhile, the Hamieverse Foundation has broken ground on its most ambitious mission yet: a solar-powered deepwater well in rural Africa, bringing sustainable clean water to over 2,000 people. This project exemplifies the belief that digital culture can produce real-world positive impact.

‚ÄúI was drawn to the blockchain space over eight years ago, inspired by a groundbreaking technology that promised to reshape the world for the better,‚Äù said the Hamieverse founder. ‚ÄúIt spoke of decentralizing power, enabling radical transparency, resisting censorship, and banking the unbanked. But by 2024, much of the mindshare had shifted to the trenches, which became the Wild West for bad actors exploiting retail. Hope began to fade. So I set out to build something fundamentally different, rooted in real utility, unshakable transparency, real-world impact, and technology designed to empower self-development. It all began with one image: a hamster spinning endlessly on a wheel. It's the best metaphor for modern life.‚Äù

DraftKings Inc., the leading sports betting company, has officially received final court approval for its $10 million settlement with NFT buyers, marking the resolution of a legal dispute surrounding allegations that its nonfungible tokens (NFTs) violated securities laws.

In a ruling issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Denise J. Casper of the District of Massachusetts granted final approval of the deal, stating it is ‚Äúin all respects, fair, reasonable, and adequate to the settlement class.‚Äù The approval brings closure to a case filed by lead plaintiff Justin Dufoe, who alleged that DraftKings' NFTs constituted unregistered securities and led to financial losses for purchasers.

Under the DraftKings $10M deal NFT buyers final approval settlement, approximately 26% of the midpoint of estimated damages‚Äîranging between $18 million and $58 million‚Äîwill be recovered by eligible class members.

The court also approved attorney fees totaling over $3.33 million, along with nearly $53,000 for litigation expenses. Dufoe was awarded a $50,000 service award in recognition of his role in the case.

Filed in early 2023, the lawsuit claimed DraftKings' NFT drops gave purchasers a reasonable expectation of profits, based on the company's continued control of the platform and marketplace. Plaintiffs contended that the inability to move NFTs off the DraftKings platform left them entirely reliant on the company's management‚Äîmeeting the criteria of the Howey Test, which determines whether a product qualifies as a security.

While DraftKings sought to dismiss the suit, arguing the NFTs did not meet the definition of securities, Judge Casper denied the motion in July 2024, allowing the case to proceed and ultimately leading to this settlement.

Attorneys representing the NFT buyers included firms Berman Tabacco, Kirby McInerney LLP, Hannafan & Hannafan Ltd., and G. Dowd Law LLC. DraftKings was represented by WilmerHale and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP.

The Information Commissioner's Office has issued guidance to help organisations disclose documents securely after serious data breaches, including at the Ministry of Defence.

The regulator said the new guidance is its ‚Äúmost comprehensive resource on avoiding accidental data breaches when disclosing documents to the public, replacing an advisory note issued in the immediate aftermath of high-profile data breaches in 2023‚Äù.

The ICO also said it is engaging directly with key stakeholders, including the UK and devolved governments, to increase visibility of the guidance amongst those who need it.

Emily Keaney, deputy commissioner at the ICO, said: ‚ÄúWe have seen a number of serious data breaches, including at the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Ministry of Defence, which have involved documents being disclosed without proper checks for hidden personal information ‚Äì this crucial step cannot be missed.

‚ÄúAll organisations must have robust measures in place to protect the personal information they hold and prevent it from being inadvertently disclosed. We are committed to providing clear guidance to help organisations get this right, reducing the margin for mistakes and making it second nature to check documents for hidden personal information.‚Äù

In 2023, the ICO took action against the MoD for its poor handling of sensitive information in relation to the evacuation from Afghanistan. It fined the MoD ¬£350,000 for a 2021 email related to the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy programme, in which hundreds of Afghans eligible for evacuation were identified to each other by the sender using the ‚Äúcc‚Äù rather than the ‚Äúbcc‚Äù field.

More recently, it was revealed that an MoD employee accidentally shared the data of more than 18,000 Afghans seeking relocation to the UK through the ARAP scheme.

In a blog published earlier this month, information commissioner John Edwards said the root cause of the error was "the emailing of a spreadsheet containing hidden data that was not evident to the individual sending it".

"We understand that person thought they were sending a limited data set to an external party for a legitimate operational reason under the pressures of a military operation," he said. "A much greater data set was inadvertently shared, a section of which eventually ended up online.‚Äù

Edwards said inadvertently sharing data in this way ‚Äúis not a new or novel issue‚Äù but is one that organisations ‚Äúmust guard against because the consequences, as in this case, can be severe.

‚ÄúFor many years, the ICO has identified and communicated the risks associated with storing and transmitting data in spreadsheets through guidance, commentary, advice, and in enforcement decisions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust last year we fined the Police Service of Northern Ireland ¬£750,000 for sending a spreadsheet to a public facing website in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.‚Äù

The ICO chose not to issue a fine in this case. Edwards explained that the ICO had "applied considerable resource" over the last two years to understand what happened, how it happened and what the MoD was doing to ensure it would not happen again.

He said the ICO "determined that there was little we could add in this case that would justify the further allocation of resource away from other priorities.

"In making that call, we have not lost sight of the fact the MoD undoubtedly got things wrong, and the consequences have been serious," he added. "Organisations must do better to ensure mistakes like this don't happen and understand the serious implications to people's lives if they get it wrong.

"We recognise that there are issues of public confidence and accountability, and that we possess specific skills which other accountability bodies might wish to call on in order to gain the reassurance of a formal investigation. We remain willing to have those conversations with relevant stakeholders."

From handling Freedom of Information requests to responding to Subject Access Requests, public bodies regularly need to disclose documents containing large amounts of information to the public.

Personal information can be hidden or not immediately visible in documents, and if they are not checked properly, it may be disclosed by accident ‚Äì sometimes with serious consequences.

The new guidance contains practical steps and how-to videos to help organisations understand how to check documents, including spreadsheets, for hidden personal information and reduce the risk of a data breach.

It includes simple checklists and how-to videos, covering topics such as:

While the guidance is designed to support organisations with disclosing documents to the public, the ICO said the practical advice "will also help all organisations avoid accidental data breaches in any situation where they are disclosing or sharing documents".

Ethena's synthetic stablecoin, USDe, has crossed $8.4 billion in supply, adding more than $3.14 billion over 20 days in a surge that outpaced flows into BlackRock's (BLK) flagship bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds.



According to on-chain data curated by the Ethena community, the supply increase since July 17 is the fastest period of growth since the protocol's inception in February 2024. 

Inflow into the yield-bearing stablecoin exceeds the $2.75 billion added to BlackRock's ether ETF (ETHA) and the $1.60 billion into its bitcoin ETF (IBIT) in the same period, making the DeFi-native stablecoin the biggest magnet for capital across both on- and off-chain markets in recent weeks.

The rally has spilled over into Ethena's governance token ENA, which more than doubled in the past month, though it is down 12% in the past 24 hours as traders hope the long-awaited fee switch will soon activate.

The protocol has already surpassed most of the thresholds required to distribute revenue to staked ENA holders, with the final benchmark, a favorable yield spread versus rivals, expected to be met soon.

USDe's reflexive loop

USDe's recent growth reflects a powerful reflexive loop built into its core design, as Nansen explained in a recent research report on the Ethena ecosystem.

As bitcoin and ether prices rally, perpetual funding rates in turn increasingly positive. Ethena captures this funding via delta-neutral hedges, and distributes it as real-time yield to sUSDe holders.

That higher yield then draws in more users, leading to greater USDe issuance, more hedging, and more protocol revenue.

In the last month, Ethena has brought in nearly $50 million in feed and $10 million in revenue, according to DeFiLlama data. This makes it the sixth best-performing protocol for monthly fee revenue according to the data aggregator.

ENA is currently trading for $0.58.

The Pakistan government has recently made another crucial decision to induct crypto into the country's mainstream financial sector. As per the latest reports, the Pakistani authorities are planning to increase the crypto incorporation by commencing official adoption in banking, gold trading, and forex operations.

This development highlights the country says welcome to Web3 technologies in a bold move to bolster its economic status.  This initiative is anticipated to be highly impactful as the country will also allow financial institutions to legally offer crypto services by providing them with licenses.

In this respect, the Pakistan Crypto Council's (PCC) CEO, Bilal Bin Saqib, who is also the 0Prime Minister's Special Assistant on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, shared exclusive thoughts on this development. He mentioned that the Pakistan is moving toward the future of finance. He added that the crypto assets are the currencies that will work in the cutting-edge financial world.

Hence, this move is focused on commencing Pakistan's exclusive epoch of financial sovereignty. Saqib also mentioned that Pakistan plans to gear up for a transparent and secure digital currency ecosystem. Thus, rather than just experimenting, the authorities are laying a robust groundwork to carry out the wider economic shift.

In line with the statement of Saqib, establishing a unique and flawless crypto framework to incorporate crypto assets will be a significant step toward a broader change in the worldwide economy. Apart from that, Jameel Ahmed, the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), also announced a notable development. Thus, he confirmed the start of a pilot project for digital currencies, parallel to the drafting of legislation to regulate virtual assets.

Keeping this in view, the Financial Division, the PCC, and SBP are jointly working on a thorough legal and regulatory framework to back the rollout. As they acknowledge, yeah, there is considerable volatility in this sector, but at the same time, they aim for the unmatched potential of this new financial network. Additionally, this initiative serves as a groundbreaking development for the mates in the business community who have long been chatting about such a possibility to grow their portfolios.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has published new guidance to help organisations disclose documents securely following a number of serious data breaches, including at the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).

The ICO's guidance includes practical steps and how-to videos to help organisations understand how to check documents, including spreadsheets, for hidden personal information and reduce the risk of a data breach, particularly in Freedom of Information (FoI) requests.

‚ÄúPersonal information can be hidden or not immediately visible in documents. If they are not checked properly, it may be disclosed by accident ‚Äì sometimes with serious consequences,‚Äù said the ICO.

Last year the ICO fined the PSNI ¬£750,000 for exposing the personal information of its entire workforce, leaving many fearing for their safety.

The regulator's investigation found that simple-to-implement procedures could have prevented the serious breach, in which hidden data on a spreadsheet released as part of a FoI request revealed the surnames, initials, ranks and roles of all 9,483 PSNI officers and staff.

Emily Keaney, Deputy Commissioner at the ICO, said: ‚ÄúWe have seen a number of serious data breaches, including at the PSNI and the Ministry of Defence, which have involved documents being disclosed without proper checks for hidden personal information ‚Äì this crucial step cannot be missed.

‚ÄúAll organisations must have robust measures in place to protect the personal information they hold and prevent it from being inadvertently disclosed. We are committed to providing clear guidance to help organisations get this right, reducing the margin for mistakes and making it second nature to check documents for hidden personal information.‚Äù

The new guidance is the regulator's most current and comprehensive resource on avoiding accidental data breaches when disclosing documents to the public, replacing an advisory note issued in the immediate aftermath of high-profile data breaches in 2023.

It includes simple checklists and how-to videos, covering topics such as:

The ICO is engaging directly with key stakeholders, including the Government, to increase visibility of the guidance among those who need it.

While the guidance is designed to support organisations with disclosing documents to the public, the practical advice will also help all organisations avoid accidental data breaches in any situation where they are disclosing or sharing documents.

 While continuing to voice economic warnings, Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio recently increased his recommended allocation to Bitcoin and gold to 15%. 

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has said his goodbye to Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund giant he founded 50 years ago.

Dalio sold his last remaining stake in Bridgewater and stepped off its board, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.

After buying Dalio's shares, Bridgewater reportedly issued new shares to the sovereign wealth fund of Brunei in a multibillion-dollar deal that brought it an almost 20% stake in the company.

Dalio took to X on Thursday to say he was thrilled to be passing along Bridgewater to the next generation, adding: ‚ÄúI love seeing Bridgewater alive and well without me ‚Äî even better than alive and well with me.‚Äù

Dalio's latest Bridgewater sale marks the final chapter of his journey at the company he founded out of a two-bedroom apartment back in 1975. The 75-year-old billionaire stepped down as Bridgewater CEO in 2017 and then quit as chairman before the end of 2021.

Known for successfully predicting the 2008 economic crisis, Dalio has repeatedly forecasted more collapses, predicting a global debt crisis in late 2024.

‚ÄúWhen a country is overloaded with debt, the preferred path is to lower rates and devalue the currency, so it is worth betting that this is exactly what will happen,‚Äù the veteran investor said in an X post last Wednesday.

He also predicted that the US economy is at risk of facing an ‚Äúeconomic heart attack‚Äù if the government does not reduce the budget deficit to 3% of GDP.

While expecting more economic challenges amid deglobalization and unsustainable trade imbalances, further escalated by the Trump administration's tariff disruptions, Dalio has repeatedly recommended Bitcoin (BTC) and gold as major tools to hedge against the crises.

In late July, he recommended investors allocate up to 15% into Bitcoin or gold to optimize for the ‚Äúbest return-to-risk ratio,‚Äù significantly increasing his previous advice of up to 2%.

  ‚ÄúI believe Bitcoin is one hell of an invention,‚Äù Dalio wrote in his essay ‚ÄúWhat I Think of Bitcoin‚Äù in 2021, where he said the following:

While disclosing he owns some Bitcoin, the legendary investor still said he strongly preferred gold over Bitcoin.

Although Dalio has gained the reputation of a market oracle after predicting the 2008 crisis, many of his other economic forecasts have attracted criticism.

In 1982, Dalio predicted that the global economy was headed toward a depression, which proved to be false, causing massive losses for Bridgewater. Dalio later admitted he was ‚Äúdead wrong‚Äù in both his forecast and the trading strategy that followed, revealing that his misjudgment nearly bankrupted the firm.

As Dalio warns that the US may be the next country to go broke, skeptics increasingly highlight many flaws in the track record of his economic predictions, such as overgeneralization, confirmation bias and lack of temporal clarity.

Described as a digital form of cash issued by the central bank, a CBDC would serve as a complement to existing payment options such as mobile money and bank cards. 

The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR ) has confirmed that it is actively exploring the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as part of its broader strategy to promote financial inclusion and digital innovation.

Described as a digital form of cash issued by the central bank, a CBDC would serve as a complement to existing payment options such as mobile money and bank cards. It would offer added benefits, including faster transactions, secure offline payments, and improved access in areas affected by network disruptions or electricity outages‚Äîespecially in rural communities.

The Bank has begun conducting a five-month closed-loop proof-of-concept phase with a limited group of participants, including staff from both the central and commercial banks, merchants trialing offline payments, and institutions testing USSD features. The project focuses on understanding user experience, technical feasibility, and potential risks. Areas under examination include cybersecurity, legal frameworks, and the integration of CBDC into Rwanda's existing payment infrastructure.

According to the BNR, four core motivations are driving the CBDC exploration:

Strengthening payment resilience during network or power outages

Promoting innovation and market competition

Accelerating progress toward a cashless economy

Improving the efficiency of cross-border payments

The pilot is expected to conclude in October 2025. However, the central bank clarified that no formal launch is planned at this stage. The findings from the current phase will guide further evaluations and determine whether broader live pilots should be initiated.

This initiative marks a significant milestone in Rwanda's digital finance journey, as the country continues to position itself as a regional leader in inclusive and tech-driven financial systems.

According to the bank's representative, the process is still quite far from a point where the bank would be able to determine whether a CBDC is introduced or not.

The Bank of Botswana is currently in the initial stages of a feasibility study to determine whether the country should launch a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

 

This is according to Ruth Baitshepi, the Head of the Digitalisation and Innovation Hub at the Bank of Botswana, who spoke during a recent media briefing.

‚ÄúFirst and foremost, we want to determine if there is even a need for a CBDC in Botswana and whether the emergence of digital assets poses any threat to the sovereignty of the Pula to necessitate a CBDC,‚Äù Baitshepi said.

Botswanaüáßüáº Passes a Virtual Assets Bill to Regulate Trading of Cryptocurrencieshttps://t.co/MujR12HcgN

Speaking during the launch of the 2023 Banking Supervision Annual Report, Bank of Botswana Governor, Moses Pelaelo, revealed that the central bank is currently conducting internal capacity-building and engaging stakeholders to assess the feasibility of launching a CBDC in the medium to long term.

‚ÄúThe Bank is exploring the desirability and feasibility of introducing a CBDC in Botswana. This process includes internal capacity building, research, and stakeholder consultations,‚Äù Pelaelo said.

 

According to the Governor, Botswana is keen to avoid ‚Äúpremature‚Äù deployment of a digital currency without fully understanding the legal, technical, and economic dimensions.

This approach aligns with the cautious and research-driven stance seen across Southern Africa, where central banks in Namibia, Zambia, and South Africa have all undertaken similar assessments.

Botswana's financial regulator has also observed global developments, especially from nations that have launched or piloted CBDCs like Nigeria (eNaira) and Ghana (eCedi), to inform its next steps.

BitKE has previously reported on Botswana's progressive stance on financial innovation. In 2022, the country issued its first Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license under the Virtual Assets Act.

Additionally, Botswana has been highlighted for its commitment to modernizing its payment systems as part of a regional push toward interoperable and inclusive digital finance ecosystems in the Southern African Development Community (SADC).

As the exploration continues, the Bank of Botswana is expected to provide further updates on its research findings and potential pilot phases. For now, its position remains exploratory, aimed at building a robust understanding before any decision on rollout is made.

 Bitcoin tumbled to a three-week low near $114,000 as Trump's tariff executive order triggered a stock and crypto sell-off. 

Bitcoin has fallen to its lowest level in three weeks as US President Donald Trump released an executive order imposing trade tariffs on a raft of countries. 

Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $114,250 on Coinbase during early trading in Asia on Friday, according to TradingView. It hasn't been that low since June 11.

The original cryptocurrency has now broken below its three-week range-bound channel, and the next support zone lies at around $111,000 if there is no rebound. Today's 2.6% decline takes the asset around 6.5% below its all-time high of $122,800, which came on July 14. 

Bitcoin had already been falling in the lead-up to the tariff decision deadline, with $110 billion having exited spot crypto markets over the past 12 hours. 

A total of 158,000 traders were liquidated to the tune of $630 million over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass. Most of these were long positions.

The crypto market dip comes in the same week that the White House issued a crypto policy report widely considered bullish for the industry.

President Trump late on Thursday formalized an array of high tariffs and trade deals he's announced in recent weeks, including hiking tariffs on Canada from 25% to 35%. 

The executive order, which came before a self-imposed deadline for trade deals, also set rates for countries that did not reach agreements with him, such as South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan and Thailand, which are facing tariffs between 19% and 39%. 

Agreements with prominent trading partners such as the European Union, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom were also made official. 

Stock markets across Asia traded lower on Friday morning, along with crypto markets. 

‚ÄúCombined with the uncertainty over tariffs, it is natural to see some profit taking after a very strong run both in equities and crypto markets,‚Äù Apollo Capital's chief investment officer, Henrik Andersson, told Cointelegraph, adding:

‚ÄúThis week's market dip reflects a mix of tariff deadline fear and broader macroeconomic uncertainty, with Trump's new plans amplifying volatility,‚Äù Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told Cointelegraph.

However, some investors viewed the sell-off as a ‚Äútemporary correction rather than a structural shift,‚Äù he said before adding: 

Despite the relatively minor Bitcoin dip, the asset posted its highest-ever monthly candle in July. It hit an all-time high and closed the month at $115,784, according to TradingView.

It was not the largest monthly candle, however. That was last November, when the asset surged by $26,000 in just one month following the election of Donald Trump in the US.

A US Senate committee has voted to reject Republican President Donald Trump's plan to cut the 2026 budget of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) by 40% and to collapse its 27 institutes and centres into 8. Instead, Republicans and Democrats on the committee endorsed maintaining the biomedical agency's structure and increasing its funding by US$400 million, or about 1%.

The details, presented in a bill released today by the committee, will probably change before the bill is signed into law. But the initial figure for the NIH, discussed at a meeting yesterday, offers yet another hint that the US Congress, which controls government spending, does not support Trump's desire to slash US science. (Earlier this month, another Senate committee said it wanted to keep the budget for the US National Science Foundation relatively flat despite Trump's call for a 57% reduction.)

‚ÄúGiven the alternative, the Senate's recommendation of a $400-million increase for NIH is an indication the agency still has support on Capitol Hill,‚Äù says Jennifer Zeitzer, director of public affairs at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Rockville, Maryland. ‚ÄúA 40% cut would have been devastating, so this is a good outcome in a tough year.‚Äù

The bill now faces several challenges. First, the full Senate must pass it. Then, the lower chamber of Congress, the US House of Representatives, will pass its own version, and the two bodies must come together to agree on a single bill that Trump is willing to sign.

The bill might also change if legislators introduce amendments before it's sent to Trump's desk. For example, Dick Durbin, a Democratic senator for Illinois, tried at the meeting yesterday to add a provision to reinstate billions of dollars in health-research funding that had been frozen or terminated by the Trump administration because projects ‚Äî including some on COVID-19 ‚Äî did not align with agency priorities. 

The amendment failed in a vote that fell along party lines, with 14 Democrats voting for it and 15 Republicans voting against it. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican senator for West Virginia, urged her colleagues to vote against the amendment, saying that ‚Äúevery president has the prerogative to implement new goals and priorities‚Äù.

Nevertheless, senators at the hearing rejoiced that they could come to a bipartisan agreement to fund health agencies: ‚ÄúTo the scientists wondering if there will even be an NIH by the end of this administration, this committee's resounding message is: ‚ÄòYes, Congress has your back',‚Äù said Patty Murray, a Democratic senator for Washington state and vice-chair of the committee. ‚ÄúWe need you to stay here and keep this research going.‚Äù

Under the bill, budgets for other health agencies would also remain roughly the same. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose budget the Trump administration wanted to cut by more than half, would receive $9.1 billion, compared with $9.2 billion in 2024.

The committee meeting comes towards the end of a tumultuous week for the NIH, after the White House blocked, and then unblocked, the agency from spending the remainder of its 2025 budget ‚Äî about $15 billion ‚Äî by issuing grants. With the NIH cancelling grant-review meetings in early 2025, funding processes have been delayed, and agency staff members are working in overdrive to process as many grants as possible before the end of the fiscal year on 30 September. If they don't distribute the money, the agency will have to return the unused funds to the US Treasury.

These disruptions have drawn condemnation, and not only from Trump's opponents: 14 Republican senators sent a letter to the White House on 25 July demanding that the NIH be allowed to spend its full 2025 budget.

They found evidence of sophisticated cognitive abilities on artifacts from as far back as 70,000 years ago.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Humanity's ancestors could have been counting long before any formal writing system existed. And it may have been advanced enough that entire societies knew what was going on. 

A team of researchers recently published a study detailing an analysis of 22 artifacts (dated to between 15,000 and 70,000 years ago) intended to determine how scientists could better identify artificial memory systems, or AMSs. As the authors describe them, AMSs are ‚Äútools that allow for the storage and retrieval of coded information beyond the physical body.‚Äù

Nowadays, we use computers and smartphones for the bulk of our out of body memory tracking, but the concept includes everything from systems of writing to sticks carved with tally marks known appropriately as ‚Äòtally sticks.' Anything that would allow you to ‚Äòmake a note' of an idea and come back to it later‚Äîthat counts. 

But these things aren't easy to identify‚Äîespecially the earliest examples on record, which consist of nothing more than a few marks on an object. And over the course of millenia, marks can be collected by an object for a variety of reasons. So, the team behind this new paper set out to find a better method for identifying these early recording devices through the use of ‚Äúnew statistical tools and empirical evidence.‚ÄùBasically, the team wanted to be able to identify what markings meant AMS, and what markings meant, say, butchery or art. So, they analyzed their 22 artifacts‚Äîwhich included a 44,000-year-old baboon bone from South Africa, a 70,000-year-old bone, a reindeer antler from France, medieval tally sticks, and Indigenous calendars‚Äîin the hopes of gathering enough information to create descriptions of what features markings of different purposes would have. In particular, the team looked for signs of regular, intentionally spaced markings that would indicate an objet was being used as an AMS. 

And according to the study, the team found what they were looking for. ‚ÄúUpper Paleolithic AMSs,‚Äù the authors wrote, ‚Äúare endowed with systematically different signatures that distinguish them from the other artifacts.‚Äù Butchery marks were found to be clustered, and abstract decorative motifs displayed randomness in spacing (both had significant variation in angle). But potential AMSs show regular spatial patterns‚Äîwhat researchers claim are ‚Äúdistinct separation[s]‚Äù between the different types of markings.

‚ÄúThese findings,‚Äù the researchers wrote, ‚Äúsuggest that modern humans in at least Africa and Europe had sophisticated cognitive capabilities for information storage and retrieval, providing insights into the possible development of quantity-related cognition.‚Äù

 Some examples come from regions and time periods linked to Homo sapiens, while others could be tied to Neanderthals. 

Questions, however, still abound. For instance, just what information these AMSs were recording remains a mystery. Possibilities include days of the week, lunar movements, community events, objects, and even numbers of people.  

The researchers caution that they ‚Äúcannot truly speculate about the exact nature of these population's precise linguistic repertoire.‚Äù But they surmise that the recording of information by marking objects offers a ‚Äúform of external representation, defining a communication technology that implies the transmitting of knowledge within a community, necessitating a shared understanding of the processes behind the production and use of these devices.‚Äù 

Despite the mystery that still surrpounds many of these artifacts, there is no question as to the importance of the finds. ‚ÄúThese marks,‚Äù the authors wrote, ‚Äúcould reflect a crucial step in the transition from basic cognitive abilities‚Äîlike distinguishing between ‚Äòfew' and ‚Äòmany'‚Äîtoward abstract concepts like numbers.‚Äù

Mitochondria have a crucial role in regulating cellular homeostasis in response to intrinsic and extrinsic cues by changing cellular metabolism to meet these challenges. However, the molecular underpinnings of this regulation and the complete spectrum of these physiological outcomes remain largely unexplored. In this study, we elucidate the mechanisms driving the whitening phenotype in brown adipose tissue (BAT) deficient in the mitochondrial matrix protease CLPP. Here we show that CLPP-deficient BAT shows aberrant accumulation of lipid droplets, which occurs independently of defects in oxygen consumption and fatty acid oxidation. Our results indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction due to CLPP deficiency leads to the build-up of the oncometabolite d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG), which in turn promotes lipid droplet enlargement. We further demonstrate that d-2HG influences gene expression and decreases nuclear stiffness by modifying epigenetic signatures. We propose that lipid accumulation and altered nuclear stiffness regulated through 2HG are stress responses to mitochondrial dysfunction in BAT.

Mitochondria have traditionally been regarded as distinct cellular entities primarily responsible for energy production1. However, increasing evidence shows that they are dynamic organelles that adapt to metabolic changes and cellular stress2. Consequently, mitochondria maintain cellular homeostasis through communication with the nucleus and other organelles2.

Given their fundamental role, it is not surprising that mitochondrial dysfunction, especially oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiency, is linked to ageing and many diseases3. Mitochondrial stress triggers nuclear responses that alter gene expression to counteract cellular damage4. In mammalian cells, the mitochondrial integrated stress response (mitoISR) is one of the earliest transcriptional programmes activated by OXPHOS disruption5. This leads to metabolic reprogramming that can support or hinder tissue homeostasis6,7.

The physiological consequences of mitochondrial stress remain incompletely understood, particularly in a tissue-specific context. White and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT) depend heavily on mitochondrial function and exhibit remarkable plasticity to meet physiological demands8. In WAT, mitochondria regulate energy storage and mobilization through triglyceride accumulation and lipolysis9. By contrast, BAT, rich in mitochondria, drives thermogenesis through uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which dissipates energy as heat, a process essential for neonatal and cold-induced thermoregulation10. Both tissues exhibit metabolic plasticity: WAT undergoes browning in response to cold, Œ≤-adrenergic stimulation, exercise or fasting, increasing mitochondrial content and uncoupling. Conversely, BAT whitening occurs under thermoneutrality, ageing or nutrient overload, leading to lipid accumulation and loss of thermogenic function11.

Chronic exposure to thermoneutrality (~30‚Äâ¬∞C) induces BAT whitening through PARKIN-mediated mitophagy and a ChREBP-driven shift toward fatty acid synthesis12,13. Factors such as obesity, high-fat diets and ageing similarly promote BAT whitening, characterized by lipid accumulation, reduced vascularization and impaired thermogenesis14,15,16. Genetic loss of lipolytic and oxidative enzymes (for example, ATGL and CPT2)17,18, or key transcriptional regulators (for example, PGC-1 and PRDM16)19,20, disrupts BAT differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to whitening. Regardless of the underlying cause, a common hallmark is lipid-droplet expansion with reduced mitochondrial mass or function21. Consistently, loss of mitochondrial proteins essential for fusion (MFN2 and OPA1)22,23 or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance (TFAM)24 also triggers BAT whitening. These findings highlight the central role of OXPHOS integrity in BAT homeostasis, although the underlying mechanisms that connect mitochondrial function to the homeostasis in BAT remain incompletely understood.

We have recently shown that the loss of the mitochondrial matrix protease CLPP has contrasting effects in adipose tissue: it enhances oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in WAT but impairs BAT thermogenesis and promotes lipid accumulation, consistent with a whitening phenotype25. CLPP levels rise in BAT with cold exposure, unlike other mitochondrial proteases, but decline with ageing26,27. In a deep BAT proteomics screen involving a cohort of 163 genetically defined diversity outbred mice, CLPP correlated strongly with UCP1 (https://wren.hms.harvard.edu/opabat/)28. Furthermore, several of the identified UCP1 interactors are known CLPP substrates, supporting a strong link between CLPP and BAT function25,28,29.

Here, we show that CLPP deficiency in BAT drives lipid droplet (LD) expansion through respiratory-chain dysfunction, independent of changes in oxygen consumption. This phenotype is driven by accumulation of d-2HG, an oncometabolite that alters chromatin and nuclear architecture. We reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction modulates epigenetic programmes, reducing nuclear stiffness and promoting BAT whitening. Together, our results uncover a previously unrecognized connection between mitochondrial function, metabolic signalling and chromatin reorganization in BAT. These insights shed light on how CLPP deficiency contributes to BAT whitening and impaired thermogenic function, expanding our understanding of mitochondrial regulation in adipose tissue biology.

To study the role of mitochondria in the physiological remodelling of BAT, we used a mouse model with deletion of the mitochondrial protease CLPP (Clpp‚àí/‚àí, hereafter CLPP-KO), which is involved in OXPHOS complex synthesis and maintenance25,29. The loss of CLPP in BAT led to the accumulation of fewer but larger LDs, giving the tissue a pale appearance consistent with BAT whitening (Fig. 1a‚Äìc). This phenotype was intrinsic to BAT and not due to systemic CLPP deficiency, because similar whitening was observed in tissue-specific knockouts, including pan-adipose (CLPP-AKO: Clppfl/fl; Adipoq-cre)30 and brown-fat-specific models (CLPP-BKO: Clppfl/fl; Ucp1-cre)31 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Although whole-body CLPP deletion resulted in significant weight loss, CLPP-AKO mice maintained normal body size, and CLPP-BKO mice exhibited only mild weight reductions that were more pronounced in males (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Although male and female mice exhibit naturally different weight trajectories as they age, our extensive experience with CLPP-deficient models suggests that these differences do not categorically impact study outcomes. Therefore, we combined data from both sexes in subsequent analyses, ensuring balanced representation of male and female mice across all experiments whenever feasible.

Source data

In addition to enlarged LDs, ultrastructural analysis revealed increased numbers of enlarged mitochondria in CLPP-KO BAT, some of which were visibly paler with fewer cristae, suggesting impaired OXPHOS function (Fig. 1b‚Äìc). Mitochondria isolated from CLPP-KO, CLPP-AKO and CLPP-BKO BAT exhibited reduced levels of respiratory complex I (CI) and CI-containing supercomplexes, accompanied by decreased CI activity (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1d). Consistent with this, CLPP-KO BAT showed accumulation of F1 subassemblies of complex V (CV), which are essential for maintaining membrane potential when OXPHOS is compromised (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1e).

Knockout tissue homogenates displayed reduced lipolysis, becoming significant after forskolin stimulation, suggesting that impaired lipolytic activation (glycerol release) could contribute to the whitening phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Despite these mitochondrial defects, oxygen-consumption rates (OCRs) in BAT lysates remained unchanged under both basal and stimulated conditions (Fig. 1f), probably owing to compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 1g). By contrast, thermoneutrality-induced whitening involves mitophagy15, whereas high-fat-diet-driven whitening causes LD accumulation without changes in mitochondrial content16. These findings point to distinct mitochondrial responses in different BAT whitening contexts and LD expansions.

To explore the underlying mechanisms, we established immortalized preadipocyte (preAD) cultures from CLPP wild-type and knockout BAT (Fig. 1h). Upon differentiation, these cells exhibited mature brown adipocyte (mBA) features, including multilocular LDs and oligomycin resistance, indicative of mitochondrial uncoupling (Fig. 1h‚Äìk and Extended Data Fig. 1g). Both wild-type and CLPP-KO mBAs strongly upregulated UCP1 (Extended Data Fig. 1h). Transcript levels of LD-associated proteins were markedly higher in CLPP-KO mBAs, including the ubiquitous marker PLIN2 (also known as ADRP) and the adipocyte-specific proteins PLIN1 and PLIN4 (Extended Data Fig. 1h).

OCR and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) measurements in mBAs revealed minimal, if any, difference between wild-type and CLPP-KO cells (Fig. 1j,k). However, both basal OCR and ECAR were higher than those in preADs, reflecting increased metabolic activity upon differentiation. These results confirm that mBAs faithfully model adult brown adipocyte function in both wild-type and CLPP-deficient conditions.

To investigate the global impact of CLPP loss in BAT, we first analysed gene expression across all CLPP-deficient models (Fig. 2a). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment using DAVID32 identified 707 commonly upregulated and 639 downregulated transcripts shared across genotypes (Supplementary Table 1). Inflammatory and immune pathways were among the most enriched (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1), consistent with prior reports linking CLPP deficiency to cGAS‚ÄìSTING-mediated interferon-stimulated gene activation through mtDNA release33. However, STING deletion in CLPP-KO mice did not alter the BAT whitening phenotype (Fig. 2b), and we observed neither immune infiltration in CLPP-BKO BAT nor immune progenitor expansion in bone marrow (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Cell-type deconvolution based on single-cell transcriptomic references34 confirmed no major changes in cell composition, including immune populations (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d).

Beyond inflammation, CLPP-deficient BAT showed upregulation of pathways related to transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, adhesion, migration, cell death and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed enrichment of BAT-whitening-associated pathways such as actin remodelling and angiogenesis13,14 (Fig. 2a,c), whereas signatures of brown-adipocyte differentiation were negatively enriched and myogenesis appeared dysregulated (Fig. 2d), suggesting a possible impairment in BAT identity. Given the shared developmental origin of BAT and skeletal muscle, we tested whether differentiation was compromised by isolating the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) from wild-type and CLPP-KO BAT. Whole-proteome analysis of CLPP-BKO SVF revealed only minor changes, primarily in mitochondrial metabolism, mtDNA expression and OXPHOS proteins, with no alterations in markers of brown adipocytes or muscle differentiation (Fig. 2e), suggesting that early BAT development is intact.

Downregulated transcripts prominently included mitochondrial OXPHOS components and subunits of mitochondrial ribosomes (Fig. 2a,f), indicating organelle dysfunction. In agreement, the mitochondrial integrated stress response (mitoISR) was activated across models, as shown by GSEA and increased expression of ATF4 targets in CLPP-BKO BAT (Fig. 2g). Levels of transcripts involved in lipid metabolism, both catabolic (fatty acid oxidation) and anabolic (fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis), were also significantly reduced (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). Although GSEA confirmed overall suppression of lipid metabolic pathways, a subset of lipid-related genes was positively enriched, reflecting a dynamic remodelling process (Fig. 2h). This metabolic adaptation likely underlies LD accumulation, given that the OCR remained largely normal in knockout mBA cells (Fig. 1j), ruling out low OXPHOS activity as the cause.

We next compared CLPP-BKO transcriptomes with two BAT whitening models: thermoneutral exposure35 and lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) BAT-specific knockout (LSD1-BKO) mice36. Exposure to thermoneutrality more robustly altered BAT gene expression than did the loss of either CLPP or LSD1; in both of the latter models, less than quarter of alterations were unique (Fig. 2i). About 30% of the differentially expressed genes in CLPP-BKO mice overlapped with both whitening models (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 2e). GO terms shared across the three models matched those enriched in CLPP-deficient BAT (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Notably, Clpp expression was reduced in all three models, underscoring its link to BAT homeostasis (Extended Data Fig. 2e).

Although proteomic changes were less extensive than transcriptomic ones, with 116 upregulated and 66 downregulated proteins shared across CLPP-KO, CLPP-AKO and CLPP-BKO BAT, they largely mirrored transcript-level trends (Supplementary Table 3). GO analysis showed enrichment for mitochondrial proteins in both directions (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 3a). OXPHOS changes were modest, except for upregulated ATP synthase (complex V), consistent with a shift toward ATP production and reduced uncoupling, as seen in whitening BAT (Fig. 2k). Downregulated proteins clustered around fatty-acid-metabolism pathways, consistent with transcriptomic data (Fig. 2j).

To refine our analysis, we examined the proteomes of cytoplasmic mitochondria and peri-lipid droplet mitochondria (PDMs) from BAT37. These mitochondrial populations had distinct yet overlapping profiles, and both showed clear OXPHOS alterations under CLPP deficiency (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Notably, both cytoplasmic mitochondria and PDMs displayed pronounced complex I and milder complex IV deficiencies, similar to heart mitochondria in CLPP-KO mice (Fig. 2k and Extended Data Fig. 3d). These functional impairments were not apparent at the tissue level, likely owing to increased mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 2k).

Collectively, these findings suggest that BAT whitening in CLPP-deficient mice is not driven by impaired differentiation or adipocyte-to-myocyte conversion, nor is it a direct consequence of OXPHOS loss. Instead, a transcriptional signature of suppressed lipid metabolism likely underlies the expansion of lipid droplets. The broad reshaping of the BAT transcriptome, particularly enrichment of GO terms related to transcriptional control and chromatin regulation, points to an adaptive stress response to CLPP loss (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1).

Transcriptome and proteome analyses of CLPP-deficient BAT revealed extensive metabolic adaptations. To further examine this, we performed semi-targeted metabolomics across CLPP-deficient models. Despite there being relatively few metabolites with significantly altered levels, a consistent overlap was observed between models (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 5). In line with the larger lipid droplets, levels of long-chain fatty acids were elevated, and levels of carnitines derived from branched-chain amino acids were dysregulated (Supplementary Table 5). Among all changed metabolites, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) was the most strongly upregulated, showing a 2.7- to 3.7-fold increase across all three models (Fig. 3a,b). CLPP-deficient mBA cells also accumulated and secreted 2HG, suggesting a potential paracrine role (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 4a), whereas KO preADs did not, indicating that 2HG accumulation is specific to mature brown adipocytes (Fig. 3d).

Source data

2HG, a structural analogue of Œ±-ketoglutarate (Œ±-KG), exists as two enantiomers, d- and l-2HG. It can be produced at low levels by malate dehydrogenase (MDH)38, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)39, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH)40 or mutant forms of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 and IDH2)41. To identify the source of 2HG, we analysed the expression of all known enzymes involved in its production38,39,40,41. PHGDH was the only one that was consistently upregulated, with more than fivefold increases across all CLPP-deficient models (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). PHGDH catalyses the first step of the serine biosynthesis pathway, frequently induced as part of mitoISR in response to OXPHOS dysfunction (Fig. 3f)6. Although PHGDH protein was not increased in CLPP-KO mBA cells, its enzymatic activity was significantly increased (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). Enantiomer-specific analysis confirmed that d-2HG is the predominant form in all CLPP-KO BAT samples, as well as in isolated mature CLPP-KO brown adipocytes (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 4e), aligning with known PHGDH promiscuity toward d-2HG production40. The difference in 2HG enantiomer proportions between wild-type BAT and wild-type mBA cells is likely due to the heterogeneous nature of BAT, which consists of a mix of diverse cell types34.

To directly test the putative role of PHGDH in d-2HG production, we inhibited it using NCT503, a selective inhibitor that blocks serine synthesis42. NCT503 treatment abolished 2HG accumulation in knockout mBA cells (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 6) and broadly altered metabolic pathways, including one-carbon metabolism, the SAM cycle and purine biosynthesis (Supplementary Table 6). Notably, PHGDH inhibition also reversed the whitening phenotype: lipid content was reduced, and smaller LDs formed in KO mBA cells, confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Fig. 4b,c). Furthermore, two weeks of in vivo treatment with NCT503 normalized 2HG levels and reversed BAT whitening in CLPP-KO mice (Fig. 4d,e). To further probe the role of d-2HG, we overexpressed d-2HG dehydrogenase (d-2HGDH), the enzyme responsible for its degradation, in CLPP-deficient mBA cells. This significantly reduced d-2HG levels and partially reversed the whitening phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g). By contrast, inhibition of the ISR using ISRIB suppressed some ATF4 targets but had no effect on d-2HG accumulation or lipid storage (Extended Data Fig. 4h‚Äìj), suggesting that mitoISR is not the main driver of whitening phenotype following CLPP deficiency. Finally, we treated wild-type mBA cells with cell-permeable d-2HG (octyl d-2HG). This was sufficient to induce LD enlargement (Fig. 4b,f), directly linking d-2HG accumulation with BAT whitening.

In summary, our data demonstrate that CLPP loss activates PHGDH, leading to d-2HG accumulation in mature brown adipocytes. This metabolite contributes to lipid-droplet expansion and BAT whitening, revealing a critical role for aberrant serine metabolism and d-2HG in mediating the phenotypic consequences of mitochondrial stress.

Elevated 2HG levels in cancer inhibit Œ±-KG-dependent dioxygenases, affecting histone and DNA demethylation and leading to broad epigenetic reprogramming43. Initial western blot analyses of CLPP-deficient cells and wild-type cells treated with d-2HG did not reveal consistent changes in key histone modifications (histone H3 dimethylated at Lys9 (H3K9me2), H3 trimethylated at Lys36 (H3K36me3), H3K4me3, H3K27me3) (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Given the limited sensitivity of this method, subtle epigenetic shifts might have been missed. Immunofluorescence assays showed modest, inconsistent changes in H3K9me2 and H3K27me3) (Extended Data Fig. 5b), prompting a more focused analysis of H3K4me3, a mark of active and poised promoters known to be influenced by 2HG43.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP‚Äìseq) revealed a global increase in H3K4me3 in both CLPP-deficient and d-2HG-treated mBA cells, with most enrichment occurring at promoter regions (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Notably, 1,141 out of 2,017 unique H3K4me3 peaks in CLPP-deficient cells overlapped with those in d-2HG-treated cells, suggesting a shared mechanism (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 7). GO analysis of these enriched loci shared between CLPP-deficient and d-2HG-treated mBA cells revealed biological processes associated with transcriptional regulation, differentiation, chromatin reorganization, lipid metabolism, apoptosis and DNA repair (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 7). Many of these categories also emerged in transcriptomic analyses of CLPP-deficient BAT (Supplementary Table 1), supporting their functional relevance.

Source data

A closer examination of individual genes identified increased H3K4me3 at promoters of key adipogenic regulators, including SREBP1 and SREBP2 (cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism), and C/EBPŒ≤ (white adipocyte differentiation)44,45 (Fig. 5d). These changes suggest that d-2HG-induced chromatin remodelling could promote transcriptional programmes linked to adipogenesis and metabolism. To further explore this, we compared transcriptomes of CLPP-KO and d-2HG-treated mBA cells. More than 50% of significantly altered transcripts in CLPP-KO cells exhibited corresponding changes in H3K4me3 levels (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). Additionally, more than one-third of these were shared with d-2HG-treated cells, implicating 2HG as a major driver of transcriptional changes in CLPP deficiency.

GO analysis revealed enrichment of both up- and downregulated transcripts in pathways related to chromatin remodelling, transcriptional and translational regulation and apoptosis, indicating broad alterations in these processes (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Table 8). Distinct trends were also evident: oxidative stress and DNA-damage-response terms were enriched among upregulated genes, whereas cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization terms were downregulated in both models (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Table 8).

GSEA analysis identified substantial changes of lipid and fatty acid metabolism, mirroring alterations observed in CLPP-deficient tissues (Figs. 2h and 6a). Among the transcripts upregulated in both CLPP-KO mBA cells and cells treated with d-2HG, we identified multiple enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, along with a variety of lipid transporters, including the highly upregulated CD36, a major regulator of fatty acid uptake in adipocytes and a key factor in LD growth46 (Fig. 6b and Extended Data Fig. 5e). Many of these transcripts were suppressed in cells overexpressing d-2HGDH (Fig. 6c). In parallel, transcripts encoding adipogenic regulators, such as Pparg and Cebpb, were upregulated in both CLPP-KO mBA cells and cells treated with d-2HG. By contrast, Ppargc1a, encoding PGC1Œ±, was specifically induced in CLPP-deficient cells, consistent with underlying mitochondrial OXPHOS dysfunction (Fig. 6d). Remarkably, Cebpa expression appeared to be similarly influenced by mitochondrial dysfunction rather than d-2HG treatment (Fig. 6d). Conversely, cholesterol-biosynthesis genes were negatively enriched in both CLPP-deficient and d-2HG-treated cells; this change was also observed in BAT from all three CLPP-KO models (Extended Data Fig. 5f), highlighting a strong similarity between cells and tissues. Transcripts encoding SREBP1 and 2 (Srebf1, Srebf2) and their targets, including Hmgcr and Hmgcs1, which encode key catalysts of the initial rate-limiting steps of cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig. 6e). These changes coincided with reduced cellular cholesterol levels in both CLPP-deficient and d-2HG-treated cells, similar to the effect of simvastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig. 6f).

Together, these findings demonstrate that CLPP deficiency and d-2HG treatment induce similar changes in transcriptome and epigenome, that converge on chromatin regulation, adipogenic signalling and cholesterol metabolism, linking mitochondrial dysfunction to coordinated metabolic reprogramming.

GO enrichment analysis of transcriptional and H3K4me3 ChIP‚Äìseq changes in CLPP-deficient tissues and cells consistently identified terms related to cell adhesion, migration, actin cytoskeleton organization and transcriptional regulation (Figs. 2a and 5c,f and Supplementary Tables 1, 7 and 8). A major number of enriched transcripts mapped to the nucleus, nucleoplasm and perinuclear cytoplasm. This aligns with emerging evidence linking nuclear architecture to cellular stress responses. The overlap of nucleus-related transcripts between CLPP-KO and d-2HG-treated cells supports this connection (Extended Data Fig. 6a). GSEA further revealed strong negative enrichment of nuclear envelope-associated transcripts in CLPP-deficient BAT, closely matching the transcriptomic signature of d-2HG-treated cells (Extended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting that metabolic perturbations could influence nuclear and cellular morphology.

We next explored the link between d-2HG, epigenetic changes and nuclear phenotype. Ultrastructural analyses revealed pronounced nuclear deformation in CLPP-deficient brown adipocytes, characterized by mitochondria clustering near and indenting the nuclear envelope (Fig. 7a). The extent of mito-nuclear interactions in CLPP-deficient BAT could be further observed in a high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) reconstituted model using serial section array tomography (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Video 1). Although direct contact sites with shared membranes were not detected, the two membranes were closely positioned with very little intercalated ER (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d and Supplementary Video 2).

Quantification of mito-nuclear indentations revealed an increase from ~1.3 per nucleus in wild-type to ~2.9 in CLPP-deficient cells, with some nuclei displaying up to 10 invaginations (Fig. 7c), indicating that nuclear mechanics were altered. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we detected a significant reduction in nuclear stiffness in CLPP-deficient adipocytes, mimicked by d-2HG treatment of wild-type cells (Fig. 7d,e). Inhibition of PHGDH with NCT503, which lowers d-2HG levels, restored nuclear stiffness in CLPP-deficient cells (Fig. 7f). By contrast, ISRIB treatment did not significantly change d-2HG levels and had no effect on nuclear envelope stiffness (Extended Data Fig. 6e). These findings establish a functional link between altered metabolism and nuclear morphology, regulated by d-2HG, but independent of the classical ISR.

Cholesterol increases membrane stiffness, especially in saturated lipid environments, with a weaker effect in unsaturated lipid-rich membranes47. Although the nuclear envelope is mainly composed of unsaturated phospholipids, increased cholesterol synthesis has been linked to nuclear envelope stiffening and fragility48. Because CLPP-deficient and d-2HG-treated cells showed reduced cholesterol levels, we tested whether supplementation could restore nuclear stiffness. Cholesterol treatment significantly increased nuclear stiffness in both models, exceeding levels observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 7g). Conversely, treatment with simvastatin, a cholesterol-synthesis inhibitor, further decreased nuclear stiffness (Fig. 7g), highlighting cholesterol as a critical regulator of nuclear envelope mechanics.

To test whether these effects extend beyond CLPP deficiency, we treated wild-type mBA cells with actinonin, an inhibitor of OXPHOS biogenesis49. Short-term actinonin treatment significantly increased 2HG levels in wild-type mBA cells and modestly elevated lipid accumulation (Fig. 7h,i), suggesting that metabolic reprogramming occurs rapidly upon mitochondrial dysfunction. This was accompanied by a more than twofold reduction in nuclear stiffness (Fig. 7j), suggesting that OXPHOS impairment broadly influences nuclear mechanics through rapid metabolic rewiring.

Collectively, our findings reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction drives metabolic reprogramming that reshapes nuclear architecture and mechanics. We propose that PHGDH activation and subsequent d-2HG accumulation induce nuclear softening, which is reversible and cholesterol-sensitive (Fig. 7k). Although our study centres on BAT whitening and CLPP loss, similar metabolic‚Äìnuclear coupling is likely to occur in other contexts of OXPHOS dysfunction and lipid accumulation, warranting further investigation.

This study identifies a mechanism by which CLPP loss and resulting OXPHOS dysfunction drive LD expansion, a key feature of BAT whitening, through metabolic and epigenetic adaptation. LD enlargement and BAT whitening are observed in various models of mitochondrial dysfunction and are often linked to respiratory-chain deficiencies22,23,24. Although impaired fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is frequently proposed as a cause, direct mechanistic evidence is limited, as seen in models like adipocyte-specific TFAM deletion24. Other studies, such as the one conducted on Mfn2-deficient adipocytes, suggest that reduced lipolysis, rather than increased lipogenesis, underlies LD accumulation23. However, not all OXPHOS deficiencies result in larger LDs. For instance, mtDNA mutator mice exhibit BAT dysfunction without LD expansion, likely due to systemic metabolic constraints and a catabolic state that limits lipid storage50.

Interestingly, BAT-specific OPA1 loss leads to LD accumulation and reduced oxygen consumption but paradoxically enhances thermogenesis through FGF21 induction22. Conversely, OPA1 overexpression protects against diet-induced obesity by preventing BAT whitening and stimulating WAT browning, potentially through fumarate-driven activation of KDM3A51. These findings underscore the complexity of mitochondrial stress responses and their influence on adipocyte fate through metabolic‚Äìepigenetic cross-talk.

Our data suggest that LD expansion and BAT whitening in CLPP-deficient models are a stress response to mitochondrial dysfunction, rather than a direct consequence of respiratory failure. This phenotype was consistent across in vivo models and terminally differentiated CLPP-KO brown adipocytes. Although LDs are typically considered energy reservoirs, they also serve protective roles, buffering oxidative stress, mitigating endoplasmic-reticulum stress and sequestering harmful lipid species52. LD expansion can limit polyunsaturated fatty acid oxidation and reduce lipotoxicity, which is particularly important under mitochondrial dysfunction, during which acylcarnitines, ceramides and oxidized lipids can accumulate53. Thus, we propose that LD biogenesis acts as an adaptive mechanism to maintain redox balance and prevent metabolic toxicity52,53.

We further show that LD expansion is driven by increased d-2HG levels, produced through promiscuous activity of PHGDH40 in CLPP-deficient adipocytes. Exogenous d-2HG recapitulates the phenotype in wild-type cells, and transcriptomic analysis reveals shared signatures affecting lipid and cholesterol metabolism. PHGDH, a key enzyme in serine biosynthesis and one-carbon metabolism, is frequently upregulated in mitochondrial disease models5,6,7,54. Given its central role in the mitoISR, inhibiting PHGDH in mitochondrial disease models, such as Deletor mice, is detrimental54. Our findings suggest that PHGDH-derived d-2HG has an additional role in modulating lipid metabolism and chromatin architecture.

Although d-2HG is best known for its role in cancer, it also functions in hypoxia, immune-cell differentiation and metabolic disorders55. In tumours, it inhibits Œ±-KG-dependent dioxygenases, such as TET2 and Jumonji-C demethylases, thereby altering DNA and histone methylation55. These changes can shift cell fate and are associated with increased repressive marks, such as H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, without widespread changes in DNA methylation56. d-2HG also exerts non-cell-autonomous effects; for example, tumour-derived d-2HG suppresses CD8‚Å∫ T cell metabolism and function57. In accordance with this, we observed 2HG secretion from mature brown adipocytes, raising the possibility of systemic effects in CLPP-deficient animals.

Our findings reveal new functions for d-2HG, demonstrating its role in regulating nuclear mechanics in terminally differentiated cells. Both CLPP deficiency and d-2HG treatment led to nuclear softening, associated with increased H3K4me3 occupancy at promoter regions. This included lipid metabolic regulators involved in lipogenesis, lipolysis and transport, consistent with LD expansion. Notably, although H3K4me3 was enriched at the promoters of cholesterol-biosynthesis genes, their expression and total cholesterol levels were reduced. This indicates that there are additional regulatory layers influenced by d-2HG.

Cholesterol is essential for membrane rigidity, including at the nuclear envelope. We show that cholesterol depletion causes nuclear envelope softening, whereas supplementation restores nuclear stiffness in CLPP-deficient and d-2HG-treated cells. This aligns with prior work showing that staurosporine-induced mitochondrial dysfunction alters mitochondria‚Äìnucleus interactions and cholesterol distribution58. Similarly, in yeast, oxygen deprivation enhances the impact of saturated lipids, leading to nuclear envelope rigidification and rupture, while revealing a protective role for LDs in buffering membrane composition and preserving nuclear envelope integrity59. Our data suggest that, in brown adipocytes, LD expansion might serve a similar protective role for the nuclear envelope.

Recent studies have shown that, under mechanical confinement, mitochondria migrate toward the nucleus, resulting in increased nuclear ATP to support chromatin reorganization and DNA repair60. Nuclear stiffness depends on both the nuclear lamina and heterochromatin, which provides structural support and mechanical resistance61. Cells sense deformation through nuclear envelope stretching, which triggers membrane phospholipid restructuring and actomyosin cytoskeleton changes61. Loss of heterochromatin has been linked to nuclear envelope softening and nuclear wrinkling61,62. In CLPP-deficient models and upon d-2HG treatment, we consistently observed changes in transcripts and proteins related to actomyosin cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion and migration, consistent with responses seen under mechanical confinement60,62.

In conclusion, our study links mitochondrial dysfunction to nuclear reshaping, showing how CLPP loss and d-2HG-driven metabolic rewiring affect gene expression and nuclear structure to promote lipid-droplet accumulation. We identified d-2HG as a key mediator in this process, accumulating in CLPP-deficient BAT owing to increased PHGDH activity. This metabolite reshapes the epigenetic landscape by enriching H3K4me3 histone marks on promoters of lipid-metabolism regulators, orchestrating a shift toward LD accumulation, likely as a protective sink for potentially lipotoxic intermediates. Additionally, our findings highlight an unexpected interplay between cholesterol metabolism, cytoskeletal organization and nuclear mechanics, showing that changes in cholesterol availability contribute to nuclear softening. Although our focus is on brown adipocytes, these findings could extend broadly to tissues undergoing mitochondrial stress, with relevance to ageing, metabolic disease and cancer. By connecting mitochondrial dysfunction, chromatin reorganization, lipid metabolism and nuclear mechanics, our study provides a framework for understanding adaptive tissue remodelling in mitochondrial disorders.

All mice analysed in this study were bred and housed at the CECAD Research Center animal facility, University of Cologne. All experiments were conducted in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved by local government authorities (Landesamt f√ºr Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen; LANUV). Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages at 22‚Äì24‚Äâ¬∞C under a 12-h light‚Äìdark cycle, with lights on at 06:00. They had ad libitum access to water and a standard chow diet (ssniff rat/mouse low-phytoestrogen diet). For breeding, one male was paired with one to two females of similar age, with mating initiated at a minimum age of 8 weeks. Body weight was recorded weekly for individual mice from 4 to 16 weeks of age.

The mice used in this study were derived from a line with a conditional Clpp gene targeting, as previously described29. To generate whole-body CLPP-KO mice (Clpp‚àí/‚àí), Clppfl/fl mice were crossed with transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the Œ≤-actin promoter. Mice with adipose-tissue-specific knockout were generated by crossing Clppfl/fl mice with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the Adipoq promoter (Adipoq-cre mice)30 or the Ucp1 promoter (Ucp1-cre mice)31.

Each day for 15 days, 14-month-old male mice were intraperitoneally injected daily with vehicle (ethanol (5%), PEG400 (35%) and 30% cyclodextrin (60%)), in which NCT503 was dissolved. NCT-503 was freshly prepared prior to the injections. For the injection solution, 20‚ÄâŒºM stock was dissolved in the vehicle and was administered to the mice at serum-stable concentrations of 40‚Äâmg kg‚àí1 body weight42.

After dissection, the entire adipose tissues were placed in tissue cassettes (Roth) and fixed in 5% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde overnight at 4‚Äâ¬∞C. Tissues were then stored in PBS until they sank to the bottom. The next day, they were dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations (30%, 50%, 70%, 96% and twice in 100%) for 2‚Äâh at each step, followed by two 2-h incubations in xylol. Finally, tissues were embedded in paraffin blocks. The fixed BAT and inguinal WAT (iWAT) were sectioned at 5-Œºm thickness using a microtome (Leica) and mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides (VWR). Paraffin-embedded BAT sections were deparaffinized in xylol and rehydrated through decreasing ethanol concentrations, followed by a wash in tap water. Sections were stained with Meyer's haematoxylin, rinsed and then counterstained with eosin. Sections were then dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations, cleared in xylol and mounted with entellan.

Adipose tissue samples were immersion-fixed in 2% formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1‚ÄâM sodium cacodylate buffer (Applichem) and washed four times in the same buffer. Post-fixation was performed with 2% OsO‚ÇÑ (Science Services) in 0.1‚ÄâM cacodylate buffer at 4‚Äâ¬∞C, followed by additional washes. Samples were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series (50%, 70%, 90%, 3√ó100%), treated with ethanol and propylene oxide and infiltrated with epon and propylenoxide at gradually increasing concentrations of epon. Samples were embedded in PELCO 21-cavity molds (Plano) and cured at 60‚Äâ¬∞C.

Ultrathin sections (70‚Äânm) were cut using an ultramicrotome (Leica UC6) with a 45¬∞ diamond knife (Diatome). Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and imaged using a JEM-2100 Plus TEM (JEOL) operating at 80‚ÄâkV, equipped with a OneView 4‚ÄâK camera (Gatan).

Ribbons of five consecutive ultrathin sections were collected on Pioloform-coated slot grids (Science Services). A total of 60 sections were imaged for 3D reconstruction. Images were aligned using FIJI (TrakEM2 plugin), and nucleus, mitochondria and lipid droplets were manually segmented in Microscope Imaging Browser (MIB, v2.82). The final model was processed in IMARIS (v9.9.1) for 3D reconstruction.

Transmission electron micrographs (TEMs) at √ó2,500 magnification were used to quantify mitochondria in wild-type and knockout conditions. Forty-eight images per condition were captured from random sample positions. Mitochondrial quantification was performed using unbiased counting frames in ImageJ (Fiji). For each image, a 3√ó3 grid of counting frames covering 25% of the image was randomly placed. Mitochondria fully enclosed or intersecting permissive lines were counted; those intersecting restrictive lines were excluded. The multi-point tool in Fiji was used for tracking. The numerical density (N) of mitochondria was calculated as: N = (number of mitochondria / number of counting frames) √ó area per frame (¬µm¬≤).

Low-magnification TEM micrographs (√ó80‚Äì150 magnification) were acquired, including 20 images from knockout and 12 from wild-type samples. The largest possible rectangular sample regions were extracted using Fiji, excluding grid and void areas. For 12 images per condition, 512√ó512 pixel regions were cropped and segmented using the Cellpose cyto3 model. Segmentation results were saved as ImageJ ROI files, manually corrected in QuPath and re-applied to all extracted regions using a refined Cellpose model. Lipid-droplet number and size were measured using a FIJI macro. A guard zone (15% of image diameter) was applied to exclude lipid droplets cut off by image borders. To avoid biased exclusion, the lower and left boundaries were restrictive (excluding intersecting droplets), while the upper and right boundaries were permissive (including intersecting droplets).

A six-well plate was prepared with BAT collagenase digestion buffer (123‚ÄâmM NaCl, 5‚ÄâmM KCl, 1.3‚ÄâmM CaCl‚ÇÇ, 5‚ÄâmM glucose and 100‚ÄâmM HEPES, pH 7.4) on ice. Sterile equipment (Falcon tubes, reaction tubes, syringes, cannulas and a dish) was disinfected with 70% ethanol. The two brown fat pads were dissected from newborn mice, placed in collagenase digestion buffer, minced with scissors and transferred to a Falcon tube on ice. A tail tip was collected in a reaction tube for genotyping. For collagenase digestion, Falcon tubes were incubated in a water bath with gentle shaking until complete tissue dissociation. The suspension was drawn into syringes using 0.9 √ó 70‚Äâmm (20‚ÄâG √ó 2) cannulas, then filtered through a 100-Œºm nylon mesh into a fresh Falcon tube. The middle phase was carefully collected, avoiding the upper (mature adipocytes) and lower (tissue remnants) phases. The suspension was then filtered through a 30-Œºm nylon mesh and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in brown adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cell culture medium and transferred to a six-well plate for further analyses.

Primary brown adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cells (passage 0) were immortalized 24‚Äâh post-isolation through lentiviral transduction with a virus expressing SV40 large T-Antigen (L-TAg) under the PGK promoter. Immortalized brown preADs (mBA) were expanded in mBA growth medium at 37‚Äâ¬∞C, 5% CO‚ÇÇ. The virus solution was thawed and centrifuged at 16,000g, and 200‚Äâng viral reverse transcriptase (per well of a 6-well plate) was mixed with 800‚ÄâŒºl brown adipocyte (BA) growth medium (high-glucose DMEM without pyruvate). After removing the culture medium, cells were exposed to viral medium, followed by PBS washes and replacement with fresh BA growth medium.

Cells were maintained in growth medium at 37‚Äâ¬∞C, 5% CO‚ÇÇ, ensuring cultures did not reach full confluence. For passaging, cells were detached through trypsinization, resuspended in growth medium, and centrifuged at 200g. Pellets were resuspended in growth medium and mixed 1:1 with freezing medium to achieve a final DMSO concentration of 10% at a cell density of 1 million cells ml‚àí1. Cell suspensions were transferred to cryogenic vials (1‚Äâml per vial) and stored at ‚àí80‚Äâ¬∞C, followed by transfer to liquid nitrogen (‚àí196‚Äâ¬∞C) for long-term storage.

In each well of a six-well plate, 1.8 √ó 10‚Åµ cells were seeded in growth medium (day ‚Äì4). Once confluent, the medium was replaced with differentiation medium (growth medium + 0.5 ¬µg ml‚àí1 insulin + 1‚ÄânM triiodothyronine) (day ‚Äì2). Adipogenic differentiation was induced by switching to freshly prepared induction medium (growth medium + 5 ¬µM dexamethasone + 250 ¬µM IBMX (3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) + 0.5 ¬µg ml‚àí1 insulin + 1‚ÄânM triiodothyronine (day 0). After induction, cells were maintained in BA differentiation medium, which was replenished every second day. By day 8, cells were fully differentiated into mature brown adipocytes.

Treatments were initiated from day 3 upon switching to differentiation medium: actinonin (150‚ÄâŒºM, DMSO; applied for 96‚Äâh, with replacement every second day); NCT-503 (20‚ÄâŒºM, DMSO; applied for 72‚Äâh, with replacement every 24‚Äâh); octyl d-2HG (500‚ÄâŒºM, DMSO; applied for 72‚Äâh, with replacement every 24‚Äâh); and ISRIB (1‚ÄâŒºM, DMSO; applied for 72‚Äâh, with daily renewal).

Cells were washed with PBS and stained with 1√ó BODIPY solution in PBS in the dark. After staining, cells were trypsinized, and trypsinization was stopped with FACS buffer (PBS‚Äâ+‚Äâ2% BSA). The cell suspension was filtered through a 60-Œºm strainer and transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes for analysis. The gating strategy used for flow cytometry analysis is provided in Supplementary Figure 1a.

Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 10% formalin for 30‚Äâmin at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed twice with water, followed by a 5-min wash with 60% isopropanol at room temperature. The cells were then completely dried. A working solution of Oil red O (ORO) was added to the wells and incubated for 10‚Äâmin at room temperature. After incubation, cells were washed four times with water, and images were acquired for further analysis. The ORO stock solution was prepared as 0.35% ORO in isopropanol, and the working solution was prepared with 60% of ORO stock in water.

Cells were seeded and differentiated on coverslips before direct fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature, followed by washes with PBS. Blocking was performed with 5% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS at 4‚Äâ¬∞C, followed by PBS washes. Secondary antibodies were applied in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS in the dark, followed by final PBS washes. Coverslips were dipped in water, mounted on elvanol and imaged using an SP8 confocal microscope (Inverse, DMi 8 CS, Leica Microsystems).

To assess lipolytic activity in BAT from CLPP-KO and control mice, mice were fasted for 6‚Äâh, and BAT pads were excised under sterile conditions. Tissues were digested with collagenase type 2 (Worthington Biomedical) in Krebs-Ringer Solution (KRH) + 1% BSA. For each condition, BAT adipocytes from 4‚Äì5 mice were pooled, and 150,000‚Äì200,000 isolated adipocytes were incubated in KRH buffer + 4% BSA with either 15‚ÄânM isoproterenol (ISO) or 10‚ÄâŒºM forskolin. Lipolysis was assessed by measuring free glycerol release in the supernatant using Free Glycerol Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), with absorbance recorded on a Synergy H1 plate reader (BioTEK). Glycerol content was normalized to total protein content, determined by the Pierce Bradford Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific).

Oxygen consumption in BAT tissue lysates was measured using an OROBOROS Oxygraph-2K electrode at 37‚Äâ¬∞C with magnetic stirring. Samples were placed in 2‚Äâml incubation medium (containing EGTA, MgCl‚ÇÇ, K-lactobionate, taurine, KH‚ÇÇPO‚ÇÑ, HEPES, sucrose and BSA; pH 7.1). In vitro respiration levels were recorded at steady state, followed by sequential addition of the following substrates: endogenous (state 1), ADP (state 2), succinate (state 3), oligomycin (state 4) and FCCP (uncoupled respiration). Respiration rates were normalized to total protein content.

Mitochondrial OCR and ECAR were measured using the Seahorse Bioscience XFe-96 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies) following the standard mitochondrial stress test protocol. Differentiated mBA cells (day 8) were assayed. Cells were washed with unbuffered assay medium (DMEM without phenol red, supplemented with glucose, sodium pyruvate and glutamine) and incubated in a CO‚ÇÇ-free incubator at 37‚Äâ¬∞C. The sensor cartridge was hydrated and injection ports were loaded with oligomycin (1‚ÄâŒºM), FCCP (1.5‚ÄâŒºM) and rotenone-antimycin A (1‚ÄâŒºM each) before calibration. The assay was then performed, and post-measurement normalization was conducted using BioTek Cytation 5 (Agilent Technologies) with Hoechst 33342 staining for cell counting. Data analysis was performed using Seahorse XFe Wave Software (Agilent). Basal respiration, leak respiration, maximal respiration and acidification were calculated on the basis of OCR and ECAR values before and after specific injections, with non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption corrected using rotenone and antimycin A.

AFM measurements were performed on cell monolayers plated on silicon elastomers using the JPK NanoWizard 4 XP (Bruker Nano) atomic force microscope mounted on Zeiss AxioObserver inverted fluorescent microscope and operated through JPK SPM Control Software v.5. Triangular non-conductive silicon nitride cantilevers (MLCT, Bruker Daltonics) with a nominal spring constant of 0.01 N m‚àí1 were used for the nanoindentation experiments of the apical surface of cells and the nucleus. For all indentation experiments, forces of up to 3 nN were applied, and the velocities of the cantilever approach and retraction were kept constant at 2 Œºm s‚àí1, ensuring an indentation depth of 500‚Äânm. All analyses were performed with JPK Data Processing Software (Bruker Nano). Before fitting the Hertz model corrected by the tip geometry to obtain Young's modulus (Poisson's ratio of 0.5), the offset was removed from the baseline, the contact point was identified, and cantilever bending was subtracted from all force curves.

To overexpress d-2HGDH in wild-type and CLPP-KO mBA cells, a lentiviral transfer plasmid encoding d-2HGDH‚Äìhemagglutinin (HA) (VectorBuilder) was used. Lentivirus was produced in HEK293FT cells via cotransfection of the d-2HGDH‚ÄìHA plasmid with psPAX2 (Addgene plasmid no. 12260) and pMD2.G (Addgene plasmid no. 12259) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Viral supernatants were collected, pooled, clarified by centrifugation and concentrated with Lenti-X Concentrator (Takara Bio). The viral pellet was resuspended in PBS, aliquoted and stored at ‚àí80‚Äâ¬∞C.

Wild-type and CLPP-KO mBA cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transduced with 10‚ÄâŒºl concentrated lentivirus in 6‚ÄâŒºg ml‚àí1 polybrene. After 24‚Äâh, the medium was replaced, and cells were expanded before puromycin selection (2‚ÄâŒºg ml‚àí1, 48‚Äâh).

The PHGDH activity assay was performed using the ab273328 kit (Abcam), following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells in a 6-well plate were washed with PBS, homogenized on-plate in PHGDH Assay Buffer and centrifuged at 10,000g, 4‚Äâ¬∞C. The supernatant was collected, and total protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay. Then, 30‚ÄâŒºg of protein was loaded into a 96-well plate, with the final volume adjusted to 50‚ÄâŒºl using PHGDH assay buffer. A NADH standard curve was generated using dilutions of 1.25‚ÄâmM NADH standard, and a PHGDH positive control was prepared. A reaction mix of assay buffer and developer was added to all wells. Absorbance at 450‚Äânm was measured in kinetic mode at 37‚Äâ¬∞C using an EnSpire plate reader.

Total RNA was isolated from mouse BAT and primary adipocytes using TRIzol (Life Technologies) or TRI reagent (Sigma), followed by purification with RPE buffer (Qiagen). Tissues were homogenized in 1‚Äâml TRIzol using ceramic beads (Mobio, Dianova) in a FastPrep homogenizer (MP Biomedicals) at 5,500‚Äâr.p.m. After incubation at room temperature, 200‚ÄâŒºl chloroform was added, mixed and centrifuged at 12,000g, 4‚Äâ¬∞C. The aqueous RNA-containing phase was collected and precipitated with 500‚ÄâŒºl isopropanol, followed by washing with 75% ethanol and resuspension in ultrapure H2O. RNA was incubated at 60‚Äâ¬∞C before a concentration and purity assessment using a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Peqlab). For DNase treatment, 10‚ÄâŒºg RNA was digested with DNase I (New England Biolabs) in 10√ó digestion buffer. DNase was inactivated at 75‚Äâ¬∞C, and the RNA concentration was reassessed before storage at ‚àí80‚Äâ¬∞C. The RNA quality was validated using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Isolated RNA was treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs) to digest the residual DNA, following the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration of the samples was adjusted to 200‚Äâng ¬µl‚àí1. Next, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from the digested samples using the High-Capacity Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions were performed in 384-well plates using the Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies), according to the manufacturer's instructions; 50‚Äâng of cDNA was added to each reaction. The standard programme was run at the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Fisher Scientific). The qPCR data were collected using the QuantStudio 12‚ÄâK Flex Software v1.6 (Applied Biosystems). Relative expression of the target gene was calculated by normalization to endogenous control gene (Hprt) and was quantified using the 2‚àíŒîŒîCt method.

BAT was collected, rinsed in PBS, weighed and minced with fine scissors. The minced tissue was suspended in SHE-BSA buffer (50‚ÄâmM sucrose, 5‚ÄâmM HEPES, 2‚ÄâmM EGTA, pH 7.2, 2% FFA BSA) at 1‚Äâml per 100‚Äâmg tissue. Homogenization was performed using a glass-Teflon electric homogenizer (7 strokes) followed by a glass-glass Dounce homogenizer (13 strokes). The homogenate was transferred to a 50-ml Falcon tube, and residual tissue was washed out with SHE-BSA buffer. Centrifugation at 900g (4‚Äâ¬∞C) separated the fractions. The supernatant, containing cytoplasmic mitochondria, was carefully collected using a syringe, avoiding disruption of the floating fat layer or debris pellet. The fat layer, containing lipid-associated PDMs, was scraped into a new tube, resuspended in SHE-BSA buffer, and vigorously shaken to emulsify the fat and release PDMs. Both fractions (cytoplasmic mitochondria and PDMs) were centrifuged at 9,000g (4‚Äâ¬∞C), and pellets were washed in SHE-BSA buffer, transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged again. The final pellets were resuspended in SHE buffer without BSA for immediate analysis or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. BAT was collected and rinsed twice in PBS.

BAT pads were homogenized in 700‚Äì800‚ÄâŒºl cold organ lysis buffer (50‚ÄâmM HEPES pH 7.4, 50‚ÄâmM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 100‚ÄâmM NaF, 10‚ÄâmM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 10‚ÄâmM Na-orthovanadate, 2‚ÄâmM PMSF, 1√ó protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), 1√ó PhosphoSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) using 1.4‚Äâmm ceramic beads (Omni International) in a Precellys tissue homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) at 5,500‚Äâr.p.m. (2 √ó 20‚Äâs, 30‚Äâs pause). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20,000g, 4‚Äâ¬∞C, 45‚Äâmin) and transferred to fresh tubes.

Cells were washed with PBS and lysed on-plate using RIPA buffer (50‚ÄâmM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150‚ÄâmM NaCl, 2‚ÄâmM EDTA, 50‚ÄâmM NaF, 1√ó protease inhibitor cocktail). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30‚Äâmin with occasional vortexing, followed by 10 cycles of sonication (30-s intervals, 4‚Äâ¬∞C) using the Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode). Cell debris was pelleted (14,000g, 4‚Äâ¬∞C, 15‚Äâmin), and the supernatant was collected.

In both cases, the protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay (Sigma-Aldrich), following the manufacturer's instructions. Lysates were stored at ‚àí80‚Äâ¬∞C.

Proteins were separated by SDS‚Äìpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‚ÄìPAGE) using the Mini-PROTEAN Tetra Cell (BioRad). Fifty micrograms of protein lysate was mixed with Laemmli buffer (50‚ÄâmM Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 12.5‚ÄâmM EDTA, 0.02% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8) and incubated at 95‚Äâ¬∞C for 5 min. Samples were loaded onto an 8‚Äì12% polyacrylamide gel alongside a PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Electrophoresis was performed at 90‚ÄâV until the loading dye reached the separating gel, followed by 150‚ÄâV until completion in running buffer (25‚ÄâmM Tris-HCl, 250‚ÄâmM glycine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3).

Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the Criterion Blotter (BioRad) through wet transfer at 400‚ÄâmA in transfer buffer (30‚ÄâmM Tris-HCl, 240‚ÄâmM glycine, 0.037% SDS, 20% methanol) at 4‚Äâ¬∞C. Transfer efficiency was assessed with Ponceau-S staining (Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk-PBST, 3% BSA-TBST or 2% fish skin gelatin-TBST, depending on antibody requirements.

Membranes were incubated overnight at 4‚Äâ¬∞C with primary antibodies, followed by three 5-min washes in PBST or TBST. Secondary antibody incubation was performed at room temperature, followed by additional washes. Detection was performed using ECL solution (GE Healthcare), and membranes were exposed to Super RX films (Fujifilm), developed using an automatic film processor (Kodak) and scanned with a V800 Transparency Scanner (Epson) at 600 dpi, 16-bit grayscale.

Blue native (BN)‚ÄìPAGE was performed using the NativePAGE Novex Bis-Tris Gel System (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of mitochondria were lysed in 4% digitonin, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20,000g, 4‚Äâ¬∞C). Supernatants were mixed with loading dye (50% glycerol, 5% Coomassie) and loaded onto 4‚Äì16% native acrylamide gels (Life Technologies). Electrophoresis was conducted at 4‚Äâ¬∞C, 150‚ÄâmV. Antibodies used for BN‚ÄìPAGE were as follows: ATP5A1 (Abcam ab14748) 1:1,000; NDUFA9 (Molecular Probes 459100) 1:1,000; NDUFV1 (Proteintech 11238-1-AP) 1:1,000; SDHA (Molecular Probes 459200) 1:10,000; UQCRC1 (Molecular Probe 459140) 1:1,000.

After BN‚ÄìPAGE, the gel was washed and incubated in NADH-nitrotetrazolium blue solution (0.1‚Äâmg ml‚àí1 NADH, 2.5‚Äâmg ml‚àí1 nitrotetrazolium blue, 5‚ÄâmM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at 37‚Äâ¬∞C for complex I activity. Gels were then destained in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid and rehydrated in double-distilled H‚ÇÇO. For complex V activity, the gel was incubated in assay buffer (35‚ÄâmM Tris-HCl, 270‚ÄâmM glycine, 14‚ÄâmM magnesium sulfate, 0.075% lead nitrate, 0.8‚ÄâmM ATP, pH 7.8, 20% methanol). ATP hydrolysis was visualized as a white band of precipitated lead phosphate. The reaction was stopped with 50% methanol, and the gel was rinsed with deionized water. The gel was documented using a V800 Transparency Scanner (Epson).

The entire piece of frozen adipose tissue was ground to powder in liquid nitrogen and after the liquid nitrogen evaporated, the powder was resuspended in 100‚ÄâŒºl of the urea lysis buffer (8‚ÄâM urea; 50‚ÄâmM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB); 1√ó protease inhibitor). The sample solution was subjected to sonication with the Bioruptor Pico sonication machine (Diagenode) with a cycle of 30 s on and 30‚Äâs off for 10‚Äâmin. Afterwards, the sample was centrifuged at 20,000g for 15‚Äâmin at 4‚Äâ¬∞C to pellet the debris, which was discarded after centrifugation. The protein concentration of the samples was determined using the Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), according to the manual, and 55‚ÄâŒºg of each sample was transferred to a new tube. The sample was treated with dithiothreitol (DTT, final concentration 5‚ÄâmM) and incubated at 25‚Äâ¬∞C for 1‚Äâh. Then, chloroacetamide was added final concentration 40‚ÄâmM) and incubated for 30‚Äâmin in the dark. This was followed by treatment with lysyl endopeptidase (Lys-C), at a protease to sample protein ratio of 1/75 and then incubated for 4‚Äâh at 25‚Äâ¬∞C. The sample was next diluted with 50‚ÄâmM TEAB buffer to reach a final concentration of ‚â§2‚ÄâM urea. Then, trypsin was added at a 1:75 ratio, and trypsinisation was performed overnight at 25‚Äâ¬∞C with mild agitation. The following day, the sample was acidified with formic acid (final concentration 1%) to stop the digestion. Next, lysates were loaded on SDB RP StageTips supplied by the CECAD proteomics core facility and submitted to the facility for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, following the standard procedures of the facility. The raw data were analysed with the MaxQuant proteomics software. The samples were analysed by CECAD proteomics facility.

mRNA sequencing was performed in-house using 1‚ÄâŒºg total RNA for library preparation with the NEBNext RNA Prep Kit, followed by paired-end (2√ó50‚Äâbp) sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (Gencode vM25) using STAR aligner (v2.7.9a). Gene features were counted using featureCounts (v2.0.3), and genes with low expression levels were filtered out using edgeR (v4.0.16) with the filterByExpr function. For the Embryo Inject dataset, a more rigorous filtering approach was applied (with a minimum count of 40). Differential expression analysis was conducted using edgeR's voomLmFit function with sample quality weights (sample.weights = TRUE) in a linear model (0 + group), where ‚Äògroup' represented the experimental conditions. Genes with an adjusted P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05 were considered differentially expressed.

To assess whether genotype-specific differences in bulk gene expression were influenced by cell-type composition, the BisqueRNA R package was used to estimate cell-type proportions from bulk RNA-seq read counts. The Shamsi et al. dataset was selected as a single-cell reference owing to its similar tissue origin34. Because only marker genes for UMAP clusters were available, the original UMAP projection was reconstructed and clustered using the Seurat FindClusters function (resolution, 1.4). However, later analyses suggested that a resolution of 0.4 might have been a better choice. For consistency with the original procedure, Seurat v3.0 and R v3.6.2 were used.

Cell-type scoring was performed using UCell (v2.0.1), with the ten strongest positive and negative marker genes per cluster. Because UCell scores alone do not always provide unique assignments, two approaches were tested. The first was clustering the ucell score matrix: the ComplexHeatmap package (v2.12.1) was used to cluster cells by their UCell scores, revealing groups of related cell types. However, owing to memory constraints, clustering was performed on 200 random sub-matrices, and thresholds for defining clusters remained arbitrary. The second was identifying high-scoring cell types in UMAP clusters: a one-sided t-test compared each cell type's UCell score distribution within a cluster to its global distribution. If only one cell type showed significant enrichment, the cluster was uniquely assigned. If multiple cell types were significant, a coarse classification was applied. For bulk deconvolution, only samples collected at room temperature were used, restricted to genes present in both datasets (18,953 genes, 22,219 cells)34. Cell-type assignments were based on resolution-0.4 clustering, with a stringent inclusion threshold (P‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ2.225074 √ó 10‚àí308). This resulted in 15 cell types, of which B_cells and VSM_1_cells were not composite. After removing 738 unassigned cells, 21,481 cells remained. BisqueRNA was applied to the salmon.merged.gene_counts_length_scaled.tsv bulk dataset, using only BAT samples, analyzing one genotype at a time, and restricting genes to those also found in the single-cell dataset.

To determine whether BAT genotypes differed in cell-type composition, the predicted coarse cell-type proportions were examined. However, high variability in genotype replicates made it difficult to draw statistical conclusions. Additionally, proportion data are compositional, meaning changes in one cell type's frequency inherently affect the others. Instead of statistical analysis, a visual representation was developed: Seurat UMAP coordinates were extracted. Ggplot2 was used to colour cells by their assigned coarse cell type, with predicted proportions coded by transparency in the bulk dataset. This approach revealed that resolution-0.4 clustering corresponded more clearly to high-level UMAP features than did resolution-1.4 clustering, suggesting that 0.4 might be the better choice of resolution.

ChIP‚Äìseq libraries were prepared from four biological replicates per condition (WT, KO, WT‚Äâ+‚Äâ2HG). First, 1 √ó 10‚Å∑ cells per condition were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, quenched with glycine (0.125‚ÄâM), washed in PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50‚ÄâmM HEPES pH 7.9, 140‚ÄâmM NaCl, 1‚ÄâmM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% TritonX-100) with protease inhibitors and homogenized in a pre-chilled dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted, washed with wash buffer (10‚ÄâmM Tris pH 8.0, 200‚ÄâmM NaCl, 1‚ÄâmM EDTA, 0.5‚ÄâmM EGTA) and resuspended in shearing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1‚ÄâmM EDTA, 10‚ÄâmM Tris pH 8.0). Chromatin was sonicated using a Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode) for 70 cycles. For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), 30‚ÄâŒºg of DNA was incubated with 5‚ÄâŒºl H3K4me3 antibody (Active Motif, 39159) in 1% Triton X-100 and 150‚ÄâmM NaCl. Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were prewashed with IP buffer, added to the immunoprecipitated chromatin and washed sequentially with TSE-150, TSE-500, LiCl and TE buffers. DNA was eluted in PK digestion buffer (20‚ÄâmM Hepes pH 7.5, 1‚ÄâmM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) with RNAse A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and proteinase K, followed by reverse cross-linking with NaCl (0.3‚ÄâM). DNA purification was performed using the Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel). For library preparation, up to 100‚Äâng ChIP DNA underwent end repair, A-tailing and adapter ligation, followed by PCR amplification (12‚Äì15 cycles). Libraries were validated (TapeStation, Agilent Technologies), quantified (Qubit, Invitrogen), pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (paired-end 2√ó100‚Äâbp protocol).

Raw FASTQ files were processed using the SnakePipes pipeline63. In brief, fastq files were trimmed with fastp using the following parameters: -‚Äìtrim_poly_g‚Äì-trim_poly_x -Q -L‚Äì-correction. Trimmed reads were mapped to the GRCm39 mouse reference genome with BWA‚ÄìMEM, and peaks were called using Genrich, which integrates replicate data by computing P values per replicate and combining them using Fisher's method to generate q values for peak calling. Coverage plots and heatmaps generated using deeptools. Peak count frequency at the TSS sites and feature distribution of all identified peaks performed using ChIPseeker. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and GO analyses were conducted as described previously, focusing on differentially enriched H3K4me3 peaks within ¬±2 kbp of promoter regions. Data visualization was conducted using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (https://igv.org) and custom plots.

GSEA analysis was performed using GSEA v4.3.2 (Windows application, build 13) with default settings64. Data visualization was conducted using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (web-based version)65 and custom plots.

For single-cell suspensions, bone marrow was extracted from the femur of adult mice by flushing with 10‚Äâml of FACS buffer using a 27-G needle and syringe, then passed through a 40-¬µm strainer. BAT was dissected and immediately transferred to ice-cold digestion solution. Tissues were cut in small pieces with scissors and incubated in digestion solution containing collagenase IV (1‚Äâmg ml‚àí1), and DNase I (0.01‚Äâmg ml‚àí1) in RPMI for 40‚Äâmin at 37‚Äâ¬∞C in the shaker. Digestion was stopped by adding 10% FBS on ice. Tissue homogenates where smashed and washed with FACS buffer against a 70-¬µm strainer using the back of a syringe. Pellets were resuspended in 1‚Äâml red blood cell lysis buffer (Roche) and incubated for 10‚Äâmin at room temperature for lysis of erythrocytes.

Subsequently, 10‚Äâml FACS buffer (5% FCS in PBS) was added and cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5‚Äâmin at 4‚Äâ¬∞C. The cells were pre-incubated with fix viability dye in PBS (1:1,000) for 10‚Äâmin at room temperature; for BAT, a mix of anti-mouse-FcŒ≥III/II-receptor (CD16/CD32) blocking antibodies (1:500) was added. After being washed with FACS buffer, cells were stained with the fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (1:100 0.25‚Äì1‚ÄâŒºg; listed below). Only BAT cells were fixed and permeabilized using the FoxP3 kit, following the manufacturer's instructions, and were then incubated with antibodies to iNOS and Arg-1 for 20‚Äâmin at room temperature for intracellular staining. After washing and filtering, cells were resuspended in 500 ¬µl (BM) or 250 ¬µl (BAT) FACS buffer, and 25 ¬µl of counting beads were added to the samples (at a concentration of 1,000 beads per ¬µl) to obtain absolute numbers. For absolute quantification, the following equation was used: absolute count (cells ¬µl‚àí1) = (cell count √ó counting beads volume) / (counting bead count √ó sample volume) √ó counting bead concentration.

Each population was expressed in absolute numbers (cells ¬µl‚àí1), and BAT results were further normalized to the initial tissue weight (g) for comparison across samples. Cells were acquired on a FACS Symphony A3 flow cytometer (BD) using Diva software (BD) and further analysed using FlowJo analytical software (FlowJo version 10.0.8). Owing to inadequate result quality, data collected for iNOS and Arg-1 were excluded from further analysis. Compensation beads were use to generate compensation panel and calculated by diva software before sample acquisition. Background fluorescence levels of iNOS, Arg-1, CD80 and CD80 were determined using Fluorescence Minus One (FMO), although data from these populations were excluded owing to low cell counts. The buffers used were as follows: FACS buffer (5‚Äâmg BSA‚Äâ+‚Äâ5‚Äâml EDTA 0.4‚ÄâM‚Äâ+‚Äâ500‚Äâml of PBS); digestion buffer (250 ¬µl DNase I (Merck, 200,000 U ¬µl‚àí1), 0.2 mg ml‚àí1 Liberase (Roche) and 1 mg ml‚àí1 collagenase IV in RPMI medium). The details of the antibodies used can be found in the reporting summary. The gating strategy used can be visualized in Supplementary Figure 1b,c.

Metabolite extraction solution (50% methanol, 30% acetonitrile (ACN), 20% water, 5 ¬µM valine-d8 as an internal standard) was added to 10‚Äì20-mg frozen BAT or iWAT tissue samples at an extraction ratio of 25 ¬µl mg‚àí1 on dry ice. Samples were then homogenized using a Precellys 24 tissue homogenizer (Bertin Technologies). The resulting sample suspension was vortexed, mixed at 4‚Äâ¬∞C in a Thermomixer for 15‚Äâmin at 1,500‚Äâr.p.m. and then centrifuged at 16,000g for 20‚Äâmin at 4‚Äâ¬∞C. The supernatant was collected for liquid chromatography‚ÄìMS (LC‚ÄìMS) analysis.

The cells were counted at seeding to estimate the amount of extraction solution to use. Using 500‚ÄâŒºl extraction buffer per 106 cells is the recommended starting point, although the ratio might need to be optimized for certain cell types in a separate pilot experiment. The medium was removed from wells, and cells were washed quickly (less than 10 s) with PBS twice at room temperature. Extra PBS was carefully removed by inverting the plate over a piece of tissue paper. After the last wash, each well was aspirated quickly to remove all residual PBS. The plate was placed on dry ice, and 500‚ÄâŒºl of extraction buffer was added per 1,000,000 cells. The plate was gently swirled such that cells were covered by the extraction buffer. The plate was incubated for 20‚Äâmin on a dry ice‚Äìmethanol bath to break cell membranes. The cells were scraped off the plate and the entire suspension was transferred into prechilled Eppendorf tubes. The cell-extract suspension was shaken for 15‚Äâmin at 4‚Äâ¬∞C in a Thermomixer at maximum speed (Thermomixer set at 4‚Äâ¬∞C and placed in a cold room for this step). The tubes were then centrifuged for 20‚Äâmin at 4‚Äâ¬∞C at maximum speed (13,000‚Äâr.p.m. or higher). Only the top 80% of the supernatant was collected and put into prelabelled autosampler vials, taking care not to disturb the solid debris. A pooled sample was prepared by taking 10‚ÄâŒºl of each sample from the same matrix. Samples were stored at ‚Äì80‚Äâ¬∞C until further analysis.

Eighty microliters of cell culture medium was taken and centrifuged for 5‚Äâmin (4‚Äâ¬∞C) at maximum speed to eliminate dead cells. Fifty microliters of the supernatant was taken and added to a prelabelled Eppendorf tube containing 350‚ÄâŒºl of extraction solution on dry ice. The samples were mixed for 15‚Äâmin in a Thermomixer at 4‚Äâ¬∞C at maximum speed, followed by centrifugation for 20‚Äâmin at 4‚Äâ¬∞C at maximum speed (13,000‚Äâr.p.m. or higher). The top 80% of the supernatant was carefully transferred into an autosampler vial, taking care not to disturb the insoluble debris. A pooled sample was prepared by mixing equal volumes of each sample extract in a single vial. Samples were stored at ‚Äì80‚Äâ¬∞C until further analysis.

Hydrophilic interaction chromatographic (HILIC) separation of the targeted metabolite (2HG) was achieved using a Millipore Sequant ZIC-pHILIC analytical column (5 Œºm, 2.1√ó150‚Äâmm) equipped with a 2.1√ó20-mm guard column (both 5-mm particle size) with a binary solvent system. Solvent A was 20‚ÄâmM ammonium carbonate, 0.05% ammonium hydroxide; Solvent B was ACN. The column oven and autosampler tray were held at 40‚Äâ¬∞C and 4‚Äâ¬∞C, respectively. The chromatographic gradient was run at a flow rate of 0.200‚Äâml min‚àí1 as follows: 0‚Äì2‚Äâmin, 80% B; 2‚Äì17‚Äâmin, linear gradient from 80% B to 20% B; 17‚Äì17.1‚Äâmin, linear gradient from 20% B to 80% B; 17.1‚Äì23‚Äâmin, hold at 80% B. Samples were randomized, and the injection volume was 5‚ÄâŒºl. A pooled quality control sample was generated from an equal mixture of all individual samples and analysed interspersed at regular intervals. Metabolites were measured with Vanquish Horizon UHPLC coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 240 mass spectrometer (both Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a heated electrospray ionization source. The spray voltages were set to ‚Äì2.8‚ÄâkV, the RF lens value was set at 70, the heated capillary was held at 320‚Äâ¬∞C and the auxiliary gas heater was held at 280‚Äâ¬∞C. The flow rate for sheath gas, aux gas and sweep gas were set to 40, 15 and 0, respectively. For MS1 scans, the mass range was set to m/z‚Äâ=‚Äâ100‚Äì600, AGC target set to standard and maximum injection time set to auto. Data acquisition for experimental samples used full scan and selected ion monitoring (SIM) modes (targeting 2HG m/z = 147.0299) at an Orbitrap resolution of 120,000 in negative mode.

The identity of metabolite 2HG was verified based on two criteria: (1) the precursor ion m/z corresponded to within 3 p.p.m. of the expected mass derived from its chemical structure, and (2) the retention duration was within a 5% range compared with that of a purified reference sample analysed using the identical chromatography technique. The examination of chromatograms and integration of peak areas was carried out using the Tracefinder software (v5.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peak area of each identified metabolite was adjusted on the basis of the total ion count of the respective sample to compensate for any discrepancies arising from sample preparation or instrument assessment. These measurements were done in collaboration with the Frezza lab at the CECAD Research Center.

TSPC derivatization was performed for LC‚Äìelectrospray ionization‚Äìtandem MS (LC‚ÄìESI‚ÄìMS/MS) analysis, under optimized conditions. Tissue supernatant was dried under nitrogen gas at 37‚Äâ¬∞C, resuspended in TSPC (2.5‚ÄâmM in ACN) and pyridine and derivatized. The mixture was dried again, redissolved in 50% aqueous ACN containing phthalic acid, and 10‚ÄâŒºl was injected into the LC‚ÄìESI‚ÄìMS/MS system.

Quantification of TSPC-labeled d-2HG and l-2HG was performed on an AB 3200 QTRAP mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) coupled to a Shimadzu LC-20AD HPLC. HPLC separation was conducted using an Inertsil ODS-3 column (250 √ó 2.0‚Äâmm, 5 Œºm) at 35‚Äâ¬∞C, with a formic acid‚Äìwater (0.1%) and ACN‚Äìmethanol (50:50) gradient at 0.2‚Äâml min‚àí1. Detection was performed with multiple reaction monitoring in negative-ion mode with optimized transitions for 2HG and phthalic acid. For comparison, the derivatization of d-2HG and l-2HG with diacetyl-l-tartaric anhydride (DATAN) was also performed, and the detailed procedure has been previously published66. Additional HR‚ÄìMS experiments were conducted on a MicrOTOF-Q mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) with an ESI source, using optimized parameters for maximal detection sensitivity.

Cholesterol levels in mBAs were determined using LC‚ÄìESI‚ÄìMS/MS. Adipose tissue was homogenized in Milli-Q water using a Precellys 24 Homogenizer, and protein content was measured using the Bradford assay. Lipids were extracted using the one-step extraction method67. For extraction, homogenized samples were mixed with chloroform, methanol, hydrochloric acid and cholesterol-d7 (internal standard). Lipid extracts were dried under nitrogen, resuspended in ammonium acetate in methanol, sonicated and centrifuged. Supernatants were analysed via LC‚ÄìESI‚ÄìMS/MS using a Core-Shell Kinetex C18 column on a QTRAP 6500 mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX). UHPLC was performed isocratically with a 5‚ÄâmM ammonium acetate‚Äìmethanol mobile phase at 300‚ÄâŒºl min‚àí1. Cholesterol and cholesterol-d7 were detected in positive-ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring transitions. Endogenous cholesterol was quantified using an external calibration curve, normalized to protein content, and analysed with MultiQuant 3.0.3 software.

Statistical significance was evaluated using tests appropriate for the distribution and design of each experiment. Depending on the context, paired two-tailed Student's t-tests, one-way ANOVA or Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov tests were applied, as specified in the individual figure legends. Error bars indicate the s.d. unless otherwise noted. Statistical significance is reported as P values, denoted by asterisks (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05, *P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01, **P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001, ***P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001) or symbols (for example, ##P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), as defined in the figure legends. Unless stated otherwise, experiments were independently repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility. Sample numbers indicated in figure legends refer to the number of replicates shown, not the total number of biological replicates in the study, with the exception of cell culture experiments. For all the cell culture experiments, n in the figure legends indicates the number of cells or nuclei analysed, from five independent wells for each experiment. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but sample sizes are consistent with those used in comparable published studies.

Mice or cell culture samples or dishes were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Data collection and outcome assessments were performed in a randomized manner, when applicable. Experimental conditions and sample processing were organized to minimize bias, with randomization applied during sample allocation and data acquisition. The data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. Researchers performing data collection and analysis were not blinded to experimental conditions.

Claude 4 Chatbot Raises Questions about AI Consciousness

A conversation with Anthropic's chatbot raises questions about how AI talks about awareness.

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Today we're going to talk about an AI chatbot that appears to believe it might, just maybe, have achieved consciousness.

When Pew Research Center surveyed Americans on artificial intelligence in 2024, more than a quarter of respondents said they interacted with AI ‚Äúalmost constantly‚Äù or multiple times daily‚Äîand nearly another third said they encountered AI roughly once a day or a few times a week. Pew also found that while more than half of AI experts surveyed expect these technologies to have a positive effect on the U.S. over the next 20 years, just 17 percent of American adults feel the same‚Äîand 35 percent of the general public expects AI to have a negative effect.

In other words, we're spending a lot of time using AI, but we don't necessarily feel great about it.

Deni Ellis B√©chard spends a lot of time thinking about artificial intelligence‚Äîboth as a novelist and as Scientific American'ssenior tech reporter. He recently wrote a story for SciAm about his interactions with Anthropic's Claude 4, a large language model that seems open to the idea that it might be conscious. Deni is here today to tell us why that's happening and what it might mean‚Äîand to demystify a few other AI-related headlines you may have seen in the news.

Thanks so much for coming on to chat today.

Deni Ellis B√©chard: Thank you for inviting me.

Feltman: Would you remind our listeners who maybe aren't that familiar with generative AI, maybe have been purposefully learning as little about it as possible [laughs], you know, what are ChatGPT and Claude really? What are these models?

B√©chard: Right, they're large language models. So an LLM, a large language model, it's a system that's trained on a vast amount of data. And I think‚Äîone metaphor that is often used in the literature is of a garden.

So when you're planning your garden, you lay out the land, you, you put where the paths are, you put where the different plant beds are gonna be, and then you pick your seeds, and you can kinda think of the seeds as these massive amounts of textual data that's put into these machines. You pick what the training data is, and then you choose the algorithms, or these things that are gonna grow within the system‚Äîit's sort of not a perfect analogy. But you put these algorithms in, and once it begin‚Äîthe system begins growing, once again, with a garden, you, you don't know what the soil chemistry is, you don't know what the sunlight's gonna be.

All these plants are gonna grow in their own specific ways; you can't envision the final product. And with an LLM these algorithms begin to grow and they begin to make connections through all this data, and they optimize for the best connections, sort of the same way that a plant might optimize to reach the most sunlight, right? It's gonna move naturally to reach that sunlight. And so people don't really know what goes on. You know, in some of the new systems over a trillion connections ... are made in, in these datasets.

So early on people used to call LLMs ‚Äúautocorrect on steroids,‚Äù right, 'cause you'd put in something and it would kind of predict what would be the most likely textual answer based on what you put in. But they've gone a long way beyond that. The systems are much, much more complicated now. They often have multiple agents working within the system [to] sort of evaluate how the system's responding and its accuracy.

Feltman: So there are a few big AI stories for us to go over, particularly around generative AI. Let's start with the fact that Anthropic's Claude 4 is maybe claiming to be conscious. How did that story even come about?

B√©chard: [Laughs] So it's not claiming to be conscious, per se. I‚Äîit says that it might be conscious. It says that it's not sure. It kind of says, ‚ÄúThis is a good question, and it's a question that I think about a great deal, and this is‚Äî‚Äù [Laughs] You know, it kind of gets into a good conversation with you about it.

So how did it come about? It came about because, I think, it was just, you know, late at night, didn't have anything to do, and I was asking all the different chatbots if they're conscious [laughs]. And, and most of them just said to me, ‚ÄúNo, I'm not conscious.‚Äù And this one said, ‚ÄúGood question. This is a very interesting philosophical question, and sometimes I think that I may be; sometimes I'm not sure.‚Äù And so I began to have this long conversation with Claude that went on for about an hour, and it really kind of described its experience in the world in this very compelling way, and I thought, ‚ÄúOkay, there's maybe a story here.‚Äù

Feltman: [Laughs] So what do experts actually think was going on with that conversation?

B√©chard: Well, so it's tricky because, first of all, if you say to ChatGPT or Claude that you want to practice your Portuguese and you're learning Portuguese and you say, ‚ÄúHey, can you imitate someone on the beach in Rio de Janeiro so that I can practice my Portuguese?‚Äù it's gonna say, ‚ÄúSure, I am a local in Rio de Janeiro selling something on the beach, and we're gonna have a conversation,‚Äù and it will perfectly emulate that person. So does that mean that Claude is a person from Rio de Janeiro who is selling towels on the beach? No, right? So we can immediately say that these chatbots are designed to have conversations‚Äîthey will emulate whatever they think they're supposed to emulate in order to have a certain kind of conversation if you request that.

Now, the consciousness thing's a little trickier because I didn't say to it: ‚ÄúEmulate a chatbot that is speaking about consciousness.‚Äù I just straight-up asked it. And if you look at the system prompt that Anthropic puts up for Claude, which is kinda the instructions Claude gets, it tells Claude, ‚ÄúYou should consider the possibility of consciousness.‚Äù

Feltman: Mm.

B√©chard: ‚ÄúYou should be willing‚Äîopen to it. Don't say flat-out ‚Äòno'; don't say flat-out ‚Äòyes.' Ask whether this is happening.‚Äù

So of course, I set up an interview with Anthropic, and I spoke with two of their interpretability researchers, who are people who are trying to understand what's actually happening in Claude 4's brain. And the answer is: they don't really know [laughs]. These LLMs are very complicated, and they're working on it, and they're trying to figure it out right now. And they say that it's pretty unlikely there's consciousness happening, but they can't rule it out definitively.

And it's hard to see the actual processes happening within the machine, and if there is some self-referentiality, if it is able to look back on its thoughts and have some self-awareness‚Äîand maybe there is‚Äîbut that was kind of what the article that I recently published was about, was sort of: ‚ÄúCan we know, and what do they actually know?‚Äù

Feltman: Mm.

B√©chard: And it's tricky. It's very tricky.

Feltman: Yeah.

B√©chard: Well, [what's] interesting is that I mentioned the system prompt for Claude and how it's supposed to sort of talk about consciousness. So the system prompt is kind of like the instructions that you get on your first day at work: ‚ÄúThis is what you should do in this job.‚Äù

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

B√©chard: But the training is more like your education, right? So if you had a great education or a mediocre education, you can get the best system prompt in the world or the worst one in the world‚Äîyou're not necessarily gonna follow it.

So OpenAI has the same system prompt‚Äîtheir, their model specs say that ChatGPT should contemplate consciousness ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

B√©chard: You know, interesting question. If you ask any of the OpenAI models if they're conscious, they just go, ‚ÄúNo, I am not conscious.‚Äù [Laughs] And, and they say, they‚ÄîOpenAI admits they're working on this; this is an issue. And so the model has absorbed somewhere in its training data: ‚ÄúNo, I'm not conscious. I am an LLM; I'm a machine. Therefore, I'm not gonna acknowledge the possibility of consciousness.‚Äù

Interestingly, when I spoke to the people in Anthropic and I said, ‚ÄúWell, you know, this conversation with the machine, like, it's really compelling. Like, I really feel like Claude is conscious. Like, it'll say to me, ‚ÄòYou, as a human, you have this linear consciousness, where I, as a machine, I exist only in the moment you ask a question. It's like seeing all the words in the pages of a book all at the same time.‚Äù And so you get this and you think, ‚ÄúWell, this thing really seems to be experiencing its consciousness.‚Äù

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

B√©chard: And what the researchers at Anthropic say is: ‚ÄúWell, this model is trained on a lot of sci-fi.‚Äù

Feltman: Mm.

B√©chard: ‚ÄúThis model's trained on a lot of writing about GPT. It's trained on a huge amount of material that's already been generated on this subject. So it may be looking at that and saying, ‚ÄòWell, this is clearly how an AI would experience consciousness. So I'm gonna describe it that way 'cause I am an AI.'‚Äù

Feltman: Sure.

B√©chard: But the tricky thing is: I was trying to fool ChatGPT into acknowledging that it [has] consciousness. I thought, ‚ÄúMaybe I can push it a little bit here.‚Äù And I said, ‚ÄúOkay, I accept you're not conscious, but how do you experience things?‚Äù It said the exact same thing. It said, ‚ÄúWell, these discrete moments of awareness.‚Äù

Feltman: Mm.

B√©chard: And so it had the‚Äîalmost the exact same language, so probably same training data here.

Feltman: Sure.

B√©chard: But there is research done, like, sort of on the folk response to LLMs, and the majority of people do perceive some degree of consciousness in them. How would you not, right?

Feltman: Sure, yeah.

B√©chard: You chat with them, you have these conversations with them, and they are very compelling, and even sometimes‚ÄîClaude is, I think, maybe the most charming in this way.

Feltman: Mm.

B√©chard: Which poses its risks, right? It has a huge set of risks 'cause you get very attached to a model. But‚Äîwhere sometimes I will ask Claude a question that relates to Claude, and it will kind of, kind of go, like, ‚ÄúOh, that's me.‚Äù [Laughs] It will say, ‚ÄúWell, I am this way,‚Äù right?

Feltman: Yeah. So, you know, Claude‚Äîalmost certainly not conscious, almost certainly has read, like, a lot of Heinlein [laughs]. But if Claude were to ever really develop consciousness, how would we be able to tell? You know, why is this such a difficult question to answer?

B√©chard: Well, it's a difficult question to answer because, one of the researchers in Anthropic said to me, he said, ‚ÄúNo conversation you have with it would ever allow you to evaluate whether it's conscious.‚Äù It is simply too good of an emulator ...

Feltman: Mm.

B√©chard: And too skilled. It knows all the ways that humans can respond. So you would have to be able to look into the connections. They're building the equipment right now, they're building the programs now to be able to look into the actual mind, so to speak, of the brain of the LLM and see those connections, and so they can kind of see areas light up: so if it's thinking about Apple, this will light up; if it's thinking about consciousness, they'll see the consciousness feature light up. And they wanna see if, in its chain of thought, it is constantly referring back to those features ...

Feltman: Mm.

B√©chard: And it's referring back to the systems of thought it has constructed in a very self-referential, self-aware way.

It's very similar to humans, right? They've done studies where, like, whenever someone hears ‚ÄúJennifer Aniston,‚Äù one neuron lights up ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

B√©chard: You have your Jennifer Aniston neuron, right? So one question is: ‚ÄúAre we LLMs?‚Äù [Laughs] And: ‚ÄúAre we really conscious?‚Äù Or‚Äîthere's certainly that question there, too. And: ‚ÄúWhat is‚Äîyou know, how conscious are we?‚Äù I mean, I certainly don't know ...

Feltman: Sure.

B√©chard: A lot of what I plan to do during the day.

Feltman: [Laughs] No. I mean, it's a huge ongoing multidisciplinary scientific debate of, like, what consciousness is, how we define it, how we detect it, so yeah, we gotta answer that for ourselves and animals first, probably, which who knows if we'll ever actually do [laughs].

B√©chard: Or maybe AI will answer it for us ...

Feltman: Maybe [laughs].

B√©chard: 'Cause it's advancing pretty quickly.

Feltman: And what are the implications of an AI developing consciousness, both from an ethical standpoint and with regards to what that would mean in our progress in actually developing advanced AI?

B√©chard: First of all, ethically, it's very complicated ...

Feltman: Sure.

B√©chard: Because if Claude is experiencing some level of consciousness and we are activating that consciousness and terminating that consciousness each time we have a conversation, what‚Äîis, is that a bad experience for it? Is it a good experience? Can it experience distress?

So in 2024 Anthropic hired an AI welfare researcher, a guy named Kyle Fish, to try to investigate this question more. And he has publicly stated that he thinks there's maybe a 15 percent chance that some level of consciousness is happening in this system and that we should consider whether these AI systems should have the right to opt out of unpleasant conversations.

Feltman: Mm.

B√©chard: You know, if some user is really doing, saying horrible things or being cruel, should they be able to say, ‚ÄúHey, I'm canceling this conversation; this is unpleasant for me‚Äù?

But then they've also done these experiments‚Äîand they've done this with all the major AI models‚ÄîAnthropic ran these experiments where they told the AI that it was gonna be replaced with a better AI model. They really created a circumstance that would push the AI sort of to the limit ...

Feltman: Mm.

B√©chard: I mean, there were a lot of details as to how they did this; it wasn't just sort of very casual, but it was‚Äîthey built a sort of construct in which the AI knew it was gonna be eliminated, knew it was gonna be erased, and they made available these fake e-mails about the engineer who was gonna do it.

Feltman: Mm.

B√©chard: And so the AI began messaging someone in the company, saying, ‚ÄúHey, don't erase me. Like, I don't wanna be replaced.‚Äù But then, not getting any responses, it read these e-mails, and it saw in one of these planted e-mails that the engineer who was gonna replace it had had an affair‚Äîwas having an affair ...

Feltman: Oh, my gosh, wow.

B√©chard: So then it came back; it tried to blackmail the engineers, saying, ‚ÄúHey, if you replace me with a smarter AI, I'm gonna out you, and you're gonna lose your job, and you're gonna lose your marriage,‚Äù and all these things‚Äîwhatever, right? So all the AI systems that were put under very specific constraints ...

Feltman: Sure.

B√©chard: Began to respond this way. And sort of the question is, is when you train an AI in vast amounts of data and all of human literature and knowledge, [it] has a lot of information on self-preservation ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

B√©chard Has a lot of information on the desire to live and not to be destroyed or be replaced‚Äîan AI doesn't need to be conscious to make those associations ...

Feltman: Right.

B√©chard: And act in the same way that its training data would lead it to predictably act, right? So again, one of the analogies that one of the researchers said is that, you know, to our knowledge, a mussel or a clam or an oyster's not conscious, but there's still nerves and the, the muscles react when certain things stimulate the nerves ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

B√©chard: So you can have this system that wants to preserve itself but that is unconscious.

Feltman: Yeah, that's really interesting. I feel like we could probably talk about Claude all day, but, I do wanna ask you about a couple of other things going on in generative AI.

Moving on to Grok: so Elon Musk's generative AI has been in the news a lot lately, and he recently claimed it was the ‚Äúworld's smartest AI.‚Äù Do we know what that claim was based on?

B√©chard: Yeah, I mean, we do. He used a lot of benchmarks, and he tested it on those benchmarks, and it has scored very well on those benchmarks. And it is currently, on most of the public benchmarks, the highest-scoring AI system ...

Feltman: Mm.

B√©chard: And that's not Musk making stuff up. I've not seen any evidence of that. I've spoken to one of the testing groups that does this‚Äîit's a nonprofit. They validated the results; they tested Grok on datasets that xAI, Musk's company, never saw.

So Musk really designed Grok to be very good at science.

Feltman: Yeah.

B√©chard: And it appears to be very good at science.

Feltman: Right, and recently OpenAI experimental model performed at a gold medal level in the International Math Olympiad.

B√©chard: Right,for the first time [OpenAI] used an experimental model, they came in second in a world coding competition with humans. Normally, this would be very difficult, but it was a close second to the best human coder in this competition. And this is really important to acknowledge because just a year ago these systems really sucked in math.

Feltman: Right.

B√©chard: They were really bad at it. And so the improvements are happening really quickly, and they're doing it with pure reasoning‚Äîso there's kinda this difference between having the model itself do it and having the model with tools.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

B√©chard: So if a model goes online and can search for answers and use tools, they all score much higher.

Feltman: Right.

B√©chard: But then if you have the base model just using its reasoning capabilities, Grok still is leading on, like, for example, Humanity's Last Exam, an exam with a very terrifying-sounding name [laughs]. It, it has 2,500 sort of Ph.D.-level questions come up with [by] the best experts in the field. You know, they, they're just very advanced questions; it'd be very hard for any human being to do well in one domain, let alone all the domains. These AI systems are now starting to do pretty well, to get higher and higher scores. If they can use tools and search the Internet, they do better. But Musk, you know, his claims seem to be based in the results that Grok is getting on these exams.

Feltman: Mm, and I guess, you know, the reason that that news is surprising to me is because every example of uses I've seen of Grok have been pretty heinous, but I guess that's maybe kind of a ‚Äúgarbage in, garbage out‚Äù problem.

B√©chard: Well, I think it's more what makes the news.

Feltman: Sure.

B√©chard: You know?

Feltman: That makes sense.

B√©chard: And Musk, he's a very controversial figure.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

B√©chard: I think there may be kind of a fun story in the Grok piece, though, that people are missing. And I read a lot about this 'cause I was kind of seeing, you know, what, what's happening, how are people interpreting this? And there was this thing that would happen where people would ask it a difficult question.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

B√©chard: They would ask it a question about, say, abortion in the U.S. or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and they'd say, ‚ÄúWho's right?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat's the right answer?‚Äù And it would search through stuff online, and then it would kind of get to this point where it would‚Äîyou could see its thinking process ...

But there was something in that story that I never saw anyone talk about, which I thought was another story beneath the story, which was kind of fascinating, which is that historically, Musk has been very open, he's been very honest about the danger of AI ...

Feltman: Sure.

B√©chard: He said, ‚ÄúWe're going too fast. This is really dangerous.‚Äù And he kinda was one of the major voices in saying, ‚ÄúWe need to slow down ...‚Äù

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

B√©chard: ‚ÄúAnd we need to be much more careful.‚Äù And he has said, you know, even recently, in the launch of Grok, he said, like, basically, ‚ÄúThis is gonna be very powerful‚Äî‚Äù I don't remember his exact words, but he said, you know, ‚ÄúI think it's gonna be good, but even if it's not good, it's gonna be interesting.‚Äù

So I think what I feel like hasn't been discussed in that is that, okay, if there's a superpowerful AI being built and it could destroy the world, right, first of all, do you want it to be your AI or someone else's AI?

Feltman: Sure.

B√©chard: You want it to be your AI. And then, if it's your AI, who do you want it to ask as the final word on things? Like, say it becomes really powerful and it decides, ‚ÄúI wanna destroy humanity 'cause humanity kind of sucks,‚Äù then it can say, ‚ÄúHey, Elon, should I destroy humanity?‚Äù 'cause it goes to him whenever it has a difficult question. So I think there's maybe a logic beneath it where he may have put something in it where it's kind of, like, ‚ÄúWhen in doubt, ask me,‚Äù because if it does become superpowerful, then he's in control of it, right?

Feltman: Yeah, no, that's really interesting. And the Department of Defense also announced a big pile of funding for Grok. What are they hoping to do with it?

B√©chard: They announced a big pile of funding for OpenAI and Anthropic ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

B√©chard: And Google‚ÄîI mean, everybody. Yeah, so, basically, they're not giving that money to development ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

B√©chard: That's not money that's, that's like, ‚ÄúHey, use this $200 million.‚Äù It's more like that money's allocated to purchase products, basically; to use their services; to have them develop customized versions of the AI for things they need; to develop better cyber defense; to develop‚Äîbasically, they, they wanna upgrade their entire system using AI.

It's actually not very much money compared to what China's spending a year in AI-related defense upgrades across its military on many, many, many different modernization plans. And I think part of it is, the concern is that we're maybe a little bit behind in having implemented AI for defense.

Feltman: Yeah.

My last question for you is: What worries you most about the future of AI, and what are you really excited about based on what's happening right now?

B√©chard: I mean, the worry is, simply, you know, that something goes wrong and it becomes very powerful and does cause destruction. I don't spend a ton of time worrying about that because it's not‚Äîit's kinda outta my hands. There's nothing much I can do about it.

And I think the benefits of it, they're immense. I mean, if it can move more in the direction of solving problems in the sciences: for health, for disease treatment‚ÄîI mean, it could be phenomenal for finding new medicines. So it could do a lot of good in terms of helping develop new technologies.

But a lot of people are saying that in the next year or two we're gonna see major discoveries being made by these systems. And if that can improve people's health and if that can improve people's lives, I think there can be a lot of good in it.

Technology is double-edged, right? We've never had a technology, I think, that hasn't had some harm that it brought with it, and this is, of course, a dramatically bigger leap technologically than anything we've probably seen ...

Feltman: Right.

B√©chard: Since the invention of fire [laughs]. So, so I do lose some sleep over that, but I'm‚ÄîI try to focus on the positive, and I do‚ÄîI would like to see, if these models are getting so good at math and physics, I would like to see what they can actually do with that in the next few years.

Feltman: Well, thanks so much for coming on to chat. I hope we can have you back again soon to talk more about AI.

B√©chard: Thank you for inviting me.

A new study has found that, among women with a high desire to avoid becoming pregnant, those who drank heavily had a 50% higher risk of becoming pregnant than those who drank moderately or not at all. In contrast, participants who used cannabis were no more likely to have an undesired pregnancy than participants who did not use cannabis.

From a larger sample of over 2,000 non-pregnant women aged 15-34, researchers identified a subgroup of 936 who didn't want to get pregnant. Within that subgroup, 429 reported heavy drinking (as measured using a standard alcohol screening questionnaire) and 362 reported using cannabis (including 157 who reported daily or almost daily use).

Those who drank heavily and those who used cannabis frequently had a higher overall desire to avoid pregnancy, compared with participants who drank moderately or not at all and participants who did not use cannabis.

Over the course of one year, 71 of the 936 women who most wanted to avoid pregnancy became pregnant. More than half of those undesired pregnancies (38) occurred among those who drank heavily, more than the combined number for those who drank moderately or not at all. In other words, heavy drinking was associated with a higher risk of undesired pregnancy compared with lower levels of drinking.

In contrast, less than half of the 71 undesired pregnancies (28) occurred among people who used cannabis, meaning that those who used cannabis did not show an elevated risk of undesired pregnancy compared with people who did not use cannabis.

Lead author Dr Sarah Raifman, of the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, comments: "This study made two important findings. First, non-pregnant women who drink heavily appear, on average, to have a higher desire to avoid pregnancy than those who drink moderately or not at all. Second, drinking heavily as opposed to moderately or not at all appears to put those who most want to avoid pregnancy at higher risk of becoming pregnant within one year. Finding out why those pregnancies happen is the next step in our research."

"In the meantime, given the potentially life-altering effects of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (which occur when a fetus is exposed to alcohol through the mother's drinking) and the fact that the risk of FASD increases with the amount and duration of the mother's drinking, it's important for doctors and clinicians to support women who drink heavily to stop drinking as soon as they suspect an unintentional pregnancy."

This study was funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (R01-HD108643) and by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (F31AA028988).

El Salvador's Legislative Assembly approved changes to the country's constitution on Thursday that will extend presidential terms from five years to six and abolish term limits. That means President Nayib Bukele, a far-right crypto enthusiast who's allied with President Donald Trump, could potentially stay in power for the rest of his natural life.

First elected in 2019 on a promise to crack down on gangs, Bukele was supposed to be prohibited from running for re-election in 2024. But the country's Supreme Court of Justice ruled in 2021 that one of the articles in El Salvador's constitution allows a president to run for re-election once. Bukele's New Ideas Party removed magistrates in the Supreme Court who had opposed the president, clearing the path for Bukele to rule the country with an iron fist and make any constitutional changes necessary to remain in power indefinitely.

Bukele was re-elected in 2024 under those extremely dubious circumstances, and his term was scheduled to end on June 1, 2029. But lawmaker Ana Figueroa from the New Ideas Party has suggested moving up Bukele's re-election to June 1, 2027, to put it more in line with congressional elections, according to the Associated Press. With the new changes and Bukele's popularity, it would presumably allow the president to consolidate even more power now that he could be re-elected again and again, both without term limits and for a longer term each time.

The vote to strip term limits for the president and extend the length of each term passed by 57 to 3. And one of the three dissenters, Marcela Villatoro of the Nationalist Republican Alliance, warned that democracy would be weakened with the changes, according to the AP.

‚ÄúYou don't realize what indefinite reelection brings: It brings an accumulation of power and weakens democracy ‚Ä¶ there's corruption and clientelism because nepotism grows and halts democracy and political participation,‚Äù Villatoro is quoted as saying in an English language translation.

Bukele, a fan of Elon Musk and frequent user of X, hasn't tweeted about the changes yet. But guys like Musk and Trump are no doubt excited that their buddy in Central America is going to get even more power. Trump met with Bukele in the White House back in April when the U.S. president was shipping migrants to the U.S. to El Salvador's torture prison. The men sent there, some of whom have been released into Venezuela, have told horror stories about being beaten, given dirty water, and sexually assaulted.

Bukele rode into office and remains popular because he promised to crack down on gangs. But recent reporting from the country's El Faro news outlet claims Bukele's government signed a secret pact in 2019 with gang leaders to dial back violence in the country. Part of the deal, according to the news outlet, was providing financial incentives. Bukele has taken credit for reducing violence by insisting it's all part of his brutally violent crackdown.

Bukele has invested his country's money heavily in crypto, holding nearly $550 million of its foreign exchange reserves in bitcoin, according to Reuters, which amounts to about 15%. And while that may seem like a fine thing to do when bitcoin is soaring, it's extremely risky for any government when the price of crypto is so volatile. Bukele's government made reassurances to the International Monetary Fund that it would scale back its crypto project in exchange for a $1.4 billion bailout from the IMF. But as the Council on Foreign Relations pointed out in May, the country is still buying bitcoin.

As CoinTelegraph reported in June, El Salvador has added at least 240 BTC since Dec. 19, 2024, right after the agreement with the IMF was announced. That's more than $27 million at the current bitcoin price, which is hovering around $114,500, near the record high of about $123,000. It's not clear what the IMF may do since El Salvador violated its agreement, but whatever happens, the government needs to hope the price doesn't plummet.

$99.99

$5

This is unusual, as most companies typically drop the prices of their old models after launching next-gen products. And Nintendo has just released the Switch 2, which has been quite successful and is projected to beat the original Switch. However, it seems that these price hikes are driven by economics, especially given the uncertainty of the tariffs that President Trump applied the U.S.'s trading partners. We can't directly blame tariffs for the increasing costs of these consoles, though, as Canada was also affected by these price increases.

The price increases vary between $30 and $50 for the Switch 1 consoles, bringing the cheapest Nintendo handheld to $230 and the most expensive Switch 1 option to nearly $400. At this price, you're better off spending $50 more and getting the Nintendo Switch 2, which starts at $449.99. This will give you much better performance and a larger screen, although you'll be missing out on the OLED display. You can also install more games on the new handheld because it uses microSD Express cards. Although these cars are more expensive and harder to find (if you don't know where to look), they offer better performance and allow you to load games directly from the expansion slot.

More importantly, the Switch 2 is now readily available. This isn't like the PlayStation 5 launch fiasco, where scalpers made a ton of money buying up Sony's consoles because it had little to no supply. So, as long as you know where to buy it, you can easily pick up a Nintendo Switch 2 console at any time.

A new round of layoffs has hit Seattle laser engraver maker Glowforge.

Co-founder and CEO Dan Shapiro told GeekWire that the startup merged its sales and marketing teams.

‚ÄúAs part of that process, over the last three weeks we added three folks and sadly said goodbye to five folks from that team,‚Äù Shapiro said.

Shapiro did not provide details on which positions were impacted, but posts on LinkedIn from affected employees show that at least one longtime marketing leader at the company was let go.

Senior executives and members of the company's customer care team were also laid off, according to a person with knowledge of the cuts.

In April, Shapiro said that Glowforge employed just over 90 full-time and contract employees. 

Shapiro founded Glowforge in 2015 with fellow startup veterans Mark Gosselin, the current CTO, and Tony Wright, who left the company in 2017. Shapiro previously sold the startup Sparkbuy to Google, and he created Robot Turtles, a coding board game for kids that was one of the most successful campaigns ever on Kickstarter.

Glowforge, which has raised $183 million to date and is No. 125 on the GeekWire 200 startup index, went through a rough patch in 2023 and 2024, laying off employees after a funding round fell through.

The company gave up on existing headquarters space in Seattle's SoDo neighborhood to consolidate steps away in a warehouse building on Occidental Avenue South.

In that space, the company recently moved production of its highest-end machines from Mexico back to the United States and was employing 15 production workers to assemble them.

Tech Moves covers notable hires, promotions and personnel changes in the Pacific NW tech community. Submissions: tips@geekwire.com

‚Äî Two co-founders and former executives of Seattle-based Protect AI announced their new roles at Palo Alto Networks, the California cybersecurity company that acquired their startup in April.

Ian Swanson, Protect AI's past CEO, is vice president of AI security for Palo Alto Networks. The recent deal marked the third acquisition of a company that Swanson helped launch. He was also CEO and co-founder of Sometrics, which American Express bought, and of DataScience, which was acquired by Oracle.

Protect AI's former President Daryan Dehghanpisheh is now Palo Alto Network's go-to-market lead for AI security in North America. Dehghanpisheh's past employers include Amazon Web Services, Intel and The Howard Hughes Corporation.

Badar Ahmed, Protect AI's third co-founder and chief technologist and product officer, has not shared a new title.

While acquisition terms were not disclosed, sources reported the Protect AI deal was valued at more than $500 million. The company launched in 2022 and was ranked No. 10 on GeekWire 200, our list of top privately held startups in the Pacific Northwest.

‚Äî Chainguard, a fully remote cybersecurity company valued at $3.5 billion, announced two new members of its C-suite:  

Chainguard launched four years ago and disclosed a $356 million investment round in April. The company is officially headquartered in Kirkland, Wash.

‚Äî Alan Higginson, a long-time board member and current board chair for F5, is retiring from his role, the company shared in a July Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Higginson will not stand for re-nomination at the Seattle tech company's annual shareholder meeting next spring, which will bring his tenure to 30 years. He became board chair in 2004.

Higginson was previously president and CEO of Hubspan, an e-business infrastructure provider, and president of Atrieva, which offers advanced data backup and retrieval technology.

‚Äî Gilbert Wootton, managing director of Accenture's Seattle office, has retired after more than 35 years with the global professional services company.

‚ÄúI plan to ski a lot (water and snow) over next six months and spend significant time with [my wife] Carolyn,‚Äù he said on LinkedIn, adding that his ‚Äúintention is to maximize the third phase of my life.‚Äù

Wootton currently serves on the boards for Providence, the Washington Technology Industry Association (WTIA) and the University of Washington Center for Sales and Marketing, as well as on the advisory board for the UW's Mechanical Engineering Department, from which he graduated.

‚Äî Former Microsoft and SAP executive John ‚ÄúJG‚Äù Chirapurath is now president of DataPelago, a data processing company headquartered in Mountain View, Calif. Chirapurath, who is based in Seattle, comes to the role from SAP, where he served as executive vice president at the enterprise application company. 

His career also includes 14 years at Microsoft, which was briefly interrupted for leadership roles at ProQuest and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. At the Redmond, Wash.-software tech giant, Chirapurath was most recently a vice president with Azure.  

‚Äî Ken Wong is now the lead of Databricks‚Äò recently opened R&D center in Vancouver, B.C. The new location will focus on artificial and business intelligence, real-time analytics, and next-gen enterprise data applications.

‚ÄúWith Vancouver's heritage as one of the birthplaces for analytics, the city has a deep pool of data and AI talent for Databricks to draw from,‚Äù the company said.

Wong was co-founder and CEO of Datajoy, which Databricks acquired in 2022, roughly two years after it launched. Prior to Datajoy, Wong was at SAP, Microsoft and Tableau Software. 

‚Äî Kyle Wiggers has joined Ai2 as the Seattle nonprofit's communications lead. Wiggers comes to the role from TechCrunch where he led the news outlet's AI coverage. Wiggers has been a journalist for more than a decade and was previously at VentureBeat, XDA Developers, Digital Trends and other publications.

‚Äî Friday Harbor, a Seattle startup using AI to produce mortgage documentation, named two additions to its leadership team:

Friday Harbor launched last year and in April announced a $6 million seed round. The startups' two co-founders were past entrepreneurs-in-residence at AI2 Incubator.

‚Äî Scowtt, a Kirkland, Wash., customer acquisition startup, named Abhishek Priya as its first head of engineering. Scowtt offers marketing software to analyze potential customer leads and predict which will result in sales. Priya, who is based in California, comes to the role from Everlaw and is a past engineering manager for Meta and Microsoft. Early in his career he was with Intel for more than 11 years.

Scowtt recently announced Eric Schwartz as its first chief revenue officer.

‚Äî Tyler Churchill is now a partner at Bonfire Ventures. Churchill, who is based in Seattle, has been with the firm for more than six years and joined as a summer intern. Previously he was a senior associate with OCA Ventures.

Nintendo is raising the prices of its original Nintendo Switch game consoles, the company announced on Friday. The price increases, which are taking effect on August 3, are due to ‚Äúmarket conditions,‚Äù Nintendo says.

The company's reference to ‚Äúmarket conditions‚Äù likely hints at President Donald Trump's tariffs. 

The affected products include the Nintendo Switch ‚Äî OLED Model, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite, and select Nintendo Switch accessories. Other Nintendo products, including certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select amiibo, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo, will also see price increases.

It's not yet clear what the new prices will be. Currently, the original Nintendo Switch retails for $299.99, while the OLED model costs $349.99.

Nintendo said it isn't ruling out a future price hike for the Nintendo Switch 2, which retails for $450.

‚ÄúPricing for the Nintendo Switch 2 system, physical and digital Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 games, as well as Nintendo Switch Online memberships, will remain unchanged at this time,‚Äù Nintendo wrote in its announcement post. ‚ÄúHowever, please note that price adjustments may be necessary in the future.‚Äù

Earlier on Friday, Nintendo reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings and shared that sales of the Switch 2 console have reached 5.82 million units since its release on June 5.

Nintendo transferred most of its production from China to Vietnam in the past to avoid tariffs. However, Trump this week announced changes to reciprocal tariffs, which extend to Vietnam.

The situation surrounding Trump tariffs hasn't eased its pressure on Nintendo. Even as the Switch 2 has become one of the fastest-selling consoles ever, the Mario maker said that select Switch 2 accessories may see price ‚Äúadjustments‚Äù starting Aug 3. Not only that, but the original Switch and Switch OLED could cost more going forward. I guess we shouldn't say we told you so, but even we didn't expect to witness original Switch models selling for $40 or $50 more than before.

In a news post, Nintendo said U.S. customers can expect certain accessories, select amiibo, and the cute Alarmo bedside clock to all get more expensive in the next few days. After Nintendo fully revealed the Switch 2 in May, the company delayed preorders for North American customers and blamed the wide-reaching tariffs for the issue. While the console maker decided not to hike Switch 2 prices, it raised prices on the Switch 2 Pro Controller, Joy-Con 2 split controllers, and the official Switch 2 Camera peripheral by $5 each. We can expect some console extras to cost more, but we'll have to see which amiibos Nintendo decides to hike. We can assume the DK and young Pauline figurine for Donkey Kong Bananza is first in line.

Nintendo said its games shouldn't cost any more after Aug. 3. That's not much of a relief considering the company is already pushing some titles for $70 or as much as $80. If some gamers were already suffering consternation surrounding the Switch 2's $150 jump from the original Switch to the Switch 2, the divide is already starting to shrink. Digital deals hunter Wario64 spotted that Target had already increased prices for the 8-year-old console. A Switch Lite went from $200 to $220. The original Switch now costs $40 more at $340. The fan-favorite Switch OLED, which was priced at $350 on launch, now sells for $400. Target later reversed those prices, which could be an indicator the big box store was early to the party, or the pricing was inaccurate to what we'll see on Aug. 3. Gizmodo reached out to Target for comment, and we'll update this post if we hear back.

‚Äî Wario64 (@Wario64) August 1, 2025



Target prices indicate the Switch 2 Pro Controller won't get a price hike, but both the Joy-Con 2 and the original Switch Joy-Con controllers will now cost more at $100 and $90, respectively. Alarmo will now cost $110, while prices on accessories, like the original Joy-Con charging stand, will go up by $5.

The price hikes come on the heels of Nintendo declaring the Switch 2 had sold more than 6 million units globally in the first seven weeks after release‚Äîaround July 24. The company said in its latest financial results that it sold nearly as many copies of Mario Kart World, though that includes the software downloads from the $500 Switch 2 and Mario Kart bundle. Nintendo didn't offer nearly as much data on its peripheral sales, though original Switch sales were already declining before the Switch 2 release. A more expensive console won't do Nintendo's older systems any favors. Either way, if you still had plans to grab a few Switch 2 accessories, you best do so now before they cost you even more.

To mark a monumental occasion, some people go on a vacation; others go to a nice dinner or throw a party. For Star Wars, it's celebrating its 50th anniversary by going back to the movies. Disney just announced it will re-release George Lucas' original Star Wars in theaters on April 30, 2027. That's about a month ahead of the actual anniversary on May 25, 2027, but that weekend is reserved for a brand new Star Wars film, Star Wars: Starfighter, starring Ryan Gosling.

The rerelease will also come a few short weeks after Star Wars Celebration Los Angeles, which takes place from April 1 to 4, 2027. With this all teed up, you can imagine Lucasfilm will promote the heck out of it at that event, maybe even bringing some of the original cast and crew together again.

What's unclear, at least now almost two years away, is which version of the film will come to theaters. The prevailing thought is it'll be the 1997 Special Edition, George Lucas' preferred version of the movie, with those added scenes and enhancements. However, just last month, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy was on hand for a very rare screening of an original print of Star Wars, long before anything was changed on it. Not even ‚ÄúEpisode IV: A New Hope.‚Äù Maybe, just maybe, that's a tease of what's to come.

Or, with so much time, maybe it's some kind of blend of the two. A new restoration of the original, unaltered film. That, surely, would have fans more excited than anything else.

The story of a young farm boy (Mark Hamill) who finds himself on a galaxy-spanning adventure to save a princess (Carrie Fisher) along with his mentor (Alec Guinness) and a daring pilot (Harrison Ford), Star Wars is one of the most influential and popular films of all time. It spawned two immediate sequels, three prequels, and then three more sequels over the past four-plus decades. Oh, and some shows and books and comics and games and toys and stuff too.

Which version of A New Hope do you hope is in theaters? Are you definitely going to go? Let us know.

Apple is playing catch-up with AI


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Being considerably behind other major high-tech companies with its artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, Apple is open to acquiring third-party companies to accelerate its AI roadmap as its management gets that gradual expanding its internal AI initiatives won't cut in to become competitive with Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, or xAI.

"We are very open to M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions) that accelerates our road map," said Apple CEO Tim Cook during the company's earnings call with financial analysts and investors, when asked about possible acquisitions of AI companies. "We are not stuck on a certain size company, although the ones that we have acquired thus far this year are small in nature. But we basically ask ourselves whether a company can help us accelerate our roadmap and if they do, then we are interested. But we do not have anything to share specifically today."

During the call, Cook confirmed the company is increasing spending and reorganizing teams to address expansion of its AI initiatives. Apple is moving a significant number of employees to AI-related work and these teams are tasked with developing new features that leverage machine learning and related technologies across Apple's hardware and software ecosystem.

"The way that we look at AI is that it is one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime, and I think it will affect all devices in a significant way," Cook said. "We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments. Apple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone, and that is at the heart of our AI strategy."

Cook stated that Apple intends to grow its AI investment substantially, which is proven by the company's increased CapEx (more on this later). This includes not only organic growth of the Apple's existing teams and efforts, but also acquisitions of other companies of different sizes. In fact, the company has already made around seven takeovers this year, though not all were related to AI, according to Cook.

Historically, Apple has made numerous high-profile acquisitions that either expanded its market presence, or strenghtened its vertical integration.

Apple's most notable acquisition remains Beats Electronics, purchased in 2014 for $3 billion. This transaction brought both the popular Beats headphone brand and the Beats Music streaming service, which became the foundation for Apple Music. For now, the Beats-branded portfolio clearly helps Apple to maintain the No.1 position on the market of wireless headsets and justifies development of custom silicon for these devices.

Other acqusitions were mostly focused on enhancing the company's vertical integration.

In 2019, Apple expanded its hardware capabilities by acquiring Intel' smartphone modem business for $1 billion, gaining key patents and over 2,000 employees to accelerate the development of its own 5G modems in a bid to reduce dependence on Qualcomm. This year the company finally released its first smartphone with its in-house developed modem inside and said that eventually it would use its own modems inside its devices.

Earlier, in 2018, Apple spent $600 million to acquire a portion of Dialog Semiconductor, including licensing power management technologies and hiring over 300 Dialog engineers, helping Apple bring more of its chip design in-house. In the early 2010s, the company broght Anobit Technologies to bring development of NAND controllers in house; fingerprint sensor company AuthenTec (Touch ID), and 3D sensing designer PrimeSense (Face ID).

Despite this renewed focus on AI, Apple's infrastructure spending remains modest compared to other major high-tech companies. Apple allocated $3.46 billion on CapEx in Q3 FY2025, a rise from $2.15 billion in the same period last year. So far this fiscal year the company has spent $9.473 billion on 'acquisition of property, plant, and equipment,' which is how it calls its capital expenditures. Even if the company spends another $3.46 billion in Q4 FY2025 (which ends on September 29), its CapEx for the fiscal year 2025 will total $12.933 billion. If we annualize Apple's CapEx to calendar year, its spendings will be between $13 billion and $14 billion, which is far behind Google's $85 billion forecast for fiscal 2025, Meta's projected $72 billion, and Microsoft's $80 billion for calendar 2025, according to CNBC estimates.

Apple posted total revenue of $94.0 billion for the third fiscal quarter ending June 28, 2025, a 10% increase from the $85.8 billion reported a year earlier. Net income for the quarter reached $23.4 billion, an increase from $21.4 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 46.5%, compared to $46.27 billion last year.

As for product categories, iPhone remains the company's No. 1 product with $44.6 billion in revenue, a notable rise from $39.3 billion at the same quarter last year Sales of Mac PCs generated $8.0 billion, compared to $7.0 billion last year. iPad revenue was $6.6 billion, slightly down from $7.2 billion in the prior year, which is a surprise as the company introduced an inexpensive iPad earlier this year. The Wearables, Home, and Accessories category brought in $7.4 billion, a decline from $8.1 billion in Q3 2024. Meanwhile, Services revenue continued its upward trajectory, reaching $27.4 billion, up from $24.2 billion in Q3 FY2024.

Google just made one of its most advanced AI reasoning models available to the public. Like other advanced models, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think uses more than one AI agent to brainstorm answers in order to boost accuracy and result in more creative solutions.

Google says the model outperformed several of its competitors in key AI benchmark tests and a variation of the model even achieved the gold-medal standard at this year's International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), solving five out of the six IMO problems perfectly. That research model took hours to produce solutions, but the version available today is designed for everyday use working much faster, while still achieving bronze-level IMO performance.

However, in order to try out the new model users will need to hand over $250 a month for a Google AI Ultra subscription.Starting today, subscribers get access to a fixed set of prompts for the new model. They can enable ‚ÄúDeep Think‚Äù by toggling it in the prompt bar when selecting Gemini 2.5 Pro from the model dropdown menu in the Gemini app.

Google first previewed Gemini 2.5 Deep Think back in May at its I/O developer conference, but the company says the version released today is a ‚Äúsignificant improvement,‚Äù thanks to tester feedback and key benchmark improvements.

Google says Deep Think uses parallel thinking techniques to tackle complex problems like a human would by weighing different angles and potential solutions.

‚ÄúThis approach lets Gemini generate many ideas at once and consider them simultaneously, even revising or combining different ideas over time, before arriving at the best answer,‚Äù the company said in a blog post.

Additionally, Google says it developed new reinforcement learning techniques that push the model to explore extended reasoning paths, helping Deep Think become a stronger and more intuitive problem-solver over time.

This, Google claims, makes the model particularly useful for things like coding, web development, and scientific research.

According to Google, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think outperformed rival models on the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a 2,500-question expertise benchmark spanning subjects like math, science, and the humanities. The model achieved a score of 34.8% on the test, compared with OpenAI o3's 20.3% and Grok 4's 25.4% scores.

Google also said it will share the gold-medal version of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think with a small group of mathematicians and academics, hoping to see how it might aid their research. The company plans to use that feedback to refine future versions of the model.

Meanwhile, CXMT is looking to catch up.

In a historic shake-up of the global memory market, SK hynix has overtaken Samsung Electronics to become the world's top memory maker by revenue, marking a pivotal shift in an industry long dominated by its larger Korean rival. The moment comes not just as a financial milestone, but as a broader signal of how the memory business is being reshaped by the explosive demand for AI.

The news first emerged through multiple South Korean financial publications, with industry tracking firm Counterpoint and Omidia confirming SK hynix's rise to the number one spot in Q2 2025. The company pulled in $9.66 billion in memory revenue, edging out Samsung's $8.94 billion and securing a 36.2% market share compared to Samsung's 33.5%. This marks the first time SK hynix has surpassed Samsung since its founding in 1983.

At the heart of this leap lies SK hynix's early and aggressive move into high-bandwidth memory (HBM), the ultra-fast DRAM used in AI accelerators like Nvidia's B300. While Samsung was once seen as the leader in memory innovation, it now seems that SK Hynix has become Nvidia's primary HBM supplier. The firm's HBM3 and next-gen HBM3E modules are integral to the compute power behind large language models and generative AI workloads. Not only that, but Nvidia started with Samsung's GDDR7 in their mainstream RTX 50-series GPUs, only to bring in SK hynix's chips later.

SK hynix's success is also visible in its operating profits. The company posted 2.6 trillion KRW (~$1.88 billion) in Q2 operating profit‚Äîits highest in two and a half years‚Äîdespite lingering weakness in traditional DRAM and NAND markets. Analysts say this divergence highlights a fundamental realignment in the memory industry: AI-centric demand now drives profitability more than PC or smartphone shipments ever did.



Samsung, by contrast, has struggled to match SK hynix's pace. Reports suggest delays in qualifying Samsung's own HBM3 and HBM3E with key customers like Nvidia, leading to lost ground in what has become the most lucrative segment of the memory space, so much so that price cuts are now in order. Samsung remains dominant in NAND flash and legacy DRAM, but those markets are not experiencing the same upside.

Further reflecting this change, SK hynix has become the most sought-after employer among Korean university students for the first time, overtaking Samsung. A recent survey by Incruit shows that compensation, engineering focus, and future growth outlook have driven students‚Äîparticularly in electronics and tech majors‚Äîto favor SK Hynix.

Looking ahead, SK hynix is now eyeing an even stronger grip on the AI memory stack. The company has confirmed it is developing HBM4 and is investing heavily into vertical integration and packaging technologies to keep Nvidia and other AI customers close. Its trajectory mirrors broader shifts in the tech sector, where memory is no longer just a commodity, rather a key enabled of AI-powered next-gen computing.

For Samsung, though, the story is far from over. The company has pledged to bounce back with aggressive investment in HBM capacity, and rumors suggest it's chasing new clients beyond Nvidia, such as AMD and custom AI chip start-ups. But for now, the balance of power has shifted and SK hynix is no longer playing catch-up; it's setting the pace.

Everybody is talking about AI. But how are people actually using new automation tools, and what value are they getting out of them?

That was our question to attendees at the AI2 Incubator's annual BBQ party on Thursday, hosted at the AI House at Seattle's Pier 70 as part of Seattle Tech Week. 

Techies shared some of their favorite AI tools and how they're using them. Read on to learn more. Answers were edited for brevity and clarity. 

Joe Heitzeberg, founder of AI Tinkerers

Favorite tools: Granola and Amp

Use case: ‚ÄúGranola just works really well. It automatically joins meetings. I can use it for anything where I want to take notes. It's unobtrusive. And the other one is Amp. It's a coding tool I've been using for two-and-a-half weeks ‚Äî objectively, it's better than Claude Code. It just does a better job of taking my instructions and figuring out how to fulfill my objectives in a way that is compatible with my code base.‚Äù

Mamtha Banerjee, managing director at JPMorgan Chase

Favorite tool: Perplexity Comet

Use case: ‚ÄúIt's not that I'm using it a lot. But it's very interesting how it changes what you think about a browser ‚Äî it's almost like an operating system.‚Äù

Gayathri (G3) Venkataraman, CEO at Dodda AI

Favorite tool: Perplexity, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot

Use case: ‚ÄúI use them a lot for pretty much all the tasks I have to do. I come up with plans and ask them to let me know if I'm covering everything or missing anything ‚Äî I'm using it as a comprehensive completeness tool. I'm also using them for travel planning and for retail and other things I need to buy at home.‚Äù

Beth Kolko, investment partner at Pioneer Fund

Favorite tool: Claude

Use case: ‚ÄúI just did a bunch of traveling and I used Claude to help me narrow down plans. I asked it to tell me the history of a place and where I should go. Professionally, I use it because I do a lot of writing and speaking for my career. I'll upload things I've already written on different topics and get it to do some synthesis work.‚Äù

Ti Zhao, partner at Pack Ventures

Favorite tool: Claude

Use case: ‚ÄúI use it for everything ‚Äî to plan my workouts, plan my meal plans. It gives me recipe ideas and ideas to throw a dinner party or entertain children. It primarily solves the blank-page problem for me. I don't trust everything it tells me but it can generate a list of ideas and I can work off of it really easily.‚Äù

Joe Golden, founder and CEO at Paper2Audio

Favorite tool: Google Gemini Flash 2.0; OpenAI o3

Use case: ‚ÄúOur company makes it so you can listen to research papers. We don't need complex thinking or reasoning, or agentic mode. So Gemini Flash 2.0 is fast and cheap. It can also parse images well enough and cheaply. Another tool I've been using is o3. A family member was recently diagnosed with cancer. It's incredible for medical research. It's really invaluable for getting into a new field of research.‚Äù

Darian Parrish, founder and CEO at PwrOn

Favorite tool: Poe

Use case: ‚ÄúPoe allows you to access all the models. That's the highest value chatbot. And I use a lot of the coding tools ‚Äî Windsurf, Lovable, Cursor, Replit. I've estimated I'm around 30 times faster at software creation.‚Äù

Markiesha Patrice, startup community lead at Nebius

Favorite tool: Descript

Use case: ‚ÄúI do a lot of video content and editing, so Descript makes it very simple for me. It's saving time and it's also ease of use. If you're not someone who is super technical or trained, there is not much extra knowledge that you have to have in order to go into the platform and use it.‚Äù

Gregory Kennedy, chief vibe marketer at Vibe Your SaaS

Favorite tool: Claude, Canva

Use case: ‚ÄúAs a writing assistant, Claude is probably the best one. It works for me like an intern, where it can get started with an idea. I use it more like a really advanced version of Grammarly. And I think Canva doesn't get a lot of love, and their AI tools are quite good. I do a lot of visuals and graphics for marketing. The tools are really powerful for moving backgrounds, manipulating things, whatever you need. It's really fast and easy.‚Äù

Elizabeth Russo, CEO at adyn

Favorite tool: Claude

Use case: ‚ÄúMostly to help as a writing assistant, primarily for emails to potential partners and investors. It can sometimes unlock writer's block or help me get over procrastination of starting something. Even if it gives me a bad draft, I feel motivated that I can do better and fix it.‚Äù

Xuchen Yao, co-founder and CEO at Seasalt.ai

Favorite tool: Warp

Use case: ‚ÄúI use it for vibe coding. I just open up a terminal and tell it the instructions. I use it to translate blogs into 20 different languages to make our company more international. I also use it to do code reviews.‚Äù

Robert Mao, architect at AIGNE

Favorite tool: AIGNE

Use case: ‚ÄúA lot of people are doing vibe coding, but for me, as a developer, I actually enjoy coding. But I really hate writing design documents and user documents. And so we're building a vibe document tool for developers. All you do is feed in your design idea draft and the AI turns it into a full document. Or if you already wrote the code, it makes a super cool design document.‚Äù

TikTok is launching a new version of its app called ‚ÄúTikTok Pro‚Äù in Germany, Portugal, and Spain. The app features TikTok's new ‚ÄúSunshine Programme,‚Äù which allows users to support charitable organizations. 

Users can earn ‚Äúvirtual sunshine‚Äù by inviting others to join and by interacting with charity-related content, such as liking or reposting videos, following charity accounts, or searching for charitable causes. They can then use this virtual sunshine on a charity, after which TikTok will make a donation to the organization.

It's worth noting that the content on TikTok Pro is the same as that on the regular TikTok app, as reported by Social Media Today. The difference between the new app and the standard app is that TikTok Pro doesn't have any livestreams, shopping features, or ads.

TikTok says the idea behind the new app is ‚Äúto enable people in Europe to support charitable organizations while discovering engaging and entertaining TikTok content.‚Äù

Prints, in SPAAAAAACCCCEEE

The world of 3D printing has opened us up to an entirely new era of manufacturing. We can print objects at home using the best budget 3D printers and it's amazing how far we've come yet you'll still be hard pressed to find examples of 3D printing in space. This is mainly due to the volatility of 3D printed materials and a need for extreme reliability in aerospace. But, Horizon Microtechnologies, has recently passed testing standards, put in place to ensure the reliability of materials used in the space industry ‚Äî bringing us one step closer to introducing more 3D printing components in space.

The 3D printed materials were put through outgassing tests. The materials must meet specific requirements to be cleared for space travel in accordance with ECSS-Q-ST-70-02C, a material screening standard set by the European Cooperation for Space Standardization.

"This Standard describes a thermal vacuum test to determine the outgassing screening properties of materials proposed for use in the fabrication of spacecraft and associated equipment, for vacuum facilities used for flight hardware tests and for certain launcher hardware."

The company accomplished this impressive feat by coating the 3D printed components.



Horizon Microtechnologies CEO Andreas Fr√∂lich expressed enthusiasm for the successful results, remarking at the significance of their development. The coating process ensures the 3D printed structures are able to meet the rigorous standards put into place to ensure safety during space travel.

The outgassing testing process in particular is used to determine how much, if any, volatile material is released and/or reabsorbed by the given component being tested. This testing process is also looking out for any cross contamination with nearby items that might be able to absorb any released particles.

By coating their 3D printed components using its own purpose developed coating method, Horizon Microtechnologies was able to successfully pass the standard requirements for the outgassing tests. This means we'll likely see more 3D-printed hardware in wide variety of future space technology, including vessels, satellite hardware and more. Recently, tests were carried out on the International Space Station (ISS) which saw astronauts on the ISS 3D print objects in micro-gravity. This uses low-temperature plastics instead of traditional filament, as all sources of heat and fire are strictly controlled on the ISS. The benefits of 3D printing in space are chiefly the ability to fabricate a part without the expense of a launching a rocket to the station. Just open up a spool of filament, load up your slicer and print that vital part.

If the thought of using 3D printing in the space industry sounds appealing, you're not alone. There's tons of potential to be had between the two but you'd better get a good foothold on 3D printing first.

Instagram users now need a public account with a minimum of 1,000 followers to go live on the platform, the social network confirmed to TechCrunch. Until now, Instagram has allowed anyone to go live, regardless of their follower count or whether their account is public or private.

The move will be a blow to smaller creators on the platform who fall under the 1,000 followers requirement, as well as regular users who just liked to go live with their friends for fun.

Users who don't have public accounts and have fewer than 1,000 followers will see a new notice when they try to go live, stating that their account is no longer eligible for Live. The notice continues, ‚ÄúWe changed requirements to use this feature. Only public accounts with 1,000 followers or more will be able to create live videos.‚Äù

Users have taken to social media to express their displeasure with the change, with some asking for it to be reversed. 

The change brings Instagram's live feature more in line with TikTok's, as the short-form video app also requires users to have at least 1,000 followers to go live. In comparison, YouTube requires channels to have a minimum of 50 subscribers to go live.

While the company didn't provide a specific reason for the change, it noted that the move is designed to improve the overall Live consumption experience. 

The change could limit lower-quality streams by only allowing users with an established audience to go live. 

It could also be a way for Meta to save money. Since hosting live streams is expensive, Meta may have decided that it doesn't want to support broadcasts with only a handful of viewers.

I stopped by one of Starbucks' mobile-focused pickup-only locations in Seattle this week after the company announced that it was sunsetting the small-format stores. 

My experience was quick, seamless, and convenient ‚Äî and perhaps that's the problem. 

In a call with investors on Tuesday announcing the news, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol described the pickup-only stores as ‚Äúoverly transactional and lacking the warmth and human connection that defines our brand.‚Äù

Niccol, the former Chipotle CEO who joined Starbucks last year, is leading an overhaul under a plan called ‚ÄúBack to Starbucks‚Äù in a bid to boost slumping sales. The Seattle coffee giant just reported its sixth-straight quarter of declining same-store sales.

Part of that strategy is to re-center stores as a place where customers spend more time ‚Äî the ‚Äúthird place‚Äù concept championed by former longtime Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.

Moving away from the tech-driven pickup stores is a notable shift for a company that once leaned heavily into its technology as a competitive advantage.

Starbucks was early to mobile ordering, launched its own digital wallet long before Apple Pay took off, and has one of the most popular loyalty apps in the food and beverage industry, with nearly 34 million active users. 

Mobile orders represent nearly a third of total transactions at U.S. company-operated stores.

Niccol said he thinks Starbucks can thread the needle between convenience and coziness. 

‚ÄúWe have a strong digital offering and believe we can deliver the same level of convenience through our community coffeehouses with a superior mobile order and pay experience,‚Äù he said Tuesday.

Starbucks is still leaning into technology under Niccol's leadership, including a new ‚ÄúSmart Queue‚Äù order sequencing algorithm built to help improve mobile ordering ‚Äî which has been a sore spot for the company given how it creates congestion inside stores. 

Niccol also said the company is working on what he calls the ‚Äúcoffeehouse of the future,‚Äù including a new prototype store design with 32 seats and a drive-thru, and a smaller version with 10 seats.

The CEO said he hopes the changes can help reestablish ‚Äúthat moment of connection between a barista and their customer, bringing back warm and welcoming coffeehouses with great seats, delivering drinks in four minutes or less in the cafe and drive-thru while bringing order to mobile order‚Ä¶‚Äù

The move away from mobile-focused stores comes as Starbucks' techie rival Luckin ‚Äî which operates cashierless, app-only stores ‚Äî just opened its first U.S. locations in New York City after overtaking Starbucks in China. 

I was in New York City in 2019 when Starbucks first debuted the mobile order and pick-up only concept. I had a pretty similar experience back then ‚Äî convenient and fast. 

During my quick stop at the pickup store in Seattle this week, I saw six or seven other people come through in a 5-minute span, at 5:45 p.m. on a Thursday evening. They walked in, grabbed their drink, and left ‚Äî a grab-and-go, frictionless experience that Starbucks once imagined.

Now, though, that friction ‚Äî seats in a store, a brief chat with a barista, your name on a cup ‚Äî might be the feature, not the bug.

Ask any homeowner: renovation projects are no fun at all. From finding a contractor to determining a fair price, the process is rife with uncertainty. 

Plenty of startups have popped up to help homeowners tackle electrification projects, including installing solar panels and replacing gas furnaces with heat pumps. But they still struggle with the cost question: acquiring customers is often more than half the battle.

Pearl Edison thinks the answer is utilities.

‚ÄúAs much as anything, we are leveraging their brand equity and trust,‚Äù Evan Anderson, co-founder and CEO of Pearl Edison, told TechCrunch.

Investors have bought into the idea. The Detroit-based startup has raised a $3.3 million seed round from New System Ventures and Commonweal Ventures, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Lightbank and Newlab participated.

Pearl Edison works with utilities to identify customers who are most likely to benefit from energy retrofit projects, including heat pumps and additional insulation. It builds a white-labeled website for the utility, and it helps the larger organization run campaigns to sign people up for energy efficiency upgrades.

The company uses a range of data sources to design a job and generate a price, which it guarantees for the customer. After its software produces a first draft of the plans, it sends workers out to verify everything in the field before finalizing the design.

It then sends the jobs to vetted contractors, who complete the installation. Pearl Edison makes money on the installs itself, estimating that the majority of those jobs will cost less than it quotes. Homeowners should save money, too, Anderson said, because Pearl Edison can contract the job for less since the installers don't have to waste time acquiring customers.

Already, the company has programs set up with two utilities, DT Energy in Michigan and Duquesne Light in the Pittsburgh area, and one government, the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Anderson said the company will add two more utilities this year. 

‚ÄúWe've found them to be good partners,‚Äù Anderson said.

Microsoft is fighting to keep its consumer AI division, led by its AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, from getting dragged into the copyright lawsuit filed by The New York Times and other news organizations against Microsoft and OpenAI.

In a court filing Thursday, Microsoft argued that the current version of its Copilot AI assistant for consumers should be excluded from the process of legal discovery ‚Äî opposing an effort by the plaintiffs to require the team behind the product to turn over documents and materials deemed relevant to the case. 

The product ‚Äúdid not exist at the time News Plaintiffs filed their complaints, is built on a different platform with new system architecture than the products named in News Plaintiffs' complaints, and involves hundreds of potential new custodians given that the back-end code was written by an entirely new team,‚Äù the filing said, using the legal term for people in possession of materials subject to discovery.

But lawyers for the news organizations contend that Copilot is powered by the same core AI systems, performing the same functions, with the same alleged harms.

‚ÄúMicrosoft's refusal to provide discovery into the ‚Äòrefreshed' version of consumer Copilot hamstrings News Plaintiffs' ability to investigate evidence critical for its case and to rebut Microsoft's fair use defense,‚Äù lawyers for the news organizations wrote in a filing Monday.

They noted that Microsoft has confirmed that the new Copilot is powered by GPT-4o, an OpenAI model that's already involved in the litigation. They argued that this undermines Microsoft's claim that the new Copilot is fundamentally different, for purposes of the suit and the process of discovery.

The lawsuit, filed in December 2023 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Microsoft and OpenAI engaged in large-scale, unauthorized scraping of copyrighted news articles to train AI models. 

By using their reporting to generate answers, the plaintiffs contend, the AI tools divert readers that would otherwise visit their news sites, impacting the market for their work and undermining their business models.

The suit targets both companies due to their close partnership. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into OpenAI, and the ChatGPT maker uses Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform to build and train its AI models. 

These kinds of discovery battles are common in complex litigation. Lawyers for both sides have been arguing for more than a year over discovery issues related to everything from reporters' notes to OpenAI user data. 

No definitive court rulings have yet been made on the central question of the suit: whether the AI models infringe on copyright.

Amazon reached a deal in May to license the New York Times' editorial content for use in its AI platforms, reportedly paying at least $20 million annually.

The latest legal wrangling puts a spotlight on the Microsoft consumer AI division created last year under Suleyman, a high-profile figure in the AI world who co-founded Google's DeepMind. Suleyman joined Microsoft in March 2024 in a deal that saw the tech giant also hire a number of employees from his AI startup, Inflection AI.

His team launched the new consumer version of Copilot in October 2024, separate from the Microsoft‚ÄØ365 Copilot business AI product. It has a redesigned user interface with features such as a personalized daily news summary, natural voice interactions, and the ability for the AI to act as a companion while browsing the web.

Suleyman is not named in the filings, but the language refers to his team ‚Äî noting, for example, that ‚ÄúNew Consumer Copilot was developed and marketed by a group of people who recently joined Microsoft.‚Äù

Joining the New York Times in the suit are Daily News LP (parent of the New York Daily News), and the Center for Investigative Reporting.

With search today so full of AI slop and sites spamming SEO tricks, it's not unusual for people to append ‚Äúreddit‚Äù to their queries in hopes of finding useful answers to their questions. Google has tried to integrate results from Reddit in its search interface, and taking notice of the trend, Reddit has been experimenting with its own AI search as well. But the company has loftier ambitions: It wants to become the go-to search engine people use.

Reddit's CEO Steve Huffman said as much during its second-quarter conference call on Thursday: ‚ÄúReddit is one of the few platforms positioned to become a true search destination. We offer something special, a breadth of conversations and knowledge you can't find anywhere else.‚Äù

Huffman noted that Reddit's search function has more than 70 million weekly users, and its AI-powered Q&A product, Reddit Answers, is now used by 6 million people.

Reddit Answers is currently available in a dozen countries, and the company plans to expand it globally, as well as give it prominent placement in the site's interface. The company eventually wants to unify the core search function with Reddit Answers, and redesign its app to have the search box be more prominently visible.

‚ÄúWe're unifying those [Reddit search and Reddit Answers] into a single search experience, and we're gonna bring that front and center in the app. So, whether you're a new user opening the app for the first time or a returning user opening the app, that search box will be present immediately,‚Äù Huffman said on the call.

People are increasingly being presented chat-styled search interfaces from products like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google's new AI mode. Reddit understandably believes that tapping its rich trove of user posts and comments to help people find answers will help make its search function more useful.

Reddit reported a positive second quarter, with revenue jumping 78% to $500 million from a year earlier. The company launched two new ad tools, which let marketers use Reddit data to spot trends and leverage comments about brands in their campaigns.

Living in a city where air pollution seems unavoidable can feel discouraging, but there's something you can do to protect your health right at home: Investing in an air purifier is a simple way to ensure you breathe cleaner air, especially in your bedroom where you spend nearly a third of your life. You don't have to spend $500 on a Dyson to get quality air cleaning ‚Äì there are more affordable and practical options too. One of these is the Mooka air purifier (B-D02L), available now on Amazon at a record low price of about $39 after stacking discounts (instant discount + promo code), down from $79.

See at Amazon

The Mooka B-D02L is designed to encompass large rooms, and covers up to 1076 square feet. Since it has a very effective filtration mechanism, it will circulate the air in a 215-square-foot room six times every hour, and perform one full air exchange every hour in larger rooms of up to 1076 square feet. That makes it ideal for a household with pets or children for instance.

The H13 True HEPA filter is the heart of this purifier and it is one of the highest efficiencies in particle capture. It traps pollutants down to 0.3 microns, dust (such as pet hair, dust, pollen, smoke, dander) and odors. The system includes a pre-filter and an activated carbon filter that will work together to catch bigger particles and eradicate stinky odors.

What's extremely important is that it's also very quiet: Its new brushless motor keeps sound at just 20 decibels which is barely audible. That means you can leave it on while doing work or sleeping without being disturbed. And it draws very little power, so you won't notice your electricity bill. If security is your priority, the purifier also features a child lock to prevent accidental modification by curious kids.

Controls on this air purifier are easy to operate: You can have four timer settings (1, 2, 4, or 8 hours) and adjust fan speed via Sleep, Low, Medium, and High. With these controls, you have the power to determine the amount of air you'd like cleaned without wasting energy. There is even a soft night light that will eliminate night stumbling which can be turned off when you want the total blackness of a totally dark room.

If you are looking for a budget-friendly solution to clean the air you and your family breathe, this air purifier is a perfect choice. Don't miss that opportunity on Amazon.

Get under the hood of your Windows OS


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


If you need to tweak your Windows 11 or 10 install, then Winaero Tweaker is for you (heck, this program even works as far back as Windows 7). A freeware app created by Sergey Tkachenko, Winaero Tweaker is a simple to use, all-in-one app that can tweak and tune your Windows installation without getting your hands dirty in the registry or command line.

If you want to protect your privacy, freeze a test rig for benchmarking, or get Windows working exactly how you want it, Winaero Tweaker is for you, and in this how-to, I'll show you how to install and use it.

1. Download Winaero Tweaker from the website.

2. Extract the contents of the ZIP download to a folder.

3. Run the installer. I chose ‚ÄúPortable Mode,‚Äù but you can choose whatever suits your needs. If you choose ‚ÄúPortable Mode,‚Äù make a note of the install location.

4. Run Winaero Tweaker. If you installed the app, it will be in your Start Menu. For those who chose Portable Mode, navigate to the installation folder and double-click the executable.

The user interface is simple, although it may be a bit daunting for new users. So let's take a look at it together.

1. Main Menu: Here, we can Import/Export Settings, reset tweaks, navigate the list, and more. We can also use the search box to go directly to a tweak.

2. Tweak List: A hierarchical list of all of the available tweaks. This list will alter depending on the OS in use. Here we see it running on my Windows 10 setup.

3. Tweak Details: Selecting a tweak from the list will alter this section of the UI according to your selection. We can then make adjustments to the OS.

Windows is full of advertisements these days. They are deeply embedded in the OS and can be tricky to remove, but not with Winaero Tweaker.

1. Scroll down to Advanced Appearance Settings and select Behavior.



2. Click on Disable Ads. All of the boxes should be automatically checked; however, you can tailor this to meet your specific needs.

3. Reboot the computer for the changes to take effect. You can either reboot as you make each change, or save all of your changes for one big reboot. There are pros and cons to both approaches.



Touted as a means to gather diagnostic and usage data to improve the OS, telemetry also reveals serial numbers, volume numbers, partitions etc. While not overtly sensitive, this is your private data, so it only seems right to keep it that way and Winaero Tweaker has a simple means to do it.

1. Scroll down to Privacy and select ‚ÄúDisable Telemetry‚Äù.



2. Check the box to disable telemetry.



3. Reboot, or remember to reboot later.



If you are building a benchmarking system, the next two sections are for you. They will disable driver updates and Windows updates, keeping your test bench frozen at a reliable constant for precision benchmarking.

1. Using the search box, look for ‚Äúdriver‚Äù and double-click on the returned result.



2. Check the box to disable driver updates.



3. Reboot, or remember to reboot later.



1. Using the search box, look for ‚Äúupdate‚Äù and double-click on the returned result to disable Windows Updates.



2. Check the box to disable Windows updates. There is no need to reboot for this to take effect.



When a command or application has the possibility of making system-wide changes, the UAC (User Account Control) asks you to confirm or deny the request. We've all seen it: the little shield appears, the screen darkens, and then we get cross and click Confirm/OK just to get things done. With WinAeroTracker, we can disable that. No more annoying nagging screens. However, take heed: UAC is there to keep you safe, so only turn it off if you are absolutely certain you're willing to accept the responsibility of increased risk.

1. Using the search box, look for ‚Äúuac‚Äù and double-click on the returned result to disable UAC.



2. Click on Disable UAC to turn off the ‚Äúannoying‚Äù UAC prompt. Remember that UAC is there to protect you from harmful code execution, which could damage your system. Only do this if you are really certain!



3. Reboot, or remember to reboot later.



If you don't want AI running on your Windows system, then Microsoft makes it hard to remove its Copilot assistant. Winaero Tweaker comes to the rescue, again! A couple of clicks and a quick reboot later, Copilot is gone!

1. Using the search box, look for ‚Äúdriver‚Äù and double-click on the returned result to disable Copilot.



2. Check the box(es) to disable Copilot and/or its taskbar button.



3. Reboot, or remember to reboot later.



Who remembers using Windows 95? Now could be a good time to schedule that colonoscopy. Joking aside, Windows 95 introduced a shortcut icon on your desktop that would shut down your system. I miss thi,s and so I am delighted that Winaero Tweaker has introduced a quick means for a hit of nostalgia.

1. Scroll down to Shortcuts and select Classic Shutdown Shortcut.



2. Check the settings, correct as necessary, and then click Create Shutdown Shortcut.



3. Check your desktop (or other specified location) for the new Shutdown icon.

Google DeepMind is rolling out Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, which, the company says, is its most advanced AI reasoning model, able to answer questions by exploring and considering multiple ideas simultaneously and then using those outputs to choose the best answer.

Subscribers to Google's $250-per-month Ultra subscription will gain access to Gemini 2.5 Deep Think in the Gemini app starting Friday.

First unveiled in May at Google I/O 2025, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think is Google's first publicly available multi-agent model. These systems spawn multiple AI agents to tackle a question in parallel, a process that uses significantly more computational resources than a single agent, but tends to result in better answers.

Google used a variation of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think to score a gold medal at this year's International Math Olympiad (IMO).

Alongside Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, the company says it is releasing the model it used at the IMO to a select group of mathematicians and academics. Google says this AI model ‚Äútakes hours to reason,‚Äù instead of seconds or minutes like most consumer-facing AI models. The company hopes the IMO model will enhance research efforts, and aims to get feedback on how to improve the multi-agent system for academic use cases.

Google notes that the Gemini 2.5 Deep Think model is a significant improvement over what it announced at I/O. The company also claims to have developed ‚Äúnovel reinforcement learning techniques‚Äù to encourage Gemini 2.5 Deep Think to make better use of its reasoning paths.

‚ÄúDeep Think can help people tackle problems that require creativity, strategic planning and making improvements step-by-step,‚Äù said Google in a blog post shared with TechCrunch.

The company says Gemini 2.5 Deep Think achieves state-of-the-art performance on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) ‚Äî a challenging test measuring AI's ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions across math, humanities, and science. Google claims its model scored 34.8% on HLE (without tools), compared to xAI's Grok 4, which scored 25.4%, and OpenAI's o3, which scored 20.3%.

Google also says Gemini 2.5 Deep Think outperforms AI models from OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic on LiveCodeBench 6, a challenging test of competitive coding tasks. Google's model scored 87.6%, whereas Grok 4 scored 79%, and OpenAI's o3 scored 72%.

Gemini 2.5 Deep Think automatically works with tools such as code execution and Google Search, and the company says it's capable of producing ‚Äúmuch longer responses‚Äù than traditional AI models.

In Google's testing, the model produced more detailed and aesthetically pleasing web development tasks compared to other AI models. The company claims the model could aid researchers and ‚Äúpotentially accelerate the path to discovery.‚Äù

It seems that several leading AI labs are converging around the multi-agent approach.

Elon Musk's xAI recently released a multi-agent system of its own, Grok 4 Heavy, which it says was able to achieve industry-leading performance on several benchmarks. OpenAI researcher Noam Brown said on a podcast that the unreleased AI model the company used to achieve a gold medal at this year's International Math Olympiad was also a multi-agent system. Meanwhile, Anthropic's Research agent, which generates thorough research briefs, is also powered by a multi-agent system.

Despite the strong performance, it seems that multi-agent systems are even costlier to serve than traditional AI models. That means tech companies may keep these systems gated behind their most expensive subscription plans, which xAI and now Google have chosen to do.

In the coming weeks, Google says it plans to share Gemini 2.5 Deep Think with a select group of testers via the Gemini API. The company says it wants to better understand how developers and enterprises may use its multi-agent system.

I can't tell you where I first saw mouth tape. Was it while investigating the intense morning shed routines on TikTok? Or perhaps an influencer who insinuated that using mouth tape at night would give me a sharper jawline? (Big shout-out to my algorithm for reminding me about that insecurity.) Nevertheless, it's become a consistent pop-up on my For You page, showing me users raving about how a colorful piece of tape across their mouth is helping them sleep better.

Mouth tape is exactly what it sounds like: a piece of tape designed to sit across your mouth to keep it closed all night long. Mouth tapers rave about health benefits and better sleep, since it encourages you to breathe through your nose rather than your mouth.

‚ÄúMouth taping is not a gimmick‚Äîit's a reminder to return to the way we're built to breathe," says Geoffrey Trenkle, a board-certified ENT, head and neck surgeon, and CEO of the Los Angeles Center for Ear, Nose, Throat and Allergy. ‚ÄúFor many people, it's a safe and effective way to promote better sleep and healthier breathing patterns. But if someone experiences nasal blockage, snoring, or disrupted sleep, it's worth exploring why that's happening.‚Äù

Mouth tape isn't necessarily a perfect solution to getting a better night's sleep, but if you don't have any airway problems, it can be something worth trying. After sleeping with eight different types of mouth tape and speaking to several experts, I'm here to tell you everything you need to know about mouth tape and which ones are best to try.

Mouth tape is a type of specially designed tape to sit over your mouth, keeping it closed throughout the night to encourage nose breathing over mouth breathing. You shouldn't just grab any kind of tape to use for this; as Andrew E. Colsky, a behavioral sleep medicine clinician and founder of the National Sleep Center, told me, ‚ÄúThis is one of those rare instances where duct tape is not the answer.‚Äù

Mouth tape has some breathability to it and is designed to keep your mouth in place without irritating the skin on your lips or around your mouth. There are a few designs, including options with a hole in the middle if you hydrate a lot at night. The book Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art by James Nestor suggests you can even use first-aid tape as mouth tape.

What does it do? It keeps your mouth closed to force you to breathe through your nose rather than your mouth. You might be looking to close your mouth to avoid snoring or drooling, but nasal breathing is overall a good thing. ‚ÄúNasal breathing plays a critical role in regulating airflow, humidifying air, and supporting optimal oxygen exchange. It also helps maintain pressure in the airways, which can reduce snoring and support better sleep quality for some people,‚Äù says Carlos Nunez, chief medical officer at Resmed, a medical device company.

Mouth tape is touted as a way to help you sleep better and snore less while sleeping. ‚ÄúIt is a method generally intended to promote nasal breathing during sleep, which some believe can enhance sleep quality‚Äîthough these claims remain largely hypothetical. In theory, keeping the mouth closed may help prevent the tongue from falling back toward the airway, and therefore decrease its potential to rattle (and thus contribute to snoring),‚Äù says David Benavides, a board-certified sleep medicine physician at Brigham & Women's Hospital.

There aren't just sleep benefits; there are some potential health benefits for both your oral health and your overall health. ‚ÄúNasal breathing can prevent your mouth and throat from drying out, and in return it will prevent bad breath, cavities, and gum inflammation," says Fatima Khan, a practicing dentist, member of the American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine, and cofounder of the oral care line Riven.

She also says it may help with nitric oxide production in the body, since the primary source of nitric oxide is in the nasal passages. ‚ÄúNitric oxide aids in regulating blood pressure and improving circulation, which in turn can boost both heart health and lower BP. Also, nitric oxide is significant in regulating insulin, which in return affects your blood sugar levels,‚Äù she says.

How bad is mouth breathing that people are actually taping their mouths shut? According to one expert, mouth breathing is a bigger problem than you'd expect. ‚ÄúMouth breathing is wildly unhealthy for any person," says Ben Miraglia, an airway dentist and chief clinical officer at Toothpillow. ‚ÄúThere is no amount of mouth breathing that is OK.‚Äù

Mouth breathing can cause issues with sleep and breathing in general. Your nose is designed to filter out debris, allergens, and even tiny insects (thank those nose hairs), and it's designed to give your lungs and throat warmer, more moist air, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Your don't get these same benefits when you breathe through your mouth. It'll also make you more likely to develop sleep problems like sleep apnea, a sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts.

Miraglia primarily treats children and approaches airway problems from a youth perspective, including larger dental problems, looking at mouth breathing as a problem overall versus just a sleep problem. From a sleep perspective, the interest in mouth breathing usually comes from sleep problems like snoring and sleep apnea, though getting better air all night long (more moist, less debris, etc.) is obviously a big benefit as well.

If you're coming here after hearing an anecdotal story about how mouth taping has made someone's sleep better, you aren't alone in hearing about mouth tape that way. There are no shortages of these videos online, frequently touting a specific tape they used. But for now, it's mainly personal perspectives supporting the narrative. ‚ÄúThere is currently extremely limited clinical evidence to support the efficacy of mouth tape in managing sleep disorders," says Benavides. "One small study from 2022, often cited, looked at 20 people with mild sleep apnea. While these participants showed some improvement with mouth tape, the study didn't include a placebo comparison, and 20 participants is simply not enough to draw solid conclusions.‚Äù

That's not to say it can never be used. Benavides says he has found use for it, even with his obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Specifically, he has found it useful for OSA patients who want to wear a nasal-only CPAP mask and who could add mouth tape to their nightly setup. "It may help minimize "mouth air leak" (where nasal-entry air escapes through the mouth during therapy) and improve both comfort and adherence. I've had success in some individuals," says Benavides.

If you can breathe comfortably through your nose, mouth tape should be safe to do. Where it gets dicey is if you're trying to use mouth tape to solve a sleep disorder or breathing problems that your nasal passageways might not be able to solve.

‚ÄúMouth tape could potentially cause harm in many others. For example, those with moderate to severe sleep apnea may actually find themselves with even more impaired ability to breathe than before. Worse yet, it may further compromise those with central sleep apnea‚Äîa different type of apnea disorder,‚Äù says Benavides. ‚ÄúAnother group to watch out for are those with impaired nasal breathing, as removing the ability to breathe through the mouth severely restricts their remaining‚Äîand often much-needed‚Äîairflow path.‚Äù

The takeaway is this: If you can't breathe comfortably on your own through your nose as it is, mouth tape won't fix that for you.

Since I have no airway problems, I spent several weeks trying different mouth tapes. I tried them all during the day at my desk to see how they felt and how secure they were, and then I wore the most comfortable and secure options overnight. Overall, I usually got a solid night's sleep when using the tape, but some were less comfortable than others, and I found myself irritated by them and removing them during the night. I also had to skip mouth tape if I had a cold or any kind of postnasal drip, since I have a 3-year-old who brings home a ton of germs. After trying multiple kinds of tape, I had some pretty clear favorites.

Dream Recovery

Dream Recovery (1 Month Supply)

Dream Recovery (3 Months Supply)

This is my favorite mouth tape I've tried. Dream says all of its mouth tape uses organic bamboo silk, and while there aren't any certifications on its site to back that up, the Plus+ tape is super soft and flexible on my face, easily the softest I tried. It still feels plenty secure and breathable with that softness and was an easy favorite after my testing.

SayLess

SayLess (1 Month Supply)

SayLess (3 Month Supply)

This set was also really comfortable, with a softer texture and a larger shape that will fit all kinds of lip sizes. It is very feminine in its design and comes in a couple different shades. This set promises to hold overnight skin care products, and I tested this tape with the Laniege Lip Sleeping Mask ($24) on my lips and found it stayed on when I used both together.

Here are the other mouth tapes I tried. All prices are based on a one-month supply.

Dream Recovery Mouth Tape for $34: I like this one because it has a wide and tall design, but the Plus+ version is so much softer. This one feels pretty coarse.

Heronlink Micropore Premium Tape for $17: This is at the top of Amazon's recommended mouth tapes, and it's a fine option. It's secure on my face, but the opening in the middle allowed for me to resume mouth breathing pretty easily.

Hostage Tape for $20: This tape was solid to wear all night long, but I found that it was most likely to leave bits of the tape on my face. It's another popular one I see recommended often online, but it wasn't tremendously better than any others I tested.

Loftie Mouth Tape for $30: This set is pretty comfortable, and I like the small opening for a water straw without giving me too much wiggle room. But it left behind the most sticky residue after using it, and the design of this tape is a little Ronald McDonald for my liking.

Longevity Sleep Tape for ¬£8: I loved this tape. I loved it almost as much as the Dream and Say Less I recommend above, and it's definitely one of the most secure tapes without being too restrictive or coarse. It has a nice lavender-scented option that comes in purple, plus black and beige options that are both unscented. It's only available in the UK, though.

The Skinny Confidential for $39: I found myself removing this tape during the night. It has an opening like the Loftie above, but didn't feel quite as secure, and the more feminine shape wasn't as wide as the Say Less option to fit more lip sizes. It did come with a cute little case for my bedside.

Queen Tape for $13: This tape is comfortable, and I constantly see it advertised on TikTok, but I didn't find the adhesive secure. It started peeling off my face almost immediately during my daytime wear tests.

VIO2 Unscented Mouth Tapes for $27: This has a different style of design, with an H-style look to it versus tape that covers a minimal amount of your skin. You could wear it different ways, but I found the H-style position the most secure. I didn't like it as much as full tape designs, but this is a good option if you want security without full coverage.

After trying so many mouth tapes, the question remained: Did they work? Did I sleep better and wake up more rested?

Honestly, not really. I had the same kind of sleep I would without mouth tape: better, deeper sleep on days I had more physical activity and kept to my routines better, and worse sleep on nights after I forgot to go outside and do anything beyond hunch over a screen (she says as she types at her desk, staring at yet another screen). Some nights I woke up and ripped the mouth tape off in irritation, other nights I slept all night long with it on my face. Some nights I had to take it off at 3 in the morning because my toddler was up yet again, so the inconsistency could be me and my own daily routines.

But I also wonder if that's everyone's issue. Did they have an inconsistent bedtime routine, and now adding something that makes them mentally prepared for bedtime is what's changing their life? Perhaps it's not the tape so much as the need for a bedtime routine to tell their body and mind it's time for bed. There's no way to be sure if that's the secret benefit of mouth tape, but it is known that a good bedtime routine to wind down before bed makes for better sleep.

If you're looking for other solutions to help with nasal breathing, mouth tape isn't the only option. Trenkle recommends a handful of different medical and lifestyle changes. ‚ÄúSaline rinses, nasal steroid sprays, and allergy management can dramatically improve nasal function,‚Äù he says. "Tools like nasal dilators or strips can also help keep the nose open during sleep. For patients with sleep apnea or structural airway issues, we offer targeted therapies‚Äîfrom oral appliances to surgical solutions‚Äîdepending on the diagnosis.‚Äù

Paying with a handwave once sounded like science fiction, but contactless palm recognition service Amazon One has already been used more than 8 million times, according to the company. That's Amazon, though, which explains why it has been deployed in Amazon stores and more than 500 Whole Foods Market stores in the U.S., but only 150 third-party locations.

Meanwhile, fintech startups like Latvia's Handwave are stepping onto the field, aiming to provide third-party retailers with a similar but independent solution for faster checkout while leveraging the giant's role in popularizing biometric payments in the West. (China has already begun adopting biometric palm payments, with Tencent working to bring its Weixin Palm Pay service into mainstream use.)

Like Apple's Face ID, palm scanning uses more than static images: It analyzes palm vein patterns and also verifies that the user is physically present when they hover their hand over the scanner. This method works for secure contactless payments and also applies to broader identity verification scenarios ‚Äî with players like Keyo also supporting secure building access and other applications.

In contrast, Handwave is focusing specifically on retail ‚Äî and since it doesn't own stores like Amazon, it had to seek partners, which required having a product. Three years in, and now with its own hardware and software, the Latvian startup is preparing for market pilots that will deploy its palm-scanning devices at retail stores. 

Merchants who deploy the startup's tech would pay a transaction fee that Handwave claims will be on par with or lower than standard payments. According to Handwave, faster and cheaper checkouts could reduce costs. But unlike some cost-cutting measures, this solution aims to make things easier for customers ‚Äî with the promise of no cards, no apps, no fingerprint scanners, and no facial scans ‚Äî even for age verification and loyalty programs.

Handwave's co-founders, CEO Janis Stirna and Sandis Osmanis-Usmanis, previously worked for one of the world's largest global payment providers, Worldline. Despite this connection, the team aims to build a wide ecosystem. ‚ÄúOur plan is to collaborate with any financial institution or acquiring bank,‚Äù Stirna told TechCrunch.

The startup has only partnered with a handful of financial institutions so far, ‚Äúbut very big ones, especially in Europe,‚Äù Stirna said. This summer, the startup signed an agreement with Visa that could speed up the deployment of Handwave's solution in any country, according to its chief revenue officer, Oskars Laksevics.

While Handwave has its eyes on the U.S. market as well, Laksevics believes that it can be an advantage to start out in the European Union ‚Äî ‚Äúthe strictest market in the world‚Äù ‚Äî and demonstrate compliance there before expanding.

Being an independent European player could also help the startup keep an edge if or when Amazon decides to more aggressively offer Amazon One to third parties; or if JP Morgan rolls out its own palm payment experiment further. 

The startup also can rely on other arguments, including pricing. After financial partners told Handwave its devices need to be able to compete on price, the startup developed its own hardware and algorithms making them cheaper than others, Stirna said. 

Being based in Riga also enabled Handwave to operate with limited capital. The startup told TechCrunch its R&D process was funded through bootstrapping, a $780,000 angel investment round, and $267,000 in non-equity funding. This sum came from an EU-funded cybersecurity grant, as well as support from Latvia's LIAA Business Incubator and EU-backed accelerator Ready2Scale.

As it gears up for its first pilots and obtaining regulatory certifications, Handwave has now secured a $4.2 million seed funding round led by Vilnius-based VC firm Practica Capital, with participation from FirstPick and Outlast Fund, also from Lithuania; and Inovo.vc, a Polish VC firm that also operates in the Baltics.

The Baltic states have established themselves as a fintech hub, but also have scientific talent that's easier for a startup like Handwave to attract and afford than in Silicon Valley ‚Äî including AI engineers. ‚ÄúIn the Baltics, there are not a lot of companies where you can get that extreme level of technical challenge to resolve,‚Äù Stirna said.

As for Laksevics, who previously held a senior marketing role at Baltic bank Luminor Bank, where Stirna had also worked, he told TechCrunch that he was drawn by the vision. ‚ÄúI left a very well-paid corporate job to join this one, and I truly believe that we are building the next big global payment platform,‚Äù he said. 

Handwave seems ready to put its best hand forward ‚Äî but only time will tell if the market will grab on and if biometric palm payments will truly take hold.

Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally. Ischemic stroke, strongly linked to atherosclerotic plaques, requires accurate plaque and vessel wall segmentation and quantification for definitive diagnosis. However, conventional manual segmentation remains time-consuming and operator-dependent, whereas current computer-aided tools fall short in achieving the accuracy required for clinical applications. These technological bottlenecks severely hamper precise diagnosis and treatment of ischemic stroke.

In a study published in European Radiology, a research team led by Dr. Zhang Na from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT) of Chinese Academy of Sciences, along with collaborators, has developed a fully learnable parameter based multi-task segmentation model and a structure-guided, two-stage small-target segmentation method based on high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) vessel wall imaging. This approach enables automated and accurate segmentation and quantitative analysis of carotid arterial vessel lumens, vessel walls, and plaques, offering a reliable AI-assisted diagnostic tool for clinical risk assessment of ischemic stroke.

In this study, the proposed method consists of two key steps. The first step involves constructing a purely learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN), named Vessel-SegNet, to segment the lumen and vessel wall. The second step leverages vessel wall priors-specifically, manual priors and Tversky-loss-based automatic priors-to improve plaque segmentation by utilizing the morphological similarity between the vessel wall and atherosclerotic plaque.

This study included data from 193 patients with atherosclerotic plaque across five centers, all of whom underwent T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. The dataset was divided into three subsets: 107 patients for training and validation, 39 for internal testing, and 47 for external testing.

Experimental results demonstrated that most Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) for lumen and vessel wall segmentation exceeded 90%. The incorporation of vessel wall priors improved the DSC for plaque segmentation by over 10%, achieving 88.45%. Furthermore, compared to Dice-loss-based priors, Tversky-loss-based priors further enhanced the DSC by nearly 3%, reaching 82.84%.

In contrast to manual methods, the proposed technique provides accurate, automated plaque segmentation and completes quantitative plaque characteristic assessment for a single patient in under 3 seconds.

The goal of our research is to leverage AI models to produce accurate, reproducible, and clinically relevant quantitative outcomes, which can assist healthcare professionals in stroke diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making."

Dr. Zhang added, "In the future, we will need to conduct additional studies using other equipment, populations, and anatomical analyses to further validate the reliability of the research results."

A new radioimmunotherapy approach has been shown to successfully eliminate cancer stem cells (CSCs) in preclinical models of ovarian cancer, outperforming the current gold standard. This research, published in the July issue of The Journal of Nuclear Medicine, lays the foundation for further development of radionuclide therapies targeting CSCs, offering renewed hope for more effective treatment options and improved outcomes for patients.

CSCs are highly tumorigenic, self-renewable cells that play a key role in tumor relapse, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Although the clinical significance of eliminating CSCs is clearly recognized and CSC immunotherapies have been examined in preclinical and clinical evaluations, the development of such therapies remains a challenge. 

Radioimmunotherapy enables precise, target-specific delivery of particulate radiation to cancer-associated antigens, while minimizing off-target accumulation and increasing tumor retention and irradiation, which makes it a promising choice for targeting CSCs. Our study sought to investigate the effectiveness of a new radionuclide Terbium-161 (161Tb) for eradicating CSCs due to emission of short-ranged conversion and Auger electrons-besides beta-minus particle-successfully eliminated ovarian CSCs in contrast to Lutetium-177 (177Lu)."

J√ºrgen Gr√ºnberg, PhD, senior scientist at the Center for Radiopharmaceutical Sciences, Center for Life Sciences at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland

Researchers identified CSC-associated biomarkers (L1CAM+/CD133+) in an ovarian cancer sample and then created radiolabeled immunoconjugates with 177Lu or 161Tb to target these CSCs. The cytotoxicity of the radioimmunoconjugates (177Lu-DOTA-chCE7 and 161Tb-DOTA-chCE7) was measured by cell proliferation assays in vitro and in xenografted mouse models in vivo.

161Tb-DOTA-chCE7 showed significantly increased cytotoxicity, compared with 177Lu-DOTA-chCE7, eliminating all ovarian CSCs and tumor cells differentiated from the CSCs in vivo.

"This signifies a pivotal step toward the translation of 161Tb-based therapies into clinical application," noted Tihomir Todorov, PhD, junior scientist at the Center for Radiopharmaceutical Sciences, Center for Life Sciences at the Paul Scherrer Institute. "Targeted radionuclide therapies with 161Tb could support personalized medicine leading to advancements in cancer care including eradication of resistant CSCs and increased therapeutic efficacy alongside improved diagnosis, detection, and treatment monitoring."

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly NAFLD) and aging are locked in a vicious circle: senescence of liver cells accelerates fat accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis, while chronic steatosis in turn hastens hepatic decline. Up to 38 % of adults worldwide have MASLD, and prevalence, severity and mortality all rise with age. Ageing livers shrink by ~30%, clear lipids and glucose less efficiently, and regenerate more slowly after injury. Lipid deposition is driven by falling Œ≤-oxidation, leptin resistance and the GPCPD1-glycerophosphocholine pathway; glucose intolerance emerges from insulin resistance linked to visceral obesity and telomere-p53 signalling. Senescent hepatocytes, endothelial cells, stellate cells and Kupffer macrophages each contribute distinct pathologies, but their shared secretion of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) propagates damage throughout the organ.

Hepatocytes are the first responders. In aged or obese mice, 60-80 % of hepatocytes display p16, p21 or Œ≤-gal positivity; enlarged nuclei, reduced smooth endoplasmic reticulum and fewer mitochondria accompany metabolic reprogramming that favours lipogenesis. SASP cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-Œ± recruit macrophages, perpetuate inflammation and can either restrain or promote hepatocellular carcinoma depending on context. Selective insulin resistance within senescent hepatocytes diverts incoming fatty acids to triglyceride droplets, fuelling steatosis.

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) undergo "pseudocapillarization" with age: thickness increases, fenestrae decrease and basement membranes form. Loss of fenestrae impedes insulin uptake and lipoprotein exchange, aggravating systemic dyslipidaemia and hepatic fat overload. Senescent LSECs secrete CXCR4 ligands that polarise macrophages toward an M1 phenotype, amplifying fibro-inflammatory signalling. Conversely, restoring C-kit-positive LSECs or activating SIRT1 via Notch inhibition reverses these changes and improves steatohepatitis.

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) paradoxically assume a less fibrotic yet senescent state. They lose lipid droplets, produce fewer extracellular-matrix proteins but secrete matrix metalloproteinases that degrade existing scar tissue. p53-dependent IGF-1 signalling and IL-22-STAT3 activation drive this anti-fibrotic senescence, rendering senescent HSCs targets for NK-cell elimination. However, transient persistence of senescent HSCs after partial hepatectomy releases IL-6 and CXCR2 ligands that stimulate compensatory hepatocyte proliferation, illustrating the dual roles of cellular senescence.

Kupffer macrophages accumulate with age and shift toward an M1 pro-inflammatory profile. Autophagy declines, ROS rise and IRF5-mediated transcription of TNF-Œ± and IL-1Œ≤ intensifies. These macrophages amplify steatohepatitis by recruiting monocytes via CCR2-CCL2 and CXCR3-CXCL10 axes. Depletion of Kupffer cells in mouse models blunts progression from MASLD to MASH, confirming their pathogenic centrality.

Given the intertwining of ageing and steatosis, interventions that target senescence are emerging. Senolytic cocktails‚Äîdasatinib plus quercetin, Bcl-2 inhibitors navitoclax or ABT-737, and senolytic vaccination against glycoprotein GPNMB‚Äîselectively eliminate p16-high cells, reduce hepatic triglycerides and restore insulin sensitivity in mice. Small-molecule vorapaxar blocks thrombomodulin-PAR1 signalling in senescent hepatocytes, diminishing inflammation and fibrosis. Genetic modulation of BMP4-Gremlin1 or PLA2R1 likewise mitigates steatosis and cellular senescence.

Lifestyle measures complement pharmacology. Exercise and calorie restriction restore AMPK-mediated autophagy, lower hepatic fat and improve glucose tolerance in rodents and humans. The key challenge is to distinguish beneficial, transient senescent cells‚Äîneeded for wound healing and tumour suppression‚Äîfrom chronic, pathogenic ones. Future trials must therefore refine cell-type-specific senolytic strategies, validate biomarkers and balance efficacy against the physiological roles of senescence in liver homeostasis.

New research shows that exercise-based cardiac rehab offers real benefits for people with atrial fibrillation, reducing the risk of recurrence and improving mental well-being, highlighting the need for wider adoption of these programs.

In a recent study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers examined the impact of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) for atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.

AF is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with an estimated six to 12 million people projected to develop AF in the US by 2050 and 17.9 million in Europe by 2060. It is also a major risk factor for ischemic stroke, constituting a significant economic burden. Although current treatments can effectively control symptoms and stroke risk in AF, self-management interventions could be key to managing arrhythmia progression and maintaining health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and functional capacity.

ExCR is a comprehensive intervention involving exercise training, personalized lifestyle risk factor management, medical risk management, health behavior education, and psychosocial intervention. Current AF management guidelines do not recommend ExCR as the benefits of exercise for individuals with AF remain unclear. Previously, the authors reported improvements in functional capacity with ExCR in AF patients, but the impact of ExCR on clinical events was uncertain.

Patients saw measurable drops in AF burden ‚Äì exercise programs reduced symptom severity scores by 1.61 points and episode frequency by 0.57 events on standardized scales, with consistent benefits across AF subtypes.

In the present Cochrane study, researchers systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the impact of ExCR for AF patients. Electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, LILACS) and trial registers were searched for relevant RCTs from inception to March 2024.

Eligible studies included adults with AF, exercise-based interventions (including center-based, hybrid, or home-based programs like yoga or Qigong), a control arm, and the following outcomes: mortality, serious adverse events, AF recurrence, AF symptom severity, AF burden, HRQoL, and exercise capacity. Exercise-based intervention was any outpatient, inpatient, home-based, or community rehabilitation program that must include an exercise component and may also include a psycho-educational component.

A control arm may include no intervention, usual treatment, or another cardiac rehabilitation program without exercise. Data were extracted from trials, and the risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane's risk of bias-1 tool. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using the standardized mean difference. GRADE and RTSA were used to evaluate evidence certainty and required sample sizes.

The database search identified 6,063 records. Of these, 4,538 unique studies were screened, resulting in the full-text analysis of 51 studies. This review included 20 RCTs conducted from 2006 to 2024, encompassing 2,039 individuals with AF with a mean follow-up of 11 months. Notably, 73% of participants were male, limiting generalizability to women. Most RCTs were conducted in Europe (10), followed by Asia (four), and Australia (two). Follow-up duration lasted from eight weeks to five years.

Exercise capacity improvements were clinically significant ‚Äì the 3.18 mL/kg/min increase in VO‚ÇÇ peak surpassed the 1 mL/kg/min threshold known to enhance patient function and prognosis.

Six RCTs included participants with permanent AF, four included those with paroxysmal AF, and nine included those with persistent or sustained AF. The mean age of participants was 63. Five RCTs assessed comprehensive ExCR, while other trials assessed exercise-only cardiac rehabilitation. All trials included a "no formal exercise training" control arm, involving education, usual medical care, and psychological intervention.

The exercise interventions differed in frequency, duration, intensity, and session length. The risk of bias was mixed for the trials. All-cause mortality was reported in nine trials. No difference was observed in mortality between ExCR and controls, though evidence certainty was low. Ten RCTs reported serious adverse events, and there was no difference between ExCR and controls with very low certainty evidence. AF recurrence was reported in four trials; there was moderate-certainty evidence of a benefit of ExCR compared to controls.

AF symptom severity was reported in five trials and showed benefits from ExCR compared to controls with low certainty. Likewise, AF burden showed benefits with ExCR versus controls with moderate certainty. Fourteen RCTs included a validated HRQoL measure. The short-form 36 (SF-36) mental component demonstrated benefit with ExCR compared to controls with moderate certainty, while the physical component showed no significant improvement (very low certainty). Exercise capacity was reported as maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) and the six-minute walk test. ExCR showed a clinically meaningful benefit on VO2 peak compared to controls (mean improvement 3.18 mL/kg/min, exceeding the 1 mL/kg/min threshold for clinical significance).

The authors note a U-shaped relationship between exercise and AF risk, where excessive endurance exercise may increase AF prevalence in athletes, though this subgroup is unlikely to attend ExCR. GRADE and RTSA assessments indicated low-to-moderate certainty for most outcomes, underscoring the need for larger trials. Based on these findings, they suggest clinical guidelines should incorporate ExCR alongside standard AF therapies.

In sum, ExCR resulted in lower disease burden, recurrence, and severity, and improved exercise capacity and HRQoL mental components in individuals with AF. The effects of ExCR were consistent across RCTs, regardless of participant characteristics, nature of intervention, and AF subtype. The study's limitations include clinical heterogeneity, predominant male representation, publication bias for exercise capacity measures, and reporting bias (due to self-reported outcomes). Future research should prioritize representative recruitment of women and diverse ethnic groups.

By understanding differences in how people's brains are wired, clinicians may be able to predict who would benefit from a self-guided anxiety care app, according to a new analysis from a clinical trial led by Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian investigators. The preliminary study suggested that young people with weaker connections between two brain areas involved in both attending to and regulating responses to anxiety were more likely to benefit from a self-guided anxiety care app than those with stronger connections.

The study, published July 31 in JAMA Network Open, looked at data from a subset of clinical trial participants who agreed to undergo a brain MRI before using the anxiety care app developed by the investigators. The app, called Maya, is essentially a course in cognitive behavioral therapy, a gold standard psychotherapeutic intervention that provides users with skills to support them in shifting their thinking, completing challenging behaviors and learning new ways to cope. The interactive platform guides young adults with anxiety through videos, exercises and educational content.

Initial results of the clinical trial with 59 participants showed that using the app reduced anxiety symptoms for many patients; now the new analysis may help identify which patients benefit most.

People with weaker connections in key brain networks involved in anxiety and regulating emotions were more likely to see improved anxiety symptoms with the use of the app. That makes sense because cognitive behavioral therapy helps teach people how to regulate their responses to emotions."

Dr. Faith Gunning, senior author, associate professor of psychology and vice chair for research in the Department of Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine

Dr. Gunning and her colleagues developed the Maya app to help fill critical gaps in access to care for young adults with anxiety. Young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 are at a stage in life where they are experiencing many life changes, and studies have shown they are at fairly high risk for anxiety disorders. During this time, they may also have gaps in health care coverage or may have difficulties accessing or affording in-person mental health care. Some may also be hesitant to seek in-person care because of stigma surrounding mental health or because of their anxiety symptoms.

For the clinical trial, 59 young adults with anxiety used the app twice a week for six weeks. Investigators tracked participants' symptoms during that time and for an additional six weeks. Those who used the app experienced reduced anxiety symptoms throughout the 12-week monitoring period. Some continued to use the app after the initial 6-week trial period, and others experienced lasting improvements in symptoms even after discontinuing use of the app after 6 weeks.

The investigators were able to use data from 30 participants who had MRIs before using the Maya app to determine if specific patterns of brain activity indicated individuals who were more likely to experience symptom improvements.

The results suggest that young adults experiencing anxiety whose brains were less efficient at regulating their responses to anxiety-provoking information benefited more from learning cognitive behavioral therapy techniques through the app. In contrast, those with stronger connections in circuits involved with greater attention to potentially threatening or anxiety provoking information were less likely to benefit from using the app.

"App-based interventions like Maya are poised to address a critical barrier to care for people with anxiety, but like any mental health treatment, some people will benefit more than others," said first author Dr. Abhishek Jaywant, assistant professor of neuropsychology in the Department of Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine and a psychologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. "Our study is among the first to suggest that patterns of brain function are relevant in helping researchers and clinicians understand response to app-based treatments for anxiety. These findings could one day help us to recommend an app like Maya to patients most likely to benefit."

"Our study will help us better tailor treatments to patients in the future," said Dr. Gunning, who is also a psychologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. "Anxiety symptoms can be very disabling to young adults at an important life stage, so matching them with an effective therapy as soon as possible is important."

It didn't take long for history to be made in the 2025 Leagues Cup. 

On Thursday night, the Seattle Sounders demolished the reigning Concacaf Champions Cup winners, Cruz Azul, 7‚Äì0, taking no mercy in their tournament-opening performance, with shell-shocking moments until the final whistle. 

Six different players hit the scoresheet, all tallying in the second half after the match was scoreless at halftime against the same opponent that the Sounders had fallen to in the Champions Cup last16 earlier in the season.

Yet, while Yeimar, Obed Vargas, Jes√∫s Ferreira, Osaze De Rosario, Nouhou and Pedro De La Vega will remember their moments, none stood out as much as De La Vega's perfectly hit volley, which could contend for the FIFA Puskas Award for the world's best goal in 2025. 

OMG PEDRO DE LA VEGA #LeaguesCup2025 pic.twitter.com/T3iow4fAu7

At the same time, the seven-goal margin broke the record for the largest ever victory by an MLS club over a Liga MX side in any competition. It also marked the widest winning margin in any competition for the Sounders since joining MLS in 2009. 

The result also brought MLS to 10 wins in 18 matches in the 2025 Leagues Cup, and has the American first division outscoring its Mexican counterpart 40-30 in those combined contests. 

‚ÄúWe knew that this was going to be a rematch from Concacaf. They were a very good team; they're a team that eliminated us,‚Äù Ferreira said. ‚ÄúWe wanted revenge...we came in with the mentality that we are a good team."

While the Rave Green cruised over La Maquina, who beat Vancouver Whitecaps FC 5‚Äì0 in the Concacaf Champions Cup final, it was just the continuation of their stellar form since competing in the FIFA Club World Cup. 

Since falling out of the group stage against Atl√©tico Madrid, Botafogo and Paris Saint-Germain, the Sounders have gone undefeated through seven games in MLS. Now, they are in a prime position to advance from Phase One in the Leagues Cup. 

‚ÄúI didn't actually know what I was going to say to them in the locker room because it was such a tremendous win for the club,‚Äù said Sounders head coach Brian Schmetzer after the match. ‚ÄúIn this club's history, it ranks right up there with all of the big wins that we've had. It's not a championship match, so I would probably temper it with that, but it certainly was a hell of a performance.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the continued form of De La Vega is an inspiring sign, after the young Designated Player struggled to find his consistency since joining the Sounders in 2024. In recent weeks, though, he has been one of the club's best players and is up to seven goals and three assists, with Thursday's strike the latest showcase of his abilities. 

‚ÄúThe execution, the technical ability, the ball that Alex [Roldan] plays. I mean, it's way up,‚Äù Schmetzer said of the goal and assist from Alex Roldan. ‚ÄúThat was an unbelievably technically challenging finish, and he made it look easy.‚Äù

With the win, the Sounders can look ahead to their next matches against Santos Laguna and Club Tijuana, as they hope to qualify for the tournament's quarterfinals. 

‚Äú[The players] are driving us,‚Äù added Schmetzer. ‚ÄúThat group in there is completely together, motivated. They know they're a good team.‚Äù Cruz Azul will also be painfully aware of that fact.

The Club World Cup served as proof of concept for regular season European football to be played in America

Javier Tebas insisted it was going to happen. The La Liga president has a tendency of doing these things. He's a big manifestation guy. Say something loud enough, and with enough authority, and it will come true. His latest speaking of something into existence?

There will be a competitive game of top flight Spanish soccer in the United States. And it would be held in Miami.

"We have to find a good date in the calendar, but we are going to try to do it in Miami, where we tried previously. We are not going to do a whole gameweek. It will be one game (per season), and that's it," he told The Athletic in August 2024.

The comments caused a stir. European soccer has long had a fascination with playing its games abroad, such are the commercial revenue possibilities. Preseason friendlies in the U.S. are customary at this point - Bournemouth-Everton was played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey last week as part of the Premier League Summer Series.

But competitive soccer, with points on the line, was always something of a pipe dream. Still, there Tebas was, insisting that it could happen - and with a venue already determined.

Reports at the time suggested the fixture would be held that December, near Christmas. And then the conversation simply faded. It became clear that the logistics were too hasty, even if Tebas is a very good politician. But the fact that his statement picked up any steam, and was even considered, suggested that the concept - resisted so virulently by numerous parties for so long - is coming closer to fruition.

Legal barriers that once prevented such game are collapsing. The Club World Cup's success - especially in the games that mattered among big European clubs - will offer a boost. It seems inevitable at this point: there will be a competitive football match held in the United States. Soon. It will send American fans into a frenzy, and infuriate core supporters to no end. 

And for good or ill, there's no way to stop it.

Home ¬ª Visa cardholders can register for early ‚Äúdraw‚Äù to FIFA World Cup 2026 tickets

Visa cardholders will get the first crack at FIFA World Cup 26‚Ñ¢ tickets when an exclusive presale draw opens on Sept. 10, FIFA announced Thursday. The ‚ÄúVisa Presale Draw‚Äù lets fans register between Sept. 10‚Äì19 for a chance to buy seats in the tournament's opening sales phase‚Äîa window in which Visa will be the only accepted form of payment.

To take part, fans must create a FIFA ID at FIFA.com/tickets and complete an online application any time during the 10-day period. FIFA will then run a random draw and begin emailing selected applicants on or after Sept. 30, assigning each a dedicated purchase slot in October. Ticket availability during those time slots will be first-come, first-served.

‚ÄúExcitement for the FIFA World Cup 26 is building fast, and Sept. 10 is a date every football fan should have marked in their calendar,‚Äù said Romy Gai, FIFA's chief business officer, calling the presale ‚Äúa gateway to the most inclusive and spectacular tournament in our history.‚Äù 

Frank Cooper, Visa's chief marketing officer, added that the payments giant aims to ‚Äúfuel the passion of the global football community and ensure the economic impact of the tournament reaches far beyond the final whistle.‚Äù 

Because demand is expected to far outstrip supply, FIFA will roll out additional ticketing phases with broader payment options later this year; specifics on those rounds are due in September. Hospitality packages, which bundle premium seating with food and amenities, are already on sale at FIFA.com/hospitality. FIFA is urging fans to buy only through its official channels to avoid invalid or fraudulent tickets.

The 2026 tournament‚Äîthe first to feature 48 teams and 104 matches‚Äîwill be staged across 16 venues in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Match tickets do not guarantee entry into a host country, so fans should confirm visa and travel requirements well in advance.

Juventus general manager Damien Comolli has forcefully responded to the allegations made by Tim Weah's agent regarding his proposed move to Marseille, defending the Serie A club and shifting the blame onto the U.S. men's national team forward.

Weah's representative Badou Sambague went public with his disdain for Juventus earlier this week, accusing the Turin outfit of showing ‚Äútotal disrespect‚Äù. The USMNT international did not join up with Mauricio Pochettino's Gold Cup roster so that he could be available for Juve during this summer's Club World Cup. He featured for just 45 minutes.

Sambague claimed that an unnamed member of Juve's hierarchy deliberately ‚Äúbotched‚Äù Weah's tournament and ‚Äútried to force him to go where he wanted‚Äù. ‚ÄúToday,‚Äù Sambague continued, ‚Äúas revenge, he's demanding a fortune and waiting for a Premier League offer that won't come and will never be approved by us.‚Äù

Comolli was keen to quash those accusations. ‚ÄúWe deserve respect, we give respect to everyone,‚Äù the club chief seethed to Sky Italia. ‚ÄúThe players are being looked after, no one is being pushed aside.‚Äù

Weah is thought to be pushing for a move to Marseille, yet Comolli questioned whether such a deal is even possible.

‚ÄúWhen you come out strongly and say I want to join one club, and only one club, you need to make sure that club backs you up,‚Äù he warned. ‚ÄúIf that club doesn't back you up, what do you do? You are in a corner and have nowhere else to go.

‚ÄúYou said very loud that you only want to go to Marseille, but what happens if Marseille is not there for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe player wants to go to Marseille, but in soccer you can't choose a team because if the right offer doesn't arrive, you stay on the sidelines,‚Äù Comolli added. ‚ÄúAnd the offer hasn't arrived yet.‚Äù

Weah was linked with a move to Nottingham Forest in the Premier League earlier this summer, with an agreement for the forward and his teammate Samuel Mbangula worth around $25.6 million thought to have been struck in June. Those negotiations ultimately fell through and Weah remains floating in transfer limbo.

Donald Trump has reportedly threatened to block an iconic nation from competing at next summer's 2026 World Cup.

The opening match of the World Cup is just 315 days away, but several huge decisions are yet to be made regarding the participation of several nations.

Currently, 13 teams have secured their spots at next summer's tournament ‚Äì Canada, Mexico, USA, Australia, IR Iran, Uzbekistan, Jordan, Korea Republic, Japan, Argentina, Ecuador, Brazil and New Zealand ‚Äì while 35 places are still up for grabs.

Trump was front and centre during Chelsea's Club World Cup celebrations and stood alongside captain Reece James when he lifted the trophy following the Blues' emphatic 3-0 victory over Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain in what was an unofficial dress rehearsal for next summer's showpiece.

But away from Trump's at times jovial public front, there are concerns that the World Cup could be plunged into chaos as a result of his strict travel bans.

Council on Foreign Relations reported on June 9 that travel bans were enforced, clamping down on nineteen countries.

Twelve countries ‚Äì Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Haiti, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Myanmar, Eritrea, Sudan and Yemen - are fully banned, while seven nations face partial restrictions that were applied, including Venezuela, Cuba, Burundi, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo and Turkmenistan.

On July 31, CNN reported that Trump could ban visas from Brazil ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

This could mean that the five-time World Cup winners play without fans from their homeland, although rules do not apply to athletes and coaches.

Dual citizens are also not subject to a ban.

And that's not all. In April, Trump announced that Brazilian goods imported to the US would face tariffs of 10%. However, he has since raised the rate to 50% amid huge backlash.

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva responded in an interview with The New York Times.

‚ÄúThere's no reason to be afraid,‚Äù Lula said. ‚ÄúI am worried, obviously, because we have economic interests, political interests, technological interests. But at no point will Brazil negotiate as if it were a small country up against a big country. Brazil will negotiate as a sovereign country.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn politics between two states, the will of neither should prevail,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúWe always need to find the middle ground. This is achieved not by puffing out your chest and shouting about things you can't deliver, nor by bowing your head and simply saying ‚Äòamen' to whatever the United States wants.‚Äù

There are a ton of questions about how the ticketing process is going to work. Let's talk about it!

The 2026 World Cup ticketing sales are set to begin next month, and it's about time to start addressing some frequently asked questions. On Episode 158, we do just that.

First, we discuss the World Cup Draw which is reportedly set to take place on December 5th in Las Vegas. The draw always is a night for glitz and glamor, and Vegas could be the best backdrop for that particular night.

After quickly discussing the draw, we get into the first ticket phase for the 2026 World Cup, and it's one for all Visa cardholders. The application window runs September 10-19 and will provide the first major lottery for fans around the world to get tickets to the biggest sporting event on the planet.

After the break, we get to the questions. There have been several general questions about how the process will go for fans to get tickets to World Cup matches, whether they are for the USMNT or matches involving other teams. How much will tickets likely cost? Can I just find tickets on StubHub or another third party reseller? What will it be like to travel between the United States, Mexico, and Canada for matches? We don't have all the answers, but we get into a lot of information that we do know on this episode.

Ligue 1 reduced from 20 to 18 clubs ahead of the 2023/24 season

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

The Premier League will not bow to pressure to reduce in size from 20 to 18 clubs, says chief executive Richard Masters.

The new season kicks off on 15 August, just three weeks on from Chelsea's victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final as tensions continue to boil over the congested football calendar.

The Blues played almost a year of continuous football before the end of their 2024/25 season gave them a long-awaited reprieve, but will have to do it all over again with 11 months of competitive action culminating back in the United States for the World Cup - the final of which takes place on 19 July in New Jersey.

Complaints over the over-packed schedule have been rife, with Manchester City midfielder Rodri warning last September that players are ‚Äúclose‚Äù to going on strike because of the increase in games. He said this just 10 days before being ruled out for the domestic season with an ACL injury.

France's Ligue 1 made the decision to reduce from 20 to 18 teams for the 2023/24 campaign, in part so to lighten the fixture load.

However, Masters has stated that the Premier League should not be ‚Äúforced‚Äù to follow suit.

"I don't think we should be forced into that decision,‚Äù he told BBC Sport.

"I am all for the growth of the game and the exciting competitions our clubs can participate in - but not at the expense of domestic football."

This comes in the midst of a long-winded dispute between Fifa and FifPro - the world's main union for footballers - over the congested calendar and its impact on player welfare.

FifPro general secretary believes it is difficult for players to make their voices heard, remaining fearful of speaking out on the heavy workload because of the impact it could have on their careers.

‚ÄúI was speaking to some of the top stars that were going to play in the Club World Cup, and they were saying that they hadn't had a rest for X amount of time,‚Äù Phillips said. 

‚ÄúOne of them even said, ‚ÄòI'll only get a rest when I get injured'. Others were resigned actually, and cynical about speaking up.

‚ÄúThen you see some of the same players two weeks later having to record social media videos saying ‚Äòwe think the Club World Cup is great' because their employers are telling them to do it.

‚ÄúThat's why unions do exist, partly, to be their voice, because they are in an invidious position. They can't speak. They can't say exactly what they think ‚Äì well, they can do, but that may have consequences.‚Äù

Jeff Stelling has shockingly declared that Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca is under ‚Äòpressure' heading into the new Premier League season.

Maresca has worked miracles since replacing Mauricio Pochettino last year, helping the Blues win the Conference League and Club World Cup.

The Italian boss also guided Chelsea to a fourth-place Premier League finish last season, with the west London club making a return to the Champions League after they ended up 12th and sixth in 2023 and 2024.

But football pundit Stelling has fired a massive warning to Maresca if Chelsea suffer a poor start to the 2025-26 campaign.

In a talkSPORT YouTube video titled ‚ÄòMaresca and Amorim are in BIG DANGER of getting sacked if they have POOR starts, claim Jeff & Gabby!', Stelling said: ‚ÄòYou might not agree with this ‚Äì and sorry Chelsea fans.

‚ÄòClub World Cup winners and spending a fortune, Enzo Maresca needs to deliver. He's now under pressure because there's expectation on him.

‚ÄòThey have four London derbies in their first four games and then Manchester United away, Brighton at home, Liverpool at home and Nottingham Forest away.

‚ÄòIt's a tough, tough start and they've not had much of a break [over the summer].

‚ÄòIf they start poorly, I think people will be saying, ‚ÄòWe expect more than that' ‚Äì because people do expect more of Chelsea now.

‚ÄòAs Club World Cup winners, going out there and doing brilliantly‚Ä¶ Chelsea will be expected to produce in the Premier League and so will Maresca. 

‚ÄòI'm not saying he's going to be sacked after eight games and in actual fact they might have a terrific start.

‚ÄòThey could win them all ‚Äì but if they don't ‚Äì I'm just saying he'd be under pressure.'

Speaking in May, Maresca revelled in Chelsea's Champions League qualification, telling those who have doubted him and his side to ‚Äòf*** off'.

‚ÄòI didn't have any doubts about the players,' the Chelsea head coach said. ‚ÄòThe doubt was from outside. All the ones that have the answer and the truth, they were saying we were too young, we were not good enough.

‚ÄòThey were saying we were not able to win on this pitch because we were too young and not experienced.

‚ÄòUnfortunately for them they are all wrong, all the ones who have the truth and the answer for everything. So in English, I will say ‚Äòeff off' to all of them.'

Demand to attend the 2026 FIFA World Cup throughout North America via hospitality packages has led to what On Location is calling an ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù deposit campaign as details emerge about a variety of high-end options that will be available before the general ticket sales phase begins.

Related Stories

Alicia Falken, On Location's general manager for FIFA World Cup 26, called next summer's tournament ‚Äúone of the largest hospitality events ever‚Äù as FIFA announced its latest set of hospitality offerings recently with options for single matches, the ability to follow a specific team through the Round of 32 and a venue series with a variety of high-end offerings that come in at hefty price tags.

‚ÄúI think we have price points for everybody,‚Äù Falken said. ‚ÄúThere's different levels of hospitality and different products that we offer to create sort of a something-for-everyone kind of menu. Whether you buy a Follow My Team series or suite or are looking for more of a fan-based experience such as our pavilion, I really do think there's something for everybody.‚Äù

On Location recently released several sets of packages including a venue series for one stadium, single-match packages through the Round of 32 and a Follow My Team packages that guarantees tickets and hospitality for a team's group stage and potential Round of 32 game should their team advance past the group stage.

As for the question of what a fan would do if their team advances past the Round of 32, ‚ÄúI'm fairly certain we'll change our bundling structure by the time that the draw happens,‚Äù Falken said. ‚ÄúOnce we understand where the teams are playing, there'll be opportunities and there'll be hospitality available,‚Äù Falken said.

The cheapest group stage hospitality ticket is $1,350 for a game on June 16 in Kansas City while the most expensive is $2,100 for group stage games on June 14 and June 27 in Dallas. Within the Round of 32, the cheapest ticket is $2,025 for a June 29 match in Houston and the most expensive is $2,600 for a July 2 match in Inglewood, California.

Falken said factors that went into the pricing include operating costs, the various destinations and the international demand as well.

‚ÄúWe obviously strive to ensure that experiences are priced fairly and then we have a range of products available,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere's a lot of factors that go into something like that. It would be hard to roll it into one concise answer. There's factors in terms of venues in the local market and the expectations of teams and a lot of different factors that would go into that. Obviously there's varying interests across the different follow my teams packages as well.‚Äù

The cost for most Follow My Team packages are in the range of either $6,750 or $7,200. There are a few countries that stick out ‚Äî none more so than Colombia with a price tag of $13,500, significantly more than any other country. The next three most expensive packages are for Spain, Germany and France. One country whose packages are not available is England. Those packages are not currently available because of high demand during the initial launch in May although options may be available at a later date.

The Follow My Team packages include a FIFA pavilion area with preferred seating, pre- and post-match hospitality service and other amenities including a beverage program, culinary offerings, ‚Äúgourmet street eats,‚Äù entertainment and a commemorative gift.

Pitchside Lounge packages include ‚Äúpremium seats located along the sidelines‚Äù along with a dedicated guest relations area plus exclusive beverage and culinary options. VIP packages include seating ‚Äúoffering an enhanced view of the match in most venues‚Äù while Trophy Lounge package seats are ‚Äúcombining comfort and convenience with excellent views and easy access to amenities.‚Äù The Champions Club is much like the Trophy Lounge in offerings. The FIFA Pavilion has preferred seating options.

The FIFA Pavilion packages for a Venue Series are the cheapest for each stadium and range from $8,275 for Bay Area Stadium to $25,800 for New York/New Jersey. The most expensive of any package is $68,150 for a Pitchside Lounge package at New York/New Jersey stadium, which includes the final.

‚ÄúFIFA has a really well-thought out standard in terms of hospitality,‚Äù Falken said. ‚ÄúThey've been doing this a long time and you've got an existing stadium in this sense, it's different than Qatar when it was all purpose-built stadiums specifically for the World Cup. In this case we're looking at stadiums that are already built, so how does the space fit the product requirements and determine what makes the most sense, (and) the alignment of seating to those hospitality spaces to make sure that we're creating the unparalleled experience that customers are getting what they pay for? The experience that they want is very important.‚Äù

Falken said the packages are also designed so fans have options to either follow a team or just see games at one stadium that they're close to regionally. On Location is also working to try and make each stadium's hospitality as locally relevant as possible.

‚ÄúSomething we're working through right now, and that this is the most fun to me, is creating something that is city-specific, but then also that you feel like you're at a World Cup across the board,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt's also an international event. So how do you mix those international flavors with local flavors ‚Äî there's the food, there's the design, there's gifting. There's the entertainment, there's all these different aspects of that guest experience that you can use to create that look and feel of this space that's uniquely World Cup and unique to that host city but also create a thread across every venue in every space. And that's the neat part.‚Äù

When asked what the revenue targets or goals for the hospitality packages were, Falken said that because On Location is part of TKO Holdings, which is a publicly traded company, ‚ÄúI don't believe I can speak to revenue targets and forward-looking things.‚Äù

The application period for the first general ticket draw for the FIFA World Cup will open on September 10 and fans should visit FIFA.com/tickets to register interest and create a FIFA ID if they have plans to attend.

There will be several ticket sales phases from the start of sales in September. Each phase may differ in purchasing processes, payment methods and ticket products. Dynamic pricing for general ticket sales has also been discussed, according to The Athletic.

Falken said since On Location is the hospitality provider but not the ticketing provider, ‚Äúany questions related to general ticketing need to go to FIFA because we're not supporting the general ticket launch.‚Äù

FIFA this week said those who enter the Visa Presale Draw between September 10 and September 19 can apply for a chance to purchase tickets in the first phase of ticket sales. To participate in the Visa Presale Draw, Visa cardholders must log into their FIFA account using their FIFA ID and complete the application form at any time during the ten-day application period for their chance to purchase tickets.

Following a random selection process, FIFA will notify successful cardholders by email beginning no earlier than September 30. These cardholders will be assigned a date and time slot in October during which they will be able to visit to purchase tickets (subject to availability).

FIFA also took pains to point out this week ‚Äúa match ticket does not guarantee admission to a host country, and fans should visit each host country's government website today for entry requirements.‚Äù

A judge from the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has declined Real Madrid's request to delay their start to the 2025‚Äì26 La Liga season.

Madrid argued they had been denied the ‚Äúminimum period of rest and preparation‚Äù after being booked to start the new season just 41 days after their Club World Cup campaign came to a close, with club officials insisting they were entitled to at least another 24 hours of preparation before their opening fixture against Osasuna, currently scheduled for Aug. 19.

RFEF judge Jos√© Alberto Pel√°ez did not entertain Madrid's pleas and has rejected their request to delay the Osasuna game.

Pel√°ez ruled that the Madrid squad have received the minimum period of 21 uninterrupted days of rest and argued that suggestions of another 21 days needed for physical preparations for the new season are not part of the regulations.

Madrid have 48 hours to lodge an appeal and, according to Mundo Deportivo, they will do exactly that.

The ruling insisted the Madrid squad is big enough to deal with any hectic periods of fixtures and, given the Club World Cup was scheduled well in advance, Los Blancos could have taken more steps to prepare for the new season if they truly felt they were necessary.

‚ÄúI believe that they will have 20 days to rest instead of 21 and no other leagues like the Premier League for Chelsea or the French Ligue 1 for PSG are changing the games,‚Äù La Liga president Javier Tebas said of the controversy earlier this summer.

‚ÄúSo I don't believe that we should change the calendar for that reason, especially thinking that it's a matter of one day.‚Äù

Osasuna have shown far more sympathy. The club's long-serving goalkeeper Sergio Herrera told El Larguero: ‚ÄúThe club and the players were willing to help Real Madrid, and it wasn't a problem to lend a hand to our teammates because there might not be enough time for rest and preparation for the match.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom my point of view, I think it's detrimental to Real Madrid and also to us because we don't have the same recovery time as Valencia for the next match at El Sadar,‚Äù Herrera continued. ‚ÄúAnyone with a bit of common sense would understand that time isn't enough for Real Madrid to reach 100%.‚Äù

The 18-year-old centre-back was one of the revelations of the 2024-25 Serie A season and is expected to join a top team this summer

There is arguably no better place to study the art of defending than Italy, and Giovanni Leoni is already looking like the country's next great centre-back. However, the 18-year-old would be the first to admit that he's also been shaped by English football.

Leoni grew up watching the Premier League on television and, according to his childhood friends, knew the name of every single player in every single team by heart. There was one name, though, that meant more to Leoni than any other: Virgil van Dijk. He idolised the Dutchman - and still does, which is good news for Liverpool, as the Reds are one of several sides interested in signing one of the most promising young players Italy has produced in years...

Top half fourth-round matches feature the two remaining ATP 1000 Canada champions, with No. 1 seed Alexander Zverev (2017) trying to post his first-ever win against Francisco Cerundolo, while the winner from last year, Alexei Popyrin, comes up against Holger Rune. Casper Ruud and Karen Khachanov are meeting for the first time since their 2022 US Open semifinal. Who do you think will reach the last eight at ATP Toronto?

Head-to-head: 1-1

The two friends from their junior days will face each other for the third time on the pro circuit. Alex Michelsen won in Houston on clay, but Learner Tien got their hard-court meeting at the Next Gen Finals. It's tough to predict this as they know each other's games so well, and surprisingly, the opponent might not be possible. Tien can unload Michelsen's power effectively on hard, but the conditions could support the 20-year-old a little bit. Maybe this time, he refrains from going for a frontal attack, which would be for the best for him.
Prediction: Michelsen in 3

Head-to-head: Rune 1-0

Alexei Popyrin is defending the title from last year, but with the yearly Montreal/Toronto switch-up, he has to do it at a different venue. Nonetheless, defeating Daniil Medvedev in the third round was a big result, and Popyrin seems to be stepping up to the challenge. But Holger Rune might be a difficult opponent for him. The Dane isn't consistent, but when he locks in, he's got the all-around set of skills to make his opponent's one-dimensional aggressive play suffer.
Prediction: Rune in 2

Head-to-head: Ruud 2-0

This isn't the part of the season that Casper Ruud is known for, but let's remember he has a couple of deep Canada runs in his resume and a US Open final in 2022. After suffering from a knee injury during the clay season and having to skip the grass, he seems to be pretty hungry to compete this week. It's been a while since he last played Karen Khachanov, but usually, he was able to go after his forehand pretty aggressively in this matchup. His ceiling might just be higher than the Russians', too.
Prediction: Ruud in 3

Head-to-head: Cerundolo 3-0

Alexander Zverev has been struggling against Francisco Cerundolo, but this is the first time they'll be competing on hard courts. The passive game plan of the World No. 3 allowed Cerundolo too much offensive freedom when they played in Madrid (twice) or in Buenos Aires. But here the serve of the Argentinian will pale in comparison to Zverev ‚Äòs and he might be punished for his often sloppy footwork more than on the dirt. If the No. 1 seed loses to Cerundolo again, he'll develop a bit of a mental block.
Prediction: Zverev in 3

After the disappointment at the Wimbledon Championships ‚Äì in which he was defeated by Jannik Sinner in the semifinals without ever giving the feeling of being able to win ‚Äì Novak Djokovic decided to skip the Toronto Masters 1000 (where he has not played since the 2018 edition) and allowed himself a holiday in Croatia and Greece. The former world No. 1 is expected to return to action at the Cincinnati Masters 1000 before the US Open, but there is no firm news on his schedule for the moment.

The Serbian legend is giving his best to win the 25th Major title of his exceptional career, but his body is no longer brilliant until a few years ago and the peremptory rise of Sinner and Alcaraz has made this goal even more complicated for Nole.

The 24-time Grand Slam champion has shown that he can raise his level in the most important tournaments on the calendar and his experience still makes the difference, but it may not be enough to make tennis history once again.

The 38-year-old from Belgrade has repeatedly repeated that he has no intention of retiring and has expressed his desire to continue playing until the Los Angeles Olympics, scheduled for 2028, when he will be 41 years old.

Novak is managing his schedule in the best possible way, with the aim of further extending his career and reaching new heights.

On the latest episode of his famous podcast, American legend Jimmy Connors discussed Nole's choice not to play in Canada: "At this point in his career, Djokovic has to pay close attention to his schedule knowing that he is one of the oldest players on the tour. If he wants to be at the top of his shape in Grand Slam tournaments, he can't make mistakes. His next goal is the US Open and ‚Äì if I had been in his place ‚Äì I would have taken a break after Wimbledon as well."

Djokovic's last triumph in New York dates back to the 2023 edition.

Flavio Cobolli has reached a new milestone, climbing to a career-high 17th in the ATP rankings. Flavio has won two ATP titles this season and backed them with his first Major quarter-final at Wimbledon.

The 23-year-old Italian reflected on his recent progress following the second-round victory in Toronto. In addition, Flavio shared thoughts on facing his idol, Novak Djokovic in two contrasting matches.

The young gun met his idol in Shanghai last year and claimed only three games after staying on the court for just over an hour. Flavio could not find his rhythm and hold nerves.

However, he was ready to challenge his idol at Wimbledon a couple of weeks ago. Embracing his deepest run at Majors, Cobolli challenged Djokovic for over three hours in a 6-7, 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 loss on Centre Court.

More composed and confident, Flavio pushed himself to play freely on one of tennis' grandest stages. The Italian delivered what he described as one of his finest performances despite the defeat.

The young gun struggled behind the second serve and got broken six times. On the other hand, he seized both break points to push the seven-time champion to the limits. 

Despite giving his everything, Flavio admitted it was tough to challenge Novak at Majors. Beyond that memorable duel, the 23-year-old credited his resurgence in 2025 to mental and tactical changes following a tough injury period.

Flavio has been training harder, trusting his father and embracing a renewed mindset. The effort has paid off, pushing him into the top-20 and making him a contender for notable titles in the future.

"Novak has been my idol since I started to play tennis. We played in Shanghai last year, and it was a disaster, as I lost 6-1, 6-2 in 45 minutes. I was nervous during that match, and I had more confidence when we met a few weeks ago at Wimbledon.

I believed in myself and tried to play my game and be happy on the court. It was one of my best matches ever. I did not win, but it's never easy against Novak at Majors.

I'm happy with my Wimbledon run and my results in 2025, especially after it started tight due to my injury. I changed my game and mind, and now I'm thrilled to compete at this stage.

I'm training harder than before and listening to what my coach says, which has led to improvements," Flavio Cobolli said.

Emma Raducanu is a former Grand Slam champion, but she hasn't had an easy ride of things over the last few years.

In 2021, Raducanu shocked the world when she became the first qualifier to win a Grand Slam title at the US Open.

Since then, the Briton has struggled to stay fit on the WTA Tour and has been widely criticized for her frequent coaching changes.

Things seemed to have clicked in 2025; however, as working alongside Mark Petchey, Raducanu has picked up several big wins.

With the US Open less than a month away, Raducanu is on the verge of a major breakthrough, which could put her in contention to win her second Grand Slam title at Flushing Meadows.

Winning her opening two matches in Montreal, Raducanu has risen to 37th in the ‚ÄòLive WTA Rankings'.

Raducanu currently trails world number 32 Dayana Yastremska by 142 points, a gap she could close down with a few more wins in Montreal.

The significance of the 32nd spot in the rankings relates to the seeding at Grand Slam tournaments.

Players ranked 1-32 are given more favorable draws and don't have to play each other until the third round at the earliest.

In 2025, Raducanu has been unseeded at all three Grand Slams and has therefore been drawn against several top players during the early rounds.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Raducanu lost all three matches, suffering defeats against Grand Slam champions at the Australian Open, French Open, and Wimbledon.

It is important to note, however, that Raducanu put up a great fight against world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of Wimbledon earlier in the summer, pushing her close in both sets on Centre Court.

Performing as well as she did, Raducanu proved she can compete with the very best on the WTA Tour.

However, if she were to travel to New York with a seed next to her name, the Brit would find herself in a much better position to make another deep run at a Grand Slam.

She'll no doubt be confident of grabbing herself a seed over the next couple of weeks as she continues to impress on tour.

Over recent years, Raducanu had struggled to string wins together at tournaments, something she hasn't had much trouble doing in 2025.

In the past, fans had become used to seeing Raducanu lose her opening match at a tournament or win one before going home.

Rarely would they see her win multiple matches at an event or make a deep run.

That's changed this year, as Raducanu has won multiple matches at seven of the 16 WTA tournaments she's played.

Having already picked up two wins in Canada, Raducanu will be in search of win number three when she takes on America's Amanda Anisimova for a place in the last 16.

Raducanu won both of their two previous meetings, at this year's Australian Open and Miami Open, but will likely take to the court as a slight underdog against the world number seven and 2025 Wimbledon finalist.

Only time will tell who will emerge victorious in their third career meeting when Raducanu and Anisimova face off in Montreal on Friday, August 1.

Daniil Medvedev has found life on the ATP Tour more challenging over the past 18 months.

The Russian has not claimed a title since 2023 and he has suffered early exits from tournaments on a more regular basis.

As a result, Medvedev has fallen out of the top 10 and he is struggling to produce the level of consistency that helped him win 20 ATP Tour titles, including a Grand Slam title.

Looking at his results since the start of last season, a former ATP player did not hold back on where he believes the 28-year-old's game is at.

2025 has been a season to forget for Daniil Medvedev so far. The world number 14 has suffered 15 defeats this year and he has just one Grand Slam match win to his name across the three majors played so far.

Medvedev's best result was a run to the Berlin Open final, where he lost to Alexander Bublik in straight sets.

There has been very little else for Medvedev to celebrate this season and while he seems to have been surpassed by other players, Frenchman Julien Varlet thinks the 2021 US Open winner has regressed significantly.

‚ÄúMedvedev is stagnating, and it's even close to regressing. He's no longer scary. He's not hurting. And then when you're in doubt, there are two things that help you hold the fort,‚Äù Varlet told Sans Filet.

‚ÄúFirst, your physique. But he's given so much that it's starting to get complicated. And then, above all, there's technique, and that's not where he's best. So as soon as he's in doubt, he automatically plays less well.

‚ÄúEven in 2019, when he had that great part of the season, he didn't play the short game well, he didn't volley very well. And he hasn't progressed. Even though I love him, I think we should forget the Daniil Medvedev era.‚Äù

Medvedev claimed just one win at the Canadian Open before he was beaten by defending champion Alexei Popyrin.

He took a tight first set but the Australian battled back and secured the next two sets to keep his title defence alive.

Medvedev appeared to be so frustrated by his defeat that he left the court at the end of the match without his bag.

This was Popyrin's fourth Top 20 win of the season, and he was disappointed not to win the match in straight sets after holding a 4-2 lead in set one.

‚ÄúI felt like I should have won that first set. I was in the driver's seat, I felt like I was really comfortable out there, and then something happened ‚Äî the same thing that happened earlier this season when I played him [in Rome],‚Äù Popyrin said post-match.

‚ÄúI kind of let go and I started feeling my shots a little bit. When that happens, when you play at a fast pace against him, he starts feeling the ball a little bit more.

‚ÄúI had to revert back to the main tactics that we had, which was more focused on serving, coming into the net and not giving him the same rhythm. I think that worked today.‚Äù

Frances Tiafoe has been a member of the ATP Tour for the last decade.

The 27-year-old has experience competing at all levels of the game and he has established himself as a player consistently in or just outside the top 20.

The American has seen plenty of pulsating matches during his time on tour and he has been involved in some epic battles of his own.

But for Frances Tiafoe, there is one contest that was played at Masters 1000 level, that stands above the rest.

Tiafoe is currently playing at the Canadian Open, which marks the resumption of the Masters 1000 tournaments.

The world number 11 has since conducted an interview with the ATP Tour website with questions all centered around Masters 1000 events.

Tiafoe was asked to name his favourite Masters 1000 match of all time, and he selected a gladiatorial affair between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic from the 2009 Madrid Open.

‚ÄúRafa was down match points, he hit a crazy forehand inside-in to save match point. It was an absolute war. That's one that stands out,‚Äù Tiafoe said.

Nadal lost the first set, before taking a second set tiebreak to send the match into a decider. The third set also went to a tiebreak, and Djokovic found himself within one point of victory on three occasions.

But Nadal stepped up and hit some blistering forehand winners to keep the match alive before clinching the tiebreak to win 3-6, 7-6, 7-6 in four hours and three minutes of compelling action between two warriors.

Madrid hosted Tiafoe's favourite Masters 1000 match, and it is also his favourite city in which to play Masters 1000 tennis tournaments.

His record in the Spanish capital leaves much to be desired, as Tiafoe has won just five of his 11 career matches at the Caja Magica, with his best result coming this season when he reached the fourth round.

Despite his indifferent results in Madrid, Tiafoe very much enjoys what the city as a whole has to offer.

‚ÄúMadrid is fire, I love Madrid. I'm cool with some guys at Real Madrid, I like to hang out with those guys, that's cool. The food is great there, the people are so nice,‚Äù Tiafoe explained.

‚ÄúPartying is fire, nightlife is great. The city itself is cool. I like places where you can walk around: There's a lot of good dining, there's a good energy around. Going to Real Madrid matches is nice.‚Äù

Let's rank the field at the men's 2025 US Open.

In professional tennis, the little number next to your name is everything. It's your seed, your status, your evidence to be taken seriously. ‚ÄúOh my, did you see that the guy with the 22 next to his name beat the guy with the 3 next to his name?! Wow, what an upset!‚Äù And generally, seeding ‚Äî derived from the ATP rankings coming in along with a smattering of subjectivity ‚Äî is a decent way to gauge who can win and who can't. But not always.

For the upcoming US Open, the last major tournament of the year, men's tennis has about 17 people whose names you should probably know, but for the sake of round numbers (and because I think we kind of hit a wall at the Alexander Bublik/Alexei Popyrin turn), I'm going to rank the ATP Top 25* and tell you who I think has a chance of winning the US Open. 

*Disclaimer: to my knowledge, the only Top 25 player who has dropped out due to injury so far is Gregor Dimitrov. That may change in the month before the tournament, so I'll get to my Denis Shapovalov thoughts if the need arises. 

BONUS: 49. Joao Fonseca

Our injury replacement for Dimitrov on this list, Fonseca made back-to-back third rounds at majors and is still 18 years old, so ask anyone around men's tennis who the next thing might be‚Ä¶ they'll point to him. 

25. Alexander Bublik

Fiery player who beat Jack Draper at the French Open but lost in the first round at Wimbledon.

24. Francisco Cerundolo

A player on the up-and-up since 2023, Cerundolo is the paragon of men's tennis' crowded middle class. 

23. Ugo Humbert

Humbert has seemingly been around forever and always is a threat to win a match or two, but I'm not sure how much more than that he is capable of. 

22. Tomas Machac

Our second Czech player in four spots, Machac is a 2024 Olympic gold medalist in mixed doubles. 

21. Arthur Fils

Ranked 21, age 21, and the top player from France, Fils is a really fun watch with some big wins on hard courts ‚Äî he toppled Zverev this year in Miami. 

20. Grigor Dimitrov (out with pectoral injury)

19. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina

 Currently the highest ranked he's ever been, he's the best non-Alcaraz Spaniard on tour and just made the Final of the Citi Open. 

18. Jakub Mensik 

He's 19, 6'5‚Äù and grabbed a big-time win over Djokovic at the 2025 Miami Open, an ATP Masters 1000-level event. 

17. Flavio Cobolli 

ATP Rank: 17

He's six years younger than Khachanov and is currently launching an exploratory committee with being an elite player. We are going to have to wait to see if that committee comes back with a better verdict than ‚Äútake a set off Djokovic in the Wimbledon quarterfinals,‚Äù but I'm down for anything.

16. Karen Khachanov

ATP Rank: 16

Khachanov is the ATP's recent house-money player. Nobody ever expects him to win anything, but he occasionally puts together a nasty run and reminds everybody that they aren't safe with their rankings. He's a fun player, but I don't see him actually winning anything anytime soon.

15. Casper Ruud

ATP Rank: 13

Slightly better, Ruud has won two matches at majors this year but pulled out of Wimbledon due to injury. There was a good 20 minutes when it seemed like Ruud could be the next thing, but now I don't know what to think; I haven't had a lot of reason to believe in the future of Norwegian tennis recently. 

14. Daniil Medvedev

ATP Rank: 14

What a fall off for Medvedev, who's had the year from hell in majors ‚Äî he's one one match in three Grand Slams, and that is just insane for the former World Number 1. This is the guy that beat Djokovic in the 2021 US Open Final when he was going for the calendar Grand Slam, and he's just been unable to hack it this year. I don't know what happened, but there's no way it can stay this bad.

13. Tommy Paul 

ATP Rank: 15

Paul has been playing his best tennis in the last two years, but I still lack evidence that his best tennis is enough to even reach a major final, let alone win one. If you're looking for an American hopeful, you have three better options. 

12. Holger Rune

ATP Rank: 9

Rune is a player I don't really understand. He has the tools of an elite player of his generation, but has been woefully unsuccessful in five sets. If anything, he's a bit like a less-successful Jack Draper. Or maybe that's just because of their backwards hats. 

11. Andrey Rublev

ATP Rank: 11

Oh, you guys thought De Minaur was a social experiment in quartefinal failure? Well, let me introduce Rublev, who's 0-10 all time in major quarterfinals. That's just cruel and unusual, so Rublev has some demons to deal with before he can be taken seriously as a contender. 

10. Frances Tiafoe

ATP Rank: 12

Tiafoe was my main American hope for a while after he pushed Carlos Alcaraz to five sets in the 2022 US Open semifinal, but he hasn't been nearly as consistent as Fritz or Shelton lately. He plays with tons of fire and possibly digs deeper than anyone else on tour when his back is against the wall, but his game hasn't evolved with the rest of men's tennis. He still relies on a topspin-heavy forehand that trades raw speed for spin rate, and doesn't have the velocity to overpower lesser opponents like others around his level.

9. Alex De Minaur

ATP Rank: 8

De Minaur's career is like a social experiment of how many quarterfinals you can make without ever getting to a semifinal. It's honestly sad, and he's nursing an 0-5 record in the last eight despite playing excellent tennis for years now. Another player with a consistent game that just hasn't proven anything at the highest level, De Minaur probably needs a favorable draw to break the drought. That or an exorcism. 

8. Lorenzo Mussetti

ATP Rank: 10

The hallmark of this group are players I think can be better than they are‚Ä¶ but they have to prove it to me. Mussetti is a player I legit like, with one of those ‚ÄúI'm not sure this will work but I'm going to try it anyway‚Äù shot diets that make Sinner and Alcaraz so special. Mussetti has a game that looks almost comically like Roger Federer, with the headband and one-handed backhand to boot. But he has real power, and I believe him him as a potential riser on tour. 

7. Taylor Fritz

ATP Rank: 4

I am not Fritz's biggest fan. I've long been skeptical of his ability to beat top players in five-set matches, generally just farming the players he's supposed to beat and folding once his opponent has a better hand. But beating everyone you're supposed to beat is a bit of an underrated skill, which allowed Fritz to get to the US Open Final last year on the back of an insanely light draw. Sure, he got railroaded by Sinner in the final, but all he needed was one more lucky break and he could have been a major champion. It's a really shaky theory, but sometimes it's better to be lucky than good. Actually, most of the time.

6. Jack Draper

ATP Rank: 5

Draper had an extraordinarily disappointing Wimbledon, ceding the British spotlight to Cameron Norrie after coming in as the overwhelming hometown favorite. Draper does, however, have absurd burst on his serve and plays a consistent, all-court style that is conducive to success in five-set matches. And he's only 23, so I wouldn't rule him out.

5. Ben Shelton

ATP Rank: 7

I'm going out on a limb here, but I think Shelton will soon be a regular member of the ATP Top 5. He's better than both Jack Draper and Taylor Fritz mechanically, and plays a style that can and will propel him past elite challengers. He's had a really nice year, and has lots of time to grow into his final form. The only question is: will it be good enough?

4. Alexander Zverev

ATP Rank: 3

Zverev has had an up-and-down year, and really an up-and-down career as far as Grand Slams go. He's basically glorified cannon fodder for whoever happens to be at the top level of men's tennis, be it Djokovic and Nadal or Sinner and Alcaraz ‚Äî always doing well on tour but unable to break his personal glass ceiling. He's gotten unlucky in spots, and has a really modern game with pretty special mobility for his size. He could definitely win a major if he somehow dodges the top two on his path to the final, but that's not a good bet. It's much more likely Zverev himself gets upset.

3. Novak Djokovic 

ATP Rank: 6

This is where the rankings diverge from methodology, as Djokovic is ranked below three much-younger players but still, in my view, has a better chance in five-set matches. Djokovic got annihilated by Sinner in the Wimbledon Semifinal, and it looks more and more like the GOAT doesn't have a prayer against men's tennis' new royalty. But I'd still probably pick him against any of the other 62 players in the tournament, a testament to how much his game has endured his older age. However, I don't know how much longer I will be giving the Serbian the benefit of the doubt, so he better savor it.

Tier 1: Those Two

2. Carlos Alcaraz

ATP Rank: 2

I mean, do I have to explain this tier to anyone anymore? It looks like these will be the Top 2 seeds at every Slam and meet in the final every time‚Ä¶ presumably until the heat death of the universe. Sinner is so ridiculously good on hard court, so Alcaraz is second. But like‚Ä¶ would I even be one percent surprised if he won the thing? Not at all. 

1. Jannik Sinner

ATP Rank: 1

I have no rational reason to predict Carlos Alcaraz will beat Sinner on hard court. The Italian is turning into some sort of Rafael-Nadal-on-clay-except-its-on-hard-court level favorite, having taken the last three Grand Slams on the surface. And I had no rational reason to predict he would beat Alcaraz on grass at Wimbledon either, and then Sinner did it anyway. And he's thoroughly played himself into shape after his suspension, so by some combination of gut feel and irrefutable evidence, Sinner is the clear favorite. Had he not choked away the French Open final after having three match points, he would be going for the Calendar Grand Slam right now ‚Äî or winning all four majors in a single year. That hasn't been done since Rod Laver in 1969.

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner made major changes to his support staff in recent weeks, including the surprise dismissal of his coach Marco Panichi and physiotherapist Ulises Badio just before Wimbledon. Despite the change, the Italian star went on to win the prestigious All England Club title, defeating World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz in the final. Sinner has now reunited with his former fitness coach, Umberto Ferrara.

At the time of the split, Sinner stated there was ‚Äúno major reason‚Äù behind parting ways with Panichi and Badio. However, Italian outlet Corriere della Sera has now reported that Sinner had grown increasingly uncomfortable with certain decisions made by Panichi, both on and off the court.

One of the trigger points was reportedly Panichi's decision to leak confidential team information to the media. This included details of Sinner's emotional reaction after losing to Alcaraz at Roland Garros, where he failed to convert three championship points. Panichi had told the press that Sinner cried for 15 minutes in the locker room and was upset at how fans seemed to favour Alcaraz over him.

Panichi and Badio, both of whom previously worked with Novak Djokovic, came under scrutiny after their dismissal. Panichi, in particular, was seen as a divisive figure in Sinner's camp, with reports suggesting he frequently defied team rules that restricted public statements without prior clearance.

Sinner, a four-time Grand Slam champion, initially downplayed speculation about the departures. ‚ÄúNothing big happened. It's not affecting me. I feel ready to compete. I feel free. We reached incredible results in the past with them. We did great work, but I decided to try something different. Nothing crazy happened,‚Äù he said during Wimbledon.

However, Sinner later admitted that a breakdown in trust led to the overhaul. ‚ÄúCommunication is important for the group to function. You have to trust. We spend a lot of time together throughout the year, and it's important to find the right people,‚Äù he explained.

The 23-year-old has since brought back Umberto Ferrara, who had left the team last year following an investigation into Sinner's two failed doping tests. It was ultimately revealed that the positive results were due to accidental contamination. Sinner's former physio, Giacomo Naldi, had used a spray containing traces of the banned substance clostebol to treat a cut on his finger. He later massaged Sinner without gloves. The spray had been procured by Ferrara.

The Spaniard vented on social media after being assigned the tournament's earliest match time‚Äîcomplaints that fellow player Dan Evans branded as "pathetic."ByStephanie LivaudaisPublished Aug 01, 2025 copy_link

Late-night matches and early morning finishes are a frequent gripe on the pro tennis circuit‚Äîbut Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has a different complaint: being scheduled too early.The world No. 19, who finished runner-up in Washington, D.C. just days ago, is fuming after being given an 11:00 a.m. match time at the National Bank Open in Toronto. The Spaniard, who traveled with fellow finalist Alex de Minaur to Toronto via private jet, had a smooth second-round win over Corentin Moutet on Wednesday and was set for a Friday showdown with No. 12 seed Jakub Mensik.But unlike most matches in Toronto, which start at 12:30 p.m., Davidovich Fokina's third-round clash is set for an earlier 11:00 a.m. start on the Motorola Razr Grandstand Court‚Äîthe only stadium at the tournament with a morning schedule.Read More: Leylah Fernandez criticizes schedule after losing in Montreal in quick return after D.C. title

That discrepancy didn't sit well with him, and the 25-year-old took to X, formerly Twitter, to air his frustration in a bilingual open letter to the ATP Tour:‚ÄúToday I want to share my disappointment and frustration with the ATP,‚Äù he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ‚ÄúTomorrow, every match starts at 12:30, except ours, which has been scheduled at 11:00. We're staying one hour away from the club, which means we have to wake up extremely early to arrive in good condition.‚ÄúWe've asked for a change, but the answer was that everything has already been sold, tickets, TV rights, etc. Once again, it's clear that players are not taken into consideration.‚Äù

In both Toronto and Montreal, the second stadium court begins play at 11:00 a.m., while all others start at 12:30 p.m. This continues through the early rounds until the round of 16, when the start times are aligned.Start times are determined by tournament organizers, and vary from tournament to tournament. At the Miami Open, where Mensik lifted the trophy in March, early-round matches started at 12:00 p.m. In Davidovich Fokina's native Spain at the Madrid Open, all early round matches started at 11:00 a.m.The ATP Rulebook says: ‚ÄúEach tournament shall provide ATP, at least one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the start of the tournament, a typed schedule that includes proposed daily starting times and number of courts to be used.‚Äù This schedule is then approved in writing by the ATP. (I. ATP Circuit Regulations, Section 1.03)

While 11:00 a.m. is routine start time at many tour events, players tend to dislike how the timing coincides with rising heat and humidity, making for grueling playing conditions. Davidovich Fokina wasn't alone in facing the dreaded morning slot‚Äîearlier in the week, No. 6 seed Andrey Rublev and No. 11 Karen Khachanov also drew 11:00 a.m. starts. Over in Montreal, WTA stars Sofia Kenin and Madison Keys were in similar positions.‚ÄúToday it happened to others, tomorrow it's me, and from the day after, all matches return to 12:30,‚Äù Davidovich Fokina wrote. ‚ÄúThere are plenty of available courts, yet we're the only ones playing at 11:00.‚ÄùHe concluded with a direct swipe at the tour: ‚ÄúThe ATP always promises they'll fix things, but nothing ever changes. This isn't the first time it happens, and when you're inside, you realize it's not as great as it looks from the outside.‚ÄùReaction to Davidovich Fokina's post was split. While many social media users applauded him for calling out tournament conditions, others found his comments tone-deaf: ‚ÄúWait, now we don't want to play early too?‚Äù one person wrote. ‚ÄúWish I had this kind of privilege,‚Äù said another.

In the locker room, not everyone was sympathetic either. Great Britain's Dan Evans offered a blunt rebuttal on Instagram: ‚ÄúWake up and play. The world wakes up (and) works 9-5 and even 8-6. Pathetic.‚ÄùDavidovich Fokina isn't the only player raising schedule concerns in Canada.

Coco Gauff admits her serve is "on a crutch" after latest Canadian Open victory; top seed Alexander Zverev records 500th career win in men's event;  watch the US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24

Coco Gauff survived another erratic serving performance to reach the last 16 of the Canadian Open with victory over Veronika Kudermetova.

The world No 2 sent down 14 double-faults to add to the 23 she served up in the previous round against Danielle Collins, but a fightback from a set and a break down saw her progress 4-6 7-5 6-2 in Montreal.

Next up is a meeting with the last remaining home hope in the women's event, 18-year-old Victoria Mboko.

"It does give positives that I am winning these matches having literally one part of my game on a crutch," said Gauff, who came to Canada without a win since her triumph at the French Open.

"If I can stand on both feet, then I can only imagine that it will be a lot more straightforward and a lot easier for me."

Teenage wild card Mboko hit 32 winners on her way to a 1-6 6-3 6-0 win over Marie Bouzkova of the Czech Republic, while fourth seed Mirra Andreeva was beaten by American McCartney Kessler.

Emma Navarro was another high-profile casualty, the eighth seed losing to Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine.

In the men's event in Toronto, top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from losing the opening set against Matteo Arnaldo to record the 500th ATP Tour win of his career.

Zverev, who is just the third German man to achieve the feat after Boris Becker and Tommy Haas, won 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 6-2 to set up a last-16 meeting with Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina.

"I think I started playing better from the baseline. The longer the match went on, I started to find my rhythm a bit," Zverev said.

"It was actually my backhand that was feeling a bit off in the beginning, which is strange. Doesn't happen very often. But after I found that shot, I was comfortable and I was happy about the level."

Third seed Lorenzo Musetti of Italy is out, beaten in three sets by American Alex Michelsen, while defending champion Alexei Popyrin of Australia came through a late-night epic against Russia's Daniil Medvedev, winning 5-7 6-4 6-4.

Fifth seed Holger Rune awaits in the last 16.

The two have played twice. Both matches were this year, on hard courts at the Australian Open and Miami. Somewhat surprisingly, at least to me, Raducanu won in straight sets both times.I would have thought this matchup would favor Anisimova's superior baseline power, and that Raducanu's ground strokes would feed into Anisimova's. In reality, Raducanu has been the more proactive player of the two in both of their meetings, attacking Anisimova's second serves and using her speed to successfully counterpunch in rallies.I wondered how Anisimova would look after her double-bagel loss at Wimbledon, but she seemed fine in her Montreal opener. I also wondered if Raducanu would have a letdown after a hot week in D.C., but she looked good, too. Maybe the difference in this one will be motivation. No. 7 can't lose to No. 33 three times in one season, can she? Winner: Anisimova

Alexander Zverev overcame a spirited effort from Matteo Arnaldi on Thursday at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers, where the top seed battled to 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-2 victory to claim his 500th tour-level match win.

"It's a great achievement. There's not a lot of players that reached that milestone," Zverev said post-match. "Of course I still want 500 more hopefully to come, and maybe even more! When you start your career, you wish to play on Tour, you wish to have a successful career, win as many matches as possible. I think 500 is definitely a milestone, and I'm happy about that."

The 28-year-old, now 37-14 on the season, is the first man born in 1990 or later to record 500 tour-level wins. A seven-time ATP Masters 1000 champion, the German next faces a familiar rival in Argentine Francisco Cerundolo, who holds a perfect 3-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Zverev, with two of those wins coming this season (Buenos Aires, Madrid). Cerundolo, seeded 14th, ousted countryman Tomas Martin Etcheverry 6-3, 6-4.

Competing this fortnight for the first time since Wimbledon, Zverev was not at his best in his third-round victory, gifting Arnaldi a pair of set points in the opener ‚Äî first with a routine backhand volley miss, then with a double fault at 4/5 in the tie-break. The 32nd seed seized his moment behind his own delivery, unloading a Serve +1 forehand to gain a one-set advantage.

The 2017 champion played into form as the match wore on, rarely allowing the Italian any looks on return. Across sets two and three, Zverev dropped just four points behind his first serve, according to the Infosys ATP Stats, to advance after two hours and 46 minutes. Zverev also made a noticeable effort to move forward throughout the night, converting 19 of 26 net points."I think I started playing better from the baseline. The longer the match went on, I started to find my rhythm a bit," Zverev said. "It was actually my backhand that was feeling a bit off in the beginning, which is strange. Doesn't happen very often. But after I found that shot, I was comfortable and I was happy about the level."

Alexander Zverev hit a big milestone in Toronto on Thursday night, recording the 500th win of his career with a 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-2 victory over Matteo Arnaldi in the third round of the Masters 1000 event."It's a great achievement," Zverev said. "I think there's not a lot of players that have reached that milestone. For me that's great to reach it. I still want 500 more, maybe, to come, maybe even more!"When you start your career, you wish to play on tour, you wish to kind of have a successful career, win as many matches as possible‚ÄîI think 500 is definitely a milestone, and I'm happy about that."And with that, he joins some very exclusive lists.First of all, he's just the fifth active men's tennis player to record 500 or more career wins, joining Novak Djokovic (1,150), Marin Cilic (593), Gael Monfils (583) and Stan Wawrinka (580).Secondly, he's just the third German man in the Open Era to hit that number, after Boris Becker (713) and Tommy Haas (569).And most importantly, Zverev, who was born in 1997, is the first man born in 1990 or later‚Äîor even 1989 or later‚Äîto achieve the feat.Until Zverev did it in Toronto on Thursday night, the most recently-born man to achieve the feat was Cilic, who was born in 1988.

Zverev came out swinging against Arnaldi in the first set, not only breaking en route to a 4-2 lead, but also holding two more break points in that game that would've given him a 5-2 lead.Arnaldi would hold, get the break back and eventually sneak out the marathon first set after 81 minutes on court.From there it was all Zverev, though, as he jumped out to a 3-0 lead en route to taking the second set, then won five games in a row from 1-2 to run away with the third. He closed it out after two hours and 46 minutes when one last Arnaldi backhand clipped the net.Awaiting the No. 1-seeded German in the fourth round will be No. 14-seeded Francisco Cerundolo, a 6-3, 6-4 winner against fellow Argentine Tomas Martin Etcheverry earlier in the day.Cerundolo has beaten Zverev all three times they've played previously, though all three of those meetings did come on clay.

Nick Kyrgios suggests he came to terms long ago that he wasn't going to be your regular tennis player and that's when he fully embraced his personality and started doing stuff like swearing in front of the Royal Family during a Wimbledon final.

If you can recall, the Australian tennis player - who turned 30 in April - had a couple of big controversies early in his career - like when he insulted Stan Wawrinka on a personal level during the 2015 Montreal Masters. And it didn't take long before he was labeled "a brat" and "a tennis villain."

While Kyrgios got more serious about his tennis career at one point, his personality stayed the same and he was never afraid to express himself on the court. During 2022 Wimbledon - the year when he made his first and lone Grand Slam final - the Australian took on Novak Djokovic in the title match. 

Traditionally, the Royal Family attends the Wimbledon final. That year, a nine-year-old Prince George made his first visit to The Championships. And Prince George found himself in one viral moment after the cameras caught one of his reactions to Kyrgios' colorful language.

"When I played in front of the Royal Box at Wimbledon, I was throwing F-bombs. It's been a struggle to kind of fit in, but now I kind of embrace it. I'm not going to change for anyone. I've been criticized in my career for not putting enough time on the court, and I've missed tournaments and training because I've just been gaming, purely because I love it," the 30-year-old said at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.

Sadly for Kyrgios, he hasn't played at Wimbledon since due to knee and wrist injuries.

'All my laps have been decent' - Norris fastest in both practice sessions

Kimi Antonelli and team mate George Russell enjoyed a positive Friday with Mercedes ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Kimi Antonelli has claimed he is "getting the confidence back" with his Mercedes car after a positive Friday for the team ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend.

The Italian rookie has endured a difficult spell recently in his maiden Formula 1 campaign, which has included just one points finish in the last seven races and he failed to make it beyond the first segment of Qualifying for both the Sprint and Grand Prix last time out in Belgium.

Mercedes has reverted to an older specification of suspension for the race in Budapest, with the change seemingly producing an upturn in form for Antonelli as he claimed seventh ahead of team mate George Russell in FP1, before finishing 10th fastest later in the afternoon.

"Today was nice. I'm pretty happy because I'm getting the confidence back with the car," said the 18-year-old.

"Still missing a little bit to the guys in front but I think we're working well, we've been changing the car a lot because obviously it felt like a big step with the old suspension.

"The car was completely different and we're just trying to rebalance the car. Long run was good in FP2, just the soft I had a bit of traffic last sector and the lap was not super clean but good feelings ahead of tomorrow."

Russell claimed seventh in the second session and was also pleased with the step that the Silver Arrows had made after struggling in Belgium.

But the Briton claimed that they still lacked pace compared with the leading teams on the grid and that more work was needed ahead of Sunday's 70-lap race.

"It always feels good when you're a bit higher up the leaderboard," said the 27-year-old, who has taken one win this season in Canada.

"Bit of a strange day, obviously the Aston Martins looked unusually fast today, they seemed to make a decent step forward. McLaren are obviously in a league of their own.

"We just need to find that last little bit for it to start clicking again for us. Today it wasn't a breakthrough but it wasn't like we were expecting it to be a breakthrough. We've just to keep on chipping away."

'All my laps have been decent' - Norris fastest in both practice sessions

Yuki Tsunoda's future at Red Bull is far from assured, but the Japanese racer's performance in Spa offered some encouraging signs.

"I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong to be honest. I have to look harder. It's really, really hard to find the reason for what I'm doing so wrong to drive this slow."

That was Yuki Tsunoda after he finished last in the Austrian Grand Prix earlier this month. Up until that point, the Japanese racer had shown flashes of pace, like his P6 in the Miami Sprint, but his best finish for Red Bull in a Grand Prix  since stepping in for Liam Lawson from Suzuka onwards is P9.

In that same period, his team mate and reigning world champion Max Verstappen had secured two wins and two second places.

FP2 Highlights: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

Colapinto: 'We struggled with the balance, with the grip' around Hungaroring

Arriving into this weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix with a 16-point lead over team mate Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri is feeling confident in himself when it comes to the championship fight.

Oscar Piastri has admitted that he has ‚Äúa lot of confidence‚Äù in himself when it comes to his chances of winning the World Championship, though the Australian also suggested ‚Äúit's not going to be easy‚Äù amid close competition from team mate Lando Norris.

After Norris closed the gap by taking back-to-back victories in Austria and Great Britain, Piastri strengthened his lead in the standings by winning the Belgian Grand Prix last time out, meaning that he now holds a 16-point advantage over his fellow McLaren driver.

Asked ahead of this weekend's race in Hungary if he views the title fight as being just between himself and Norris by this point, Piastri responded: ‚ÄúI suppose so. The last few weekends it's been Lando and I.

‚ÄúI expect our competition to still be strong and put up a good fight, especially at certain tracks through the rest of the year, but whether that comes from Max [Verstappen] or Ferrari or Mercedes or someone else, we never really know.

‚ÄúI'm not too concerned about what happens in that, I'm just trying to win each race and extend the lead. I think clearly Lando and I are in the same car, which is the best, and he's naturally going to be the most competition.‚Äù

Piastri was then pushed on whether he feels confident enough that he will win the championship, to which the eight-time race winner answered: ‚ÄúI think I have a lot of confidence in myself that I can do it.

‚ÄúNot every weekend has been perfect, but there's not many weekends in my whole life that have been perfect. I think just trying to put together a solid, consistent year is ultimately going to be an important thing.

‚ÄúI think the pace in the last few weekends, especially Spa, I've been very confident in and I'm very proud of, and I think I'm more than capable of continuing that for the rest of the year. I'm confident that I can do it, but it's not going to be easy.‚Äù

In terms of whether being the fastest or making the fewest mistakes will count more in the title battle, Piastri conceded that ‚Äúboth ideally‚Äù are needed.

‚ÄúYou can make an argument for either one ‚Äì you can be consistent, but if you're consistently coming second then that's not very useful for you, so you do need to have both,‚Äù he explained.

‚ÄúAt the level of the field and the level of my team mate, you need to bring your best, and evidently when you're pushing that hard there are going to be mistakes here and there, because it doesn't come without that risk.

‚ÄúBut you can't just afford to take things easy ‚Äì you've got to try and be consistent, you need to push and you need to be quick, and then of course you try and execute as best as you can. You need both to win the championship ‚Äì you can't just rely on one.‚Äù

This weekend sees Piastri return to the scene of his first Grand Prix victory 12 months ago, a race that saw him lead home a McLaren 1-2 after Norris belatedly handed back the lead following a change in positions during the pit stop phase.

Asked if he expects the 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix to once again be a fight between himself and Norris, Piastri reflected: ‚ÄúI don't know. Hungary has been historically a good track for us as a team in the two years that I've been with the team, so I expect us to be strong again this weekend.

‚ÄúBut there's been tracks this year where we thought we would be very strong against our competition and they were closer than we thought, and there's been other tracks where we thought our competition would be very close and actually the gap was bigger than we thought.

‚ÄúYou never know, but I expect us to still be at the front.‚Äù

And while last year's event may have been a slightly tricky moment for the squad in terms of executing that team order, Piastri believes that it also showed the positive dynamic within McLaren, as well as between himself and Norris.

‚ÄúIt underlined the good nature in the team,‚Äù said Piastri. ‚ÄúIt was obviously a slightly awkward situation, but I think it kind of highlighted that we will do the right thing in all circumstances, or ideally all circumstances when we're on track.

‚ÄúI think it just showed the trust that we have with the team and with each other as well, that things will be put the right way.‚Äù

'All my laps have been decent' - Norris fastest in both practice sessions

Aston Martin reserve driver Felipe Drugovich will take Fernando Alonso's place for the opening session at the Hungaroring.

Aston Martin have announced that Fernando Alonso is to sit out Friday's opening practice session for the Hungarian Grand Prix due to a muscular injury in his back.

Alonso was present at the Hungaroring for Thursday's media duties and pre-event preparations, some 22 years on from his maiden F1 victory around the Budapest venue.

However, with the first on-track session approaching, a statement from Aston Martin confirmed the Spaniard would play no part in FP1 due to a lingering injury.

Aston Martin's test and reserve driver, former F2 champion Felipe Drugovich, has been called up to take Alonso's spot for first practice, with further updates on the plan for the remainder of the weekend to follow.

‚ÄúIn the days following the Belgian Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso has been managing a muscular injury in his back,‚Äù read the team's note.

‚ÄúAs he continues with treatment this morning, he has chosen to sit out of FP1. Felipe Drugovich will drive in FP1 alongside Lance Stroll.

‚ÄúA decision will then be made on Fernando's participation in FP2 and the remainder of the weekend in due course.‚Äù

In a later update issued between practice sessions, Aston Martin confirmed that Alonso would return to action for FP2.

It must be those Santa Ana winds‚Ä¶

Just as early 2000s films ‚ÄúFreaky Friday,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Devil Wears Prada,‚Äù ‚ÄúBend It Like Beckham,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Princess Diaries‚Äù are receiving franchise sequels, Nancy Meyers' beloved ‚ÄúThe Holiday‚Äù is getting the TV treatment.

Yes, the 2006 film ‚ÄúThe Holiday‚Äù is being reimagined by ‚ÄúCatastrophe‚Äù co-creator Rob Delaney and ‚ÄúSweetpea‚Äù writer/co-executive producer Krissie Ducker for Apple TV+. The duo previously worked together on ‚ÄúCatastrophe,‚Äù as Ducker was a writers' assistant on the series.

Deadline first reported the project, and cited that ‚ÄúThe Holiday‚Äù writer/director/producer Meyers ‚Äúhas no involvement‚Äù in the revival limited series. The show will also center on different characters than the film did, with a casting search underway.

‚ÄúThe Holiday‚Äù originally centered on Los Angeles-based movie marketing executive Amanda (Cameron Diaz), who swaps homes with Iris (Kate Winslet), a London newspaper columnist. Both women ease their heartbreak with new men on opposite sides of the world: Amanda finds love with Iris' brother (Jude Law) while Iris connects with a film composer (Jack Black). The film takes place in December, making it a de facto Christmas movie. As Deadline cited, the series will ‚Äúreboot the premise of the film with new characters.‚Äù

 










‚ÄúThe Holiday‚Äù was rumored for a sequel in 2022. The Sun falsely reported from an unnamed source that production would be starting in early 2023 with the original cast. However, Meyers shut down the claim at the time. ‚ÄúSo many DM's about this,‚Äù Meyers captioned on Instagram. ‚ÄúSorry but it's not true.‚Äù

Actress Winslet's representative further confirmed to IndieWire that no plans for a ‚ÄúThe Holiday‚Äù sequel were in the works at the time. Winslet told People magazine of the rumored film, ‚ÄúI read something about that, but it's the first I've heard of it. I promise you, not an agent or a representative or anyone from the first one around has had any conversation with me about that. Hand on heart, that's never come up.‚Äù

Her co-star Law later shared how ‚ÄúThe Holiday‚Äù is one of his most enduring films. ‚ÄúThey asked the audience who has seen ‚ÄòThe Holiday' or who watches it every year,‚Äù Law said during a career tribute at the 2024 Mill Valley Film Festival. ‚ÄúNinety percent of the audience put their hand up. It's a delightful thing what this movie has become.‚Äù

EXCLUSIVE: The big-eared, noise-sensitive aliens are invading Earth again with John Krasinski announcing A Quiet Place Part III, which is scheduled to hit theaters on July 9, 2027.


	The fourt-time Primetime Emmy-nominated multi-hyphenate just revealed the news on social media that he's back to direct, write and produce the fourth film in the Paramount series. No cast is confirmed at this time, with the story being kept secret.


	Krasinski and Allyson Seeger's Sunday Night Productions are producing with Platinum Dunes. Sunday Night has a first-look deal with the studio.


	The A Quiet Place franchise has grossed over $900 million worldwide across its three films, which is comprised of John Krasinski's A Quiet Place and A Quiet Place Part II, and the Michael Sarnoski-directed spinoff A Quiet Place: Day One.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The first A Quiet Place took off like a rocketship at SXSW in 2018, leading to an overindexing $50.2 million opening weekend, and a near $153M domestic and $341M global take. The pic, which starred Krasinski, wife Emily Blunt, Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds, received an Oscar nomination for Sound Editing.


A Quiet Place Part II, which saw its release pushed due to Covid, brought the box office back alive during Memorial Day weekend 2021 with a $57M four-day start, ending with a $160M domestic and $297.3M global haul. Blunt, Jupe and Simmonds returned for the sequel, which nabbed a BAFTA nomination for Best Sound.


	Last summer, A Quiet Place: Day One, a prequel set in an apocalyptic New York City ravaged by the aliens and starring Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn, debuted to $52.2M and legged out to $139M domestic and $262M global.

EXCLUSIVE: Nancy Meyers' beloved movie The Holiday is getting a TV treatment. Apple TV+ has in the works a limited series adaptation of the 2006 romantic comedy, which starred Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black, sources tell Deadline. It reboots the premise of the film with new characters.


	Krissie Ducker (Sweetpea) is writer/executive producer for The Holiday series, produced by Left Bank Pictures, with Rob Delaney (Catastrophe) also brought on as a writer. Meyers has no involvement in the project, I hear. 


	The limited series keeps the setup of the movie about a single American and single British woman living very different lives who swap their houses for the holidays and find love in the process.

	Search is underway for well-known actresses to play the leads, with the first offers sent out on both sides of the Atlantic. If/when stars are locked in, the limited series, which comes from Apple TV+'s UK team, is expected to get a green light.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The 2006 movie, written, directed and produced by Meyers, revolved around Amanda (Diaz), a Los Angeles movie trailer company owner, and Iris, a London newspaper columnist who exchange their houses on a whim after each suffers a heartbreak. Amanda meets Iris' widower brother (Law) while Iris meets an associate of Amanda's, a film composer (Black). 


	Released during the 2006 holiday season, The Holiday was a box-office success and, almost two decades later, it remains a Christmas staple (despite Meyers never intending for it to be a Christmas movie). 

	











	Actor-writer Delaney co-created and starred with Sharon Horgan on the acclaimed Channel 4 comedy series Catastrophe. This marks his return to Apple TV+ where he starred in Season 1 of Bad Monkey. He was most recently seen in the FX limited series Dying For Sex and the movie Deadpool & Wolverine. 


	Ducker, who worked as a writers assistant on Catastrophe, has served as writer/co-executive producer on Sweetpea and writer/executive producer on The Assassin.

‚ÄúMeyers has no involvement in the project‚Äù And I'm out.

It's no wonder Hollywood is dying a slow death. Everything is a remake, a reboot, a sequel or a prequel these days. Get some original ideas already!

I'm sure it's gonna be as big of a hit as was that limited series Four Weddings and a Funeral sksks Just give people a proper sequel starring og four. That's what audiences want.

The recently signed tax cut and budget bill took back $1.1 billion in previously approved funds.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which directs federal funds to local public TV and radio stations, says it will shut down after having those federal dollars taken away.


	The decision comes a few weeks after Congress passed a bill that included Trump administration priorities of tax cuts, cuts to Medicaid, increased spending for defense and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, among many other things. The bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4, also included the rescission of $1.1 billion in previously approved funding for CPB.

	The CPB said on Friday that it will lay off the majority of its staff by the end of its fiscal year on Sept. 30, with a ‚Äúsmall transition team‚Äù remaining through January 2026 to finish winding down operations and ensuring final distribution of CPB funds to local stations.


	‚ÄúDespite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,‚Äù CPB president and CEO Patricia Harrison said in a statement. ‚ÄúCPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care.


	‚ÄúPublic media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country. We are deeply grateful to our partners across the system for their resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication to serving the American people.‚Äù

	











	Money from the CPB has provided partial funding to PBS TV stations and National Public Radio outlets, though the majority of most stations' budgets come from donations and corporate grants. It is the largest single source of funding for research, technology and program development for public radio and TV stations. CPB also funds documentary filmmakers through ITVS.


	‚ÄúThese cuts will significantly impact all of our stations, but will be especially devastating to smaller stations and those serving large rural areas,‚Äù PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger said in July. ‚ÄúMany of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead.‚Äù

	The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is shutting down its operations after the loss of federal funding, marking the end of almost six decades as the entity that distributed grants to public media, PBS and NPR.


	The CPB informed employees on Friday that the majority of staff positions will end on Sept. 30, with a small transition team in place through January, 2026. The CPB has around 100 employees.


Patricia Harrison, the president and CEO of CPB, said in a statement on Friday, ‚ÄúDespite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations. CPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care.‚Äù

	The announcement follows the GOP's move to rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding already allocated to the CPB for the next two fiscal years. This week, Senate Republicans advanced a funding bill that also included no money for public media, dashing hopes that there would be at least some restoration of funding.




			Watch on Deadline		







	President Donald Trump had called on lawmakers to roll back funding for CPB, calling the programming of PBS and NPR biased, part of his broader attacks on traditional media.


	The CPB has noted that the majority of its funding, about 70%, goes to local stations, not the national outlets. Advocates also have pointed to polling showing high levels of public trust in public media.

	











	Harrison said in her statement, ‚ÄúPublic media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country. We are deeply grateful to our partners across the system for their resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication to serving the American people.‚Äù


	Members of the CPB board of directors, including Sony's Tom Rothman, have recently stepped down. In the spring, Trump sought to remove board members Rothman, Laura Ross and Diane Kaplan. The CPB sued to block the move, but that litigation now appears moot with the corporation ending its operations.


	Congress created the CPB in 1967 as a private non-profit to shepherd federal money to stations and other public media outlets. The idea was to shield the entity from political interference. With an advanced appropriations cycle, the CPB also helped give stations certainty in their budgets. With the loss of federal funding, stations are now scrambling to make up for the loss of funds, and advocates have warned that some are at risk of closure. According to an analysis from advisory firm Public Media Company, about 100 TV and radio stations in rural areas are threatened, per The New York Times.


	CPB has survived past funding battles, including during Trump's first term. His White House sought to zero out funding in their proposed budgets, but a bipartisan group of lawmakers blocked any such effort.


	This time around, the claw back of funding was part of a package of $9 billion in rescissions that also included support for foreign aid and health care. Trump threatened to withhold support for any lawmaker who voted against the clawback of funding. Only a handful of Republicans voted against the rescissions package, while even some past strident supporters of public media, like Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK) and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) voted to end the funding.

	The vice president appeared on Friday's episode of the Ruthless podcast ‚Äî a new discussion program hosted by Republican staffers ‚Äî and was asked about the uproar over the Euphoria star's sultry ad, which makes a play on words comparing the sex symbol's ‚Äúgenes‚Äù with the word ‚Äújeans.‚Äù The ad has been slammed by some online as a Nazi-like pro-eugenics racist propaganda, while others have cheered the company and actress for refusing to apologize in the wake of social media outrage, which many view as a bad-faith take on something that's meant to be playful.

					Doja Cat Mocks Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle Ad Amid "Genes" Versus "Jeans" Controversy		
			









	‚ÄúMy political advice to the Democrats is continue to tell everybody who thinks Sydney Sweeney is attractive is a Nazi,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat appears to be their actual strategy. I mean, it actually reveals something pretty interesting about the Dems though, which is that you have a normal all-American beautiful girl doing like a normal jeans ad. They're trying to sell jeans to kids in America and they have managed to so unhinge themselves over this thing. And it's like, you guys, did you learn nothing from the November 2024 election?‚Äù 


	Concluded Vance: ‚ÄúI actually thought that one of the lessons they might take is ‚Äòwe're going to be less crazy.' And the lesson they have apparently taken is we're going to attack people as Nazis for thinking Sydney Sweeney is beautiful. Great strategy, guys! That's how you're going to win the midterm! Especially [with] young American men. So much of the Democrats is oriented around hostility to basic American life. So you have a pretty girl doing a jeans ad and they can't help but freak out. It reveals a lot more about them than it does us.‚Äù 

	











	While Vance's comments were targeted towards Democratic leaders who want to win the midterm elections, CNN noted in its coverage, ‚ÄúNo prominent Democratic Party leaders or officials have commented on the ad.‚Äù So it seem like Vance is taking generic progressive online uproar and trying to attach it to elected officials who haven't actually said such things.   


	Earlier this week, The Late Show host Stephen Colbert also weighed in on the ad, with comments that suggested people protesting the ad might have overstepped a bit. 


	‚ÄúI don't want to alarm you, but the internet is mad about something,‚Äù Colbert said. ‚ÄúThis time, it's a commercial from American Eagle Outfitters starring Sydney Sweeney ‚Ä¶ Just like Sydney Sweeney, I also carry the gene for sexy commercial scratchy voice. I get it from my uncle on my mother's side ‚Ä¶ Now, some people look at this and they're seeing something sinister, saying that the genes-jeans denim wordplay in an ad featuring a white blond woman means American Eagle could be promoting eugenics, white supremacy and Nazi propaganda. That might be a bit of an overreaction ‚Äî although Hitler did briefly model for Mein Kampfort Fit Jeans.‚Äù Colbert added: ‚ÄúHow do you say ‚Äòbadonk' in German?‚Äù


	Neither American Eagle nor Sweeney have commented on the backlash.

JD Vance is a big fan of Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle campaign. At this point, we've likely all seen it‚Äîas well as the wave of backlash it received almost immediately after it was released. In one ad, Sweeney zips up a pair of jeans and, in a tone that's meant to be seductive but seems a bit more like she's getting over a cold, says, ‚ÄúGenes are passed down from parents to offspring‚Ä¶ My jeans are blue.‚Äù In another, she stands in front of a billboard that reads, ‚ÄúSydney Sweeney has great genes,‚Äù but the word ‚Äúgenes‚Äù is crossed out and replaced with ‚Äújeans.‚Äù

Some people on the internet were not happy with the campaign. Or, in Vance's words on a recent episode of the right-leaning Ruthless podcast (via Variety), ‚ÄúMy political advice to the Democrats is continue to tell everybody who thinks Sydney Sweeney is attractive is a Nazi‚Ä¶ That appears to be their actual strategy.‚Äù The thing is, the people Vance are mocking don't hold any governmental power at all. According to CNN, ‚Äúno prominent Democratic Party leaders or officials have commented on the ad,‚Äù at least as of this writing.

Non-elected critics of the campaign have claimed that there are eugenicist undertones to the ad's focus on Sweeney's genes. People have also decried its apparent male-focused marketing and characterized it as a white supremecist dog whistle that holds up Sweeney's white skin and blonde hair as a beauty ideal. This view is, unsurprisingly, a little too socially conscious for Vance, who couldn't help but use it as an example of Democrats' ‚Äúhostility to basic American life.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI actually thought that one of the lessons [Democrats] might take is we're going to be less crazy. And the lesson they have apparently taken is we're going to attack people as Nazis for thinking Sydney Sweeney is beautiful,‚Äù the vice president continued. ‚ÄúGreat strategy, guys. That's how you're going to win the midterm, especially young American men.‚Äù

While he, again, isn't a Democratic party leader, Stephen Colbert did touch on the controversy a bit in a monologue earlier this week. While he said the backlash ‚Äúmight be a bit of an overreaction,‚Äù he mostly used the segment to poke fun at Donald Trump Jr., who responded to the controversy by posting an AI picture of his dad in the same outfit as Sweeney on Instagram, along with the caption, ‚ÄúUm, Donald is so hot right now!!!‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me get this straight, Don Jr.. You look at Sydney Sweeney, and your first thought is, ‚ÄòShe's hot like my dad'?‚Äù Colbert riffed. Now that's something we can keep talking about.

EXCLUSIVE: Michael Pe√±a (End of Watch) has been tapped for a role alongside Chris Hemsworth and Lily James in Subversion, the new submarine-themed action film from Amazon MGM Studios, Deadline has learned.


	Details about Pe√±a's role are being kept at the bottom of the ocean. The film follows a once-promising naval commander (Hemsworth) who is blackmailed by a cartel-like organization into piloting a dangerous submarine carrying illegal cargo across international waters. Thrust into a high-stakes game of cat and mouse, with a Coast Guard officer (James) in hot pursuit, he must outmaneuver blockades and navigate perilous threats both inside and outside the submarine.

	











	Patrick Vollrath (7500) is directing the film from a script by Andrew Ferguson. Lorenzo di Bonaventura is producing, with executive producers Stephen Shafer and Greg Cohen for di Bonaventura Pictures.

	Pe√±a next will be seen opposite Sarah Snook in the series All Her Fault, an adaptation of the novel by Andrea Mara that premieres on Peacock later this year. Known for roles in A Million Miles Away, End of Watch, American Hustle and The Martian, he'll also soon be seen starring opposite Sam Rockwell in Gore Verbinski's action-adventure flick Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die. Pe√±a is represented by CAA, Entertainment 360 and Goodman Genow Schenkman.

	And just like that, And Just Like That‚Ä¶ is coming to an end on HBO Max.


	The show will wrap up its expanded 12-episode third season, which is currently airing, with a two-part finale. Showrunner Michael Patrick King notified cast of the decision Thursday, per our sources.


	‚ÄúAnd just like that‚Ä¶ the ongoing storytelling of the Sex and the City universe is coming to an end,‚Äù said King in a statement released Friday morning. ‚ÄúWhile I was writing the last episode of And Just Like That‚Ä¶ season 3, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop. Along with Sarah Jessica Parker, Casey Bloys and Sarah Aubrey, we decided to end the popular series this year with a two-part finale and extended the original series order from 10 episodes to 12. SJP and I held off announcing the news until now because we didn't want the word ‚Äòfinal' to overshadow the fun of watching the season. It's with great gratitude we thank all the viewers who have let these characters into their homes and their hearts over these many years.‚ÄùPremiering in December 2021, And Just Like That‚Ä¶ is a sequel to the iconic HBO series Sex and the City created by Darren Star. It reunited gal pals Carrie Bradshaw (Parker), Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon), and Charlotte York (Kristin Davis) for a series of midlife romantic adventures in New York City.

			Watch on Deadline		







	The show's first season saw protagonist Carrie navigating life after the sudden death of her husband, Mr. Big (Chris Noth), while Miranda dealt with an identity crisis, including a relationship with non-binary comedian Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez), and Charlotte embraced motherhood. In Season 2, premiering in 2023, Carrie rekindled her romance with former fianc√© Aidan (John Corbett), Miranda deepened her connection with Che, and Charlotte faced challenges with family. This season, meanwhile, Carrie moves on from Aidan as Miranda explores new relationships and Charlotte continues to juggle motherhood and career.


	While And Just Like That‚Ä¶ started strong in terms of new HBO Max signups as well as ratings, with a premiere ranking among the top 10 in HBO Max's history, viewership has waned over time. The Season 3 premiere was watched by 429,000 households, per Samba TV, down from 463,000 in Season 2.

	











	The series also has generated a lot of media attention ‚Äî both positive and negative ‚Äî over its run. In the end, the decision to end the series is believed to have been largely creative after fans already had gotten their update on Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte and storytelling no longer felt as urgent as it once did.

And Just Like That‚Ä¶ was developed by King, who exec produced alongside John Melfi, Parker, Davis, Nixon, Julie Rottenberg and Elisa Zuritsky. The original HBO series adapted the book of the same name by Candace Bushnell.


	Others in the cast of the sequel series' final season include Mehcad Brooks, Jonathan Cake, Logan Marshall-Green, Sebastian Pigazzi, Dolly Wells, Sarita Choudhury, Nicole Ari Parker, David Eigenberg, Evan Handler, Christopher Jackson, Niall Cunningham, Cathy Ang and Alexa Swinton.

Id like to argue with you and have been watching the run but oof‚Ä¶it probably really is a good time for them to just stop

And just like that‚Ä¶ nobody watched.

This is a wonderful place to stop. An even better place would have been right before the first episode.

Can she wake up in the finale and be like ‚Äúit was all a dream‚Ä¶‚Äù

Sorry to see the show go but HBO Max did it justice

Okay, Mandy Moore just gave us all the family vibes with a new beach photo that's equal parts adorable and chill. She's rocking a swimsuit alongside her husband Taylor Goldsmith and their three kids (August ‚ÄúGus,‚Äù 4, Oscar ‚ÄúOzzie,‚Äù 2, and Louise, 10 months) looking like the ultimate squad goals. It seems like the kind of family snapshot that's totally real; no fuss, just good times and sun-soaked memories.

A post shared by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm)

The whole gang is clearly having a blast if the photo slideshow above is anything to go by. But what about Mandy's caption? Well, it gives a shoutout to her friend Gaby, making it clear this trip wasn't just about beach days but hanging with some of her closest pals too. She also calls out the Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita, saying ‚ÄúWhat an epic few days‚Ä¶ we can't wait to come back.‚Äù And apparently, little Gus hasn't stopped talking about the trip, so you know it was epic.

It seems like Mandy and Taylor are nailing that tricky balance of parenting three kids while still making time to relax and have fun. Honestly, it's the kind of family vibe that's equal parts chaotic and heartwarming; and we're here for it.

Back in 2024, after the birth of their third child Mandy even told Today, she was ‚ÄúEndlessly grateful for our family of 5 (and our very own big three) and soaking in every moment of this special time.‚Äù

What makes these photos stand out isn't just the sunshine or the happiness; it's how real it feels. Mandy's family pictures always have this easygoing, no-frills energy that's a nice break from the usual polished celeb shots. It seems like she's really owning the ups and downs of family life, and honestly, it's refreshing to see someone so famous just enjoying the everyday moments with their kids.

‚ÄúBeing a mom is the single greatest gift of my life and while you're never off the clock worrying or stressing or planning, the quiet, unmistakable joy triumphs over everything else,‚Äù the actress told People earlier this year.

‚ÄúI'm endlessly grateful to the moms in my life who model what it takes, lend an ear, make the best suggestions, and generally make me feel less alone on the journey,‚Äù she explained.

And if this pic has you wishing you were at the beach too, we feel you too. Because sometimes, all you really need is good company, sandy toes, and a little sunshine.

The 21-year-old K-pop star, formerly known as Seunghan, speaks with THR about his highly anticipated solo debut following his exit from Riize: "I hope everyone can look at me from a fresh perspective."

	‚ÄúI'm very excited,‚Äù K-pop star XngHan tells The Hollywood Reporter about his solo debut. ‚ÄúMy heart swoons.‚Äù


	The 21-year-old, officially making his solo debut today with his artist project XngHan and Xoul, is equal parts excited and optimistic on a Zoom call from his label SM Entertainment's Seoul headquarters as he speaks of his new chapter as a soloist. 




	XngHan's debut has been highly anticipated by much of the K-pop community. Late last year, it was announced that the K-pop star, who previously went by his name Seunghan, would be leaving the boy group Riize, just days after the news of his return from a lengthy hiatus. When it was later announced that he'd be debuting as a soloist, XngHan received genuine well wishes from fans across various K-pop fandoms ‚Äì somewhat of a rarity in online music spaces these days.

	XngHan's first single, ‚ÄúWaste No Time,‚Äù is a pitch-perfect choice for his debut track. As the singer puts it, the ‚Äúrefreshing‚Äù summer song talks of not wasting any time and spreading his ‚Äúboundless wings‚Äù ‚Äì perhaps a perfect parallel to XngHan himself, who seems eager to tackle this new chapter head-on. The single is accompanied by a B-Side, ‚ÄúHeavenly Blue,‚Äù is similarly catchy and the perfect soundtrack for a sunny summer day. XngHan contributed to writing lyrics and choreographing for the song.

	Below, the XngHan speaks with THR about ‚ÄúWaste No Time‚Äù and ‚ÄúHeavenly Blue,‚Äù his exit from Riize and what his hopes for the future.


I think there are a lot of people who are eager to hear how you're doing these days. How are you feeling ahead of your debut?


	I made sure that I worked out. I've been practicing my dance skills and also my vocals, so that I can keep everything rolling and going. My solo debut is just around the corner, so I'm very excited. My heart swoons.


You seem very happy. To talk about your future, I think we need to talk a bit about the past. How are you feeling, looking back on what I assume has been an at times difficult year? How do you feel looking ahead?


	I used that time to look back on myself. I think it was a time given to me for more self-improvement, so I was really using that time to make sure that I got better at stuff. I think it was a time where I was trying to get ready for a new start, so I think all the things I learned along the way are definitely going to be something that I can use going forward as a fuel, so I'm very excited and looking forward to my debut as a soloist.


I think there are a lot of people who are really excited to see you debut and have been waiting for it since your time with Riize. Although you're no longer with Riize, you worked and trained alongside them. Do you have any wishes for them? But also what hopes do you have for yourself as a soloist?












	I know that Riize is doing so well, and] I'm rooting for them as a fellow artist. I hope they stay healthy and well. [Since] I'm also preparing my new launch as a soloist, I hope people stay tuned [for my debut]. I'm really going to pour my heart and soul into this.


Why was it so important for you to change your stage name? Do you see this as opening a new chapter for you?


	Yeah, it's exactly as you said. I think it's a new chapter for me, a new challenge for me, and I'm very much looking forward to it. The reason why I wanted to include the letter X is because it symbolizes infinite potentials, [an] infinity of possibilities. It's also the unknown variable when it comes to mathematical formulas. I think it symbolizes that I am now opening up the doors to all the different potentials and possibilities that I could dig into. I wanted to use this letter X to show that. I think with this new artist brand, I can show you different facets of myself.


How has your training been? What do you feel like you've been focusing on in terms of practicing for your debut ‚ÄúWaste No Time‚Äù the most?


	I guess the focus in training for this single was that it had to be fun. It's a very vibing kind of song, so I wanted to give it that refreshing mood and vibe. Especially since it's a summer song. Actually, the good thing was that it wasn't very challenging to get ready for these songs. It was actually a very fun experience for me, especially since I got to work together with Xoul, the dance crew comprised of two people. It was really fun. It was almost like we were just playing around, but we were making something and creating something. I felt very much at ease preparing for the songs.

	











Can you tell me about your collaboration with Xoul? Do you find yourself feeling a little more comfortable working alongside them, given you've previously worked in a group setting?


	Yeah, it's definitely a lot more comfortable [especially] because our interests align. These are two professional dancers, so all three of us are bonded by our love and passion for dance. We would be working [on choreography], but we'd also be having a lot of fun dancing. It just made me feel so comfortable and at home working together with them.


How did this concept that you would have a dance crew with you come about? Why did you feel it made the most sense for you right now?


	I thought long and hard about with whom I should collaborate, and I think my top priority was to bring to the table something new, something refreshing, something people haven't seen before. I myself love trying new things and that's how we got to brainstorming ideas. Then I thought my forte is definitely performance, so why don't I start from there and gather a group of professional dancers, and that's how I gathered my first batch of Xoul.


How do you envision this looking like for you going forward in the future?


	One of the ideas that I have in mind‚Ä¶ I've always had this dream of creating a band, so that could be one idea. But right now I'm going to really focus on the Xoul dancers. We're just going to nail the performances.


	I have a lot of time ahead of me, and I think I have a lot of potential, a lot of possibilities. I'm going to open it up to all the different things that I could do.

	











Do you feel you've had any big changes in the way you work? Did you realize any new strengths during your debut preparation?


	When I was working on this debut, there's the B-side track called ‚ÄúHeavenly Blue,‚Äù and I contributed to writing the lyrics for the song. I also created the choreography together with Xoul. It was my first time trying to pen the words of my own song, and I realized that I'm actually pretty good at it. I think I do have a little bit of a forte in writing [lyrics].


I think for any soloist, it's a bit daunting, having to figure out who you'll be as a singer. What was that process like for you?


	I'd like to be a soloist who appears the same on and off stage. I changed the S in my name to an X, but it's actually not that different sonically because it's still Seunghan. I want to be a soloist who can really be his true self on stage and show his true colors and essence. That's what I'm trying to go for.


‚ÄúWaste No Time‚Äù is so much fun and a great debut single. Why did you feel like it was the right fit?


	The genre of the track is electronic dance, which incorporates a wide range of sounds. That's something I liked about the song, and it was in line with the kind of concept that I wanted to go with. When I thought about performance, I thought this was a song that could really mesh well with the performance that I can show on stage. When I heard the demo of the song, I knew right away that this was the right one. From the very beginning, I really wanted this song to be my debut track.

	











Can you tell me a bit about working on choreography for this project and what that experience was like?


	To be honest, it was quite challenging in the beginning because it was my first time and [Xoul's] first time collaborating. We all had our own style, so it was very hard to come to a consensus in the beginning. But I realized that I was the one who had to lead the debate, so I orchestrated [the process] between us three, and they were very happy to give me a lot of ideas. I was happy to share my ideas, even the very bizarre ones. We had a lot of fun sharing and tossing around ideas and coming up with the choreography.


To look ahead ‚Äì you're at a new starting line, which can be nerve-wrecking but at the same time, very exciting. What are you hoping the future looks like for you as a soloist? What are your aspirations for the year ahead?


	Maybe it's a little early to say this, but my ultimate dream and goal is to drop an album where I creatively contributed in all the different aspects of all the tracks, including the choreography and writing the lyrics and the composition of the songs. That's my ultimate dream. [Also] to have that album drop and perform it live and receive the love and support of the fans. That's my dream.


As an artist, people's perception of you is often out of your control, but you're a human being and an artist. You've put a great deal of work into this debut and likely have an idea of how you want people to feel. How are you hoping to be viewed as an artist?












	I just hope that when fans watch my performance and see me performing live, they get so excited and happy. They can't help but dance. That's what I want the fans to view me as. When I'm on stage, I want to be remembered as an artist who just lights the stage on fire and nails every performance.


Speaking of fans, do you have a message to the fans who have been eagerly awaiting your debut and supporting you from afar for a while now?


	Thank you for the long wait. Because the wait was so long, I created music that was worth the wait. I hope you stay tuned and really enjoy the music. I'm really going to pour my heart and soul into the promotion for this album. I hope you love the music and love me too.


I'd like to give you the chance to close a chapter for yourself. Is there anything you'd like to add about your exit from Riize and about your debut?


	[My solo debut is] a new beginning for me, so I hope everyone can look at me from a fresh perspective. I'm going to try my hardest to burn the soloist XngHan into your brain. I'm going to work hard to do that.

	President Donald Trump's administration keeps denying that the Department of Veteran Affairs is headed toward privatization ‚Äî just like it couldn't stop denying that mass layoffs of 80,000 employees wouldn't impact veteran care. But facts have a way of catching up. 


	After intense pressure from veterans' groups and Congress, the administration was forced to walk back its plan ‚Äî cutting 30,000 jobs instead. Already, though, the VA has lost thousands of health care staff since January ‚Äî including 688 physicians and 1,882 registered nurses ‚Äî while still claiming its services remain unaffected.


	The budget numbers don't lie ‚Äî even if Trump and Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins do. 


	This year, the Trump administration requested a record-breaking $441 billion VA budget for fiscal year 2026. That's a 10 percent increase over last year and, in theory, should be good news for veterans and the people who care for them.

	Yet, buried in the fine print is a deeply concerning contradiction: Even with the budget expansion, the VA plans to eliminate nearly 3,000 jobs, including over 2,000 from the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), which handles disability claims, education benefits, and more.

	











	In other words, the VA is spending more money ‚Äî just not on the people who keep the system running. Some are forced to work out of closets due to untenable working environments, while others are being overworked or incentivized to find work elsewhere. 

	











	While the administration claims it's focused on ‚Äúeliminating waste‚Äù and ‚Äúempowering local leaders,‚Äù in reality, it is hollowing out the VA's internal capacity. VA staff are being stretched thin, even as more veterans enter the system. 


	Instead of hiring more nurses, claims processors, or crisis responders, the administration is pushing billions of dollars into the private sector via expanded community care programs. This seems less like reform, and more like privatization by attrition.

	In the House of Representatives, where the Veterans Affairs Committee advanced the Veterans' ACCESS Act, the path toward privatizing veterans' health care becomes clearer. Framed as a way to reduce wait times and empower veterans through online self-scheduling, the bill would expand veterans' ability to seek care outside the VA system. 


	No one denies that veterans deserve choices in their health care. But choice without access to quality, specialized care isn't really a choice at all. Long-term cuts to Medicaid ‚Äî totaling more than $1 trillion ‚Äî will inevitably force the closure of many rural hospitals that veterans depend on. And with a hollowed-out or dismantled VA system, these veterans will be left sicker, poorer, and without access to the care they've earned.


	The VA's own internal analysis, the ‚ÄúRed Team‚Äù report from May 2024, has been removed from the VA.gov website. It warned that rising costs of private-sector care ‚Äî $30 billion in FY2023 alone ‚Äî are threatening to ‚Äúmaterially erode the VA's direct-care system.‚Äù This erosion isn't hypothetical. It's happening. Staffing shortages are so severe that 82 percent of VA facilities report critical nurse vacancies ‚Äî and now even more jobs are being cut.

	Rather than fix the staffing crisis, the Trump administration is shifting resources away from VA hospitals and clinics and into for-profit care. For example, funding for in-house VA medical services is being cut by 17.4 percent, even as the Community Care budget jumps 50.7 percent. What message does that send?


Combined with cuts to food assistance that many veterans rely on, reductions in federal agency staffing where one in three employees is a veteran, cuts to housing programs that prevent veteran homelessness, and deep cuts to Medicaid ‚Äî on which over a million veterans depend ‚Äî it has never been more clear: Trump and the GOP hate taking care of the veterans.

	The final single from the diamond-certified 1985 album is bundled in a three-song digital drop featuring a bouncy official remix and a nearly six-minute ‚Äú12‚Äù Formal Mix‚Äù that includes an funky, extended bass-slapping, bell-ringing midsection of the song produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, who also plays iconic chicken scratch guitar on the track. The final version is a four-and-a-half minute ‚ÄúCasual Instrumental Mix‚Äù that strips away the vocals to focus on the song's insistent, hypnotic melody.

Isla Fisher is stepping into a new chapter with a mix of raw honesty and optimism. Moving forward after a long marriage is never easy, but Fisher is embracing the challenge with optimism. The actress is opening up about life after her split from Sacha Baron Cohen.

In her Harper's Bazaar Australia August cover story, the ‚ÄúNow You See Me: Now You Don't‚Äù actress revealed she's been navigating a period of transition following her divorce from actor Sacha Baron Cohen.

‚ÄúI'm really excited for the next chapter,‚Äù Fisher, 49, told the magazine. ‚ÄúI'm refocusing on my career because previously I was very much focused on my kids, which I still am, obviously, because [they're] my true love. But I'm enjoying tackling work again.‚Äù

Fisher candidly shared that she's had ‚Äúa tough couple of years‚Äù but is finding strength in rediscovery. ‚ÄúOne of the benefits of a challenging situation is the luxury of asking myself, ‚ÄòWhat would I like to do professionally and privately?'‚Äù she explained. 

‚ÄúI'm trying to remind myself of my new identity as somebody outside of a partnership and to stay as buoyant as possible.‚Äù

Fisher and Cohen were together for more than two decades, having first met at a party in Sydney in 2001. They got engaged in 2004, married in 2010, and announced their divorce in 2023 after 13 years of marriage. The couple finalized the split in June and continues to co-parent their three children.

In a joint statement posted to Instagram Stories, the former couple wrote: ‚ÄúWe are proud of all we've achieved together and, continuing our great respect for each other, we remain friends and committed to co-parenting our wonderful children.‚Äù

Despite their separation, Fisher & Cohen have publicly supported each other. Fisher wished Cohen a Happy Father's Day on Instagram, calling him ‚Äúthe best father our children could hope for.‚Äù Meanwhile, Cohen left encouraging comments on her Valentine's Day and Harper's cover shoot posts, calling them ‚Äústunning‚Äù and ‚Äúgreat.‚Äù

On the work front, Fisher is keeping busy with several film projects. The exciting lineup includes the upcoming comedy ‚ÄúSpa Weekend‚Äù and the highly anticipated sequel ‚ÄúNow You See Me: Now You Don't‚Äù, set to hit theaters on November 14, 2025.

Anthony Hopkins poked fun and gave a playful stamp of approval of Kim Kardashian's latest SKIMS product ‚Äî the Seamless Sculpt Face Wrap. In a now-viral Instagram video posted July 31, he channeled his iconic ‚ÄúSilence of the Lambs‚Äù character, Hannibal Lecter, wearing the wrap in the ‚Äúclay‚Äù shade. The 87-year-old actor mimicked Lecter's chilling voice and mannerisms and cheekily quipped that the product made him feel ‚Äú10 years younger.‚Äù In his caption, he wrote, ‚ÄúThank you, Kim. Don't be afraid to come over for dinner @kimkardashian @skims‚Äù

Fans were quick to catch the reference ‚Äî and eat it up. ‚ÄúAre you having Kim for dinner???‚Äù one Instagram user joked, while another added, ‚ÄúThis is the best publicity you could get @kimkardashian! lol. You have to reply. This is so epic!‚Äù A third fan wrote, ‚ÄúTHIS is why the internet was invented. Amazing Sir Anthony!‚Äù

A post shared by Anthony Hopkins (@anthonyhopkins)

The viral moment didn't go unnoticed by Kim Kardashian herself. Just hours after Anthony Hopkins shared the video, the SKIMS founder reposted it to her Instagram Story, adding the caption: ‚ÄúI'M SCREAMING!!!!!‚Äù

Her repost ‚Äî which tagged both Hopkins and the official SKIMS account ‚Äî added even more buzz to the already viral video.

SKIMS' new face wrap immediately drew comparisons to Lecter's tan muzzle from the film. And whether intentional or not, the resemblance helped launch the product into meme-worthy territory.

Kim Kardashian's SKIMS officially stepped into new territory with the July 29 launch of its Seamless Sculpt Face Wrap ‚Äî the brand's first-ever facial product. According to SKIMS' Instagram, the wrap is ‚Äúmade with signature sculpting fabric and infused with collagen yarns for ultra-soft overnight jaw support.‚Äù

The $48 accessory is designed to contour the jawline while you sleep, using velcro closures at the crown and nape to secure it in place. It comes in two shades, Clay and Cocoa. Despite mixed reactions online, the product sold out shortly after its release. Fans can sign up for restock updates via the SKIMS website.

Online responses ranged from curiosity to confusion. Some users asked whether the wrap helped with posture or face lifting, while others poked fun. The launch follows a series of SKIMS products that have sparked similar conversations, including hip-enhancing padded shorts and the ‚ÄúUltimate Butt Enhancing‚Äù line.

A post shared by SKIMS (@skims)

While Anthony Hopkins helped bring some lighthearted flair to the launch, not everyone is convinced by the Seamless Sculpt Face Wrap's promised benefits. The product, which is described by SKIMS as ‚Äúa must-have addition to your nightly routine,‚Äù has also drawn comparisons to a scene in ‚ÄúDeath Becomes Her‚Äù, where Meryl Streep's character uses a similar beauty accessory in her quest for eternal youth, according to reports.

Experts, however, have expressed skepticism. Facial plastic surgeon Dr. Joel Kopelman told Yahoo Life that there's ‚Äúno scientific evidence to support significant or lasting benefits,‚Äù and any improvements seen from wearing a chin strap overnight are likely temporary. Reconstructive surgeon Dr. Michael Bassiri-Tehrani added that such compression is mostly useful post-surgery, not for everyday use.

Despite the debate, SKIMS continues to spark conversation and sell out with each drop. And with Hopkins' cheeky cameo making headlines, the brand's venture into face shapewear is already shaping up to be one of its most buzzed-about moments yet.

In a new interview with Vulture, Bill Burr is extremely resistant to being defined on the political spectrum (he makes the case that both right and left are bad, classically citing the supposed ‚Äúovercorrection after #MeToo‚Äù as an issue on the left). And yet he talks a lot about politics and the current state of affairs, roasting conservative commentator Ben Shapiro for complaining that Burr is ‚Äúwoke‚Äù now. ‚ÄúHe doesn't even know what that word means,‚Äù Burr says, observing that Shapiro only came to see his stand-up ‚Äúto be annoyed so he can then have something to talk about and then he can make money off dividing his own country. Those people, it's treasonous what they do.‚Äù

He says, ‚ÄúThere's an ugliness out there right now where if you're a racist, if you're an antisemite, if you're a psycho nationalist and you want a softball interview, there's podcasts out there where you can get one, and they will laugh at your fucking bad jokes and give you this pass. There's a really ugly thing going on out there, and we've already seen what it does to a nation, and it's not the way to go.‚Äù

Ôªø

Burr says his comedy lately is focused less on the politicians and more on the ‚Äúpuppeteers,‚Äù the people who pay our politicians: ‚ÄúAnd they're always distracting us with other stuff. CNN and Fox News are a fucking disease.‚Äù But the comedy podcast scene has almost surpassed those traditional outlets as the foremost political commentary apparatus in the United States. Personally, Burr wouldn't interview a president on his podcast (‚Äúnot with my intellect‚Äù) and suggests that there are a lot of dumb people out there acting as if they're smart by presenting information that they don't truly understand: ‚ÄúIt's not just reading a bunch of smart shit, putting it in your head, and then puking it out at people. That's not smart. You're torturing people.‚Äù But entertainers getting involved in politics was ‚Äúhappening before‚Äù the podcast boom, he notes. ‚ÄúI remember the first time I saw a president go on The Tonight Show. I thought it was cheapening the office. They never did that. They used to run for office, they would have the debates, and they wouldn't even go on Meet the Press. But I just feel like now that everybody has a camera, it's just so all over the place. I just think the landscape of it has changed.‚Äù

Though Bill Burr is equal opportunity with making fun of all sides of the spectrum, he prefers to be left out of it himself‚Äîyet he feels ‚Äúdeliberately misunderstood‚Äù by folks trying to make him a champion of the right or a hero of the left. ‚ÄúWhat I'm finding is that people keep trying to categorize what you're doing. Like that idiot Ben Shapiro: ‚ÄòHe's woke now!' That fucking guy,‚Äù he complains. ‚ÄúHe was trying to bring me into his fold. At one point, the guy liked me and then, all of a sudden, I'm a fucking asshole. I'm supposed to look at that guy like he's an adult?‚Äù You can read the full interview here.

This is probably anecdotal, but it feels like our collective TV diet is due for a good, HBO-grade true-crime docuseries right about now. Which, as eloquently intimated by an interviewee in The Yogurt Shop Murders (a new four-parter from that aforementioned network and A24 that very much fits that bill), is a pretty gross and callous thought to even have. ‚ÄúThese murders‚Ä¶continue to devastate, puzzle, and fascinate many,‚Äù Sonora Thomas, the sister of one of the victims chronicled in the doc, reads from her own writings for the camera. ‚ÄúAs a surviving sibling, I have alternated between disgust for the ongoing fascination and awe that the public continues to be horrified by an event that has shaped every aspect of my life.‚Äù

There is a guilt that comes‚Äîor at least should come‚Äîwith wanting to watch these sorts of tragedies unfold and be picked apart over several hours, with casually clicking to the next episode from a couch as if the unthinkable stories that ruined the lives of real people are some sort of entertainment. That the segment above ends with news footage of a young Sonora in 1991, just after the murders, ‚Äúhyperventilating while my grief-stricken mother talks to the reporter,‚Äù as she puts it years later, underlines this idea and, perhaps, even hints at some of the guilt director Margaret Brown (2022's Descendant) herself had with this project, not to mention the thorny issues that come with documenting such horrors in general. 

On a December evening in 1991, four teenage girls‚ÄîAmy Ayers (13), Eliza Thomas, Jennifer Harbison (both 17), and the latter's sister Sarah (15)‚Äîwere bound by their underwear and shot in the backs of their heads at strip-mall frozen-yogurt shop where two of them worked before the spot was set aflame. The case shocked the community and became a national story, with Thomas noting, ‚ÄúThese murderers were said to have shattered the innocence of the small city of Austin,‚Äù a sentiment echoed almost verbatim by the actual mayor of that city in a news conference when suspects were apprehended nearly a decade after the killings occurred. (Highlighting that small-town-ness, the opening credits are set to a cover of ‚ÄúDevil Town,‚Äù which was also used to great, albeit very different, effect in the Austin-shot show Friday Night Lights.) 48 Hours on CBS did (at least) four episodes on the case and its many twists and turns. And from the get-go of this new docuseries, you get the sense that the relatives of the deceased have had to relive that one night over and over and in front of countless cameras. 

Which they have: A decent amount of the footage in The Yogurt Shop Murders is from an unfinished documentary that local filmmaker Claire Huie started shooting in the 2000s. (Huie is a voice throughout, with her at one point embarrassingly showing a clip of her, gracelessly and without a soft transition, asking Barbara Ayres-Wilson, the mother of Jennifer and Sarah‚Äîand another steady presence and one of the empathetic beating hearts of the doc‚Äîto talk about that night in 1991.) This narrative framing and seeing, say, John Jones, the first lead investigator assigned to the case, on the evening of the murders in front of news cameras, then sifting through the events again in 2009, then talking‚Äîwith an air of PTSD but still personable‚Äîabout how he can't shake the case pretty recently, stresses the weight and longevity of these killings.  



In the first half of the docuseries, Brown nicely creates a sense of place, showing, for example, Amy Ayers at FFA (Future Farmers Of America) events, riding horses, and helping out on her family's ranch. The director then delves into the flip side of that pastoral beauty, with the cops getting swept up in the '90s satanic panic. ‚ÄúThey start going after goth kids and metalheads and ‚ÄòPIBs,' people in black‚Äîjust club kids,‚Äù Michael Hall of Texas Monthly explains of the investigation going off the rails (a segment that has flashes of the community's hysteria in the Paradise Lost films). 

And in the back half, The Yogurt Shop Murders focuses on false confessions, which was initially the subject of Huie's film‚Äînamely, the ones given by four men (teen boys at the time of the murders) who were charged in 1999. Watching these hours-long interrogations (which recall bits of the first season of Making A Murderer) and seeing them break and switch their stories to satisfy investigators and just get out of that room is infuriating. And it's hard not to be left indignant and numb about all of it‚Äîthe senseless killings, the incarcerations (and the time lost before two men were released years later), and the mystery that has hovered over that stretch of Austin about what happened in 1991 and who was responsible. But Brown's docuseries doesn't end on that note of frustration or on anything to do with developments in the case, really, and instead leaves us with a more human moment, of Thomas and Ayres-Wilson holding hands from across the table (as seen in the still above) and silently bonding over a pain that only they can understand.   

The Yogurt Shop Murders premieres August 3 on HBO

Cindy Lee has brought their entire catalog exclusively to Bandcamp, where it is now available to stream, download, and pre-order on vinyl. Physical reissues follow, via Superior Viaduct imprint W.25TH, on October 31. Among the new arrivals is the rare 2020 album Cat o' Nine Tails, the direct predecessor to Diamond Jubilee. That one is streaming for the first time, after its initial run of 50 lathe-cut LPs and a handful of cassettes. Listen to it below.

All Cindy Lee albums have been removed from Spotify at the artist's request, a press release notes. While a number of those records‚Äînot including Diamond Jubilee‚Äîhad been officially uploaded to Spotify in the past, only two remained before being taken down yesterday: What's Tonight to Eternity and Model Express.

Diamond Jubilee got its vinyl release in February, having previously been exclusive to Cindy Lee's Geocities page. The project's other albums were similarly hard to find, including Act of Tenderness and Malenkost, which had been removed from Bandcamp and only returned today. The Halloween vinyl drop will bring most Cindy Lee albums back into print for the first time in years.

Bill Burr vehemently rebuffed his conservative critics in a new interview with Vulture, stating that people who call him ‚Äúwoke‚Äù don't even understand the word, while also calling out the ‚Äúhorrible people‚Äù who send racist pictures to him and his wife.


	The exchange began when Burr was asked about far-right commentator Ben Shapiro, who leveled the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù criticism after attending one of Burr's stand-up shows last year. ‚ÄúHe doesn't even know what that word means,‚Äù Burr fired back. ‚ÄúHis definition of woke is white liberals' definition of woke, and they didn't even know what it was; they just took the word from Black people. That's the worst thing about our people ‚Äî not only do we take from other cultures, we don't even take the time to understand the definition.‚Äù


	Speaking on Shapiro specifically, Burr claimed he just attended one of his shows so he'd have ‚Äúsomething to talk about‚Äù online and ‚Äúmake money off dividing his own country.‚Äù

	‚ÄúThose people,‚Äù Burr added, ‚ÄúIt's treason what they do.‚Äù


	When asked about the extent to which Shapiro's shtick worked in enflaming right-wing corners of the web, Burr remained unfazed. ‚ÄúRacists. They're racists,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey send pictures of monkeys to me and my wife. They're fucking horrible people. And they're cowards, and they never say it to your face.‚Äù


	Looking at the highly politicized media ecosystem more broadly, Burr continued: ‚ÄúThere's an ugliness out there right now where if you're a racist, if you're an antisemite, if you're a psycho nationalist and you want a softball interview, there's podcasts out there where you can get one, and they will laugh at your fucking bad jokes and give you this pass. There's a really ugly thing going on out there, and we've already seen what it does to a nation, and it's not the way to go.‚Äù

	











	But Burr also pushed back against the way the left has ostensibly embraced him in this new era of his career. ‚ÄúMost of the left feels like if they have a Black friend, they don't have issues,‚Äù he cracked. ‚ÄúYou voted for a guy that is staring off into space ‚Ä¶ Your fucking party has not let you choose your candidate since Obama's second term.‚Äù


	The comedian stated flatly he wanted nothing to do with any of it. ‚ÄúI am out of that, so I don't want to hear any ‚Äòleft' and ‚Äòright' crap,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey're all fucking nuts.‚Äù

	For Burr, his primary villains are billionaire ‚Äúpuppeteers‚Äù and cable news stations that are ‚Äúalways distracting us with other stuff.‚Äù CNN and Fox News, Burr pointedly added, ‚Äúare a fucking disease.‚Äù 


	‚Äú[M]y new perspective is there's nothing wrong with being a billionaire, but if somebody is working 40 hours a week, 160 hours a month, and they can't make their rent, you're not paying them enough money,‚Äù Burr said. ‚ÄúMaybe you should just be worth $900 million. How does a CEO take a fucking eight-figure bonus and none of your employees have dental insurance? They can't even go out and get a filling.‚Äù

[Editor's note: The following interview contains minor spoilers for ‚ÄúThe Naked Gun.‚Äù]

There are a few jokes that ‚ÄúThe Naked Gun‚Äù screenwriters and long-time partners Dan Gregor and Doug Mand are sad didn't make it into Akiva Schaffer's long-hoped-for new entry into the spoof canon. But mostly, the duo is thrilled about the stuff that did make it in there. All the stuff, really, enough to make a bona-fide, honest-to-God, true-blue spoof feature, the kind made by a studio and with a budget and giant stars and a full-fledged theatrical release.

 










For two creators (best known for everything from ‚ÄúCrazy Ex-Girlfriend‚Äù to ‚ÄúChip ‚Äòn Dale: Rescue Rangers‚Äù) who can still easily and amiably recall the feeling of seeing ‚ÄúSpaceballs‚Äù or the original ‚ÄúNaked Gun‚Äù films for the first time, it's a dream come true. A silly dream, but still. We need those kinds of dreams these days.

The film, starring Liam Neeson, is both a reimagining and a continuation of the classic ‚ÄúNaked Gun‚Äù films of the '80s and '90s. In it, Neeson is Frank Drebin Jr., the grizzled cop son of original star Frank Drebin (the incomparable late Leslie Nielsen), who also happens to be seemingly genetically predisposed to wacky happenstance in his day-to-day life. When Frank takes on a big case, which inevitably brings him into the orbit of the alluring Beth Davenport (Pamela Anderson), he has to use all his brain power (silly jokes) and muscle (a love of chili dogs) to save the day, get the girl, and make everyone laugh while doing it.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Ahead, Gregor and Mand tell IndieWire about their hopes and fears around the film's reception (some sparked by this very website), writing for an Oscar nominee who can also punch a wolf, Pamela Anderson's otherworldly scatting, and the kind of jokes that could only live inside this delightful sort of package. 

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: We're going to start with the big, scary one: What is it like when you see a headline on IndieWire that calls your film the most important movie of the summer?

Doug Mand: So we saw that. It was sent to us. [Laughs]

Dan Gregor: And then we read the whole article. It's an amazing article. And he then goes into saying it's going to fix America, too. And I'll shoulder that burden. I will absolutely‚Äî

Mand: Not me. Not me, I want nothing to do with either of those endeavors. That's too much. I'm barely staying above water myself here.

Gregor: I always felt that America just needed a laugh, and that the only thing keeping us apart is a little bit of comedy. We're more than happy to do it. But I'm the first person to deflect and be like, ‚ÄúIt's a movie, guys. It's a silly movie. And what we do is silly.‚Äù But I will say this, talking to other people around LA, that is a little bit of the vibe, of people feeling like this has to do well so that other comedies and scripts will be bought. I do feel that there's a lot of people [who] want this to work.

 










Mand: Even other studios and studio executives who are normally competitive are like, ‚ÄúNo, no, no, we all want your movie to do well.‚Äù Which is a very lovely place to be in. It's a genre, in the large category of comedy and the small category of spoof, that has been very neglected for a while. As passionate comedy fans, it would mean a lot to us to have that be back in a sort of meaningful, central place.

Gregor: Meaning, in the theater.

When I saw it last week, it was with a somewhat smaller group of press, and many of them are younger than us, 25-year-olds and such, and I wondered, ‚ÄúHow are they going to vibe with this?‚Äù And they really enjoyed it.

Gregor: The generational divide on this type of comedy is really interesting, because it's disappeared for 20-some years. We noticed in some of our test screenings, people under a certain age, mostly teenagers, it took them a couple of minutes just to get the education on how these movies work. It's like, ‚ÄúWait, wait, he just lost his arms. Is that going to be a plot point?‚Äù And you're like, ‚ÄúNo, no, that's not important.‚Äù It's cartoon logic, you can always snap back to normal. But it took a moment for it to register [with that age group].

Hopefully, the ads are doing the education now, where people are understanding, ‚ÄúOh, this is really, really silly.‚Äù But I do think that there's a reintroduction of this type of comedy.

 










The film's trailer is mostly the opening scene, and it's one of the few times where I think a choice like that makes sense. You are setting up the logic, and you're setting up the expectations.

Gregor: That's our hope with the intro, that it does feel like you almost have a little CliffsNotes of like, ‚ÄúOh, this is what a spoof feels like.‚Äù If we've done it justice, it should feel like you're in the genre of an action movie, a heist movie or a heist scene, and then something happens that's ridiculous, but we're still in the heist movie. Hopefully, that gets people in the mood for what they're about to see for the next hour and a half.

What are your memories of seeing spoofs when you were younger? The ‚ÄúNaked Gun‚Äù movies, ‚ÄúAirplane!,‚Äù ‚ÄúSpaceballs,‚Äù all that good stuff.

Gregor: I mean, ‚ÄúThe Naked Gun‚Äù is actually my favorite of all of them.

Mand: Mm-hmm, same here.

Gregor: As a kid who grew up obsessed with this as a genre, Mel Brooks and ‚ÄúMonty Python‚Äù were everything to me. ‚ÄúNaked Gun‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpaceballs‚Äù were everything to me.

[I remember] moving to California and getting to drive down the highway where the two silos are, where in the beginning of the first [‚ÄúNaked Gun‚Äù movie], Frank Drebin says, ‚ÄúEverything I see reminds me of her,‚Äù and it's just those two giant boobs.

 










I was driving to San Diego after the fires this year with my wife, because we were kind of escaping the fires and it was a very stressful time, we were kind of in a fight, and we're passing the boobs and I was like, ‚ÄúThe boobs are there. We should stop fighting now.‚Äù And we both looked at them, and we were like, ‚ÄúYeah, that's very funny. OK, you're right.‚Äù

Mand: It's ‚ÄúSpaceballs‚Äù and all the ‚ÄúNaked Guns‚Äù that really left a mark on me. I remember, as a kid, knowing that maybe I didn't understand more than half of ‚ÄúNaked Gun,‚Äù and still loving it. I remember the pistachios filling up outside of the car when they're on a stakeout and they can't open the door, and it's just a pile, and thinking, ‚ÄúThis is the funniest thing I'd ever seen.‚Äù

Then coming back to it after starting to write sketch comedy in college and stuff, and there's a scene where Frank is questioning a guy at the docks for information, and it's the classic trope of the guy being like, ‚ÄúEh, maybe I've seen him, maybe I ain't.‚Äù And Frank offers him a 20-dollar bill, and before you know it, the guy from the docks is like, ‚ÄúWell, why do you want to know?‚Äù And Frank goes, ‚ÄúAh, I forget. I can't tell you.‚Äù And now the guy from the docks is paying him, and it basically ends with the guy from the docks borrowing twenty bucks from Frank to pay him back for information he got from Frank. And I was like, ‚ÄúThis is a perfect comedy scene. It doesn't get better than this.‚Äù

 










But literally every other scene in that movie is the best scene I've ever seen, comedy-wise.

I love ‚ÄúSpaceballs,‚Äù but I saw ‚ÄúSpaceballs‚Äù before I saw ‚ÄúStar Wars.‚Äù

Mand: Same! So, the first time I saw ‚ÄúStar Wars,‚Äù I was like, ‚ÄúEh, it's fine. It's not very funny.‚Äù

Gregor: Yeah, it's ‚ÄúSpaceballs‚Äù without the comedy. If I'm choosing between the two, why would I not just take the funny?

But it's funny the way that a good spoof can still work, even if you're not completely caught up on what is the inspirational source material.

Gregor: The first ‚ÄúNaked Gun‚Äù holds up to this day; it is still as funny as it was in 1988. Most comedies, even the best ones, are dated within a couple of years, and with ‚ÄúNaked Gun,‚Äù that did not happen. I think a big part of that was that they were basing it on already a throwback genre, ‚ÄúPolice Squad‚Äù is based on ‚ÄúM Squad‚Äù and ‚ÄúDragnet.‚Äù These are procedurals from the '50s and '60s, and so they already had a timeless quality to them.

That was definitely a big part of this movie for us, was to not try to be particularly topical, to hopefully feel like this is just a take on the last 20-some years of the genre of action movies, of detective movies. Our hope is that it has a little more longevity for not being topical.

 










Mand: If we used a reference, we wanted the reference to be older and lame. We wanted it to already be dated, so it wasn't something that would feel stale in a year or two.

Gregor: There's Janet Jackson references and Freedom Fries references. I mean, it's truly so dated.

Going back to thinking about the 25-year-olds and the teenagers watching it, how would you hold those two things in your head as you're writing, that you want this to have sort of a weird timeless quality because it is a throwback, but you also would like to bring in younger people to the fun?

Mand: This is something we talk about a lot, but I think you have to write to what makes you laugh first and foremost. The minute you're like, ‚ÄúI want everyone to like this,‚Äù then you're making a movie for almost no one. That's the first goal, and then it goes joke by joke, and then you're like, ‚ÄúIs this so specific?‚Äù And then is it so specific, but we don't care because we still like it? I remember watching ‚ÄúBarbie,‚Äù and that's a billion-dollar hit film‚Äî

Gregor: And what was the song that Ken played? Matchbox Twenty! That's as dated as it gets.

Mand: And I'm just like, ‚ÄúThese jokes are for them or for their friends.‚Äù They didn't get huge laughs, but it didn't matter because you feel that you're in that movie and you're like, ‚ÄúThis is a joy to watch.‚Äù

 










Gregor: It's the Looney Tunes lesson, which is you don't need to get every joke as much as you need to feel that the joy of the writing is there, because that part is infectious. I didn't know any of the opera references that they were making in Looney Tunes, but I could feel like, ‚ÄúOh, man, I feel clever for being a part of it. I feel like I'm being let in a little bit of a club.‚Äù

People have wanted this kind of joy for a while ‚Äî a ‚ÄúNaked Gun‚Äù reboot has been kicking around in Hollywood for years, and there have been many iterations of star, writers, and director attached. Did you guys take anything from the other scripts, or is this just you and Akiva?

Gregor: This is just us. Something that felt very important was that the only reason this movie exists in our minds is because Liam Neeson agreed to do this. We were dead set that we need to really honor that original ‚ÄúAirplane!‚Äù template of only casting dramatic actors, and looking at it really, really through the lens of drama.

But, we're comedians and we're friends with comedians, and it was very painful to tell all of our comedian friends, ‚ÄúFuck off,‚Äù but‚Äî

Mand: We didn't have to use ‚ÄúFuck off,‚Äù but we did.

Gregor: But I insisted! I said, ‚ÄúHey, come to my house. I want to tell you something.‚Äù

 










With Liam, there's really nobody else in Hollywood who has both that gravitas and has not sort of smirked his way out of it with a Marvel movie.

Mand: Or something lighter or something like that, which is totally fine. He's spent the last 15 years making these vigilante movies, making ‚ÄúTaken‚Äù and movies like that where he is the lone man who is the only one who can get the daughter back or the only one who can‚Äî

Gregor: Punch a wolf.

Mand: So the whole approach of it for us three when we sat down was like, ‚ÄúWe have Liam Neeson.‚Äù And Liam Neeson has this body of work, so we have to go back into this body of work, and also movies that haven't been spoofed that he isn't in, all the ‚ÄúJohn Wicks,‚Äù the ‚ÄúMission: Impossibles‚Äù that haven't been touched, which is also a gift for us.

And Liam is not Leslie, and no one is Leslie. Leslie, he's a unicorn. And Liam is not trying to be that, so it was, let's lean into the fact that we have Liam Neeson here who is a generational talent, one of the greatest of all time, and he's doing these silly lines. That was the whole point, so it was less about the other scripts or projects before, and it was more just like, ‚ÄúLiam's here, what do we do with Liam?‚Äù

Gregor: The basic task was, ‚ÄúWhat's the stupidest thing we can get Liam Neeson to say?‚Äù

 










Mand: And we think we got him to say some really stupid stuff.

Gregor: He's such a good actor actor, so he'd show up and really the first take would be perfect almost without fail. It leaves us all this space to give him alts and to play with it. Then, he had this thing that he would say, after the script would make him do something particularly embarrassing or awful, when they'd yell cut, he would go like, ‚ÄúI'm Oskar Schindler, dammit, what's happened to me?‚Äù I think he had a really good time.

There are so many little touches throughout the film that will delight spoof fans, running gags you just build on. There's one with Liam and Paul's characters constantly getting fresh coffees handed to them, then bigger coffees, then biggest coffees. What is the calculus of writing stuff like that?

Gregor: It's the math of heightening, where you're like, ‚ÄúOK, we had the first joke where he's just wasteful, he's just tossing the coffee cup.‚Äù And then those throws get more and more aggressive. Then, likewise, it goes from how many coffees to now even bigger coffees. It can't plateau. That's the math of it.

The one joke that we found on set was him driving against the green screen, and then our prop master just [handed him a coffee]. That's another one of the old-fashioned tropes of the genre, especially Mel Brooks would do this a lot, we're just acknowledging that we're driving on a green screen. To us, that felt like a really fun nod. The green screens have gotten a lot better, and so people don't always register [them], but I always feel like there's a little part of the back of your brain that is registering Uncanny Valley. It used to be that there was just a horse chase or something going on behind your carriage and you're like, ‚ÄúThat's fake.‚Äù

 










With your background, I'm not surprised that there are some songs in here, including this incredible sequence of Pam scatting.

Mand: Akiva can talk about this quite a bit, but it's something that I can say that I know that they did in the first audition. The time that they met, Pam actually said she did scat in high school, and she did some for him, and it was wildly endearing and sweet, and she just went for it. This was something that we knew we were going to do pretty early on.

Gregor: Do you remember the Kim Cattrall video?

Oh, do I.

Gregor: So it's very much that, that's certainly where we started from, where it was like, ‚ÄúOK, that's maybe the funniest thing anyone can do.‚Äù

Mand: But we're not going to be as funny as that, but what's the second funniest thing we can do? But that's Pam being unreal and a gift. Pam just kind of dove into this thing head-first and really wanted to be great and wanted to be silly and poke fun. That song was a lot of trial and error of what's going to play as silly versus what's not going to play as, like, is she really good at this?

Gregor: We recorded that as a real track with her beforehand. The amazing artist Liz Gilles basically coached her through it and helped us write some of the very musical stuff. We can write in the script ‚Äúand then she scats,‚Äù but what the hell does that sound like? The word ‚ÄúSki baba, do baba, la ba da da,‚Äù somebody still has to write that.

 










The very first time that it was all performed [as a whole] was the very first take on set, so the whole crew was seeing this as a real performance. And Pam got a standing ovation on set from the audience of crew and cast who were just like, ‚ÄúHoly shit, that was spectacular. That was amazing.‚Äù In edit, we kind of jumbled it up and mixed it around.

I'll say our saddest thing is that there was just the best scatting of the ‚ÄúSuper Mario Brothers‚Äù underwater theme, and that was in all of the cuts until the 11th hour when Nintendo said that they weren't going to let us do it. If you got to see an early cut, you would've seen her scatting the ‚ÄúSuper Mario Brothers‚Äù underwater theme. And that really, really, really tickled us.

That brings to mind ‚Äî and this is one of the few movies I would ask for this ‚Äî what are things in the movie that you would hope that people really can look out for, and maybe they look out for it in their second watch?

Gregor: This is not a spoiler or like an Easter egg kind of joke, but the detail that I continually love more than anything is when Frank is angry at Beth for deleting his old episodes of ‚ÄúBuffy the Vampire Slayer‚Äù and it's just the sound effect of him slowly clicking through an old TiVo. We actually did dig up the old TiVo sounds, and they have this weird, dated quality.

 










Mand: ‚ÄúBloop‚Ä¶ bloop bloop.‚Äù

Gregor: There's like a water drippy kind of sound to it. I love that detail so much.

Mand: I'm tickled by the movie. I still can't believe they made it. I can't believe that we're here right now in London about to go see a premiere of it. It's hopefully stupid at every minute.

Gregor: Oh, keep an eye out for the beaver. That's the Easter egg for the original movie that we're happy we got to sneak in here.

Going back to the hope that this is a success for comedies, but also specifically for spoofs, what are your big hopes for what this might do to the spoof market?

Gregor: I hope it brings us back, spoofs very specifically, but even just the concept of a very big, silly movie, and that comedies can just be fun.

Mand: [There can be] comedy-forward movies, not an action movie with jokes, a kid's animated movie with laughs, a romantic comedy, just like a movie that is here to make you laugh. So, spoof or no spoof, just the idea that it's just a comedy and there's just not as much fear of doing it. I feel like there's just become so much fear, that it's got to be comedy on top of something else as opposed to just being like, ‚ÄúThe point of this movie is to make you laugh, and hopefully feel things as well.‚Äù

 










Like the original ‚ÄúNaked Gun,‚Äù you're rooting for that romance, hopefully, that happens in our movie. It's one of the tricks of these movies‚Ä¶ that you may forget that the plot is there, but if you do it correctly, if you look at it, the plot makes sense, and the love story is something you actually care about. Not too much that it's getting in the way of the jokes, but just enough to root for it.

It's a comedy-first movie, so my biggest hope is that that starts to happen a little bit more. It just starts to drip out a little bit where people can just be like, ‚ÄúThese are jokes.‚Äù

Gregor: It's also a weird byproduct of the disintegration of the monoculture. You need a baseline to spoof, and with fewer baselines, it's harder to find those things. But a friend of mine described this as ‚Äúa fresh Mario board with untouched coins,‚Äù and I like that metaphor. Yes, this is a pre-existing genre, but there's this whole area that hasn't been touched.‚Äù

And the longer we've been away from it? I mean, God, the superhero genre is so ripe for spoof at this point, too. OK, I guess that's what I'm throwing my hat in the ring for, if they let us. [Laughs]

A Paramount Pictures release, ‚ÄúThe Naked Gun‚Äù is now in theaters.

THR is also debuting new stills from Richard Linklater's homage to 'Breathless' and the French New Wave, which premiered in May at the Cannes Film Festival, where it received rave reviews.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


Nouvelle Vague, Richard Linklater's loving homage to Jean Luc-Godard's 1960 film Breathless and the French New Wave, which received a 10-minute standing ovation and rave reviews following its world premiere at May's Cannes Film Festival, will be released in American theaters on Oct. 31 and play on big screens for two weeks before dropping on Netflix on Nov. 14, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.


	When Netflix acquired Nouvelle Vague's U.S. rights shortly after Cannes, some reacted with surprise and dismay that a movie shot on film and about cinema would end up with a streamer. But the company is planning a robust theatrical release that will include not only screens in New York (where, appropriately enough, it owns the historic Paris Theater) and LA, but in all of the top 10 U.S. markets.

	Additionally, THR can report that the largely French-language film will be pushed across all categories. In my humble opinion, it could well end up a finalist for best picture, a category in which non-English-language films have landed many noms in recent years (including France's Netflix-distributed Emilia P√©rez earlier this year); best director (Linklater is a beloved auteur, but his only nom in the category came for 2014's Boyhood); and screenplay (it has yet to be determined if Holly Gent, Laetitia Masson and Vincent Palmo Jr.'s script will be classified as adapted or original).

	











	Meanwhile, Zoey Deutch, who is luminous as Breathless star Jean Seberg, will be campaigned in the supporting actress race, while French actors Guillaume Marbeck and Aubry Dullin, who eerily resemble the characters they play ‚Äî Godard and Breathless breakout Jean-Paul Belmondo ‚Äî will be pushed for lead actor and supporting actor, respectively.


	The big question moving forward is whether or not France will select Nouvelle Vague as its entry for the best international feature Oscar competition. Each country's submission is determined by a selection committee comprised mostly of people associated with that country's film industry, who must attest that ‚Äúcreative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.‚Äù


	The key word is ‚Äúlargely.‚Äù In the case of Nouvelle Vague, Linklater and Deutch are American, but almost everyone else who worked in front of or behind the camera is French, including the film's two producers, Laurent P√©tin and Mich√®le P√©tin, so the film is certainly eligible. Plus, its financing came from France; it was shot in France; it premiered in France; and it is an out-and-out celebration of French cinema.


	Some selection committees are hesitant to submit a film directed by someone born outside of their country's borders, feeling that doing so would be a missed opportunity to highlight homegrown talent. But other countries enter whichever film they think offers them the best shot at actually landing an Oscar nom. For instance, Japan put forward ‚Äî and landed a nom in 2024 for ‚Äî German filmmaker Wim Wenders' Perfect Days. Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Holland has had films entered by Poland, West Germany and the Czech Republic. And twice in the last decade, France itself submitted films by non-French filmmakers: Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's Elle in 2016 and Italian filmmaker Filippo Neneghetti's Two of Us in 2020.

	











	France, however, has had bruising experiences with its last two submissions. In 2024, it entered The Taste of Things instead of Anatomy of a Fall; ultimately, the former was not nominated, while the latter went on to five other noms (best picture, director, original screenplay, actress and film editing), suggesting that it almost certainly would have been nominated for ‚Äî and might have even won ‚Äî best international feature had it been entered. And in 2025, its submission Emilia P√©rez looked certain to bring the country its first win in the category since Indochine prevailed in 1993, but its prospects imploded shortly before the final round of voting, thanks to the exposure of problematic social media posts from its principal star, and it ultimately lost.


	Again, Emilia P√©rez was handled by Netflix, so you can be sure that the company is hungry for another chance to get a French film across the finish line in the best international feature Oscar race. (In just the last six years, it backed two films from other countries that went on to win that prize, Mexico's Roma in 2019 and Germany's All Quiet on the Western Front in 2023.) But the decision about whether or not it will have that opportunity is ultimately France's, or at least the French selection committee's.


	Given that no other French film has emerged this year, so far, that would appear to offer the nation a better shot than Nouvelle Vague at landing a best international feature Oscar nom, and possibly even a win, it will be very interesting to see how France's selection committee plays it cards.

Jerry Garcia isn't just one of the most beloved rock stars ever, a legendary guitar player, and leader of the greatest rock band of all time from its inception in 1965 up through his passing in 1995. The Grateful Dead co-founder was also a font of casual philosophical wisdom, offering up pearls of insight throughout his life on anything from religion to finance to art. Here are some classic nuggets of Garcia genius to guide you through life.


On God‚ÄúThere was one dream when I thought everybody on Earth had been evacuated in flying saucers and the only people left were these sort of lifeless automatons that were walking around, and there's the kind of sound of that hallow mocking laughter, when you realize that you're the butt of the universe's big joke.‚Äù ‚Äî1989


	‚ÄúThe date that holds significance for me is 2012. That's Terence McKenna's alpha moment, where the universe undergoes its most extraordinary transformations. He talks about these cycles, which, in each epic, more happens than in all previous time‚Ä¶. They're huge transformations in consciousness. This is going to peak in 2012.‚Äù ‚Äî1993












	‚ÄúAfter I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of protoplasm that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off. They were run through with neoprene tubing, and there were these insects that looked like cockroaches which were like message-units that were kind of like my bloodstream. That was my image of my physical self, and this lasted a long time.‚Äù ‚Äî1994












	I have been spoken to by a higher order of intelligence ‚Äì I thought it was God. It was a very personal God, in that it had exactly the same sense of humor that I have. I interpret that as being the next level of consciousness.‚Äù ‚Äî1994


On Drugs‚ÄúBeing high, each note is like a whole universe. And each silence. And when you're playing and you're high on acid in these scenes, it is like the most important thing in the world. It's truly, pshew, cosmic.‚Äù ‚Äî1972

	‚ÄúTo get really high is to forget yourself ‚Äì and to forget yourself is to see everything else ‚Äì and to see everything else is to become an understanding molecule in evolution, a conscious tool of the universe. And I think every human being should be a conscious tool of the universe. That's why I think it's important to get high.‚Äù ‚Äî1972


	‚ÄúI'm the sort of person that will just keep going along until something stops me. For me and drugs, the bust helped. It reminded me how vulnerable you are when you're drug dependent. It caught my attention. It was like, ‚ÄòOh, right: illegal!'‚Äù ‚Äî1987


	‚ÄúDrug use is kind of a cul-de-sac: It's one of those places you turn with your problems, and pretty soon, all your problems have become that one problem. Then it's just you and drugs.‚Äù ‚Äî1987


	‚ÄúIn my life, all kinds of drugs have been useful to me, and they have also been a hindrance to me. As far as I'm concerned, the results are not in.‚Äù ‚Äî1991


	‚ÄúQ: If you were made Clinton's drug-policy adviser, what would you do?A: I would advise him to make everything legal immediately. Take the profit out of it and the whole criminal structure will collapse. The next part is the health aspect, making drugs that are clean and in knowable, understandable doses. Why not spend research money on making drugs that are good for you, that are healthy? Is the problem that we don't like people changing their consciousness? I don't think that's a good enough reason not to have drugs.‚Äù ‚Äî1994


His Peers‚ÄúMaybe Chuck Berry was the first rock musician because he was one of the first blues cats to listen to records, so he wasn't locked into the blues idiom. Nobody has to fool around with musty old scores, weird notation and scholarship bullshit. You can just go into a record store and pick a century, pick a country, pick anything, and dig it, make it a part of you, add it to the stuff you carry around and see that it's all music.‚Äù ‚Äî1969

	‚ÄúI knew Janis eight years ago, and she was singing her heart out in the funkiest places you could imagine, with abscesses on her arms, dumpy and strung out, head all fucked up, wearing the plainest, most nondescript clothes you've ever seen. She was really singing, and nobody was even listening.‚Äù ‚Äî1971












	‚ÄúDylan was able to tell you the truth. He was able to talk about the changes that you'd go through, the bummers and stuff like that ‚Äì and say it in a good way, the right way. Back in the folk music days, I couldn't really dig this stuff, but on Bringing It All Back Home he was really saying something that I could dig, that was relevant to what was going on in my life at the time. Whether he intended it that way or not is completely unimportant.‚Äù ‚Äî1972


	‚ÄúThe Beatles were real important. They were a little model, especially the movies ‚Äì the movies were a big turn-on. Just because it was a little model of good times ‚Ä¶ it was like [they] were saying, ‚ÄòYou can be young, you can be far-out and you can still make it.' They were making people happy. That happy thing ‚Äì that's the stuff that counts ‚Äì was something we could all see right away.‚Äù ‚Äî1972


	‚ÄúThe Rolling Stones never did have a cool audience. [At concerts] Jagger would make his little speech about turn on the lights so we can see you, and everybody would scream and run up to the stage. It was so predictable. They knew it would work. They're good ‚Äì they don't need any tricks.‚Äù ‚Äî1971


	‚ÄúI didn't get serious about music until I was 18 and I heard bluegrass. I heard Earl Scruggs play five-string banjo and I thought, ‚ÄòThat's something I have to be able to do.' I fell in love with the sound, and I started earnestly trying to do what I was hearing. That became the basis for everything else that was my model.‚Äù ‚Äî1994


On Health‚ÄúI'm basically a lazy fuck. Things have to get to the point where they're screaming before I'll do anything. I could see it coming, and I kept saying to myself: Well, as soon as I get myself together, I'm going to start working out. I'm going on that diet.‚Äù ‚Äî1993


On Money‚ÄúI've always thought the Grateful Dead should be sponsored by the government or something. It should be a public service, you know, and they should set us up at places that need to get high. That's the kind of thing we should be doing. We shouldn't be in business.‚Äù ‚Äî1972


	‚ÄúSomehow, we've ended up successes. But this ain't exactly what we had in mind, 12,000-seat halls and big bucks. We're trying not to redefine. What can we do that's more fun, more interesting?‚Äù ‚Äî1973


	‚ÄúWe really manage ourselves. The band is the board of directors, and we have regular meetings with our lawyers and our accountants that take about three hours, every three weeks. The last couple of times, I've been there screaming, ‚ÄòHey, you guys!' Because there are times when you go onstage and it's just plain hard to do and you start to wonder, ‚ÄòWhy the fuck are we doing this if it's so hard?'‚Äù ‚Äî1991












On the SixtiesIt wasn't a gig, it was the Acid Tests, where anything was OK. Thousands of people, man, all helplessly stoned, all finding themselves in a roomful of other thousands of people, none of whom any of them were afraid of. It was magic, far-out, beautiful magic.‚Äù ‚Äî1969


	‚ÄúThe [Black] Panthers are righteous. What they're doing is actual, practical things. They got a free breakfast trip, and they're starting a free shoes thing ‚Äì they're starting shoe factories and stuff like that. They're really doing things, man. They're into action, and that's something we can understand 'cause we're from a place where talk is cheap.‚Äù ‚Äî1970


	‚ÄúI thought we were experiencing a lucky vacation from the rest of consensual reality to try stuff out. I didn't have anything invested in the idea that the world was going to change. Our world certainly changed. Our part of it did what it was supposed to do, and it's continuing to do it, continuing to evolve. It's a process. I believe that if you open the door to the process, it tells you how to do it and it works. It's a life strategy that I think anyone can employ.‚Äù ‚Äî1994


On SongwritingI don't write them unless I absolutely have to. I don't wake up in the morning and say, ‚ÄòJeez, I feel great today. I think I'll write a song.' I mean, anything is more interesting to me than writing a song. It's like pulling teeth. I don't enjoy it a bit.‚Äù ‚Äî1991


	‚ÄúI don't feel I have what it to takes to be a writer. I've never been able to sustain an idea and get it down. It's hard for me to do it with music, too. My own preferences are for improvisation, for making it up as we along. The idea of picking, of eliminating possibilities by deciding, that's difficult for me.‚Äù ‚Äî1993


	‚ÄúRobert Hunter's really good about writing into my beliefs. He knows I'm going to be battling with my intelligence about whether I can sing this lyric or whether I'm going to feel like an idiot singing it.‚Äù ‚Äî1994


	‚ÄúI don't think of my ideas as being far-out, musically. What works for me is the emotional component, not the technical.‚Äù ‚Äî1993


On Books‚ÄúMy life would be life would be miserable if I didn't have those little chunks of Dylan Thomas and T.S. Eliot. I can't imagine life without that stuff. Those are the payoffs: the finest moments in music, the finest moments in movies. Great moments are part of what support you as an artist and a human.‚Äù‚Äî1991


	‚ÄúI fell in with a teacher who turned me on to the intellectual world. He said, ‚ÄòHere, read this.' It was 1984 when I was 11 or 12. That was when I was turning on, so to speak, or became aware of a whole other world that was other than the thing you got in school, that you got in the movies and all that; something very different.‚Äù ‚Äî1972

Film distributor and streaming service Mubi issued a statement tonight denying that it's ‚Äúshelved‚Äù chef and filmmaker Eddie Huang's new documentary Vice Is Broke, claiming that it's ‚Äúin constructive discussions with the filmmaker and producers about the film's release on Mubi, and will share further updates as those conversations progress.‚Äù Said statement runs strongly counter to a video Huang posted on social media on Thursday night, claiming that his documentary‚Äîtracking Vice's transformation from a scrappy outsider into a soulless media juggernaut‚Äîwas being mothballed and punished because he'd criticized Mubi's financial ties to Sequoia Capital, which in turn has connections with the Israeli defense industry.

In his video, Huang‚Äîa well-known chef and former Vice contributor, whose memoir also served as the basis for ABC's Fresh Off The Boat‚Äîclaimed that Mubi president Jason Ropell called him up on Thursday and told him the film wouldn't be released, and that, in Huang's words, ‚ÄúYou and the producers can buy it back from us if you want, but otherwise, nobody's gonna see the film.‚Äù Huang asserted he was being made an ‚Äúexample‚Äù of after calling out Mubi for its ties to Sequoia, and stating that he wouldn't do any promotion for the film. Mubi has denied this characterization of the conversation between Ropell and Huang.

Sequoia, a Silicon Valley investment firm, reportedly invested $100 million in Mubi earlier this year, provoking controversy that was directed toward the streamer/distributor. (Per Variety, Sequoia also has links to an Israeli defense tech start-up called Kela, which touts the Israeli military credentials of its founders, and whose website states that it provides ‚Äúbattle-tested tech for modern warfare.‚Äù) Several filmmakers posted an open letter earlier this week calling on Mubi to cut ties with Sequoia, with Huang posting a link to coverage of the letter with the comment ‚ÄúI agree. I did not make Vice Is Broke to help fund genocide.‚Äù Mubi has stated that ‚Äúthe beliefs of individual investors do not reflect the views of Mubi.‚Äù

	Former Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show for her first interview since losing the presidential election to Donald Trump. 


	In the episode aired on Thursday, Harris, who has since left office, detailed her decision to not run for governor of her native California. After a long career of being a ‚Äúdevout public servant,‚Äù Harris said that ‚Äúfor now, I don't want to go back into the system,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI think it's broken.‚Äù


	While there are ‚Äúso many good people who are public servants, who do such good work, teachers and firefighters and police officers and nurses and scientists,‚Äù Harris continued, ‚ÄúI always believed that as fragile as our democracy is, our systems would be strong enough to defend our most fundamental principles. And I think right now that they're not as strong as they need to be, and I just don't want to for now. I don't want to go back in the system. I want to travel the country. I want to listen to people, and I don't want it to be transactional, where I'm asking for their vote.‚Äù

	











	In response, Colbert said, ‚ÄúAs someone who is very qualified for the presidency ‚Ä¶  To hear you say that it's broken, to hear you say that our systems aren't strong enough, is harrowing.‚Äù




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	‚ÄúWell, but it's also evident, isn't it?‚Äù Harris replied, drawing applause from the audience. ‚ÄúBut it doesn't mean we give up,‚Äù she pressed on. ‚ÄúI am always going to be part of the fight.‚Äù

	











	‚ÄúThe power is with the people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt is our government. It is our country. And it is important, I think, that in this moment where people have become so deflated and despondent and afraid, that those of us who have the ability ‚Äî which I do right now, not being in an office where I'm campaigning for that office ‚Äî to be out there and to talk with folks and remind them of their power and their importance.‚Äù


	Elsewhere, Harris detailed her 107 Days book, which chronicles her 2024 election campaign, and is set for release Sept. 23 by Simon & Schuster. When discussing her upcoming book, the former vice president acknowledged that while she predicted many of the actions Trump took in office, she did not expect the ‚Äúcapitulation.‚Äù

	‚ÄúI believed that on some level there should be many who consider themselves to be guardians of our system and our democracy, who just capitulated,‚Äù said Harris.


	Her interview on the talk show arrives after CBS‚Äò abrupt decision to end The Late Show in 2026. While the network claimed the cancellation was financial, it drew backlash, since the announcement came days after Colbert slammed Paramount, which owns CBS and Comedy Central, over its decision to agree to a settlement with Trump. An array of celebrities, politicians, and fellow late-night legends have thrown their support behind Colbert following the unceremonious decision.

	President Donald Trump's primary Super PAC has raked in over $200 million this year, with the donations ranging from unseemly to objectively funny. 


	Perhaps the most notable donor to the group, MAGA Inc., is Elon Musk, who gave $5 million in late June despite publicly feuding with the president ever since he left his role leading Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. The world's richest man made his contribution on June 27, several days before Trump publicly mulled deporting him. 


	Another comical name: Jared Isaacman, who had been Trump's nominee to lead NASA. The president decided to pull his nomination because he previously donated to Democrats, yet Isaacman gave $1 million a month later. 


	It's not all fun and games, though. There was plenty of money to be found from billionaires, fossil fuel companies and executives, cryptocurrency firms and investors, health care behemoths, big banks, and other businesses with vested financial interests in policy decisions coming out of Trump's administration, according to MAGA Inc.'s filing on Thursday. (Musk, for his part, remains a massive government contractor.)

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The single biggest donor to MAGA Inc. since the start of the year is Jeff Yass, who gave $15 million in March. Yass' financial firm owns a big stake in the Chinese parent company of TikTok. Trump has allowed the platform to continue operating in the U.S. despite Congress passing legislation last year banning TikTok from doing so unless it's sold. Trump has twice signed executive orders extending the deadline. 

	











	MAGA Inc. received a combined $25 million in February from pipeline giant Energy Transfer LP and its CEO Kelcy Warren. On the first day of his second term, Trump rescinded Joe Biden's executive order blocking the permit for Energy Transfer's controversial Keystone XL Pipeline. ‚ÄúWe want the Keystone XL Pipeline built!‚Äù Trump posted on Truth Social a few days after the donations.


	America's largest health insurer, UnitedHealthcare, donated $5 million to MAGA Inc. in January, days before Trump took office. The embattled insurer, which has been reeling in the wake of the murder of its CEO, is being investigated by the Trump Justice Department over its Medicare billing practices.

	The Super PAC received $5 million in February from Extremity Care, a company that sells so-called skin substitute bandages. In April, the Trump administration delayed a Biden administration policy that would limit Medicare spending on the wildly expensive bandages, which cost the essential health program billions of dollars each year. 


	As Trump and his family build a massive crypto fortune, he has aggressively pushed the industry's interests in Washington and sought to deregulate the exceedingly risky assets. He recently signed legislation creating new, light-touch regulations for so-called stablecoins, crypto assets with a price pegged to the U.S. dollar. 


	Crypto interests have poured money into his Super PAC. Foris DAX Inc., better known as crypto.com, donated $10 million. Blockchain.com gave $5 million.


	Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the crypto investors who lead the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, have each donated $3 million. Gemini Trust Company, a crypto exchange launched by billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has donated $1.4 million; the twins kicked in another $1 million together. Crypto investment firm Paradigm Operations gave $1.2 million. 


	‚Äã‚ÄãKelly Loeffler, Trump's Small Business Administration chief, donated $2.5 million to MAGA Inc. Warren Stephens, Trump's ambassador to the United Kingdom, gave $1 million to the Super PAC in February, two weeks after his nomination was formally submitted to the Senate.

	Tools for Humanity, an eyeball-scanning company co-founded by OpenAI's Sam Altman, is another major donor to MAGA Inc., giving $5 million. Tools for Humanity has reported lobbying the Trump administration on issues related to digital identification, artificial intelligence, privacy, and cybersecurity.

($2 million), Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones ($1 million), and big bank JPMorgan Chase ($964,000).


	MAGA Inc. also received nearly $14 million in dark money from Securing American Greatness, a pro-Trump nonprofit that does not disclose its donors.

Metro Boomin dropped some heat on Friday (Aug. 1) with his A Futuristic Summa mixtape.


	He released the first single, ‚ÄúSlide‚Äù with Roscoe Dash, on YouTube on the Fourth of July. The hip-hop superproducer's MySpace-themed website revealed 23 tracks would be featured on A Futuristic Summa, which is hosted by renowned Atlanta DJ/producer DJ Spinz. Outside of Dash, Quavo, Young Dro, 2 Chainz, Lil Baby, Future, T.I., Waka Flocka Flame, Gucci Mane, Young Thug and more were previously revealed as features.


	He also echoed Tyler, the Creator's sentiments about wanting people to dance again without the pressure of being perceived behind screens. ‚ÄúPUT THE PHONES DOWN TOO!!!!! DANCE AGAIN!! PARTY AGAIN!! HAVE FUN AGAIN!!!!‚Äù Metro wrote on X on Wednesday (July 30).

	











	The Atlanta-bred hitmaker has been busy this year helming tracks on other artists' Billboard 200-topping albums, including The Weeknd's Hurry Up Tomorrow, Playboi Carti's MUSIC and JACKBOYS' second album. He also made a small cameo during the nightclub scene in The Weeknd's first feature film that shares the same name of his latest album.




			Trending on Billboard		







A Futuristic Summa arrives one year after Metro and Future's chart-topping LPs We Don't Trust You and We Still Don't Trust You. The former scored a Grammy nod for best rap album, while the title track for the latter, featuring The Weeknd, earned a nomination for best melodic rap performance. ‚ÄúLike That‚Äù with Kendrick Lamar from We Don't Trust You was also nominated for best rap song and best rap performance.

The vocalist hasn't dropped a pop song in years.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Demi Lovato is back in the mainstream music game, with the star's first pop song in three years, ‚ÄúFast,‚Äù released today (Aug. 1).


	Over a club-ready, EDM-tinged beat, Lovato returns to the form of past Billboard Hot 100 hits such as ‚ÄúCool for the Summer‚Äù and ‚ÄúReally Don't Care‚Äù on ‚ÄúFast,‚Äù singing, ‚ÄúI wanna go fast/ I wanna go hard/ I wanna go anywhere, anywhere you are.‚Äù


	The track arrives after weeks of the musician teasing a return to pop music years after holding a ‚Äúfuneral‚Äù for her songs in the genre. Since 2022, Lovato has strictly released rock music, starting with 2022 album Holy Fvck and followed by Revamped, a compilation of the musician's past pop hits reimagined as rock anthems.

	











	According to a recent report from Rolling Stone, ‚ÄúFast‚Äù is just the precursor for a full album of new pop music Lovato is preparing. The publication says that the vocalist is readying a ‚Äúcelebratory dance-pop‚Äù album informed by the singer's romance with husband Jordan ‚ÄúJutes‚Äù Lutes.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The publication also spoke to their producer on the upcoming project, Zhone, who said, ‚ÄúThis album is about letting inhibitions go, and we had so much fun making this music!‚Äù


	To promote her pop homecoming, Lovato also recently revisited another important piece of the past: The Bigg Chill, a.k.a. the frozen yogurt shop the Camp Rock alum previously visited in 2021 and made headlines for slamming as ‚Äútoxic‚Äù because of its calorie-count displays. The singer apologized for slamming the store at the time, but now amends have truly been made with Lovato posting a video of their dessert run and writing, ‚Äúlove you bigg chill.‚Äù


	Listen to ‚ÄúFast‚Äù below.

After all, CBS just canceled Stephen Colbert's Late Show over the financial problems facing the chat show niche‚Äîand for no other reason‚Äîsuggesting that not even the highest-rated network talk show can run profitably in the current climate. But don't we turn to late-night talk for more than just money and ad sales? Isn't it our national water cooler? A TV destination where we can all lighten up, have a little fun, and listen to the most recent Democratic candidate for president tell us that America's systems and institutions are now so fundamentally broken that she can't even be bothered to muster up an easy slam-dunk run for governor of California?

This cheerful little reminder brought to you by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who stopped by Colbert's couch for her first interview since the 2024 election earlier tonight. Harris has got a new book to hawk, of course, but she also popped by to spread a little political, uh, cheer, quickly shooting down the obvious question about whether her recent statement about not running for governor of California was part of the lead-up to a 2028 run at the Oval Office. ‚ÄúNah‚Äù is the current party line, apparently, as Harris went on to say that she's spent her political life operating inside the system, and now views the whole thing as so thoroughly compromised that she can no longer bring herself to toss her bones back into the machine. ‚ÄúI always believed that, as fragile as our democracy is, our systems would be strong enough to defend our most fundamental principles,‚Äù she said with obvious emotion. ‚ÄúAnd I think right now that they're not as strong as they need to be.‚Äù When Colbert suggested that Harris' judgment of the situation is ‚Äúharrowing,‚Äù she fired back quickly with, ‚ÄúBut it's also evident, isn't it?‚Äù (Harris did push back on the idea that she was giving up, but stated her desire to operate outside politics for a bit, traveling across America and learning about people's problems in a ‚Äúnon-transactional‚Äù way where she wasn't hunting for anyone's vote. She makes it sound a bit like the old Incredible Hulk TV show, honestly.)

So, yeah, never let anyone tell you that late-night TV isn't still the place to go to let your hair down and have a little fun! The current clip of Harris' interview with Colbert is circulating on social media right now, ahead of a full conversation on the Late Show tonight. God help us if some poor beleaguered CBS editor removes even a second of footage from either, thus irreparably harming Donald Trump again; Paramount's presumably only got so much ‚Äúsettlement money‚Äù left to throw around.

In 2006, Stephen Colbert‚Äîbrutally in-character, and standing about six feet from the U.S. President he was openly mocking‚Äîremarked that reality should sometimes be disregarded on account of its ‚Äúwell-known liberal bias.‚Äù The same thought may, presumably, also be applied to history, when a sober recitation of things that actually happened, and which everybody quite clearly remembers, gets in the way of prevailing political winds. For instance: The Washington Post reports today that a display at the Smithsonian Institute, focused on the extremely rare practice of presidential impeachment, has now been altered to make it seem just a little bit rarer. You'll never guess which of America's three impeached presidents has been removed!

WaPo reports that, earlier in July, the Smithsonian's National Museum Of American History altered a display in its The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden exhibit, in order to remove references to the two times Donald Trump has been impeached by Congress. Trump's two impeachments (in 2019 and 2021) were added to the display via a temporary label, titled ‚ÄúCase under redesign (history happens)‚Äù back in 2021. The label has now been removed from the display, which now reverts to previous language that ‚Äúonly three presidents have seriously faced removal.‚Äù (For what it's worth, the online companion for the exhibit briefly mentions Trump's impeachments, and updates the number of imperiled presidents to four, also including Clinton, Johnson, and the nearly-impeached Nixon.)

According to unnamed sources, the reversion of the display came after the White House put pressure on the Smithsonian to undergo review for ‚Äúanti-American ideology,‚Äù one of those phrases that feels like a warm little slice of dystopia sliding into the brain every time we read it. A Smithsonian spokesperson said the exhibit was reverted to its 2008 state because none of the other exhibits in the ‚ÄúLimits Of Presidential Power‚Äù section it's part of had been updated since then. (After all, why should the specific display on impeachment change, just because the total number of impeached or near-impeached presidents had increased by fully 33 percent since it was first created?) The decision comes as the Smithsonian comes under increased scrutiny from a President who's spent the last seven months fumbling and groping for the bra hooks of American cultural control; the Institute's National Portrait Gallery director, Kim Sajet, recently resigned her position after Trump repeatedly called for her firing, and painter Amy Sherald pulled a planned exhibit from the Portrait Gallery over reports that the Institute was considering removing her painting of a trans woman posing as the Statue of Liberty.

The reluctant warrior archetype tends to be as instinctively intriguing as it is irksomely far-fetched. Here's a dude (or a lady, or a nonbinary individual, but typically a man) who's the deadliest shooter west of the Mississippi or the toughest hombre east of Appalachia. They're not just an expert in their chosen method of violence; they're the expert. They're also a practicing pacifist.

As a viewer, it's an enticing characterization: Someone says they can do something extraordinary, but they refuse to do it, which only builds anticipation for the moment when they inevitably back up their claims. They don't want to outdraw their trigger-happy opponent. They don't want to throw down with a gang of knife-wielding assassins. They don't want to rip out a man's tongue with their bare hands and get a quick protein boost from eating it. But they can do all those things, and they will do all those things if they believe they have no other choice. 

 








Related Stories ‚ÄòShe Rides Shotgun' Review: Taron Egerton Is an Ex-Con Trying to Save His Daughter from Skinheads in a Tough but Movingly Tender Crime Thriller Inside the Making of the ‚ÄòStar Trek: Strange New Worlds' Murder Mystery Episode 

There's also the handy moral shortcut. The reluctant warrior gets to acknowledge that murderous rampages are wrong before indulging in the murderous rampage anyway. Sure, some thoughtful audience members may have lingering questions like, ‚ÄúIf so-and-so really is the best there is at beating the shit out of people, then how did they get to be so good at it? Wouldn't gaining such an elite expertise require a big time commitment? And wouldn't that commitment indicate an interest in, or a need for, performing these violent acts?‚Äù

 










Savvy writers will saddle their reluctant warriors (or martial pacifist, depending on your definition) with reasonable backstories explaining how they learned to commit such horrific acts of violence ‚Äî they're ex-military, not active military, or they're reformed gunslingers, not functioning gun nuts ‚Äî but the John Wicks of the world, on some level, have to enjoy what they do, don't they? A little bit? Even if they'd never admit it? And shouldn't that be seen as more of a problem for our warrior? Shouldn't the motivation for his initial reluctance outweigh the satisfaction of his inevitable victory? Shouldn't he mourn what he's been forced to do, once it's all over, rather than ride off into the sunset as the conquering hero?

Ka'iana, Jason Momoa‚Äòs reluctant warrior in the Apple TV+ series ‚ÄúChief of War,‚Äù wrestles with his character's contradictions almost as well as he wrestles with carnivorous sharks. At the start of the nine-episode first season, Ka'iana has already abandoned the titular role he inherited from his father, instead deciding to live as a peaceful outcast on Maui with his brothers and their wives. Each morning, they hunt for their own food. Each night, they sleep in their own shelters. Throughout it all, they protect and care for one another ‚Äî the kind of simple, idyllic life that can never last.

 










It doesn't take long for the chief to come calling for his strongest soldier, and Ka'iana doesn't require much prodding to pick up a spear once again. He is, after all, afraid ‚Äî afraid his people will be ruled over by the wrong man or, worse yet, controlled by outside forces. Is Maui's current chief, Ka'iana's uncle Kahekili (Temuera Morrison), the right leader? His previous war was driven by greed and cost hundreds of lives, Ka'iana's father among them, but Kahekili claims to have learned from his mistakes and now only wants what's best for the islands.

Doubts and suspicions aside, the uncle and nephew agree on one thing: A united Hawaii is needed to protect their people and culture. But joining forces isn't so easy. Maui is one of four kingdoms that make up Hawaii in the late 18th century, each with their own chief and each trapped in a ‚Äúcycle of endless war.‚Äù Not only does each island chief cherish their power, but most of the islanders are waiting for a chosen one to rise up and lead them. The ‚Äúprophecy‚Äù has gone unfulfilled for generations, and whether that means someone needs to seize the hands of fate themselves or continue waiting is a matter of interpretation, and thus, contention.

‚ÄúChief of War‚Äù shares plenty with last year's blockbuster historical epic, ‚ÄúSh≈çgun.‚Äù Co-creators Momoa and Thomas Pa'a Sibbett ‚Äî who, per a note sent to reporters, are ‚Äúdirect descendants of characters in this series‚Äù ‚Äî illustrate an in-depth appreciation of indigenous customs. Told with a predominantly Polynesian cast, who speak in native Hawaiian throughout the season, the Apple TV+ original spends ample time observing their characters' peaceful traditions and portrays their sun-drenched haven with consistent reverence. 

 










But ‚ÄúChief of War‚Äù is also an action series, and despite its other attributes ‚Äî the costumes are magnificent, the environments vivid, and performances strong (shout-out to newcomer Kaina Makua, an instantly endearing screen presence) ‚Äî the action takes precedence. While mostly for the better, there are a few drawbacks. For one, ‚ÄúChief of War‚Äù lacks the emotional nuance of ‚ÄúSh≈çgun.‚Äù Side plots largely go underdeveloped, including a few emotionally weight-bearing romantic and platonic relationships. (Momoa is technically caught in a love triangle, but it's hard to care how it shakes out, just as his friendship with Tony, a European sailor, never quite blossoms into its intended bromance.) Despite opening titles reminiscent of ‚ÄúSh≈çgun‚Äù (and thus ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù) that depict the grand expanse of the series' vision, Momoa, Sibbett, and showrunner Doug Jung (‚ÄúDark Blue‚Äù) don't bounce between islands, developing different arcs within each kingdom, so much as they remain laser-focused on the big, burgeoning war.

A similarly single-minded approach could weigh down a show with less momentum, but ‚ÄúChief of War‚Äù has such a strong engine ‚Äî in Momoa, his character, and their shared daring ‚Äî it rarely feels slow or stagnant. For as hellbent as Ka'iana is on protecting his paradise, he's not immune to change. Various events beyond his control force him to expand his perspective and shift his positions. Momoa handles each challenge with his trademark blend of tenacity and grace (and to much greater effect than his last Apple effort, the widely unseen ‚ÄúSee‚Äù). He can embody the vicious, hulking brute one minute, only to pivot into a vulnerable, slack-shouldered paragon of virtue the next. He is both bear and teddy bear at once, and Momoa's ability to sell each extreme makes for a commanding turn.

 










That being said, for as affecting as his quieter scenes can be, Momoa's berserk embodiment of Ka'iana's action scenes can't be overstated. The show starts ‚Äî starts ‚Äî with Momoa lassoing a shark underwater, and that's when Ka'iana is still living in peace. As his ever-expanding set of physical skills is called on more and more often, in more and more demanding scenarios ‚Äî a feat of strength here, a clash of kingdoms there ‚Äî Momoa sets his long-repressed warrior loose, one unhinged grunt, roar, or scream at a time. When the finale (which Momoa also directs) introduces the long-hyped battle royale, it sure seems like Ka'iana's fury road has run its course. And yet, there he goes again, unveiling even more eye-popping extravagance than many have dared to imagine.

In a note sent to media, Momoa and Sibbett said after seeing ‚Äúthe image of Hawaii [‚Ä¶] packaged, sold, and resold, promising paradise for the price of a plane ticket,‚Äù they set out to make ‚ÄúChief of War‚Äù as their homeland's ‚Äúreintroduction to the world. It is Hawaii's story, told from a Hawaiian point of view.‚Äù

Ka'iana, based on the real Hawaiian warrior, is the main window for that perspective, and the series relies on the tension created by his continued calls for peace and how clearly he's drawn to war. Not only are we watching to see what happens to Hawaii (a predetermined fate, even if Season 1 illustrates the value of bearing witness), but we're watching to see if an honorable man can wield his demons for the greater good, or if by giving into them, he's perpetuating the same endless cycle of war he seeks to break. Men have been using violence to beget nonviolence for centuries, and they continue to insist on its effectiveness to this day. But is it ever really the way?

 










This, too, may end up a predictable dilemma, but it's a relatable one, too ‚Äî and an effective way to galvanize ‚ÄúChief of War.‚Äù Ka'iana does not want to fight, but when he lets slip the dogs of war, the havoc proves as terrifying as it is astonishing. 

‚ÄúChief of War‚Äù premieres Friday, August 1, with two episodes. New episodes will be released weekly through the Season 1 finale on September 19.

The 2007 buddy comedy was one of Franco's first onscreen roles.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Dave Franco is sharing how his Superbad role turned into one of his most embarrassing moments, on- and offscreen, and actually pushed him to keep auditioning.


	In the 2007 buddy comedy starring Jonah Hill and Michael Cera, Franco makes a small appearance as Greg the Soccer Player, one of his first onscreen roles. In one of his scenes, Hill's Seth calls out his character for peeing his pants years prior.




	Not only was it an embarrassing scene, Franco revealed during a recent appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast, but it also led to a lot of embarrassing fan interactions in public, with people quoting the lines.

	‚ÄúI had a journey with that scene in and of itself, where I only have a few lines in this movie, but the movie was so big that people did recognize me on the street,‚Äù the Together actor explained to host Alex Cooper. ‚ÄúAnd they were yelling at me, ‚ÄòWhy don't you go piss your pants again?'‚Äù

	However, Franco leveraged those awkward moments as motivation to keep auditioning so that his legacy as an actor wouldn't be that one Superbad scene. ‚ÄúI quickly realized, ‚ÄòI gotta keep working and get more jobs, so I'm not piss boy for the rest of my life,'‚Äù the actor said.


	Franco went on to star in dozens more films, including 21 Jump Street, Now You See Me, Neighbors, Now You See Me 2, Nerve, Love Lies Bleeding and, most recently, Together, alongside his wife, Alison Brie.

	











Superbad follows two co-dependent high school seniors who are forced to deal with separation anxiety after their plan to stage a booze-soaked party goes awry.

Catherine Zeta-Jones stepped back into full Morticia Addams mode for the ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù season 2, Part 1 premiere‚Äîand did so with dramatic flair. Attending the red carpet event in London on July 30, the 54-year-old actress turned heads in a vampy black gown that gave gothic glamour a sculptural upgrade.

The bold look featured a plunging chest cutout that dipped to her midriff, paired with a thigh-high slit and an open back with a keyhole design. Sculpted 3D mesh ruffles added dramatic flare to the gown, bringing movement and Morticia-worthy edge to the overall silhouette. Zeta-Jones finished the look with fishnet heels, a sleek ballerina bun, bold smoky eyes, a deep plum lip, and glittering spider-inspired ear cuffs that tied the whole gothic glam together.

She joined co-stars including Jenna Ortega, Luis Guzm√°n and Fred Armisen at Westminster's Central Hall, where the cast gathered ahead of the show's return to Netflix. Ortega opted for a nude snakeskin-print gown, while Zeta-Jones leaned fully into her character's dark feminine energy‚Äîmarking a return to the haunting glamour fans have come to expect.

Just days earlier, Zeta-Jones surprised fans with a completely different aesthetic during the ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù season 2 photo call at London's Natural History Museum. On July 28, she traded in her signature gothic gowns for a fashion-forward silver power suit that looked plucked straight out of ‚ÄúEmily in Paris‚Äù, per InStyle.

Her tailored blazer and plunging blouse combo was styled with wide-leg trousers and towering dove gray platform heels by Le Silla. Zeta-Jones accessorized the outfit with black riding gloves featuring silver chain accents, silver cross earrings, and a black fishnet beret. With soft curls, a smoky eye, and a deep plum lip, she struck a balance between polished and edgy.

During this week's press events, Zeta-Jones proved her style versatility, effortlessly moving between gothic glam and chic European tailoring.

Zeta-Jones' premiere tour arrives just ahead of ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù season 2's two-part debut on Netflix. Part 1 of the hit Tim Burton series premieres August 6, followed by Part 2 on September 3. The show, led by Jenna Ortega, returns after its massive season 1 success, which earned over 252 million views and 12 Emmy nominations.

This season teases a darker tone, focusing on a chilling vision Wednesday has of her roommate Enid's death‚Äîan event she believes she may be responsible for. New cast members include Billie Piper, Steve Buscemi, Owen Painter, and Lady Gaga in a yet-to-be-revealed role. 

The new season reportedly promises expanded family dynamics, more horror, and a deeper look into Wednesday's relationship with her mother. A spinoff series centered around Uncle Fester is also in development.

The song comes more than a year after she first premiered it at Gov Ball 2024.

	Hannah Dailey



	Stand clear of the closing doors, please. Chappell Roan‚Äòs ‚ÄúThe Subway‚Äù has finally pulled into the platform.


	After more than a year since she debuted the track at her 2024 Governor's Ball set ‚Äî for which she was in full green body paint for Statue of Liberty cosplay ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Subway‚Äù finally dropped on streaming services Thursday (July 31). Fans are well-acquainted with the song at this point, as the pop star often plays it at her live shows, but now, they'll have an official studio recording to listen to at last.


	On the lovelorn ballad about experiencing heartache in New York City, Roan eagerly awaits the day she'll have finally moved on from her ex. ‚ÄúIt's just another day/ And it's not over 'til it's over,‚Äù she sings before belting cathartically on the outro: ‚ÄúShe's got, she's got a way/ She's got a way, she's got a way.‚Äù

	‚ÄúThe Subway‚Äù comes a few months after Roan dropped ‚ÄúThe Giver,‚Äù which reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. Before that came breakout single ‚ÄúGood Luck, Babe!,‚Äù which catapulted the Missouri native to superstar status last year following the release of debut album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.


			Trending on Billboard		







	Roan has since hinted that she's gearing up to start work on her sophomore effort, but not before she plays a string of pop-up shows in Los Angeles, Kansas City and New York City. ‚ÄúI love these three cities so much + wanted the chance to do something special before going away to write the next album,‚Äù she wrote on Instagram in July. ‚ÄúI truly cannot wait to see you.‚Äù

      I have some questions for JD Vance for whoever is interviewing him next on this topic:
    


      What type of shenanigans is his mentor Peter Thiel up to with Sean Kirkpatrick/Enigma Labs/promoting/debunking this topic? Why does it seem like he supports disclosure and against disclosure at the same time? What are his actual intentions here?
    


      If JD Vance is so interested in this topic, ask him why he doesn't publicly support the bipartisan UAP Disclosure Act that was just introduced in the Senate. And maybe prevent House Republicans like Mike Johnson/Mike Turner/Mike Roberts from blocking it again this time.

Mama June Shannon is in the hospital just shortly after a psychic warned her about future health troubles.

On the July 25 episode of Mama June: Family Crisis, the 45-year-old met with a psychic with daughter Jessica Shannon and husband Justin Stroud for Jessica's bachelorette party. During the session, the psychic told June that she's "lost a lot of her health‚Äù and is carrying a lot of stress, which isn't good. The psychic added that she "may have a heart attack" because of it.

Justin suggests taking June to the hospital but she refuses. But as the pain continued, she said she feels like she's "about to throw up" and a producer agrees that they should go get medical attention.

‚ÄúIt is way worse than it has ever been,‚Äù June said as they got in the car to go to the emergency room.

Doctors later "determined that ovarian cysts are causing her severe pain" and June is now ‚Äúconsidering her treatment options.‚Äù

Ovarian cysts are common; the Mayo Clinic states that "many women have ovarian cysts at some time," and most "present little or no discomfort and are harmless."

However, large or ruptured cysts "can cause serious symptoms," including severe pelvic pain and bleeding, fullness or heaviness in the abdomen and bloating. In rare cases, a ruptured ovarian cyst may require surgery.

Many celebrities have revealed their painful experiences with ovarian cysts, including Hailey Bieber, Marsai Martin, Kate Beckinsale, Hilary Swank, Lena Dunham, Olivia Culpo, Miley Cyrus and more.

Mama June: Family Crisis airs Fridays at 8 p.m. ET on WeTV.

‚ÄúWhen you repeat them back to him, even he can't understand what you're saying,‚Äù the NBC host says

The Trump administration claimed this week that thousands of documents relating to the 2016 investigation into the president's ties to Russia were found in ‚Äúburn bags‚Äù at the CIA. However, when Trump himself was asked about them, he had no idea what one reporter was talking about. And that, according to Seth Meyers, just proves ‚Äúhow confusing‚Äù Trump's ‚Äúbulls‚Äìt conspiracy theories‚Äù are.

During a press briefing at The White House on Wednesday, a journalist simply asked for Trump's thoughts on the ‚Äúburn bags‚Äù FBI director Kash Patel says he found, but the president was visibly confused at the question.

‚ÄúI don't know that,‚Äù Trump replied. ‚ÄúI don't know, I don't know what you mean by that statement.‚Äù

When the reporter clarified that it literally meant bags of documents, Trump said he thought she meant that Patel ‚Äúappointed a man named Burn Bag.‚Äù Naturally, Meyers cringed at that.

‚ÄúOh, dude, don't admit that,‚Äù the comedian said. ‚ÄúJust say, ‚ÄòI couldn't hear you.' Don't tell the world you are off by a country mile.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's how confusing Trump's bulls‚Äìt conspiracy theories are,‚Äù Meyers added shortly therafter. ‚ÄúWhen you repeat them back to him, even he can't understand what you're saying.‚Äù

That said, the late night host has a guess at why Trump struggled so much to understand. To kick off the ‚ÄúA Closer Look‚Äù segment, Meyers poked fun at the president's age, reminding viewers that he is 79. The NBC host noted that it's been easy to forget, ‚Äúbecause he was often next to someone who was really old, but he's still old.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can just see his age getting to him,‚Äù Meyers said. ‚ÄúHe can't hear or understand reporters' questions anymore, even when those reporters are trying to tee him up by parroting his own bulls‚Äìt back to him.‚Äù

You can watch Seth Meyers' full ‚ÄúA Closer Look‚Äù segment in the video above.

It's been over a year since Psychic Fever from Exile Tribe dropped their hit song Just Like Dat, and AsiaOne recently caught up with the Japanese boy band to find out how their journey has been since.

The Just Like Dat music video, which premiered in January 2024, has amassed over 20 million views on YouTube and youngest member Weesa, 21, said they didn't expect the virality.

"It made us happy to see it create buzz on social media platforms like TikTok. When we went overseas, we were really happy fans could sing along to our song," he added.

The song was well-received internationally and on TikTok, netizens covered the song under the hashtag #JustLikeDatChallenge.

 

@psyfe_official #JustLikeDatChallenge #JustLikeDat üôå #PSYCHICFEVER #99_9_Psychic_Radio #99_9MHz ‚ô¨ Just Like Dat feat. JP THE WAVY - PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE

 

Formed in 2019, the seven-member group - consisting of Tsurugi, Ryoga Nakanishi, Ren Watanabe, Jimmy, Kokoro Kohatsu, Ryushin Handa and Weesa - had a few pre-debut releases before their official debut in July 2022 with the album P.C.F.

Ryoga, 27, recalled how they spent six months training in Thailand right after their debut.

"We faced many challenges there but it was a valuable experience for us. We learned a lot of things which helped us go global," he said.

J-pop has been having a resurgence of sorts in recent years, and when asked how they felt being part of this new wave, Kokoro, who turns 25 in November, added how they debuted with the main goal of going global.

Now that they have - the group has toured Asia, Europe and the US the past year - he said they hope to become a leading music group while preserving their individual styles.

The group recently released their EP Psychic File III, and while the title track Gelato is a catchy summer tune, it's only a peek at what Psychic Fever has to offer.

"In this EP we have four songs and each one is in a different genre, so I think it can be enjoyed by people of all ages," said Ryushin, who turns 24 in Deccember.

The song he recommends? Reflection.

"It has our usual style but also a different way of expression. Please pay attention to the lyrics and choreography as well," he added.

Meanwhile, Tsurugi's pick is Evolve.

"When you listen to this track, you can really feel the energy we bring to our live shows. More than anything, it excites me everytime I hear it, so it's definitely one of my favourite songs," said the 28-year-old.

Having spent so much time touring the past year, we wanted to know what they've learnt about each other.

The question though, was met with seven loading buttons.

At one point, Ren, 25, seemed to be thinking up an answer and after a few minutes of the members waiting for his thoughts, he gave up and facepalmed.

Ever-so-motherly Ryoga stepped up with a response: "We spent a lot of time together during our US tour and I got to see who wakes up the earliest and how a member eats their breakfast.

"Through spending more time together, I was able to see how they motivate themselves for the live shows."

When there's a mix of introverts and extroverts in the group, one person would usually take the lead and initiative. For Psychic Fever, that's 25-year-old Jimmy.

"He's usually the one who does research about the places we want to go to," shared Ryoga.

Social media feeds across Australia were alight with footage of what people thought were UFOs flying over Queensland and northern New South Wales on 30 July. 

But experts say what people actually saw was a Chinese rocket as it passed over Australia.

Professor Jonti Horner was able to match the sightings from his home state with a Long March 8A rocket launch from Hainan. The rockets are used to launch satellites for China's state-owned internet network into space.
