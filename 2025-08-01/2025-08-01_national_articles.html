Constitutional Accountability Center President Elizabeth Wydra and constitutional attorney Mark Smith weigh in on how the Supreme Court limiting nationwide injunctions on federal judges will impact the birthright citizenship ruling. A federal appeals court will hear oral arguments Friday afternoon in a challenge to President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship in the U.S., one of several lower court cases that took shape after the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in June. Justices narrowed when lower courts can issue so-called "universal injunctions" blocking the president's orders from taking effect nationwide. Supreme Court justices attend President Donald Trump's inauguration at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 20, 2025. Instead, the language put forth by the Trump administration, and subsequently blocked, would have clarified that individuals born to illegal immigrant parents, or those who were here legally but on temporary non-immigrant visas, are not citizens by birthright. So far, the administration hasn't found much success there. A federal judge in New Hampshire issued a nationwide injunction last month blocking Trump's order from taking force, and certified as a class all infants born in the U.S. who would be denied citizenship under the order. Arguments before the First Circuit come just one week after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals also blocked Trump's birthright citizenship order from taking force nationwide. Demonstrators holds up a banner during a citizenship rally outside of the Supreme Court in Washington, May 15, 2025. "The district court below concluded that a universal preliminary injunction is necessary to provide the states with complete relief," U.S. "We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a universal injunction in order to give the states complete relief." Olga Urbina and her 9 months son Ares Webster participate in a protest outside the US Supreme Court over President Donald Trump's move to end birthright citizenship as the court hears arguments over the order in Washington, DC, on May 15, 2025. It's unclear how judges on the First Circuit will rule. But their oral arguments come days after the Trump administration detailed new specifics on how it plans to enforce its order in question. Guidance from roughly half a dozen U.S. agencies outlines these new requirements for parents. One document published by the Social Security Administration outlines new requirements parents will need to meet to prove their child is a U.S. citizen at birth. "With respect to citizenship, an SSN applicant may currently demonstrate U.S. citizenship by providing a birth certificate showing a U.S. place of birth," a document from SSA said. "Once the EO takes effect, a birth certificate showing a U.S. place of birth will not be sufficient documentary evidence of U.S. citizenship for persons born after the EO takes effect." More than 22 U.S. states and immigrants' rights groups have sued the Trump administration to block the change to birthright citizenship, arguing in court filings that the executive order is both unconstitutional and "unprecedented." And to date, no court has sided with the Trump administration's executive order seeking to ban birthright citizenship, though multiple district courts have blocked it, including in wake of the Supreme Court ruling, from taking effect.

(Angela Peterson/Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel via AP, Pool, File) Adrianna Reams, sister of Sade Carleen Robinson, gives an emotional victim impact statement before the sentencing of Maxwell Anderson on Friday, Aug. 1 2025, in Milwaukee County Court in Milwaukee. MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Milwaukee man who killed a 19-year-old college student on their first date and spread her body parts around the area was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole. During a sentencing hearing that was by turns somber, emotional and horrifying, Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Laura Crivello repeatedly questioned how Anderson could commit such a heinous crime. Prosecutors related details of how Anderson cut up Robinson's body and dumped one of her legs near a playground. Robinson's mother, Sheena Scarbrough, said Anderson “messed the entire community up” and deserves no protection in prison. “No man should be able to live after what he did. First-degree intentional homicide in Wisconsin carries a mandatory life sentence. He argued that Anderson served in the U.S. Navy and suffers from obvious mental health issues. Cotton acknowledged that Anderson has been convicted of multiple misdemeanor disorderly conduct counts in connection with domestic violence but they're not significant offenses compared to most homicide defendants. Anderson told the judge that he's innocent and plans to appeal his convictions. He didn't elaborate, although Crivello later noted that Anderson had told an investigator that some stranger must have kidnapped Robinson after she left his apartment following their date. “I hope true justice will be delivered,” Anderson said Friday. Crivello refused to offer Anderson a chance at parole. She dismissed Anderson's claims of innocence, saying his view of reality “differs from the rest of the world.” Trailing off at times and shaking her head, she said he's irredeemable, called his crimes “unconscionable” and likened the case to something out of a horror novel. “It's beyond imaginable to not know whether your child is dead or alive, and then learn they're dismembered and disgraced, is beyond understanding,” she said. She also sentenced Anderson to 7 1/2 years on the dismemberment count and a year and a half on the arson charge. Online court records indicate she dismissed the fourth count of hiding a corpse on Friday after Cotton argued Anderson can't be convicted of both mutilating and hiding a corpse. Surveillance video and cellphone text and tracking records show they spent the late afternoon and early evening of April 1 drinking at two bars before heading back to Anderson's apartment. Prosecutors have argued she was incapacitated and couldn't resist. Surveillance video shows her car leaving his apartment early on the morning of April 2 and arriving at a park along the Lake Michigan shoreline. Prosecutors maintain that's where he cut her body into pieces. He later burned her car behind an abandoned building and took a bus home. Searchers discovered one of Robinson's legs in the park and her other leg and a foot near a playground close to where he burned the car. A human torso and an arm believed to be Robinson's remains washed up on a beach in suburban South Milwaukee. This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the mother's name to Scarbrough, not Scarborough.</p>

Former President Joe Biden appeared to slur and stumble through multiple parts of his speech July 31, 2025, in Chicago. Former President Joe Biden touted appointing Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court, during a slur-filled speech at the National Bar Association's 100th annual gala at the Hyatt in Chicago Thursday evening — just hours after one of his top aides testified before the Republican House Oversight Committee for their investigation into the former president's fitness for office. Likewise, Biden said he also selected demographically diverse judges during his administration. Former President Joe Biden said he also selected demographically diverse judges during his administration. "I promised to have an administration that looked like America and appoint a bench that looked like America," Biden said. "Justice Jackson, as you witnessed earlier this week, has proven herself to have the wisdom and the character that I saw in her when I nominated her. Appointed 13 Black women to the Courts of Appeals of the United States Federal Court, more than every other president in American history combined," he said. Then-President Joe Biden listens as Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson speaks during an event on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., on April 8, 2022. The National Bar Association originally formed in Iowa before Black attorneys were permitted to join the American Bar Association, and is now made up of 66,000 members working in law who advocate for civil rights and diversity. Those who attended the event included Jackson, as well as Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, MSNBC pundit Joy-Ann Reid and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Biden and his allies have faced allegations of concealing the truth about Biden's mental fitness while in office, following his debate performance against President Donald Trump on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, where Biden struggled to answer seemingly basic questions. Then-President Joe Biden appeared frail and struggled with a raspy voice during the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign against then-former President Donald Trump in Atlanta on June 27, 2024. Multiple books have been written in 2025 detailing Biden's final days in office, his deteriorating mental faculties and challenges within the Democratic Party as a result of his decision to withdraw from the election. Additionally, several investigations are ongoing on Capitol Hill concerning Biden's mental decline. For example, the House Oversight Committee is examining the cover-up of Biden's cognitive decline and potentially unauthorized executive actions taken during his presidency. Earlier Thursday, longtime Biden aide Michael Donilon appeared before the House Oversight Committee and told lawmakers that he could have raked in a total of $8 million if Biden had won re-election in 2024, Axios first reported. Fox News Digital reached out to Biden's spokesperson for comment and has not yet received a reply. Fox News' Charlie Creitz and Alex Schemmel contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Protesters chant slogans while demonstrating against the closure of the trans youth clinic at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, July 3, 2025, in Los Angeles. Liv Y., center, holds a transgender pride flag as people gather to protest against the Trump administration and Project 2025 near the Washington State Capitol building, in in Olympia, Wash., Feb. 5, 2025. Seventeen Democratic officials accused President Donald Trump's administration of unlawfully intimidating health care providers into stopping gender-affirming care for transgender youth in a lawsuit filed Friday. The latest announcement came Thursday from UI Health in Chicago. Trump's administration announced in July that it was sending subpoenas to providers and focusing on investigating them for fraud. It later boasted in a news release that hospitals are halting treatments. The Democratic officials say Trump's policies are an attempt to impose a nationwide ban on the treatment for people under 19 — and that's unlawful because there's no federal statute that bans providing the care to minors. “The federal government is running a cruel and targeted harassment campaign against providers who offer lawful, lifesaving care to children,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. Since 2021, 28 states with Republican-controlled legislatures have adopted policies to ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have a right to enforce those laws. At least seven other major hospitals and health systems have made similar announcements, including Children's National in Washington D.C., UChicago Medicine and Yale New Haven Health. Kaiser Permanente, which operates in California and several other states, said it would pause gender-affirming surgeries for those under 19 as of the end of August, but would continue hormone therapy. Connecticut Children's Medical Center cited “an increasingly complex and evolving landscape” for winding down care. Other hospitals, including Penn State, had already made similar decisions since Trump returned to office in January. Trump devoted a lot of attention to transgender people in his campaign last year as part of a growing pushback from conservatives as transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance on some fronts. On his inauguration day in January, Trump signed an executive order defining the sexes as only male and female for government purposes, setting the tone for a cascade of actions that affect transgender people. But the American Medical Association says that gender is on a spectrum, and the group opposes policies that restrict access to gender-affirming health care. Gender-affirming care includes a range of medical and mental health services to support a person's gender identity, including when it's different from the sex they were assigned at birth. It includes counseling and treatment with medications that block puberty, and hormone therapy to produce physical changes, as well as surgery, which is rare for minors. In March, a judge paused enforcement of the ban on government spending for care. In April, Attorney General Pam Bondi directed government investigators to focus on providers who continue to offer gender-affirming care for transgender youth. “Under my leadership, the Department of Justice will bring these practices to an end,” she wrote. In May, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a report discouraging medical interventions for transgender youth and instead focusing solely on talk therapy. In June, a Justice Department memo called for prioritizing civil investigations of those who provide the treatment. In July, Justice Department announced it had sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics involved in gender-affirming care for youth, saying they were part of investigations of health care fraud, false statements and other possible wrongdoing. And in a statement last week, the White House celebrated decisions to end gender-affirming care, which it called a “barbaric, pseudoscientific practice” Kristen Salvatore's 15-year-old child started hormone therapy late last year at Penn State Health. Salvatore said in an interview with The Associated Press before the lawsuit was announced that it was a major factor in reduced signs of anxiety and depression. Salvatore has been struggling to find a place that's not hours away from their Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, home that would provide the hormones and accept Medicaid coverage. The family has enough testosterone stockpiled to last until January. But if they can't find a new provider by then, Salvatore's child could risk detransitioning, she said.</p>

The Israeli Defense Force released video on Tuesday they claim shows Hamas terrorists operating inside a UNRWA base near Rafah. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) that provides aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, determining that the agency needs to be abolished and is beyond reform. According to a U.S. State Department public assessment to Congress that was independently obtained by Fox News Digital, "The Administration has determined UNRWA is irredeemably compromised and now seeks its full dismantlement." The individuals identified by the Israel Defense Forces as combatants are seen carrying firearms and interacting with U.N.-branded vehicles. According to the State Department document, the Trump administration demanded in March 2025 that UNRWA "return all remaining unspent balances of U.S. funding in its accounts." In May, the State Department said it is working "to cease U.S. participation in all working-level UNRWA bodies" at the United Nations. The Biden administration had given UNRWA $1 billion in U.S. taxpayer funding since 2021 before the freeze in 2024 went into effect. Photos released by the Israeli Defense Forces show three individuals that the Israeli military claims are Hamas terrorists inside a UNRWA compound in Rafah. Former Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said in February 2024 that dozens of individuals employed by UNRWA were directly involved in the atrocities carried out against Israeli civilians on Oct. 7. Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon told the U.N. in January that UNRWA must close its operations in Jerusalem. In August 2024, Fox News Digital reported the U.N. fired nine employees from UNRWA who likely participated in the Hamas slaughter of 1,200 people, including more than 30 Americans, on Oct. 7 in southern Israel. Israel's Knesset (Parliament) overwhelmingly banned UNRWA because of its reported support for Hamas terrorism. The U.S. has classified Hamas as a foreign terrorist organization. Israel, U.S. lawmakers, and watchdog organizations have also provided evidence to the U.N. over the years that UNRWA glorifies Palestinian terrorism and antisemitism.

The Mayflower, a British pub in London, Wednesday, July 23, 2025. The Mayflower, a British pub in London, Wednesday, July 23, 2025. LONDON (AP) — On a charming cobblestone street tucked away in London's East End, a pub proudly hangs out a sign that reads “Oldest riverside pub in London.” Across the Thames River, a pub with a different name makes the same bold claim. The two contenders can be found along a quiet stretch of the Thames, far from the city's crowded souvenir shops and tourist sites, serving up traditional British dishes — from steak and ale pie to sticky toffee pudding — with a side of history. Though it only got its name in 1957, it is said to have some of the ship's original timbers incorporated into its structure. Today, pubgoers who can prove direct descent from one of the Mayflower passengers can sign its “Descendants Book.” The Mayflower, a British pub in London, Wednesday, July 23, 2025. Every night, tourists step out of black cabs at the doors of the two pubs, trading the capital's modern skyscrapers for the storied streets of London's East End, lined with quaint terraced houses and red brick warehouses. In both pubs they enter spaces where old paintings hanging on dark paneled walls and other mementos of their histories seem to leave the contemporary world behind. “There really is a feeling that you might have stepped back in time and could be drinking beer with sailors or pirates or anybody from any Dickens novels really,” said Emily Godwin, a Londoner who has been to both. She spoke while sipping a pint of lager with friends at the Prospect on a recent summer evening. It “feels like such a pocket of history in London,” Godwin said. “So much of London's East End feels very new and trendy, and the Prospect feels like it's barely changed.” The Prospect of Whitby, a British pub in London, Wednesday, July 23, 2025. British pubs have always been at the center of social life, with locals coming together over a pint, even in times of war and economic hardship. This year an estimated 378 venues are set to shutter across England, Wales, and Scotland, according to the British Beer and Pub Association. “When a pub closes, it puts people out of a job, deprives communities of their heart and soul and hurts the local economy,” said Emma McClarkin, head of the BBPA. History is a big draw for pubgoers, with a trip to a traditional British pub coming in high on tourists' London bucket lists, raising the stakes of the Prospect and the Mayflower's competition. The Mayflower, a British pub in London, Wednesday, July 23, 2025. The Prospect claims it was established in 1520, with its original flagstone surviving an arson attack in 1666 — the same year as the Great Fire of London. “This rebuild held and continues to hold on for dear life,” he said. But there are no hard feelings between the pubs as Billington described their competition as a “loving rivalry.” “We compete against each other to be the oldest, and to serve the best food and drink,” he said. Guinness World Records said it has not formally awarded the title because of the complexities created by numerous name changes, relocations and reconstructions. “There are lots of very old pubs that might make a claim to being oldest, but it could be contested because it could be argued they weren't always in ‘London,'” English historian and author Jacob Field said. “Many pubs have changed name over time, making it hard to claim they are the oldest.”</p>

The pressure down there is so immense that even submersibles supposedly built for those conditions can, as we know, tragically fail. Now imagine taking a sub nearly three times deeper. That's what an international team of scientists did last summer. They reached a depth of more than 31,000 feet. The researchers weren't looking for a shipwreck. They were interested in what else might be lurking on the seafloor in trenches so deep that no light can reach them. It was there that they found something remarkable: an entire ecosystem of animals, living in the darkness. Even more incredibly, those animals — and the animals they eat — derive energy not from sunlight but from chemical reactions. Through a process called chemosynthesis, deep-sea microbes turn chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide into organic compounds, including sugars, forming the base of the food chain. Aboard a deep-sea vessel called Fendouzhe, which was equipped with cameras and lights, the researchers encountered abundant wildlife communities, including fields of marine tube worms peppered with white marine snails. The worms have a symbiotic relationship with chemosynthetic bacteria that live in their bodies. Those bacteria provide them with a source of nutrients in exchange for, among other things, a stable place to live. Similar to the tube worms, the clams depend on bacteria within their shells to turn chemical compounds like methane and hydrogen sulfide that are present in the deep sea into food. Du declined to comment on whether the expedition had anything to do with the potential for deep-sea mining in this region. “Diving in the submersible was an extraordinary experience — like traveling through time,” Du told Vox by email. “Each descent transported me to a new deep-sea realm. Unlike other deep-sea ecosystems — which feed on dead animals and other organic bits that fall from shallower waters — these trench communities are likely sustained in part by methane produced by microbes buried under the seafloor, the authors said. “The presence of these chemosynthetic ecosystems challenge long-standing assumptions about life's potential at extreme depths,” Du said. Update, August 1, 10 am ET: This story was originally published on July 30 and has been updated to include more details shared by a researcher involved in the expedition. These (literal) thirst traps are helping wild animals beat the heat. What budget cuts mean for wildlife, climate monitoring — and surviving peak tourism. They were already on the edge of extinction. The Endangered Species Act has a major problem.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History last month removed a board that referenced President Donald Trump's two impeachments from an exhibit on the American presidency. Unmentioned in the statement was Trump's executive order earlier this year that appeared crafted to direct the Smithsonian to soften or distort forthright discussions about certain aspects of American history, which could include the legacy of racism in the United States and parts of Trump's own history-making but controversial first term. He was acquitted both times by the Senate. In September 2021, the Smithsonian placed a board over the exhibit which read: “Case under redesign (history happens*)” and referenced Trump's two impeachments. “On December 18, 2019, the House impeached Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,” the reference to Trump's first impeachment read. “On January 13, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached twice,” the reference to his second impeachment read. Because Trump's term ended on January 20, his acquittal on February 13 made him the first former president tried by the Senate.” The statement added: “A large permanent gallery like The American Presidency that opened in 2000, requires significant amount of time and funding to update and renew. A future and updated exhibit will include all impeachments.” Asked about the removal of references to Trump's impeachment, a White House spokesperson said in a statement, “Unfortunately for far too long the Smithsonian museums have highlighted divisive, DEI exhibits which are out of touch with mainstream America.” “We are fully supportive of updating displays to highlight American greatness,” spokesperson Davis Ingle said. “The Trump administration will continue working to ensure that the Smithsonian removes all improper ideology and once again unites and instills pride in all Americans regarding our great history.” Trump's order aimed at the Smithsonian is just one example of his efforts to exert his influence on American cultural, athletic and artistic institutions and browbeat them into eliminating aspects of their work.</p>

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — An appeals court in Bosnia-Herzegovina confirmed Friday an earlier court ruling that sentenced the pro-Russia Bosnian Serb president, Milorad Dodik, to one year in prison and banned him from politics for six years over his separatist actions as tensions mount in the fragile Balkan state. He said he is not surprised by the verdict, which he called “a clear political decision” orchestrated by Bosnian Muslims in collaboration with the European Union. “I expect complete support from Serbia, we will turn to Russia for support, we will write a letter to the new U.S. administration,” Dodik said. The EU said in a brief statement that the “verdict is binding and must be respected.” Dodik has repeatedly called for the separation of the Serb-run half of Bosnia to join Serbia, which prompted the former U.S. administration to impose sanctions against him and his allies. Dodik was also accused of corruption and pro-Russia policies. Dodik's separatist threats have stoked fears in Bosnia, where a 1992-95 war erupted when the country's Serbs rebelled against independence from the former Yugoslavia and moved to form a ministate with the aim of uniting it with Serbia. The U.S.-sponsored Dayton Accords ended the war and created two regions in Bosnia, Republika Srpska and the Bosniak-Croat Federation, which were given wide autonomy but kept some joint institutions, including the army, top judiciary and tax administration. Bosnia also has a rotating three-member presidency made up of Bosniak, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats. Dodik has repeatedly clashed with the top international envoy overseeing the peace, Christian Schmidt, and declared his decisions illegal in Republika Srpska.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roy Cooper (D) led Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley by 6 percentage points in the first major poll of the 2026 North Carolina Senate race. Nearly two-thirds of voters polled did not know or were unsure of Whatley, compared to just 16% for Cooper. “With over a year to go until the North Carolina U.S. Senate race, Whatley's low name recognition presents both a challenge and an opportunity, while only 17% view him favorably, nearly two-thirds of voters either don't know him or are unsure,” Emerson College Polling executive director Spencer Kimball said in a statement. In contrast, Cooper enters the race with significantly higher name recognition and a more favorable public image.” Polls are likely to get closer as the high-stakes matchup nears — 41.5% of voters said they'd support the Democrat in congressional races, and 41.3% said they'd support the Republican candidate. With the North Carolina Senate race set to be one of the most expensive of the 2026 cycle, nearly every voter will likely have an opinion about Whatley one way or another come November of next year. The two are competing to replace Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who announced he would not run for reelection amid clashes with President Donald Trump. Friday's poll largely vindicated his decision, giving him a paltry 30% approval rating, with 43% of voters viewing him unfavorably. “Senator Tillis' retirement aligns with his weak favorability: just 41% of Republican voters view him favorably, while 35% view him unfavorably,” Kimball said. Democrats view North Carolina as one of their most likely pickups in 2026.</p>

President Donald Trump's Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke with Fox News Digital at the National Governors Association (NGA) about her collaboration with state governors. Colorado Springs, Colo. – Despite Democrats protesting President Donald Trump's plan to dismantle the Department of Education, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said returning education to the states is a "nonpartisan issue." "I'm not getting push back, because if it were just Democrat states or Republican states that were doing well or doing poorly, that would be one thing, but it's many of the states on both sides of the aisle. That's why this is really a nonpartisan issue," McMahon explained in an exclusive interview at the National Governors Association (NGA) summer meeting. The Education Secretary participated in discussions with governors from both parties at the Colorado Springs, Colo., meeting, and her department announced the release of roughly $6.8 billion in previously frozen federal funds for K-12 programs ahead of her panel discussion with the outgoing NGA chair, Gov. Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke with Fox News Digital during the National Governors Association (NGA) summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Trump signed an executive order earlier this year to dismantle the Department of Education, fulfilling one of his key campaign promises during the 2024 presidential election. McMahon explained that returning education to the states "just means giving them back the part that is now provided by the federal government, and they're anxious for it." In a joint statement on behalf of the NGA, Polis and incoming NGA chair Gov. Kevin Stitt, R-Ok., said they were "thankful these bipartisan discussions with Secretary McMahon and other key officials during the NGA Summer Meeting led to the distribution of these education funds," adding that they are "proud our advocacy helped secure this vital support for states and districts." The Education Secretary, the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), explained to Fox News Digital that participating in events like NGA, having discussions with governors from both parties and visiting as many states as possible is critical to understanding America's diverse educational landscape. McMahon said she has already visited different types of schools, from charter schools to public schools, to learn the best practices across the country. National Governors Association (NGA) outgoing chair Gov. Jared Polis discusses America's education with Education Secretary Linda McMahon at the NGA Summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Friday, July 25, 2025. "Every state does have different needs," McMahon said. "There's no one size fits all, but what I hear with every governor and almost every educator coming in, is what we are stressing, which is literacy." A Department of Education report released earlier this year revealed that American students' reading skills have continued to decline since the COVID-19 pandemic, and their math skills have barely improved. Education Secretary Linda McMahon delivers remarks at the National Governors Association (NGA) summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Friday, July 25. And when asked how the Education Secretary would address teachers who are anxious about the dismantling the Department of Education, McMahon said she is focused on ensuring best practices are carried out nationwide, while empowering states to deliver for teachers' individual needs. "This is a win for teachers because governors are already talking about that teachers should be paid fairly, that they should be allowed to innovate in the classroom, that they shouldn't spend their time doing paperwork and regulatory compliance. They should be able to spend that time with the students." Deirdre Heavey is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 50,000 discrepancies have been discovered in the state of New York's voter registration rolls, including deceased registrants, placeholder or fictitious birthdates, and duplicate entries, according to an election security watchdog's findings shared with the Washington Examiner. Among the alarming revelations, the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a law firm focused on voting integrity, found 49,933 out-of-state double registrants, who are voters simultaneously registered in New York and at least one other U.S. state. PILF cross-referenced voting registration files for New York registrants who also appear on other state voter rolls. Based on comparative analysis between voter datasets, the majority of interstate duplicates came from Florida (24,873). PILF additionally detected 2,823 inter-county duplicates inside New York's statewide database, including 1,018 pairs marked as “active” registrants across multiple counties. At least 3,845 registrant records in New York were flagged for containing placeholder, potentially fake, or implausible dates of birth, such as “1850-01-01,” despite recent voting activity. According to PILF's investigation, six registrants had died as far back as 1998, yet remained actively registered on the rolls, while four registrants could not be matched to any known Social Security number or credit data at those addresses. PILF also identified 6,788 instances of duplicated and even triplicated registrants, in which duplications at identical residential addresses were generated. The PILF research team studied same-address duplicates along common causes of duplication, such as missing Social Security information, typographical errors (e.g., misspelling of names), hyphenated or married-name confusion, and nickname variations. Notably, missing or transposed Social Security numbers can stifle standard de-duplication procedures, PILF says. “These are critical failures that put election security at risk,” PILF president J. Christian Adams said in a statement. When the Washington Examiner contacted the New York State Board of Elections for comment, a public information officer confirmed receipt of PILF's letter and said counsel is reviewing it at this time. The results were similarly egregious, with PILF detecting 18,453 deceased registrants on Maine's voting rolls. The legal group is calling for greater transparency and collaboration with local election officials to fix these problems before out-of-date or inaccurate data affects future elections. “This is not just a New York issue,” PILF research director Logan Churchwell added. “Our work in multiple states proves that voter roll maintenance is falling behind across the country. PILF's letter looped in Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, and former PILF litigation counsel Maureen Riordan, now the DOJ's chief voting oversight officer. Reportedly, all states will eventually be contacted about their adherence to federal election regulations. At a hearing last week on voter roll maintenance standards at the House Administration Committee, which has oversight over federal elections, PILF's president advocated for full disclosure of voting data. “Without transparency, you can't know what's going on, and that's why it's so important,” Adams told the congressional committee. “For over 200 years, our republic has marched towards a fuller, freer system of governance, expanding access to the ballot for more and more Americans,” ranking member Rep. Joe Morelle (D-NY) said. “There was a time in America when both Republicans and Democrats would have both been in favor of cleaning dead voters from the rolls,” PILF communications director Douglas Blair told the Washington Examiner.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A number of key documents related to the “manufactured” Russiagate scandal are still heavily redacted or not yet declassified years later, despite efforts by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, among others, to make information about the start of the Trump collusion investigation public. As President Donald Trump's administration continues to release individual documents, here is some of the information that is still outstanding. FBI Director Kash Patel reportedly found thousands of sensitive Russigate-related documents hidden away in what he described as a secret room at the bureau, and among them was an annex to a special counsel report that the Trump administration declassified this week. Patel turned over the trove of documents to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who ultimately released the annex on Thursday. CIA Director John Ratcliffe is expected to declassify underlying intelligence, including the annex, used in Durham's investigation. In the summer of 2016, then-CIA Director John Brennan briefed then-President Barack Obama on intel that Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was concocting a scheme to tie Trump, her election opponent, to Russia. Ratcliffe, as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, declassified Brennan's handwritten notes, which documented that meeting. Former FBI Director James Comey and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper were also at the Brennan-Obama briefing. According to the heavily redacted meeting minutes, on July 28, 2016, Brennan's briefing disclosed a plan from one of Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisers “to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.” Clinton approved the plan, Durham found. The memorandum, containing many redactions, mentioned “an exchange” discussing Clinton's plan to tie Trump to Russia “as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.” The rapid release of records is exposing how top Obama administration officials advanced discredited Trump-Russia narratives during the 2016 presidential election while simultaneously neglecting to take procedural investigative steps against Hillary Clinton based on, in some instances, far more credible allegations. On July 23, Grassley and Rep. Rick Crawford (R-AR), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to Patel requesting that the FBI fully investigate “untapped information” they said the bureau ignored in its investigation of Clinton's usage of a private email server for official communications as secretary of state. According to the newly declassified Office of Inspector General findings, this “unevaluated material” that the lawmakers are seeking, concerning hacked State Department data, has been stored within several thumb drives inside a northern Virginia offshoot office of the FBI's Washington Field Office since 2018. “Literally, an entire collection of data, including ‘reports purporting to analyze or characterize intercepted U.S. communications' and information concerning ‘cyber intrusions into U.S. entities' were simply swept away into the dark confines of history – until now,” the lawmakers told Patel. The massive Senate Intelligence Committee report, now regarded as Russiagate gospel among establishment Democrats, still contains walls of redactions spanning a considerable percentage of the 1,313-page publication. Democrats are suddenly citing the congressional committee's report, which was about Russian election activities at large, not specifically the targeting of Trump, to affirm their Trump-Russia collusion claims. For instance, in Volume 5: Counterintelligence Threats and Vulnerabilities, the Senate Intelligence Committee introduced a new allegation suggesting that Russian-Ukrainian operative Konstantin Kilimnik, an associate of Trump 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort, “may have been connected” to the Russian military intelligence's hack and leak of Democratic Party material. In 2018, the FBI publicly released heavily redacted copies of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants targeting former Trump adviser Carter Page. To date, all four FISA warrant applications and accompanying approvals remain riddled with redactions. Also in 2020, a judge denied legal efforts to compel additional declassification of the Page documents. According to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order, the DOJ assessed that two of the FISA applications involved “insufficient predication to establish probable cause to believe that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power” and that court authorizations for the pair of warrants “were not valid.” Aside from one guilty plea ending in probation for a former FBI lawyer, no one has been held accountable for the FBI's misconduct in the FISA process, particularly the unlawful surveillance of Page using misleading and error-filled applications. Previously released FBI interview notes detailing the bureau's discussion with Steele and his business partner back in 2017 are also still redacted at pertinent parts. Buried below were significant, paragraph-length redactions related to Russian analyst Igor Danchenko, the “primary sub-source” for Steele's dossier, and how the anti-Trump dossier was assembled and accordingly disseminated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A California federal judge on Thursday delayed the end dates of temporary protected status designations previously reserved for an estimated 61,000 people from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal until the Department of Homeland Security revoked those deportation protections. The ruling represents a setback for the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda as it seeks to deport illegal immigrants and foreign nationals who have overstayed their time in the United States. U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson of San Francisco temporarily blocked the federal government from terminating the TPS protections and work permits for thousands of migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The TPS designations for an estimated 7,000 Nepalese were previously set to end Aug. 5, and those for 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans were set to lapse on Sept. 8. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem determined the deportation protections for those three groups of migrants, among others, were no longer necessary since conditions in their native countries have improved. For instance, Noem said earlier this month that Honduras “has taken all of the necessary steps to overcome the impacts of Hurricane Mitch” and that “Honduran citizens can safely return home.” Judge Thompson concluded the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their argument that Noem's decision to terminate TPS protections was motivated by “racial animus.” “In totality, Plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence demonstrating racial and discriminatory animus in support of their Fifth Amendment claim. In recent weeks, the DHS has revoked TPS designations for an estimated 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, 160,000 Ukrainians, and thousands more from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Several lawsuits are pending in federal courts.</p>
