                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'All my laps have been decent' - Norris fastest in both practice sessions Kimi Antonelli and team mate George Russell enjoyed a positive Friday with Mercedes ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix. Kimi Antonelli has claimed he is "getting the confidence back" with his Mercedes car after a positive Friday for the team ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend. The Italian rookie has endured a difficult spell recently in his maiden Formula 1 campaign, which has included just one points finish in the last seven races and he failed to make it beyond the first segment of Qualifying for both the Sprint and Grand Prix last time out in Belgium. Mercedes has reverted to an older specification of suspension for the race in Budapest, with the change seemingly producing an upturn in form for Antonelli as he claimed seventh ahead of team mate George Russell in FP1, before finishing 10th fastest later in the afternoon. "Still missing a little bit to the guys in front but I think we're working well, we've been changing the car a lot because obviously it felt like a big step with the old suspension. Long run was good in FP2, just the soft I had a bit of traffic last sector and the lap was not super clean but good feelings ahead of tomorrow." "It always feels good when you're a bit higher up the leaderboard," said the 27-year-old, who has taken one win this season in Canada. "Bit of a strange day, obviously the Aston Martins looked unusually fast today, they seemed to make a decent step forward. McLaren are obviously in a league of their own. "We just need to find that last little bit for it to start clicking again for us.</p>

'All my laps have been decent' - Norris fastest in both practice sessions

Yuki Tsunoda's future at Red Bull is far from assured, but the Japanese racer's performance in Spa offered some encouraging signs.

"I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong to be honest. I have to look harder. It's really, really hard to find the reason for what I'm doing so wrong to drive this slow."

That was Yuki Tsunoda after he finished last in the Austrian Grand Prix earlier this month. Up until that point, the Japanese racer had shown flashes of pace, like his P6 in the Miami Sprint, but his best finish for Red Bull in a Grand Prix  since stepping in for Liam Lawson from Suzuka onwards is P9.

In that same period, his team mate and reigning world champion Max Verstappen had secured two wins and two second places.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arriving into this weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix with a 16-point lead over team mate Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri is feeling confident in himself when it comes to the championship fight. Oscar Piastri has admitted that he has “a lot of confidence” in himself when it comes to his chances of winning the World Championship, though the Australian also suggested “it's not going to be easy” amid close competition from team mate Lando Norris. After Norris closed the gap by taking back-to-back victories in Austria and Great Britain, Piastri strengthened his lead in the standings by winning the Belgian Grand Prix last time out, meaning that he now holds a 16-point advantage over his fellow McLaren driver. Asked ahead of this weekend's race in Hungary if he views the title fight as being just between himself and Norris by this point, Piastri responded: “I suppose so. The last few weekends it's been Lando and I. “I expect our competition to still be strong and put up a good fight, especially at certain tracks through the rest of the year, but whether that comes from Max [Verstappen] or Ferrari or Mercedes or someone else, we never really know. Piastri was then pushed on whether he feels confident enough that he will win the championship, to which the eight-time race winner answered: “I think I have a lot of confidence in myself that I can do it. “At the level of the field and the level of my team mate, you need to bring your best, and evidently when you're pushing that hard there are going to be mistakes here and there, because it doesn't come without that risk. This weekend sees Piastri return to the scene of his first Grand Prix victory 12 months ago, a race that saw him lead home a McLaren 1-2 after Norris belatedly handed back the lead following a change in positions during the pit stop phase. Asked if he expects the 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix to once again be a fight between himself and Norris, Piastri reflected: “I don't know. Hungary has been historically a good track for us as a team in the two years that I've been with the team, so I expect us to be strong again this weekend. “You never know, but I expect us to still be at the front.” And while last year's event may have been a slightly tricky moment for the squad in terms of executing that team order, Piastri believes that it also showed the positive dynamic within McLaren, as well as between himself and Norris. “It was obviously a slightly awkward situation, but I think it kind of highlighted that we will do the right thing in all circumstances, or ideally all circumstances when we're on track.</p>

'All my laps have been decent' - Norris fastest in both practice sessions

Aston Martin reserve driver Felipe Drugovich will take Fernando Alonso's place for the opening session at the Hungaroring.

Aston Martin have announced that Fernando Alonso is to sit out Friday's opening practice session for the Hungarian Grand Prix due to a muscular injury in his back.

Alonso was present at the Hungaroring for Thursday's media duties and pre-event preparations, some 22 years on from his maiden F1 victory around the Budapest venue.

However, with the first on-track session approaching, a statement from Aston Martin confirmed the Spaniard would play no part in FP1 due to a lingering injury.

Aston Martin's test and reserve driver, former F2 champion Felipe Drugovich, has been called up to take Alonso's spot for first practice, with further updates on the plan for the remainder of the weekend to follow.

“In the days following the Belgian Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso has been managing a muscular injury in his back,” read the team's note.

“As he continues with treatment this morning, he has chosen to sit out of FP1. Felipe Drugovich will drive in FP1 alongside Lance Stroll.

“A decision will then be made on Fernando's participation in FP2 and the remainder of the weekend in due course.”

In a later update issued between practice sessions, Aston Martin confirmed that Alonso would return to action for FP2.
