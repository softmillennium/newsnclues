                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It didn't take long for history to be made in the 2025 Leagues Cup. On Thursday night, the Seattle Sounders demolished the reigning Concacaf Champions Cup winners, Cruz Azul, 7–0, taking no mercy in their tournament-opening performance, with shell-shocking moments until the final whistle. Yet, while Yeimar, Obed Vargas, Jesús Ferreira, Osaze De Rosario, Nouhou and Pedro De La Vega will remember their moments, none stood out as much as De La Vega's perfectly hit volley, which could contend for the FIFA Puskas Award for the world's best goal in 2025. It also marked the widest winning margin in any competition for the Sounders since joining MLS in 2009. The result also brought MLS to 10 wins in 18 matches in the 2025 Leagues Cup, and has the American first division outscoring its Mexican counterpart 40-30 in those combined contests. “We knew that this was going to be a rematch from Concacaf. Since falling out of the group stage against Atlético Madrid, Botafogo and Paris Saint-Germain, the Sounders have gone undefeated through seven games in MLS. “I didn't actually know what I was going to say to them in the locker room because it was such a tremendous win for the club,” said Sounders head coach Brian Schmetzer after the match. “In this club's history, it ranks right up there with all of the big wins that we've had. In recent weeks, though, he has been one of the club's best players and is up to seven goals and three assists, with Thursday's strike the latest showcase of his abilities. I mean, it's way up,” Schmetzer said of the goal and assist from Alex Roldan. “That was an unbelievably technically challenging finish, and he made it look easy.” With the win, the Sounders can look ahead to their next matches against Santos Laguna and Club Tijuana, as they hope to qualify for the tournament's quarterfinals. “[The players] are driving us,” added Schmetzer. “That group in there is completely together, motivated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Club World Cup served as proof of concept for regular season European football to be played in America Javier Tebas insisted it was going to happen. The La Liga president has a tendency of doing these things. There will be a competitive game of top flight Spanish soccer in the United States. We are not going to do a whole gameweek. European soccer has long had a fascination with playing its games abroad, such are the commercial revenue possibilities. Preseason friendlies in the U.S. are customary at this point - Bournemouth-Everton was played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey last week as part of the Premier League Summer Series. But competitive soccer, with points on the line, was always something of a pipe dream. Still, there Tebas was, insisting that it could happen - and with a venue already determined. It became clear that the logistics were too hasty, even if Tebas is a very good politician. But the fact that his statement picked up any steam, and was even considered, suggested that the concept - resisted so virulently by numerous parties for so long - is coming closer to fruition. Legal barriers that once prevented such game are collapsing. It seems inevitable at this point: there will be a competitive football match held in the United States. It will send American fans into a frenzy, and infuriate core supporters to no end. And for good or ill, there's no way to stop it.</p>

FIFA will then run a random draw and begin emailing selected applicants on or after Sept. 30, assigning each a dedicated purchase slot in October. Ticket availability during those time slots will be first-come, first-served. “Excitement for the FIFA World Cup 26 is building fast, and Sept. 10 is a date every football fan should have marked in their calendar,” said Romy Gai, FIFA's chief business officer, calling the presale “a gateway to the most inclusive and spectacular tournament in our history.” Because demand is expected to far outstrip supply, FIFA will roll out additional ticketing phases with broader payment options later this year; specifics on those rounds are due in September. Hospitality packages, which bundle premium seating with food and amenities, are already on sale at FIFA.com/hospitality. Match tickets do not guarantee entry into a host country, so fans should confirm visa and travel requirements well in advance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weah's representative Badou Sambague went public with his disdain for Juventus earlier this week, accusing the Turin outfit of showing “total disrespect”. The USMNT international did not join up with Mauricio Pochettino's Gold Cup roster so that he could be available for Juve during this summer's Club World Cup. Sambague claimed that an unnamed member of Juve's hierarchy deliberately “botched” Weah's tournament and “tried to force him to go where he wanted”. “Today,” Sambague continued, “as revenge, he's demanding a fortune and waiting for a Premier League offer that won't come and will never be approved by us.” Weah is thought to be pushing for a move to Marseille, yet Comolli questioned whether such a deal is even possible. “When you come out strongly and say I want to join one club, and only one club, you need to make sure that club backs you up,” he warned. You are in a corner and have nowhere else to go. “The player wants to go to Marseille, but in soccer you can't choose a team because if the right offer doesn't arrive, you stay on the sidelines,” Comolli added. Weah was linked with a move to Nottingham Forest in the Premier League earlier this summer, with an agreement for the forward and his teammate Samuel Mbangula worth around $25.6 million thought to have been struck in June. Those negotiations ultimately fell through and Weah remains floating in transfer limbo. Grey Whitebloom is a writer, reporter and editor for Sports Illustrated FC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump has reportedly threatened to block an iconic nation from competing at next summer's 2026 World Cup. Currently, 13 teams have secured their spots at next summer's tournament – Canada, Mexico, USA, Australia, IR Iran, Uzbekistan, Jordan, Korea Republic, Japan, Argentina, Ecuador, Brazil and New Zealand – while 35 places are still up for grabs. Trump was front and centre during Chelsea's Club World Cup celebrations and stood alongside captain Reece James when he lifted the trophy following the Blues' emphatic 3-0 victory over Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain in what was an unofficial dress rehearsal for next summer's showpiece. But away from Trump's at times jovial public front, there are concerns that the World Cup could be plunged into chaos as a result of his strict travel bans. Twelve countries – Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Haiti, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Myanmar, Eritrea, Sudan and Yemen - are fully banned, while seven nations face partial restrictions that were applied, including Venezuela, Cuba, Burundi, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo and Turkmenistan. On July 31, CNN reported that Trump could ban visas from Brazil ahead of the 2026 World Cup. This could mean that the five-time World Cup winners play without fans from their homeland, although rules do not apply to athletes and coaches. Dual citizens are also not subject to a ban. In April, Trump announced that Brazilian goods imported to the US would face tariffs of 10%. However, he has since raised the rate to 50% amid huge backlash. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva responded in an interview with The New York Times. “In politics between two states, the will of neither should prevail,” he added. This is achieved not by puffing out your chest and shouting about things you can't deliver, nor by bowing your head and simply saying ‘amen' to whatever the United States wants.”</p>

The 2026 World Cup ticketing sales are set to begin next month, and it's about time to start addressing some frequently asked questions. On Episode 158, we do just that. First, we discuss the World Cup Draw which is reportedly set to take place on December 5th in Las Vegas. The draw always is a night for glitz and glamor, and Vegas could be the best backdrop for that particular night. After quickly discussing the draw, we get into the first ticket phase for the 2026 World Cup, and it's one for all Visa cardholders. There have been several general questions about how the process will go for fans to get tickets to World Cup matches, whether they are for the USMNT or matches involving other teams. How much will tickets likely cost? Can I just find tickets on StubHub or another third party reseller? What will it be like to travel between the United States, Mexico, and Canada for matches?

We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. The new season kicks off on 15 August, just three weeks on from Chelsea's victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final as tensions continue to boil over the congested football calendar. The Blues played almost a year of continuous football before the end of their 2024/25 season gave them a long-awaited reprieve, but will have to do it all over again with 11 months of competitive action culminating back in the United States for the World Cup - the final of which takes place on 19 July in New Jersey. Complaints over the over-packed schedule have been rife, with Manchester City midfielder Rodri warning last September that players are “close” to going on strike because of the increase in games. He said this just 10 days before being ruled out for the domestic season with an ACL injury. However, Masters has stated that the Premier League should not be “forced” to follow suit. "I don't think we should be forced into that decision,” he told BBC Sport. FifPro general secretary believes it is difficult for players to make their voices heard, remaining fearful of speaking out on the heavy workload because of the impact it could have on their careers. “I was speaking to some of the top stars that were going to play in the Club World Cup, and they were saying that they hadn't had a rest for X amount of time,” Phillips said. Others were resigned actually, and cynical about speaking up. “Then you see some of the same players two weeks later having to record social media videos saying ‘we think the Club World Cup is great' because their employers are telling them to do it. “That's why unions do exist, partly, to be their voice, because they are in an invidious position.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Demand to attend the 2026 FIFA World Cup throughout North America via hospitality packages has led to what On Location is calling an “unprecedented” deposit campaign as details emerge about a variety of high-end options that will be available before the general ticket sales phase begins. Alicia Falken, On Location's general manager for FIFA World Cup 26, called next summer's tournament “one of the largest hospitality events ever” as FIFA announced its latest set of hospitality offerings recently with options for single matches, the ability to follow a specific team through the Round of 32 and a venue series with a variety of high-end offerings that come in at hefty price tags. “I think we have price points for everybody,” Falken said. Whether you buy a Follow My Team series or suite or are looking for more of a fan-based experience such as our pavilion, I really do think there's something for everybody.” On Location recently released several sets of packages including a venue series for one stadium, single-match packages through the Round of 32 and a Follow My Team packages that guarantees tickets and hospitality for a team's group stage and potential Round of 32 game should their team advance past the group stage. Obviously there's varying interests across the different follow my teams packages as well.” There are a few countries that stick out — none more so than Colombia with a price tag of $13,500, significantly more than any other country. The next three most expensive packages are for Spain, Germany and France. One country whose packages are not available is England. Those packages are not currently available because of high demand during the initial launch in May although options may be available at a later date. Pitchside Lounge packages include “premium seats located along the sidelines” along with a dedicated guest relations area plus exclusive beverage and culinary options. VIP packages include seating “offering an enhanced view of the match in most venues” while Trophy Lounge package seats are “combining comfort and convenience with excellent views and easy access to amenities.” The Champions Club is much like the Trophy Lounge in offerings. “FIFA has a really well-thought out standard in terms of hospitality,” Falken said. “They've been doing this a long time and you've got an existing stadium in this sense, it's different than Qatar when it was all purpose-built stadiums specifically for the World Cup. Falken said the packages are also designed so fans have options to either follow a team or just see games at one stadium that they're close to regionally. “Something we're working through right now, and that this is the most fun to me, is creating something that is city-specific, but then also that you feel like you're at a World Cup across the board,” she said. When asked what the revenue targets or goals for the hospitality packages were, Falken said that because On Location is part of TKO Holdings, which is a publicly traded company, “I don't believe I can speak to revenue targets and forward-looking things.” The application period for the first general ticket draw for the FIFA World Cup will open on September 10 and fans should visit FIFA.com/tickets to register interest and create a FIFA ID if they have plans to attend. Each phase may differ in purchasing processes, payment methods and ticket products. Dynamic pricing for general ticket sales has also been discussed, according to The Athletic. FIFA this week said those who enter the Visa Presale Draw between September 10 and September 19 can apply for a chance to purchase tickets in the first phase of ticket sales. To participate in the Visa Presale Draw, Visa cardholders must log into their FIFA account using their FIFA ID and complete the application form at any time during the ten-day application period for their chance to purchase tickets. Following a random selection process, FIFA will notify successful cardholders by email beginning no earlier than September 30. FIFA also took pains to point out this week “a match ticket does not guarantee admission to a host country, and fans should visit each host country's government website today for entry requirements.” Don't miss out on our featured stories of the week.
