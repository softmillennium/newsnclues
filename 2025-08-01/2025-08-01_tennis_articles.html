                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top half fourth-round matches feature the two remaining ATP 1000 Canada champions, with No. 1 seed Alexander Zverev (2017) trying to post his first-ever win against Francisco Cerundolo, while the winner from last year, Alexei Popyrin, comes up against Holger Rune. Casper Ruud and Karen Khachanov are meeting for the first time since their 2022 US Open semifinal. Who do you think will reach the last eight at ATP Toronto? Alex Michelsen won in Houston on clay, but Learner Tien got their hard-court meeting at the Next Gen Finals. It's tough to predict this as they know each other's games so well, and surprisingly, the opponent might not be possible. Alexei Popyrin is defending the title from last year, but with the yearly Montreal/Toronto switch-up, he has to do it at a different venue. Nonetheless, defeating Daniil Medvedev in the third round was a big result, and Popyrin seems to be stepping up to the challenge. But Holger Rune might be a difficult opponent for him. The Dane isn't consistent, but when he locks in, he's got the all-around set of skills to make his opponent's one-dimensional aggressive play suffer. This isn't the part of the season that Casper Ruud is known for, but let's remember he has a couple of deep Canada runs in his resume and a US Open final in 2022. It's been a while since he last played Karen Khachanov, but usually, he was able to go after his forehand pretty aggressively in this matchup. His ceiling might just be higher than the Russians', too. Alexander Zverev has been struggling against Francisco Cerundolo, but this is the first time they'll be competing on hard courts. But here the serve of the Argentinian will pale in comparison to Zverev ‘s and he might be punished for his often sloppy footwork more than on the dirt. Damian is a connoisseur of the lower tiers of men's tennis and would probably watch the World No. 700 play a ferret if he could see it from the stands. Always pleased by a beautiful one-handed backhand or classic volleying technique. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

A new dating show, “Game, Set, Matchmaker,” is “set to unfold entirely within the electrifying atmosphere” of the U.S. Open in N.Y., according to Stephanie Livaudais of TENNIS. Part reality TV, part social experiment, the show follows one bachelorette as she “seeks real connection amid Grand Slam chaos.” Produced by the U.S. Open and “set to premiere” on YouTube, the “unscripted series is breaking ground” at the intersection of sports, pop culture and romance -- and “aims to tap into the cultural phenomenon launched by shows like ‘Love Island USA,' ‘Love Is Blind' and ‘The Bachelor' in recent years.” At the “center of it all” is “the Champion” -- 24-year-old former figure skater turned Pilates coach Ilana Sedaka. Seven contestants “ranging from influencers and social media personalities to tennis superfans will compete for Sedaka's affection in a fast-paced” series. The dating show is “a collaboration” between the USTA, production company Fresh Tape Media, and Alissa Danzig and Brian Pollack of CastingHaus. The USTA sees the show as a “fresh way to expand the tournament's cultural reach.” The series will be filmed during U.S. Open Fan Week (Aug. 18-23) at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Episodes will air on the U.S. Open's YouTube channel during the main draw, which starts on Sunday, Aug. 24 (TENNIS, 7/31).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 is expected to return to action at the Cincinnati Masters 1000 before the US Open, but there is no firm news on his schedule for the moment. The Serbian legend is giving his best to win the 25th Major title of his exceptional career, but his body is no longer brilliant until a few years ago and the peremptory rise of Sinner and Alcaraz has made this goal even more complicated for Nole. The 24-time Grand Slam champion has shown that he can raise his level in the most important tournaments on the calendar and his experience still makes the difference, but it may not be enough to make tennis history once again. The 38-year-old from Belgrade has repeatedly repeated that he has no intention of retiring and has expressed his desire to continue playing until the Los Angeles Olympics, scheduled for 2028, when he will be 41 years old. Novak is managing his schedule in the best possible way, with the aim of further extending his career and reaching new heights. On the latest episode of his famous podcast, American legend Jimmy Connors discussed Nole's choice not to play in Canada: "At this point in his career, Djokovic has to pay close attention to his schedule knowing that he is one of the oldest players on the tour. If he wants to be at the top of his shape in Grand Slam tournaments, he can't make mistakes. His next goal is the US Open and – if I had been in his place – I would have taken a break after Wimbledon as well." Djokovic's last triumph in New York dates back to the 2023 edition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu is a former Grand Slam champion, but she hasn't had an easy ride of things over the last few years. Since then, the Briton has struggled to stay fit on the WTA Tour and has been widely criticized for her frequent coaching changes. Things seemed to have clicked in 2025; however, as working alongside Mark Petchey, Raducanu has picked up several big wins. With the US Open less than a month away, Raducanu is on the verge of a major breakthrough, which could put her in contention to win her second Grand Slam title at Flushing Meadows. Raducanu currently trails world number 32 Dayana Yastremska by 142 points, a gap she could close down with a few more wins in Montreal. In 2025, Raducanu has been unseeded at all three Grand Slams and has therefore been drawn against several top players during the early rounds. It is important to note, however, that Raducanu put up a great fight against world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of Wimbledon earlier in the summer, pushing her close in both sets on Centre Court. She'll no doubt be confident of grabbing herself a seed over the next couple of weeks as she continues to impress on tour. In the past, fans had become used to seeing Raducanu lose her opening match at a tournament or win one before going home. Rarely would they see her win multiple matches at an event or make a deep run. That's changed this year, as Raducanu has won multiple matches at seven of the 16 WTA tournaments she's played. Raducanu won both of their two previous meetings, at this year's Australian Open and Miami Open, but will likely take to the court as a slight underdog against the world number seven and 2025 Wimbledon finalist. Only time will tell who will emerge victorious in their third career meeting when Raducanu and Anisimova face off in Montreal on Friday, August 1.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Russian has not claimed a title since 2023 and he has suffered early exits from tournaments on a more regular basis. As a result, Medvedev has fallen out of the top 10 and he is struggling to produce the level of consistency that helped him win 20 ATP Tour titles, including a Grand Slam title. Looking at his results since the start of last season, a former ATP player did not hold back on where he believes the 28-year-old's game is at. 2025 has been a season to forget for Daniil Medvedev so far. The world number 14 has suffered 15 defeats this year and he has just one Grand Slam match win to his name across the three majors played so far. Medvedev's best result was a run to the Berlin Open final, where he lost to Alexander Bublik in straight sets. There has been very little else for Medvedev to celebrate this season and while he seems to have been surpassed by other players, Frenchman Julien Varlet thinks the 2021 US Open winner has regressed significantly. “Medvedev is stagnating, and it's even close to regressing. And then when you're in doubt, there are two things that help you hold the fort,” Varlet told Sans Filet. But he's given so much that it's starting to get complicated. Medvedev leaves his bag on court after loss, walks straight to locker room 😂🚶‍♂️#NBO25 pic.twitter.com/lrzT681cWi Medvedev claimed just one win at the Canadian Open before he was beaten by defending champion Alexei Popyrin. He took a tight first set but the Australian battled back and secured the next two sets to keep his title defence alive. This was Popyrin's fourth Top 20 win of the season, and he was disappointed not to win the match in straight sets after holding a 4-2 lead in set one. I was in the driver's seat, I felt like I was really comfortable out there, and then something happened — the same thing that happened earlier this season when I played him [in Rome],” Popyrin said post-match. When that happens, when you play at a fast pace against him, he starts feeling the ball a little bit more. “I had to revert back to the main tactics that we had, which was more focused on serving, coming into the net and not giving him the same rhythm.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In professional tennis, the little number next to your name is everything. Wow, what an upset!” And generally, seeding — derived from the ATP rankings coming in along with a smattering of subjectivity — is a decent way to gauge who can win and who can't. For the upcoming US Open, the last major tournament of the year, men's tennis has about 17 people whose names you should probably know, but for the sake of round numbers (and because I think we kind of hit a wall at the Alexander Bublik/Alexei Popyrin turn), I'm going to rank the ATP Top 25* and tell you who I think has a chance of winning the US Open. *Disclaimer: to my knowledge, the only Top 25 player who has dropped out due to injury so far is Gregor Dimitrov. That may change in the month before the tournament, so I'll get to my Denis Shapovalov thoughts if the need arises. Our injury replacement for Dimitrov on this list, Fonseca made back-to-back third rounds at majors and is still 18 years old, so ask anyone around men's tennis who the next thing might be… they'll point to him. Fiery player who beat Jack Draper at the French Open but lost in the first round at Wimbledon. A player on the up-and-up since 2023, Cerundolo is the paragon of men's tennis' crowded middle class. Humbert has seemingly been around forever and always is a threat to win a match or two, but I'm not sure how much more than that he is capable of. Our second Czech player in four spots, Machac is a 2024 Olympic gold medalist in mixed doubles. Ranked 21, age 21, and the top player from France, Fils is a really fun watch with some big wins on hard courts — he toppled Zverev this year in Miami. Grigor Dimitrov (out with pectoral injury) He's 19, 6'5” and grabbed a big-time win over Djokovic at the 2025 Miami Open, an ATP Masters 1000-level event. He's six years younger than Khachanov and is currently launching an exploratory committee with being an elite player. We are going to have to wait to see if that committee comes back with a better verdict than “take a set off Djokovic in the Wimbledon quarterfinals,” but I'm down for anything. Khachanov is the ATP's recent house-money player. Nobody ever expects him to win anything, but he occasionally puts together a nasty run and reminds everybody that they aren't safe with their rankings. He's a fun player, but I don't see him actually winning anything anytime soon. Slightly better, Ruud has won two matches at majors this year but pulled out of Wimbledon due to injury. There was a good 20 minutes when it seemed like Ruud could be the next thing, but now I don't know what to think; I haven't had a lot of reason to believe in the future of Norwegian tennis recently. What a fall off for Medvedev, who's had the year from hell in majors — he's one one match in three Grand Slams, and that is just insane for the former World Number 1. This is the guy that beat Djokovic in the 2021 US Open Final when he was going for the calendar Grand Slam, and he's just been unable to hack it this year. I don't know what happened, but there's no way it can stay this bad. Paul has been playing his best tennis in the last two years, but I still lack evidence that his best tennis is enough to even reach a major final, let alone win one. Rune is a player I don't really understand. He has the tools of an elite player of his generation, but has been woefully unsuccessful in five sets. Or maybe that's just because of their backwards hats. Oh, you guys thought De Minaur was a social experiment in quartefinal failure? Well, let me introduce Rublev, who's 0-10 all time in major quarterfinals. That's just cruel and unusual, so Rublev has some demons to deal with before he can be taken seriously as a contender. Tiafoe was my main American hope for a while after he pushed Carlos Alcaraz to five sets in the 2022 US Open semifinal, but he hasn't been nearly as consistent as Fritz or Shelton lately. He plays with tons of fire and possibly digs deeper than anyone else on tour when his back is against the wall, but his game hasn't evolved with the rest of men's tennis. He still relies on a topspin-heavy forehand that trades raw speed for spin rate, and doesn't have the velocity to overpower lesser opponents like others around his level. De Minaur's career is like a social experiment of how many quarterfinals you can make without ever getting to a semifinal. It's honestly sad, and he's nursing an 0-5 record in the last eight despite playing excellent tennis for years now. Another player with a consistent game that just hasn't proven anything at the highest level, De Minaur probably needs a favorable draw to break the drought. The hallmark of this group are players I think can be better than they are… but they have to prove it to me. Mussetti is a player I legit like, with one of those “I'm not sure this will work but I'm going to try it anyway” shot diets that make Sinner and Alcaraz so special. Mussetti has a game that looks almost comically like Roger Federer, with the headband and one-handed backhand to boot. But he has real power, and I believe him him as a potential riser on tour. I am not Fritz's biggest fan. I've long been skeptical of his ability to beat top players in five-set matches, generally just farming the players he's supposed to beat and folding once his opponent has a better hand. But beating everyone you're supposed to beat is a bit of an underrated skill, which allowed Fritz to get to the US Open Final last year on the back of an insanely light draw. Sure, he got railroaded by Sinner in the final, but all he needed was one more lucky break and he could have been a major champion. It's a really shaky theory, but sometimes it's better to be lucky than good. Draper had an extraordinarily disappointing Wimbledon, ceding the British spotlight to Cameron Norrie after coming in as the overwhelming hometown favorite. Draper does, however, have absurd burst on his serve and plays a consistent, all-court style that is conducive to success in five-set matches. And he's only 23, so I wouldn't rule him out. I'm going out on a limb here, but I think Shelton will soon be a regular member of the ATP Top 5. He's better than both Jack Draper and Taylor Fritz mechanically, and plays a style that can and will propel him past elite challengers. He's had a really nice year, and has lots of time to grow into his final form. The only question is: will it be good enough? Zverev has had an up-and-down year, and really an up-and-down career as far as Grand Slams go. He's basically glorified cannon fodder for whoever happens to be at the top level of men's tennis, be it Djokovic and Nadal or Sinner and Alcaraz — always doing well on tour but unable to break his personal glass ceiling. He's gotten unlucky in spots, and has a really modern game with pretty special mobility for his size. He could definitely win a major if he somehow dodges the top two on his path to the final, but that's not a good bet. It's much more likely Zverev himself gets upset. This is where the rankings diverge from methodology, as Djokovic is ranked below three much-younger players but still, in my view, has a better chance in five-set matches. Djokovic got annihilated by Sinner in the Wimbledon Semifinal, and it looks more and more like the GOAT doesn't have a prayer against men's tennis' new royalty. But I'd still probably pick him against any of the other 62 players in the tournament, a testament to how much his game has endured his older age. However, I don't know how much longer I will be giving the Serbian the benefit of the doubt, so he better savor it. But like… would I even be one percent surprised if he won the thing? I have no rational reason to predict Carlos Alcaraz will beat Sinner on hard court. The Italian is turning into some sort of Rafael-Nadal-on-clay-except-its-on-hard-court level favorite, having taken the last three Grand Slams on the surface. And I had no rational reason to predict he would beat Alcaraz on grass at Wimbledon either, and then Sinner did it anyway. And he's thoroughly played himself into shape after his suspension, so by some combination of gut feel and irrefutable evidence, Sinner is the clear favorite. Had he not choked away the French Open final after having three match points, he would be going for the Calendar Grand Slam right now — or winning all four majors in a single year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Jannik Sinner made major changes to his support staff in recent weeks, including the surprise dismissal of his coach Marco Panichi and physiotherapist Ulises Badio just before Wimbledon. Sinner has now reunited with his former fitness coach, Umberto Ferrara. At the time of the split, Sinner stated there was “no major reason” behind parting ways with Panichi and Badio. However, Italian outlet Corriere della Sera has now reported that Sinner had grown increasingly uncomfortable with certain decisions made by Panichi, both on and off the court. One of the trigger points was reportedly Panichi's decision to leak confidential team information to the media. This included details of Sinner's emotional reaction after losing to Alcaraz at Roland Garros, where he failed to convert three championship points. Panichi had told the press that Sinner cried for 15 minutes in the locker room and was upset at how fans seemed to favour Alcaraz over him. Panichi and Badio, both of whom previously worked with Novak Djokovic, came under scrutiny after their dismissal. Panichi, in particular, was seen as a divisive figure in Sinner's camp, with reports suggesting he frequently defied team rules that restricted public statements without prior clearance. Sinner, a four-time Grand Slam champion, initially downplayed speculation about the departures. We reached incredible results in the past with them. We did great work, but I decided to try something different. However, Sinner later admitted that a breakdown in trust led to the overhaul. “Communication is important for the group to function. We spend a lot of time together throughout the year, and it's important to find the right people,” he explained. The 23-year-old has since brought back Umberto Ferrara, who had left the team last year following an investigation into Sinner's two failed doping tests. It was ultimately revealed that the positive results were due to accidental contamination. Sinner's former physio, Giacomo Naldi, had used a spray containing traces of the banned substance clostebol to treat a cut on his finger.</p>

Over in Montreal, WTA stars Sofia Kenin and Madison Keys were in similar positions.“Today it happened to others, tomorrow it's me, and from the day after, all matches return to 12:30,” Davidovich Fokina wrote. While many social media users applauded him for calling out tournament conditions, others found his comments tone-deaf: “Wait, now we don't want to play early too?” one person wrote. “Wish I had this kind of privilege,” said another.

The world No 2 sent down 14 double-faults to add to the 23 she served up in the previous round against Danielle Collins, but a fightback from a set and a break down saw her progress 4-6 7-5 6-2 in Montreal. "It does give positives that I am winning these matches having literally one part of my game on a crutch," said Gauff, who came to Canada without a win since her triumph at the French Open. "If I can stand on both feet, then I can only imagine that it will be a lot more straightforward and a lot easier for me."

Emma Navarro was another high-profile casualty, the eighth seed losing to Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine.
