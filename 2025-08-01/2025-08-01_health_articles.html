                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally. Ischemic stroke, strongly linked to atherosclerotic plaques, requires accurate plaque and vessel wall segmentation and quantification for definitive diagnosis. However, conventional manual segmentation remains time-consuming and operator-dependent, whereas current computer-aided tools fall short in achieving the accuracy required for clinical applications. These technological bottlenecks severely hamper precise diagnosis and treatment of ischemic stroke. In a study published in European Radiology, a research team led by Dr. Zhang Na from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT) of Chinese Academy of Sciences, along with collaborators, has developed a fully learnable parameter based multi-task segmentation model and a structure-guided, two-stage small-target segmentation method based on high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) vessel wall imaging. This approach enables automated and accurate segmentation and quantitative analysis of carotid arterial vessel lumens, vessel walls, and plaques, offering a reliable AI-assisted diagnostic tool for clinical risk assessment of ischemic stroke. In this study, the proposed method consists of two key steps. The first step involves constructing a purely learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN), named Vessel-SegNet, to segment the lumen and vessel wall. The second step leverages vessel wall priors-specifically, manual priors and Tversky-loss-based automatic priors-to improve plaque segmentation by utilizing the morphological similarity between the vessel wall and atherosclerotic plaque. This study included data from 193 patients with atherosclerotic plaque across five centers, all of whom underwent T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Experimental results demonstrated that most Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) for lumen and vessel wall segmentation exceeded 90%. In contrast to manual methods, the proposed technique provides accurate, automated plaque segmentation and completes quantitative plaque characteristic assessment for a single patient in under 3 seconds. The goal of our research is to leverage AI models to produce accurate, reproducible, and clinically relevant quantitative outcomes, which can assist healthcare professionals in stroke diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new radioimmunotherapy approach has been shown to successfully eliminate cancer stem cells (CSCs) in preclinical models of ovarian cancer, outperforming the current gold standard. This research, published in the July issue of The Journal of Nuclear Medicine, lays the foundation for further development of radionuclide therapies targeting CSCs, offering renewed hope for more effective treatment options and improved outcomes for patients. CSCs are highly tumorigenic, self-renewable cells that play a key role in tumor relapse, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Although the clinical significance of eliminating CSCs is clearly recognized and CSC immunotherapies have been examined in preclinical and clinical evaluations, the development of such therapies remains a challenge. Radioimmunotherapy enables precise, target-specific delivery of particulate radiation to cancer-associated antigens, while minimizing off-target accumulation and increasing tumor retention and irradiation, which makes it a promising choice for targeting CSCs. Our study sought to investigate the effectiveness of a new radionuclide Terbium-161 (161Tb) for eradicating CSCs due to emission of short-ranged conversion and Auger electrons-besides beta-minus particle-successfully eliminated ovarian CSCs in contrast to Lutetium-177 (177Lu)." Jürgen Grünberg, PhD, senior scientist at the Center for Radiopharmaceutical Sciences, Center for Life Sciences at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland Researchers identified CSC-associated biomarkers (L1CAM+/CD133+) in an ovarian cancer sample and then created radiolabeled immunoconjugates with 177Lu or 161Tb to target these CSCs. 161Tb-DOTA-chCE7 showed significantly increased cytotoxicity, compared with 177Lu-DOTA-chCE7, eliminating all ovarian CSCs and tumor cells differentiated from the CSCs in vivo. "This signifies a pivotal step toward the translation of 161Tb-based therapies into clinical application," noted Tihomir Todorov, PhD, junior scientist at the Center for Radiopharmaceutical Sciences, Center for Life Sciences at the Paul Scherrer Institute. "Targeted radionuclide therapies with 161Tb could support personalized medicine leading to advancements in cancer care including eradication of resistant CSCs and increased therapeutic efficacy alongside improved diagnosis, detection, and treatment monitoring."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly NAFLD) and aging are locked in a vicious circle: senescence of liver cells accelerates fat accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis, while chronic steatosis in turn hastens hepatic decline. Lipid deposition is driven by falling β-oxidation, leptin resistance and the GPCPD1-glycerophosphocholine pathway; glucose intolerance emerges from insulin resistance linked to visceral obesity and telomere-p53 signalling. Senescent hepatocytes, endothelial cells, stellate cells and Kupffer macrophages each contribute distinct pathologies, but their shared secretion of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) propagates damage throughout the organ. In aged or obese mice, 60-80 % of hepatocytes display p16, p21 or β-gal positivity; enlarged nuclei, reduced smooth endoplasmic reticulum and fewer mitochondria accompany metabolic reprogramming that favours lipogenesis. Selective insulin resistance within senescent hepatocytes diverts incoming fatty acids to triglyceride droplets, fuelling steatosis. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) undergo "pseudocapillarization" with age: thickness increases, fenestrae decrease and basement membranes form. Senescent LSECs secrete CXCR4 ligands that polarise macrophages toward an M1 phenotype, amplifying fibro-inflammatory signalling. Conversely, restoring C-kit-positive LSECs or activating SIRT1 via Notch inhibition reverses these changes and improves steatohepatitis. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) paradoxically assume a less fibrotic yet senescent state. They lose lipid droplets, produce fewer extracellular-matrix proteins but secrete matrix metalloproteinases that degrade existing scar tissue. p53-dependent IGF-1 signalling and IL-22-STAT3 activation drive this anti-fibrotic senescence, rendering senescent HSCs targets for NK-cell elimination. However, transient persistence of senescent HSCs after partial hepatectomy releases IL-6 and CXCR2 ligands that stimulate compensatory hepatocyte proliferation, illustrating the dual roles of cellular senescence. Kupffer macrophages accumulate with age and shift toward an M1 pro-inflammatory profile. These macrophages amplify steatohepatitis by recruiting monocytes via CCR2-CCL2 and CXCR3-CXCL10 axes. Depletion of Kupffer cells in mouse models blunts progression from MASLD to MASH, confirming their pathogenic centrality. Given the intertwining of ageing and steatosis, interventions that target senescence are emerging. Senolytic cocktails—dasatinib plus quercetin, Bcl-2 inhibitors navitoclax or ABT-737, and senolytic vaccination against glycoprotein GPNMB—selectively eliminate p16-high cells, reduce hepatic triglycerides and restore insulin sensitivity in mice. Small-molecule vorapaxar blocks thrombomodulin-PAR1 signalling in senescent hepatocytes, diminishing inflammation and fibrosis. Genetic modulation of BMP4-Gremlin1 or PLA2R1 likewise mitigates steatosis and cellular senescence. The key challenge is to distinguish beneficial, transient senescent cells—needed for wound healing and tumour suppression—from chronic, pathogenic ones. Future trials must therefore refine cell-type-specific senolytic strategies, validate biomarkers and balance efficacy against the physiological roles of senescence in liver homeostasis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research shows that exercise-based cardiac rehab offers real benefits for people with atrial fibrillation, reducing the risk of recurrence and improving mental well-being, highlighting the need for wider adoption of these programs. Study: Exercise based cardiac rehabilitation for atrial fibrillation: Cochrane systematic review, meta-analysis, meta-regression and trial sequential analysis. In a recent study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers examined the impact of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) for atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. AF is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with an estimated six to 12 million people projected to develop AF in the US by 2050 and 17.9 million in Europe by 2060. Although current treatments can effectively control symptoms and stroke risk in AF, self-management interventions could be key to managing arrhythmia progression and maintaining health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and functional capacity. ExCR is a comprehensive intervention involving exercise training, personalized lifestyle risk factor management, medical risk management, health behavior education, and psychosocial intervention. Current AF management guidelines do not recommend ExCR as the benefits of exercise for individuals with AF remain unclear. Previously, the authors reported improvements in functional capacity with ExCR in AF patients, but the impact of ExCR on clinical events was uncertain. Patients saw measurable drops in AF burden – exercise programs reduced symptom severity scores by 1.61 points and episode frequency by 0.57 events on standardized scales, with consistent benefits across AF subtypes. In the present Cochrane study, researchers systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the impact of ExCR for AF patients. Electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, LILACS) and trial registers were searched for relevant RCTs from inception to March 2024. Eligible studies included adults with AF, exercise-based interventions (including center-based, hybrid, or home-based programs like yoga or Qigong), a control arm, and the following outcomes: mortality, serious adverse events, AF recurrence, AF symptom severity, AF burden, HRQoL, and exercise capacity. Exercise-based intervention was any outpatient, inpatient, home-based, or community rehabilitation program that must include an exercise component and may also include a psycho-educational component. A control arm may include no intervention, usual treatment, or another cardiac rehabilitation program without exercise. Data were extracted from trials, and the risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane's risk of bias-1 tool. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using the standardized mean difference. This review included 20 RCTs conducted from 2006 to 2024, encompassing 2,039 individuals with AF with a mean follow-up of 11 months. Notably, 73% of participants were male, limiting generalizability to women. Most RCTs were conducted in Europe (10), followed by Asia (four), and Australia (two). Follow-up duration lasted from eight weeks to five years. Exercise capacity improvements were clinically significant – the 3.18 mL/kg/min increase in VO₂ peak surpassed the 1 mL/kg/min threshold known to enhance patient function and prognosis. All trials included a "no formal exercise training" control arm, involving education, usual medical care, and psychological intervention. The exercise interventions differed in frequency, duration, intensity, and session length. All-cause mortality was reported in nine trials. Ten RCTs reported serious adverse events, and there was no difference between ExCR and controls with very low certainty evidence. AF recurrence was reported in four trials; there was moderate-certainty evidence of a benefit of ExCR compared to controls. AF symptom severity was reported in five trials and showed benefits from ExCR compared to controls with low certainty. Fourteen RCTs included a validated HRQoL measure. The short-form 36 (SF-36) mental component demonstrated benefit with ExCR compared to controls with moderate certainty, while the physical component showed no significant improvement (very low certainty). Exercise capacity was reported as maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) and the six-minute walk test. ExCR showed a clinically meaningful benefit on VO2 peak compared to controls (mean improvement 3.18 mL/kg/min, exceeding the 1 mL/kg/min threshold for clinical significance). The authors note a U-shaped relationship between exercise and AF risk, where excessive endurance exercise may increase AF prevalence in athletes, though this subgroup is unlikely to attend ExCR. Based on these findings, they suggest clinical guidelines should incorporate ExCR alongside standard AF therapies. The study's limitations include clinical heterogeneity, predominant male representation, publication bias for exercise capacity measures, and reporting bias (due to self-reported outcomes). Future research should prioritize representative recruitment of women and diverse ethnic groups. Tarun is a writer based in Hyderabad, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By understanding differences in how people's brains are wired, clinicians may be able to predict who would benefit from a self-guided anxiety care app, according to a new analysis from a clinical trial led by Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian investigators. The preliminary study suggested that young people with weaker connections between two brain areas involved in both attending to and regulating responses to anxiety were more likely to benefit from a self-guided anxiety care app than those with stronger connections. The study, published July 31 in JAMA Network Open, looked at data from a subset of clinical trial participants who agreed to undergo a brain MRI before using the anxiety care app developed by the investigators. The app, called Maya, is essentially a course in cognitive behavioral therapy, a gold standard psychotherapeutic intervention that provides users with skills to support them in shifting their thinking, completing challenging behaviors and learning new ways to cope. The interactive platform guides young adults with anxiety through videos, exercises and educational content. People with weaker connections in key brain networks involved in anxiety and regulating emotions were more likely to see improved anxiety symptoms with the use of the app. Faith Gunning, senior author, associate professor of psychology and vice chair for research in the Department of Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine Dr. Gunning and her colleagues developed the Maya app to help fill critical gaps in access to care for young adults with anxiety. Young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 are at a stage in life where they are experiencing many life changes, and studies have shown they are at fairly high risk for anxiety disorders. During this time, they may also have gaps in health care coverage or may have difficulties accessing or affording in-person mental health care. Some may also be hesitant to seek in-person care because of stigma surrounding mental health or because of their anxiety symptoms. Investigators tracked participants' symptoms during that time and for an additional six weeks. The investigators were able to use data from 30 participants who had MRIs before using the Maya app to determine if specific patterns of brain activity indicated individuals who were more likely to experience symptom improvements. The results suggest that young adults experiencing anxiety whose brains were less efficient at regulating their responses to anxiety-provoking information benefited more from learning cognitive behavioral therapy techniques through the app. In contrast, those with stronger connections in circuits involved with greater attention to potentially threatening or anxiety provoking information were less likely to benefit from using the app. "App-based interventions like Maya are poised to address a critical barrier to care for people with anxiety, but like any mental health treatment, some people will benefit more than others," said first author Dr. Abhishek Jaywant, assistant professor of neuropsychology in the Department of Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine and a psychologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. "Our study is among the first to suggest that patterns of brain function are relevant in helping researchers and clinicians understand response to app-based treatments for anxiety. "Our study will help us better tailor treatments to patients in the future," said Dr. Gunning, who is also a psychologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.
