                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>El Salvador's Legislative Assembly approved changes to the country's constitution on Thursday that will extend presidential terms from five years to six and abolish term limits. That means President Nayib Bukele, a far-right crypto enthusiast who's allied with President Donald Trump, could potentially stay in power for the rest of his natural life. First elected in 2019 on a promise to crack down on gangs, Bukele was supposed to be prohibited from running for re-election in 2024. But the country's Supreme Court of Justice ruled in 2021 that one of the articles in El Salvador's constitution allows a president to run for re-election once. But lawmaker Ana Figueroa from the New Ideas Party has suggested moving up Bukele's re-election to June 1, 2027, to put it more in line with congressional elections, according to the Associated Press. With the new changes and Bukele's popularity, it would presumably allow the president to consolidate even more power now that he could be re-elected again and again, both without term limits and for a longer term each time. But guys like Musk and Trump are no doubt excited that their buddy in Central America is going to get even more power. The men sent there, some of whom have been released into Venezuela, have told horror stories about being beaten, given dirty water, and sexually assaulted. Bukele rode into office and remains popular because he promised to crack down on gangs. But recent reporting from the country's El Faro news outlet claims Bukele's government signed a secret pact in 2019 with gang leaders to dial back violence in the country. Bukele has taken credit for reducing violence by insisting it's all part of his brutally violent crackdown. Bukele has invested his country's money heavily in crypto, holding nearly $550 million of its foreign exchange reserves in bitcoin, according to Reuters, which amounts to about 15%. And while that may seem like a fine thing to do when bitcoin is soaring, it's extremely risky for any government when the price of crypto is so volatile. Bukele's government made reassurances to the International Monetary Fund that it would scale back its crypto project in exchange for a $1.4 billion bailout from the IMF. As CoinTelegraph reported in June, El Salvador has added at least 240 BTC since Dec. 19, 2024, right after the agreement with the IMF was announced.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You're better off getting a Nintendo Switch 2 at these prices. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. According to its announcement, the company made these adjustments “based on market conditions,” and they will take effect starting August 3, 2025. This is unusual, as most companies typically drop the prices of their old models after launching next-gen products. And Nintendo has just released the Switch 2, which has been quite successful and is projected to beat the original Switch. We can't directly blame tariffs for the increasing costs of these consoles, though, as Canada was also affected by these price increases. This will give you much better performance and a larger screen, although you'll be missing out on the OLED display. You can also install more games on the new handheld because it uses microSD Express cards. Although these cars are more expensive and harder to find (if you don't know where to look), they offer better performance and allow you to load games directly from the expansion slot. More importantly, the Switch 2 is now readily available. This isn't like the PlayStation 5 launch fiasco, where scalpers made a ton of money buying up Sony's consoles because it had little to no supply. So, as long as you know where to buy it, you can easily pick up a Nintendo Switch 2 console at any time. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Shapiro did not provide details on which positions were impacted, but posts on LinkedIn from affected employees show that at least one longtime marketing leader at the company was let go. In April, Shapiro said that Glowforge employed just over 90 full-time and contract employees. Shapiro previously sold the startup Sparkbuy to Google, and he created Robot Turtles, a coding board game for kids that was one of the most successful campaigns ever on Kickstarter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The situation surrounding Trump tariffs hasn't eased its pressure on Nintendo. In a news post, Nintendo said U.S. customers can expect certain accessories, select amiibo, and the cute Alarmo bedside clock to all get more expensive in the next few days. While the console maker decided not to hike Switch 2 prices, it raised prices on the Switch 2 Pro Controller, Joy-Con 2 split controllers, and the official Switch 2 Camera peripheral by $5 each. We can assume the DK and young Pauline figurine for Donkey Kong Bananza is first in line. Nintendo said its games shouldn't cost any more after Aug. 3. That's not much of a relief considering the company is already pushing some titles for $70 or as much as $80. Digital deals hunter Wario64 spotted that Target had already increased prices for the 8-year-old console. The original Switch now costs $40 more at $340. The fan-favorite Switch OLED, which was priced at $350 on launch, now sells for $400. Target later reversed those prices, which could be an indicator the big box store was early to the party, or the pricing was inaccurate to what we'll see on Aug. 3. Target prices indicate the Switch 2 Pro Controller won't get a price hike, but both the Joy-Con 2 and the original Switch Joy-Con controllers will now cost more at $100 and $90, respectively. Alarmo will now cost $110, while prices on accessories, like the original Joy-Con charging stand, will go up by $5. The company said in its latest financial results that it sold nearly as many copies of Mario Kart World, though that includes the software downloads from the $500 Switch 2 and Mario Kart bundle. Nintendo didn't offer nearly as much data on its peripheral sales, though original Switch sales were already declining before the Switch 2 release. A more expensive console won't do Nintendo's older systems any favors. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For Star Wars, it's celebrating its 50th anniversary by going back to the movies. Disney just announced it will re-release George Lucas' original Star Wars in theaters on April 30, 2027. That's about a month ahead of the actual anniversary on May 25, 2027, but that weekend is reserved for a brand new Star Wars film, Star Wars: Starfighter, starring Ryan Gosling. The rerelease will also come a few short weeks after Star Wars Celebration Los Angeles, which takes place from April 1 to 4, 2027. With this all teed up, you can imagine Lucasfilm will promote the heck out of it at that event, maybe even bringing some of the original cast and crew together again. What's unclear, at least now almost two years away, is which version of the film will come to theaters. However, just last month, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy was on hand for a very rare screening of an original print of Star Wars, long before anything was changed on it. Not even “Episode IV: A New Hope.” Maybe, just maybe, that's a tease of what's to come. A new restoration of the original, unaltered film. That, surely, would have fans more excited than anything else. The story of a young farm boy (Mark Hamill) who finds himself on a galaxy-spanning adventure to save a princess (Carrie Fisher) along with his mentor (Alec Guinness) and a daring pilot (Harrison Ford), Star Wars is one of the most influential and popular films of all time. It spawned two immediate sequels, three prequels, and then three more sequels over the past four-plus decades.

Being considerably behind other major high-tech companies with its artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, Apple is open to acquiring third-party companies to accelerate its AI roadmap as its management gets that gradual expanding its internal AI initiatives won't cut in to become competitive with Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, or xAI. "We are very open to M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions) that accelerates our road map," said Apple CEO Tim Cook during the company's earnings call with financial analysts and investors, when asked about possible acquisitions of AI companies. "We are not stuck on a certain size company, although the ones that we have acquired thus far this year are small in nature. But we basically ask ourselves whether a company can help us accelerate our roadmap and if they do, then we are interested. But we do not have anything to share specifically today." During the call, Cook confirmed the company is increasing spending and reorganizing teams to address expansion of its AI initiatives. Apple is moving a significant number of employees to AI-related work and these teams are tasked with developing new features that leverage machine learning and related technologies across Apple's hardware and software ecosystem. "The way that we look at AI is that it is one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime, and I think it will affect all devices in a significant way," Cook said. Apple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone, and that is at the heart of our AI strategy." Cook stated that Apple intends to grow its AI investment substantially, which is proven by the company's increased CapEx (more on this later). In fact, the company has already made around seven takeovers this year, though not all were related to AI, according to Cook. Apple's most notable acquisition remains Beats Electronics, purchased in 2014 for $3 billion. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Other acqusitions were mostly focused on enhancing the company's vertical integration. In 2019, Apple expanded its hardware capabilities by acquiring Intel' smartphone modem business for $1 billion, gaining key patents and over 2,000 employees to accelerate the development of its own 5G modems in a bid to reduce dependence on Qualcomm. Earlier, in 2018, Apple spent $600 million to acquire a portion of Dialog Semiconductor, including licensing power management technologies and hiring over 300 Dialog engineers, helping Apple bring more of its chip design in-house. In the early 2010s, the company broght Anobit Technologies to bring development of NAND controllers in house; fingerprint sensor company AuthenTec (Touch ID), and 3D sensing designer PrimeSense (Face ID). Despite this renewed focus on AI, Apple's infrastructure spending remains modest compared to other major high-tech companies. So far this fiscal year the company has spent $9.473 billion on 'acquisition of property, plant, and equipment,' which is how it calls its capital expenditures. Even if the company spends another $3.46 billion in Q4 FY2025 (which ends on September 29), its CapEx for the fiscal year 2025 will total $12.933 billion. Apple posted total revenue of $94.0 billion for the third fiscal quarter ending June 28, 2025, a 10% increase from the $85.8 billion reported a year earlier. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 46.5%, compared to $46.27 billion last year. As for product categories, iPhone remains the company's No. iPad revenue was $6.6 billion, slightly down from $7.2 billion in the prior year, which is a surprise as the company introduced an inexpensive iPad earlier this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google just made one of its most advanced AI reasoning models available to the public. Like other advanced models, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think uses more than one AI agent to brainstorm answers in order to boost accuracy and result in more creative solutions. That research model took hours to produce solutions, but the version available today is designed for everyday use working much faster, while still achieving bronze-level IMO performance. However, in order to try out the new model users will need to hand over $250 a month for a Google AI Ultra subscription.Starting today, subscribers get access to a fixed set of prompts for the new model. Google first previewed Gemini 2.5 Deep Think back in May at its I/O developer conference, but the company says the version released today is a “significant improvement,” thanks to tester feedback and key benchmark improvements. Google says Deep Think uses parallel thinking techniques to tackle complex problems like a human would by weighing different angles and potential solutions. “This approach lets Gemini generate many ideas at once and consider them simultaneously, even revising or combining different ideas over time, before arriving at the best answer,” the company said in a blog post. Additionally, Google says it developed new reinforcement learning techniques that push the model to explore extended reasoning paths, helping Deep Think become a stronger and more intuitive problem-solver over time. This, Google claims, makes the model particularly useful for things like coding, web development, and scientific research. According to Google, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think outperformed rival models on the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a 2,500-question expertise benchmark spanning subjects like math, science, and the humanities. Google also said it will share the gold-medal version of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think with a small group of mathematicians and academics, hoping to see how it might aid their research.

In a historic shake-up of the global memory market, SK hynix has overtaken Samsung Electronics to become the world's top memory maker by revenue, marking a pivotal shift in an industry long dominated by its larger Korean rival. The news first emerged through multiple South Korean financial publications, with industry tracking firm Counterpoint and Omidia confirming SK hynix's rise to the number one spot in Q2 2025. This marks the first time SK hynix has surpassed Samsung since its founding in 1983. At the heart of this leap lies SK hynix's early and aggressive move into high-bandwidth memory (HBM), the ultra-fast DRAM used in AI accelerators like Nvidia's B300. While Samsung was once seen as the leader in memory innovation, it now seems that SK Hynix has become Nvidia's primary HBM supplier. SK hynix's success is also visible in its operating profits. Analysts say this divergence highlights a fundamental realignment in the memory industry: AI-centric demand now drives profitability more than PC or smartphone shipments ever did. Samsung, by contrast, has struggled to match SK hynix's pace. Reports suggest delays in qualifying Samsung's own HBM3 and HBM3E with key customers like Nvidia, leading to lost ground in what has become the most lucrative segment of the memory space, so much so that price cuts are now in order. Samsung remains dominant in NAND flash and legacy DRAM, but those markets are not experiencing the same upside. A recent survey by Incruit shows that compensation, engineering focus, and future growth outlook have driven students—particularly in electronics and tech majors—to favor SK Hynix. Looking ahead, SK hynix is now eyeing an even stronger grip on the AI memory stack. Its trajectory mirrors broader shifts in the tech sector, where memory is no longer just a commodity, rather a key enabled of AI-powered next-gen computing. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. For Samsung, though, the story is far from over. The company has pledged to bounce back with aggressive investment in HBM capacity, and rumors suggest it's chasing new clients beyond Nvidia, such as AMD and custom AI chip start-ups.

We can print objects at home using the best budget 3D printers and it's amazing how far we've come yet you'll still be hard pressed to find examples of 3D printing in space. This is mainly due to the volatility of 3D printed materials and a need for extreme reliability in aerospace. But, Horizon Microtechnologies, has recently passed testing standards, put in place to ensure the reliability of materials used in the space industry — bringing us one step closer to introducing more 3D printing components in space. The 3D printed materials were put through outgassing tests. The materials must meet specific requirements to be cleared for space travel in accordance with ECSS-Q-ST-70-02C, a material screening standard set by the European Cooperation for Space Standardization. Horizon Microtechnologies CEO Andreas Frölich expressed enthusiasm for the successful results, remarking at the significance of their development. The outgassing testing process in particular is used to determine how much, if any, volatile material is released and/or reabsorbed by the given component being tested. This testing process is also looking out for any cross contamination with nearby items that might be able to absorb any released particles. By coating their 3D printed components using its own purpose developed coating method, Horizon Microtechnologies was able to successfully pass the standard requirements for the outgassing tests. This means we'll likely see more 3D-printed hardware in wide variety of future space technology, including vessels, satellite hardware and more. Recently, tests were carried out on the International Space Station (ISS) which saw astronauts on the ISS 3D print objects in micro-gravity. This uses low-temperature plastics instead of traditional filament, as all sources of heat and fire are strictly controlled on the ISS.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Seattle coffee giant just reported its sixth-straight quarter of declining same-store sales. Starbucks was early to mobile ordering, launched its own digital wallet long before Apple Pay took off, and has one of the most popular loyalty apps in the food and beverage industry, with nearly 34 million active users. Mobile orders represent nearly a third of total transactions at U.S. company-operated stores. Niccol said he thinks Starbucks can thread the needle between convenience and coziness. “We have a strong digital offering and believe we can deliver the same level of convenience through our community coffeehouses with a superior mobile order and pay experience,” he said Tuesday. Starbucks is still leaning into technology under Niccol's leadership, including a new “Smart Queue” order sequencing algorithm built to help improve mobile ordering — which has been a sore spot for the company given how it creates congestion inside stores. The CEO said he hopes the changes can help reestablish “that moment of connection between a barista and their customer, bringing back warm and welcoming coffeehouses with great seats, delivering drinks in four minutes or less in the cafe and drive-thru while bringing order to mobile order…” The move away from mobile-focused stores comes as Starbucks' techie rival Luckin — which operates cashierless, app-only stores — just opened its first U.S. locations in New York City after overtaking Starbucks in China. During my quick stop at the pickup store in Seattle this week, I saw six or seven other people come through in a 5-minute span, at 5:45 p.m. on a Thursday evening. They walked in, grabbed their drink, and left — a grab-and-go, frictionless experience that Starbucks once imagined.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ask any homeowner: renovation projects are no fun at all. Plenty of startups have popped up to help homeowners tackle electrification projects, including installing solar panels and replacing gas furnaces with heat pumps. “As much as anything, we are leveraging their brand equity and trust,” Evan Anderson, co-founder and CEO of Pearl Edison, told TechCrunch. Pearl Edison works with utilities to identify customers who are most likely to benefit from energy retrofit projects, including heat pumps and additional insulation. It builds a white-labeled website for the utility, and it helps the larger organization run campaigns to sign people up for energy efficiency upgrades. Homeowners should save money, too, Anderson said, because Pearl Edison can contract the job for less since the installers don't have to waste time acquiring customers. Anderson said the company will add two more utilities this year. “We've found them to be good partners,” Anderson said. Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

Was it while investigating the intense morning shed routines on TikTok? Or perhaps an influencer who insinuated that using mouth tape at night would give me a sharper jawline? (Big shout-out to my algorithm for reminding me about that insecurity.) Nevertheless, it's become a consistent pop-up on my For You page, showing me users raving about how a colorful piece of tape across their mouth is helping them sleep better. Mouth tape is exactly what it sounds like: a piece of tape designed to sit across your mouth to keep it closed all night long. Mouth tapers rave about health benefits and better sleep, since it encourages you to breathe through your nose rather than your mouth. “Mouth taping is not a gimmick—it's a reminder to return to the way we're built to breathe," says Geoffrey Trenkle, a board-certified ENT, head and neck surgeon, and CEO of the Los Angeles Center for Ear, Nose, Throat and Allergy. But if someone experiences nasal blockage, snoring, or disrupted sleep, it's worth exploring why that's happening.” Mouth tape isn't necessarily a perfect solution to getting a better night's sleep, but if you don't have any airway problems, it can be something worth trying. You shouldn't just grab any kind of tape to use for this; as Andrew E. Colsky, a behavioral sleep medicine clinician and founder of the National Sleep Center, told me, “This is one of those rare instances where duct tape is not the answer.” The book Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art by James Nestor suggests you can even use first-aid tape as mouth tape. “Nasal breathing plays a critical role in regulating airflow, humidifying air, and supporting optimal oxygen exchange. It also helps maintain pressure in the airways, which can reduce snoring and support better sleep quality for some people,” says Carlos Nunez, chief medical officer at Resmed, a medical device company. Mouth tape is touted as a way to help you sleep better and snore less while sleeping. “It is a method generally intended to promote nasal breathing during sleep, which some believe can enhance sleep quality—though these claims remain largely hypothetical. In theory, keeping the mouth closed may help prevent the tongue from falling back toward the airway, and therefore decrease its potential to rattle (and thus contribute to snoring),” says David Benavides, a board-certified sleep medicine physician at Brigham & Women's Hospital. How bad is mouth breathing that people are actually taping their mouths shut? According to one expert, mouth breathing is a bigger problem than you'd expect. “Mouth breathing is wildly unhealthy for any person," says Ben Miraglia, an airway dentist and chief clinical officer at Toothpillow. Your nose is designed to filter out debris, allergens, and even tiny insects (thank those nose hairs), and it's designed to give your lungs and throat warmer, more moist air, according to the Cleveland Clinic. If you're coming here after hearing an anecdotal story about how mouth taping has made someone's sleep better, you aren't alone in hearing about mouth tape that way. There are no shortages of these videos online, frequently touting a specific tape they used. But for now, it's mainly personal perspectives supporting the narrative. “There is currently extremely limited clinical evidence to support the efficacy of mouth tape in managing sleep disorders," says Benavides. "One small study from 2022, often cited, looked at 20 people with mild sleep apnea. While these participants showed some improvement with mouth tape, the study didn't include a placebo comparison, and 20 participants is simply not enough to draw solid conclusions.” That's not to say it can never be used. Benavides says he has found use for it, even with his obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Specifically, he has found it useful for OSA patients who want to wear a nasal-only CPAP mask and who could add mouth tape to their nightly setup. "It may help minimize "mouth air leak" (where nasal-entry air escapes through the mouth during therapy) and improve both comfort and adherence. If you can breathe comfortably through your nose, mouth tape should be safe to do. “Mouth tape could potentially cause harm in many others. For example, those with moderate to severe sleep apnea may actually find themselves with even more impaired ability to breathe than before. Worse yet, it may further compromise those with central sleep apnea—a different type of apnea disorder,” says Benavides. “Another group to watch out for are those with impaired nasal breathing, as removing the ability to breathe through the mouth severely restricts their remaining—and often much-needed—airflow path.” The takeaway is this: If you can't breathe comfortably on your own through your nose as it is, mouth tape won't fix that for you. Overall, I usually got a solid night's sleep when using the tape, but some were less comfortable than others, and I found myself irritated by them and removing them during the night. After trying multiple kinds of tape, I had some pretty clear favorites. Dream says all of its mouth tape uses organic bamboo silk, and while there aren't any certifications on its site to back that up, the Plus+ tape is super soft and flexible on my face, easily the softest I tried. This set was also really comfortable, with a softer texture and a larger shape that will fit all kinds of lip sizes. This set promises to hold overnight skin care products, and I tested this tape with the Laniege Lip Sleeping Mask ($24) on my lips and found it stayed on when I used both together. Dream Recovery Mouth Tape for $34: I like this one because it has a wide and tall design, but the Plus+ version is so much softer. Heronlink Micropore Premium Tape for $17: This is at the top of Amazon's recommended mouth tapes, and it's a fine option. Loftie Mouth Tape for $30: This set is pretty comfortable, and I like the small opening for a water straw without giving me too much wiggle room. But it left behind the most sticky residue after using it, and the design of this tape is a little Ronald McDonald for my liking. I loved it almost as much as the Dream and Say Less I recommend above, and it's definitely one of the most secure tapes without being too restrictive or coarse. It did come with a cute little case for my bedside. Queen Tape for $13: This tape is comfortable, and I constantly see it advertised on TikTok, but I didn't find the adhesive secure. VIO2 Unscented Mouth Tapes for $27: This has a different style of design, with an H-style look to it versus tape that covers a minimal amount of your skin. I didn't like it as much as full tape designs, but this is a good option if you want security without full coverage. After trying so many mouth tapes, the question remained: Did they work? Did I sleep better and wake up more rested? I had the same kind of sleep I would without mouth tape: better, deeper sleep on days I had more physical activity and kept to my routines better, and worse sleep on nights after I forgot to go outside and do anything beyond hunch over a screen (she says as she types at her desk, staring at yet another screen). Some nights I woke up and ripped the mouth tape off in irritation, other nights I slept all night long with it on my face. Some nights I had to take it off at 3 in the morning because my toddler was up yet again, so the inconsistency could be me and my own daily routines. Did they have an inconsistent bedtime routine, and now adding something that makes them mentally prepared for bedtime is what's changing their life? Perhaps it's not the tape so much as the need for a bedtime routine to tell their body and mind it's time for bed. There's no way to be sure if that's the secret benefit of mouth tape, but it is known that a good bedtime routine to wind down before bed makes for better sleep. If you're looking for other solutions to help with nasal breathing, mouth tape isn't the only option. Trenkle recommends a handful of different medical and lifestyle changes. "Tools like nasal dilators or strips can also help keep the nose open during sleep. For patients with sleep apnea or structural airway issues, we offer targeted therapies—from oral appliances to surgical solutions—depending on the diagnosis.” Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.
