Both women ease their heartbreak with new men on opposite sides of the world: Amanda finds love with Iris' brother (Jude Law) while Iris connects with a film composer (Jack Black). The film takes place in December, making it a de facto Christmas movie. “The Holiday” was rumored for a sequel in 2022. “So many DM's about this,” Meyers captioned on Instagram. Winslet told People magazine of the rumored film, “I read something about that, but it's the first I've heard of it. I promise you, not an agent or a representative or anyone from the first one around has had any conversation with me about that. Her co-star Law later shared how “The Holiday” is one of his most enduring films. “Ninety percent of the audience put their hand up.

No cast is confirmed at this time, with the story being kept secret. Krasinski and Allyson Seeger's Sunday Night Productions are producing with Platinum Dunes. Sunday Night has a first-look deal with the studio. The A Quiet Place franchise has grossed over $900 million worldwide across its three films, which is comprised of John Krasinski's A Quiet Place and A Quiet Place Part II, and the Michael Sarnoski-directed spinoff A Quiet Place: Day One. The pic, which starred Krasinski, wife Emily Blunt, Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds, received an Oscar nomination for Sound Editing. A Quiet Place Part II, which saw its release pushed due to Covid, brought the box office back alive during Memorial Day weekend 2021 with a $57M four-day start, ending with a $160M domestic and $297.3M global haul. Last summer, A Quiet Place: Day One, a prequel set in an apocalyptic New York City ravaged by the aliens and starring Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn, debuted to $52.2M and legged out to $139M domestic and $262M global.

Apple TV+ has in the works a limited series adaptation of the 2006 romantic comedy, which starred Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black, sources tell Deadline. Krissie Ducker (Sweetpea) is writer/executive producer for The Holiday series, produced by Left Bank Pictures, with Rob Delaney (Catastrophe) also brought on as a writer. Meyers has no involvement in the project, I hear.

Amanda meets Iris' widower brother (Law) while Iris meets an associate of Amanda's, a film composer (Black). Released during the 2006 holiday season, The Holiday was a box-office success and, almost two decades later, it remains a Christmas staple (despite Meyers never intending for it to be a Christmas movie). Actor-writer Delaney co-created and starred with Sharon Horgan on the acclaimed Channel 4 comedy series Catastrophe. This marks his return to Apple TV+ where he starred in Season 1 of Bad Monkey.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The recently signed tax cut and budget bill took back $1.1 billion in previously approved funds. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which directs federal funds to local public TV and radio stations, says it will shut down after having those federal dollars taken away. The decision comes a few weeks after Congress passed a bill that included Trump administration priorities of tax cuts, cuts to Medicaid, increased spending for defense and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, among many other things. What's Being Lost in the Documentary Space As Congress Defunds Public Media PBS and NPR Funding Face "Devastating" Cut as Rescission Package Heads to Trump's Desk The CPB said on Friday that it will lay off the majority of its staff by the end of its fiscal year on Sept. 30, with a “small transition team” remaining through January 2026 to finish winding down operations and ensuring final distribution of CPB funds to local stations. “Public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country. Money from the CPB has provided partial funding to PBS TV stations and National Public Radio outlets, though the majority of most stations' budgets come from donations and corporate grants. “These cuts will significantly impact all of our stations, but will be especially devastating to smaller stations and those serving large rural areas,” PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger said in July. “Many of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JD Vance is sounding off about the somehow-still-going controversy surrounding Sydney Sweeney‘s American Eagle jeans ad. Doja Cat Mocks Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle Ad Amid "Genes" Versus "Jeans" Controversy I mean, it actually reveals something pretty interesting about the Dems though, which is that you have a normal all-American beautiful girl doing like a normal jeans ad. Concluded Vance: “I actually thought that one of the lessons they might take is ‘we're going to be less crazy.' So much of the Democrats is oriented around hostility to basic American life. While Vance's comments were targeted towards Democratic leaders who want to win the midterm elections, CNN noted in its coverage, “No prominent Democratic Party leaders or officials have commented on the ad.” So it seem like Vance is taking generic progressive online uproar and trying to attach it to elected officials who haven't actually said such things. “I don't want to alarm you, but the internet is mad about something,” Colbert said. “This time, it's a commercial from American Eagle Outfitters starring Sydney Sweeney … Just like Sydney Sweeney, I also carry the gene for sexy commercial scratchy voice. I get it from my uncle on my mother's side … Now, some people look at this and they're seeing something sinister, saying that the genes-jeans denim wordplay in an ad featuring a white blond woman means American Eagle could be promoting eugenics, white supremacy and Nazi propaganda. That might be a bit of an overreaction — although Hitler did briefly model for Mein Kampfort Fit Jeans.” Colbert added: “How do you say ‘badonk' in German?” Neither American Eagle nor Sweeney have commented on the backlash.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JD Vance is a big fan of Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle campaign. In one ad, Sweeney zips up a pair of jeans and, in a tone that's meant to be seductive but seems a bit more like she's getting over a cold, says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring… My jeans are blue.” In another, she stands in front of a billboard that reads, “Sydney Sweeney has great genes,” but the word “genes” is crossed out and replaced with “jeans.” Or, in Vance's words on a recent episode of the right-leaning Ruthless podcast (via Variety), “My political advice to the Democrats is continue to tell everybody who thinks Sydney Sweeney is attractive is a Nazi… That appears to be their actual strategy.” The thing is, the people Vance are mocking don't hold any governmental power at all. According to CNN, “no prominent Democratic Party leaders or officials have commented on the ad,” at least as of this writing. People have also decried its apparent male-focused marketing and characterized it as a white supremecist dog whistle that holds up Sweeney's white skin and blonde hair as a beauty ideal. This view is, unsurprisingly, a little too socially conscious for Vance, who couldn't help but use it as an example of Democrats' “hostility to basic American life.” “I actually thought that one of the lessons [Democrats] might take is we're going to be less crazy. And the lesson they have apparently taken is we're going to attack people as Nazis for thinking Sydney Sweeney is beautiful,” the vice president continued. That's how you're going to win the midterm, especially young American men.” “Let me get this straight, Don Jr.. You look at Sydney Sweeney, and your first thought is, ‘She's hot like my dad'?” Colbert riffed. Lena Dunham's Too Much is just right By Juan Barquin July 10, 2025 | 11:00am</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Okay, Mandy Moore just gave us all the family vibes with a new beach photo that's equal parts adorable and chill. She's rocking a swimsuit alongside her husband Taylor Goldsmith and their three kids (August “Gus,” 4, Oscar “Ozzie,” 2, and Louise, 10 months) looking like the ultimate squad goals. It seems like the kind of family snapshot that's totally real; no fuss, just good times and sun-soaked memories. Well, it gives a shoutout to her friend Gaby, making it clear this trip wasn't just about beach days but hanging with some of her closest pals too. She also calls out the Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita, saying “What an epic few days… we can't wait to come back.” And apparently, little Gus hasn't stopped talking about the trip, so you know it was epic. It seems like Mandy and Taylor are nailing that tricky balance of parenting three kids while still making time to relax and have fun. Back in 2024, after the birth of their third child Mandy even told Today, she was “Endlessly grateful for our family of 5 (and our very own big three) and soaking in every moment of this special time.” Mandy's family pictures always have this easygoing, no-frills energy that's a nice break from the usual polished celeb shots. It seems like she's really owning the ups and downs of family life, and honestly, it's refreshing to see someone so famous just enjoying the everyday moments with their kids. “I'm endlessly grateful to the moms in my life who model what it takes, lend an ear, make the best suggestions, and generally make me feel less alone on the journey,” she explained. Because sometimes, all you really need is good company, sandy toes, and a little sunshine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's administration keeps denying that the Department of Veteran Affairs is headed toward privatization — just like it couldn't stop denying that mass layoffs of 80,000 employees wouldn't impact veteran care. But facts have a way of catching up. After intense pressure from veterans' groups and Congress, the administration was forced to walk back its plan — cutting 30,000 jobs instead. Already, though, the VA has lost thousands of health care staff since January — including 688 physicians and 1,882 registered nurses — while still claiming its services remain unaffected. That's a 10 percent increase over last year and, in theory, should be good news for veterans and the people who care for them. While the administration claims it's focused on “eliminating waste” and “empowering local leaders,” in reality, it is hollowing out the VA's internal capacity. VA staff are being stretched thin, even as more veterans enter the system. Instead of hiring more nurses, claims processors, or crisis responders, the administration is pushing billions of dollars into the private sector via expanded community care programs. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time Framed as a way to reduce wait times and empower veterans through online self-scheduling, the bill would expand veterans' ability to seek care outside the VA system. No one denies that veterans deserve choices in their health care. Long-term cuts to Medicaid — totaling more than $1 trillion — will inevitably force the closure of many rural hospitals that veterans depend on. And with a hollowed-out or dismantled VA system, these veterans will be left sicker, poorer, and without access to the care they've earned. It warned that rising costs of private-sector care — $30 billion in FY2023 alone — are threatening to “materially erode the VA's direct-care system.” This erosion isn't hypothetical. Staffing shortages are so severe that 82 percent of VA facilities report critical nurse vacancies — and now even more jobs are being cut. Rather than fix the staffing crisis, the Trump administration is shifting resources away from VA hospitals and clinics and into for-profit care. For example, funding for in-house VA medical services is being cut by 17.4 percent, even as the Community Care budget jumps 50.7 percent. Combined with cuts to food assistance that many veterans rely on, reductions in federal agency staffing where one in three employees is a veteran, cuts to housing programs that prevent veteran homelessness, and deep cuts to Medicaid — on which over a million veterans depend — it has never been more clear: Trump and the GOP hate taking care of the veterans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moving forward after a long marriage is never easy, but Fisher is embracing the challenge with optimism. The actress is opening up about life after her split from Sacha Baron Cohen. In her Harper's Bazaar Australia August cover story, the “Now You See Me: Now You Don't” actress revealed she's been navigating a period of transition following her divorce from actor Sacha Baron Cohen. Fisher candidly shared that she's had “a tough couple of years” but is finding strength in rediscovery. Fisher and Cohen were together for more than two decades, having first met at a party in Sydney in 2001. In a joint statement posted to Instagram Stories, the former couple wrote: “We are proud of all we've achieved together and, continuing our great respect for each other, we remain friends and committed to co-parenting our wonderful children.” Despite their separation, Fisher & Cohen have publicly supported each other. Fisher wished Cohen a Happy Father's Day on Instagram, calling him “the best father our children could hope for.” Meanwhile, Cohen left encouraging comments on her Valentine's Day and Harper's cover shoot posts, calling them “stunning” and “great.” On the work front, Fisher is keeping busy with several film projects. The exciting lineup includes the upcoming comedy “Spa Weekend” and the highly anticipated sequel “Now You See Me: Now You Don't”, set to hit theaters on November 14, 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new interview with Vulture, Bill Burr is extremely resistant to being defined on the political spectrum (he makes the case that both right and left are bad, classically citing the supposed “overcorrection after #MeToo” as an issue on the left). And yet he talks a lot about politics and the current state of affairs, roasting conservative commentator Ben Shapiro for complaining that Burr is “woke” now. “He doesn't even know what that word means,” Burr says, observing that Shapiro only came to see his stand-up “to be annoyed so he can then have something to talk about and then he can make money off dividing his own country. There's a really ugly thing going on out there, and we've already seen what it does to a nation, and it's not the way to go.” Burr says his comedy lately is focused less on the politicians and more on the “puppeteers,” the people who pay our politicians: “And they're always distracting us with other stuff. Personally, Burr wouldn't interview a president on his podcast (“not with my intellect”) and suggests that there are a lot of dumb people out there acting as if they're smart by presenting information that they don't truly understand: “It's not just reading a bunch of smart shit, putting it in your head, and then puking it out at people. You're torturing people.” But entertainers getting involved in politics was “happening before” the podcast boom, he notes. But I just feel like now that everybody has a camera, it's just so all over the place. I just think the landscape of it has changed.” Like that idiot Ben Shapiro: ‘He's woke now!' “He was trying to bring me into his fold. I'm supposed to look at that guy like he's an adult?” You can read the full interview here.

Physical reissues follow, via Superior Viaduct imprint W.25TH, on October 31. That one is streaming for the first time, after its initial run of 50 lathe-cut LPs and a handful of cassettes. All Cindy Lee albums have been removed from Spotify at the artist's request, a press release notes. While a number of those records—not including Diamond Jubilee—had been officially uploaded to Spotify in the past, only two remained before being taken down yesterday: What's Tonight to Eternity and Model Express. Diamond Jubilee got its vinyl release in February, having previously been exclusive to Cindy Lee's Geocities page. The project's other albums were similarly hard to find, including Act of Tenderness and Malenkost, which had been removed from Bandcamp and only returned today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Burr vehemently rebuffed his conservative critics in a new interview with Vulture, stating that people who call him “woke” don't even understand the word, while also calling out the “horrible people” who send racist pictures to him and his wife. The exchange began when Burr was asked about far-right commentator Ben Shapiro, who leveled the “woke” criticism after attending one of Burr's stand-up shows last year. “He doesn't even know what that word means,” Burr fired back. “His definition of woke is white liberals' definition of woke, and they didn't even know what it was; they just took the word from Black people. Speaking on Shapiro specifically, Burr claimed he just attended one of his shows so he'd have “something to talk about” online and “make money off dividing his own country.” “Those people,” Burr added, “It's treason what they do.” “They send pictures of monkeys to me and my wife. There's a really ugly thing going on out there, and we've already seen what it does to a nation, and it's not the way to go.” “You voted for a guy that is staring off into space … Your fucking party has not let you choose your candidate since Obama's second term.” The comedian stated flatly he wanted nothing to do with any of it. “[M]y new perspective is there's nothing wrong with being a billionaire, but if somebody is working 40 hours a week, 160 hours a month, and they can't make their rent, you're not paying them enough money,” Burr said. They can't even go out and get a filling.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

There are a few jokes that “The Naked Gun” screenwriters and long-time partners Dan Gregor and Doug Mand are sad didn't make it into Akiva Schaffer's long-hoped-for new entry into the spoof canon. For two creators (best known for everything from “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” to “Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers”) who can still easily and amiably recall the feeling of seeing “Spaceballs” or the original “Naked Gun” films for the first time, it's a dream come true. We need those kinds of dreams these days. Related Stories In Review: It's Not Too Late for the Movies to Reject AI Moviefone Lives Again! Call Today and You'll Be Greeted by Peter Dinklage's Toxic Avenger In it, Neeson is Frank Drebin Jr., the grizzled cop son of original star Frank Drebin (the incomparable late Leslie Nielsen), who also happens to be seemingly genetically predisposed to wacky happenstance in his day-to-day life. When Frank takes on a big case, which inevitably brings him into the orbit of the alluring Beth Davenport (Pamela Anderson), he has to use all his brain power (silly jokes) and muscle (a love of chili dogs) to save the day, get the girl, and make everyone laugh while doing it. Ahead, Gregor and Mand tell IndieWire about their hopes and fears around the film's reception (some sparked by this very website), writing for an Oscar nominee who can also punch a wolf, Pamela Anderson's otherworldly scatting, and the kind of jokes that could only live inside this delightful sort of package. IndieWire: We're going to start with the big, scary one: What is it like when you see a headline on IndieWire that calls your film the most important movie of the summer? Dan Gregor: And then we read the whole article. And he then goes into saying it's going to fix America, too. Not me, I want nothing to do with either of those endeavors. Gregor: I always felt that America just needed a laugh, and that the only thing keeping us apart is a little bit of comedy. But I'm the first person to deflect and be like, “It's a movie, guys. And what we do is silly.” But I will say this, talking to other people around LA, that is a little bit of the vibe, of people feeling like this has to do well so that other comedies and scripts will be bought. I do feel that there's a lot of people [who] want this to work. Mand: Even other studios and studio executives who are normally competitive are like, “No, no, no, we all want your movie to do well.” Which is a very lovely place to be in. It's a genre, in the large category of comedy and the small category of spoof, that has been very neglected for a while. As passionate comedy fans, it would mean a lot to us to have that be back in a sort of meaningful, central place. Gregor: The generational divide on this type of comedy is really interesting, because it's disappeared for 20-some years. We noticed in some of our test screenings, people under a certain age, mostly teenagers, it took them a couple of minutes just to get the education on how these movies work. Is that going to be a plot point?” And you're like, “No, no, that's not important.” It's cartoon logic, you can always snap back to normal. Hopefully, the ads are doing the education now, where people are understanding, “Oh, this is really, really silly.” But I do think that there's a reintroduction of this type of comedy. Gregor: That's our hope with the intro, that it does feel like you almost have a little CliffsNotes of like, “Oh, this is what a spoof feels like.” If we've done it justice, it should feel like you're in the genre of an action movie, a heist movie or a heist scene, and then something happens that's ridiculous, but we're still in the heist movie. Hopefully, that gets people in the mood for what they're about to see for the next hour and a half. What are your memories of seeing spoofs when you were younger? The “Naked Gun” movies, “Airplane!,” “Spaceballs,” all that good stuff. Gregor: As a kid who grew up obsessed with this as a genre, Mel Brooks and “Monty Python” were everything to me. “Naked Gun” and “Spaceballs” were everything to me. [I remember] moving to California and getting to drive down the highway where the two silos are, where in the beginning of the first [“Naked Gun” movie], Frank Drebin says, “Everything I see reminds me of her,” and it's just those two giant boobs. I was driving to San Diego after the fires this year with my wife, because we were kind of escaping the fires and it was a very stressful time, we were kind of in a fight, and we're passing the boobs and I was like, “The boobs are there. Mand: It's “Spaceballs” and all the “Naked Guns” that really left a mark on me. I remember, as a kid, knowing that maybe I didn't understand more than half of “Naked Gun,” and still loving it. Then coming back to it after starting to write sketch comedy in college and stuff, and there's a scene where Frank is questioning a guy at the docks for information, and it's the classic trope of the guy being like, “Eh, maybe I've seen him, maybe I ain't.” And Frank offers him a 20-dollar bill, and before you know it, the guy from the docks is like, “Well, why do you want to know?” And Frank goes, “Ah, I forget. And I was like, “This is a perfect comedy scene. But it's funny the way that a good spoof can still work, even if you're not completely caught up on what is the inspirational source material. Gregor: The first “Naked Gun” holds up to this day; it is still as funny as it was in 1988. Most comedies, even the best ones, are dated within a couple of years, and with “Naked Gun,” that did not happen. I think a big part of that was that they were basing it on already a throwback genre, “Police Squad” is based on “M Squad” and “Dragnet.” These are procedurals from the '50s and '60s, and so they already had a timeless quality to them. That was definitely a big part of this movie for us, was to not try to be particularly topical, to hopefully feel like this is just a take on the last 20-some years of the genre of action movies, of detective movies. Our hope is that it has a little more longevity for not being topical. We wanted it to already be dated, so it wasn't something that would feel stale in a year or two. Going back to thinking about the 25-year-olds and the teenagers watching it, how would you hold those two things in your head as you're writing, that you want this to have sort of a weird timeless quality because it is a throwback, but you also would like to bring in younger people to the fun? Mand: This is something we talk about a lot, but I think you have to write to what makes you laugh first and foremost. The minute you're like, “I want everyone to like this,” then you're making a movie for almost no one. That's the first goal, and then it goes joke by joke, and then you're like, “Is this so specific?” And then is it so specific, but we don't care because we still like it? I remember watching “Barbie,” and that's a billion-dollar hit film— Gregor: And what was the song that Ken played? Mand: And I'm just like, “These jokes are for them or for their friends.” They didn't get huge laughs, but it didn't matter because you feel that you're in that movie and you're like, “This is a joy to watch.” Gregor: It's the Looney Tunes lesson, which is you don't need to get every joke as much as you need to feel that the joy of the writing is there, because that part is infectious. I didn't know any of the opera references that they were making in Looney Tunes, but I could feel like, “Oh, man, I feel clever for being a part of it. People have wanted this kind of joy for a while — a “Naked Gun” reboot has been kicking around in Hollywood for years, and there have been many iterations of star, writers, and director attached. Something that felt very important was that the only reason this movie exists in our minds is because Liam Neeson agreed to do this. We were dead set that we need to really honor that original “Airplane!” template of only casting dramatic actors, and looking at it really, really through the lens of drama. But, we're comedians and we're friends with comedians, and it was very painful to tell all of our comedian friends, “Fuck off,” but— With Liam, there's really nobody else in Hollywood who has both that gravitas and has not sort of smirked his way out of it with a Marvel movie. Mand: So the whole approach of it for us three when we sat down was like, “We have Liam Neeson.” And Liam Neeson has this body of work, so we have to go back into this body of work, and also movies that haven't been spoofed that he isn't in, all the “John Wicks,” the “Mission: Impossibles” that haven't been touched, which is also a gift for us. And Liam is not trying to be that, so it was, let's lean into the fact that we have Liam Neeson here who is a generational talent, one of the greatest of all time, and he's doing these silly lines. That was the whole point, so it was less about the other scripts or projects before, and it was more just like, “Liam's here, what do we do with Liam?” Gregor: He's such a good actor actor, so he'd show up and really the first take would be perfect almost without fail. Then, he had this thing that he would say, after the script would make him do something particularly embarrassing or awful, when they'd yell cut, he would go like, “I'm Oskar Schindler, dammit, what's happened to me?” I think he had a really good time. There are so many little touches throughout the film that will delight spoof fans, running gags you just build on. What is the calculus of writing stuff like that? Gregor: It's the math of heightening, where you're like, “OK, we had the first joke where he's just wasteful, he's just tossing the coffee cup.” And then those throws get more and more aggressive. The one joke that we found on set was him driving against the green screen, and then our prop master just [handed him a coffee]. That's another one of the old-fashioned tropes of the genre, especially Mel Brooks would do this a lot, we're just acknowledging that we're driving on a green screen. To us, that felt like a really fun nod. The green screens have gotten a lot better, and so people don't always register [them], but I always feel like there's a little part of the back of your brain that is registering Uncanny Valley. It used to be that there was just a horse chase or something going on behind your carriage and you're like, “That's fake.” With your background, I'm not surprised that there are some songs in here, including this incredible sequence of Pam scatting. Gregor: Do you remember the Kim Cattrall video? Mand: But we're not going to be as funny as that, but what's the second funniest thing we can do? But that's Pam being unreal and a gift. That song was a lot of trial and error of what's going to play as silly versus what's not going to play as, like, is she really good at this? Gregor: We recorded that as a real track with her beforehand. The amazing artist Liz Gilles basically coached her through it and helped us write some of the very musical stuff. The very first time that it was all performed [as a whole] was the very first take on set, so the whole crew was seeing this as a real performance. And Pam got a standing ovation on set from the audience of crew and cast who were just like, “Holy shit, that was spectacular. I'll say our saddest thing is that there was just the best scatting of the “Super Mario Brothers” underwater theme, and that was in all of the cuts until the 11th hour when Nintendo said that they weren't going to let us do it. That brings to mind — and this is one of the few movies I would ask for this — what are things in the movie that you would hope that people really can look out for, and maybe they look out for it in their second watch? Gregor: This is not a spoiler or like an Easter egg kind of joke, but the detail that I continually love more than anything is when Frank is angry at Beth for deleting his old episodes of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and it's just the sound effect of him slowly clicking through an old TiVo. We actually did dig up the old TiVo sounds, and they have this weird, dated quality. Gregor: There's like a water drippy kind of sound to it. I still can't believe they made it. I can't believe that we're here right now in London about to go see a premiere of it. Gregor: Oh, keep an eye out for the beaver. Going back to the hope that this is a success for comedies, but also specifically for spoofs, what are your big hopes for what this might do to the spoof market? Gregor: I hope it brings us back, spoofs very specifically, but even just the concept of a very big, silly movie, and that comedies can just be fun. Mand: [There can be] comedy-forward movies, not an action movie with jokes, a kid's animated movie with laughs, a romantic comedy, just like a movie that is here to make you laugh. I feel like there's just become so much fear, that it's got to be comedy on top of something else as opposed to just being like, “The point of this movie is to make you laugh, and hopefully feel things as well.” It's one of the tricks of these movies… that you may forget that the plot is there, but if you do it correctly, if you look at it, the plot makes sense, and the love story is something you actually care about. Not too much that it's getting in the way of the jokes, but just enough to root for it. But a friend of mine described this as “a fresh Mario board with untouched coins,” and I like that metaphor. And the longer we've been away from it? I mean, God, the superhero genre is so ripe for spoof at this point, too. A Paramount Pictures release, “The Naked Gun” is now in theaters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Young Thug, 2 Chainz, Gucci Mane, Future, T.I., Waka Flocka Flame and more are featured on the set. Metro Boomin dropped some heat on Friday (Aug. 1) with his A Futuristic Summa mixtape. The hip-hop superproducer's MySpace-themed website revealed 23 tracks would be featured on A Futuristic Summa, which is hosted by renowned Atlanta DJ/producer DJ Spinz. Outside of Dash, Quavo, Young Dro, 2 Chainz, Lil Baby, Future, T.I., Waka Flocka Flame, Gucci Mane, Young Thug and more were previously revealed as features. He also echoed Tyler, the Creator's sentiments about wanting people to dance again without the pressure of being perceived behind screens. The Atlanta-bred hitmaker has been busy this year helming tracks on other artists' Billboard 200-topping albums, including The Weeknd's Hurry Up Tomorrow, Playboi Carti's MUSIC and JACKBOYS' second album. A Futuristic Summa arrives one year after Metro and Future's chart-topping LPs We Don't Trust You and We Still Don't Trust You. “Like That” with Kendrick Lamar from We Don't Trust You was also nominated for best rap song and best rap performance.
