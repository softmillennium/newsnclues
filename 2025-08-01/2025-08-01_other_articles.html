      I have some questions for JD Vance for whoever is interviewing him next on this topic:
    


      What type of shenanigans is his mentor Peter Thiel up to with Sean Kirkpatrick/Enigma Labs/promoting/debunking this topic? Why does it seem like he supports disclosure and against disclosure at the same time? What are his actual intentions here?
    


      If JD Vance is so interested in this topic, ask him why he doesn't publicly support the bipartisan UAP Disclosure Act that was just introduced in the Senate. And maybe prevent House Republicans like Mike Johnson/Mike Turner/Mike Roberts from blocking it again this time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mama June Shannon is in the hospital just shortly after a psychic warned her about future health troubles. On the July 25 episode of Mama June: Family Crisis, the 45-year-old met with a psychic with daughter Jessica Shannon and husband Justin Stroud for Jessica's bachelorette party. During the session, the psychic told June that she's "lost a lot of her health” and is carrying a lot of stress, which isn't good. The psychic added that she "may have a heart attack" because of it. Justin suggests taking June to the hospital but she refuses. “It is way worse than it has ever been,” June said as they got in the car to go to the emergency room. Ovarian cysts are common; the Mayo Clinic states that "many women have ovarian cysts at some time," and most "present little or no discomfort and are harmless." However, large or ruptured cysts "can cause serious symptoms," including severe pelvic pain and bleeding, fullness or heaviness in the abdomen and bloating. In rare cases, a ruptured ovarian cyst may require surgery. Many celebrities have revealed their painful experiences with ovarian cysts, including Hailey Bieber, Marsai Martin, Kate Beckinsale, Hilary Swank, Lena Dunham, Olivia Culpo, Miley Cyrus and more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And that, according to Seth Meyers, just proves “how confusing” Trump's “bulls–t conspiracy theories” are. “Oh, dude, don't admit that,” the comedian said. Don't tell the world you are off by a country mile.” “That's how confusing Trump's bulls–t conspiracy theories are,” Meyers added shortly therafter. That said, the late night host has a guess at why Trump struggled so much to understand. To kick off the “A Closer Look” segment, Meyers poked fun at the president's age, reminding viewers that he is 79. The NBC host noted that it's been easy to forget, “because he was often next to someone who was really old, but he's still old.” “You can just see his age getting to him,” Meyers said. “He can't hear or understand reporters' questions anymore, even when those reporters are trying to tee him up by parroting his own bulls–t back to him.” You can watch Seth Meyers' full “A Closer Look” segment in the video above.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been over a year since Psychic Fever from Exile Tribe dropped their hit song Just Like Dat, and AsiaOne recently caught up with the Japanese boy band to find out how their journey has been since. The Just Like Dat music video, which premiered in January 2024, has amassed over 20 million views on YouTube and youngest member Weesa, 21, said they didn't expect the virality. JP THE WAVY - PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE Formed in 2019, the seven-member group - consisting of Tsurugi, Ryoga Nakanishi, Ren Watanabe, Jimmy, Kokoro Kohatsu, Ryushin Handa and Weesa - had a few pre-debut releases before their official debut in July 2022 with the album P.C.F. Ryoga, 27, recalled how they spent six months training in Thailand right after their debut. "We faced many challenges there but it was a valuable experience for us. We learned a lot of things which helped us go global," he said. J-pop has been having a resurgence of sorts in recent years, and when asked how they felt being part of this new wave, Kokoro, who turns 25 in November, added how they debuted with the main goal of going global. The group recently released their EP Psychic File III, and while the title track Gelato is a catchy summer tune, it's only a peek at what Psychic Fever has to offer. "In this EP we have four songs and each one is in a different genre, so I think it can be enjoyed by people of all ages," said Ryushin, who turns 24 in Deccember. "It has our usual style but also a different way of expression. Please pay attention to the lyrics and choreography as well," he added. Having spent so much time touring the past year, we wanted to know what they've learnt about each other. The question though, was met with seven loading buttons. At one point, Ren, 25, seemed to be thinking up an answer and after a few minutes of the members waiting for his thoughts, he gave up and facepalmed. Ever-so-motherly Ryoga stepped up with a response: "We spent a lot of time together during our US tour and I got to see who wakes up the earliest and how a member eats their breakfast. "Through spending more time together, I was able to see how they motivate themselves for the live shows." When there's a mix of introverts and extroverts in the group, one person would usually take the lead and initiative. No part of this article can be reproduced without permission from AsiaOne.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Social media feeds across Australia were alight with footage of what people thought were UFOs flying over Queensland and northern New South Wales on 30 July. But experts say what people actually saw was a Chinese rocket as it passed over Australia. Professor Jonti Horner was able to match the sightings from his home state with a Long March 8A rocket launch from Hainan. The rockets are used to launch satellites for China's state-owned internet network into space. Tsunami warnings have been issued in Russia, Japan, Ecuador and Hawaii. The new section is part of a plan to close 'critical' gaps in the border wall and enhance security operations. Donald Trump tells the BBC he is "disappointed" with Vladimir Putin over the lack of a ceasefire deal in Ukraine. Video footage from eyewitnesses captures lights in the sky over Doha during Iran's missile strike Protesters took to the streets in New York, LA, Washington DC and Toronto after the US hit Iranian nuclear sites. The US president warns Iran of future attacks if they retaliate. President Donald Trump is weighing whether the US will join Israel's strikes on Iran as the two Middle Eastern countries continue attacks. Eyewitness, Katie Kalisher tells the BBC what happened after coming face to face with the suspect of a shooting that left two dead in Washington. Video appears to show suspect Elias Rodriguez being taken away by police and shouting 'free Palestine'. One moment the conversation was all about golf, then a reporter asked a question about genocide in South Africa. In an extraordinary Oval Office meeting, Trump pressed Cyril Ramaphosa on widely discredited claims of a white genocide in South Africa. US President Donald Trump has said the US has "no stronger partner" than Saudi Arabia during his first major foreign trip.</p>
