                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler announced Friday she is stepping down from her role at the central bank, creating an important vacancy at a time when President Donald Trump is pushing for lower interest rates. In a letter addressed to Trump, Kugler, 55, did not state a reason for her decision to leave, only noting that she will be returning to Georgetown University as a professor in the fall. "I am especially honored to have served during a critical time in achieving our dual mandate of bringing down prices and keeping a strong and resilient labor market." Kugler's term was set to expire at the end of January 2026. A Biden nominee, she joined the Board of Governors in September 2023, filling the unexpired term of Lael Brainard, who left to serve as an Biden economic advisor. As a governor, Kugler was a permanent voter on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Her resignation now paves the way for Trump to put his own nominee in for the board. Two of his prior appointments, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, voted against the decision at Wednesday's meeting to hold the Fed's key rate steady, instead indicating they wanted to lower. Kugler of late has expressed generally hawkish views, expressing support for holding rates steady until the impact Trump's tariffs are having on inflation becomes clearer. Fed Chair Jerome Powell wished Kugler well, saying "She brought impressive experience and academic insights to her work on the Board." We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A jury in Miami has determined that Tesla should be held partly liable for a fatal 2019 Autopilot crash, and must compensate the family of the deceased and an injured survivor damages of $329 million. A Tesla owner named George McGee was driving his Model S electric sedan while using the company's Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system. While driving, McGee dropped his mobile phone that he was using and scrambled to pick it up. He said during the trial that he believed Enhanced Autopilot would brake if an obstacle was in the way. His Model S accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 miles per hour, hitting a nearby empty parked car and its owners, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle. Her body was discovered about 75 feet away from the point of impact. Her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, survived but suffered multiple broken bones, a traumatic brain injury and psychological effects. "Tesla designed Autopilot only for controlled access highways yet deliberately chose not to restrict drivers from using it elsewhere, alongside Elon Musk telling the world Autopilot drove better than humans," Brett Schreiber, counsel for the plaintiffs, said in an e-mailed statement on Friday. "Tesla's lies turned our roads into test tracks for their fundamentally flawed technology, putting everyday Americans like Naibel Benavides and Dillon Angulo in harm's way." Following the verdict, the plaintiffs' families hugged each other and their lawyers, and Angulo was "visibly emotional" as he embraced his mother, according to NBC. The verdict comes as Musk, Tesla's CEO, is trying to persuade investors that his company can pivot into a leader in autonomous vehicles, and that its self-driving systems are safe enough to operate fleets of robotaxis on public roads in the U.S. Tesla shares dipped 1.5% on Friday and are now down 25% for the year, the biggest drop among tech's megacap companies. The verdict could set a precedent for Autopilot-related suits against Tesla. About a dozen active cases are underway focused on similar claims involving incidents where Autopilot or Tesla's FSD— Full Self-Driving (Supervised) — had been in use just before a fatal or injurious crash. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration initiated a probe in 2021 into possible safety defects in Tesla's Autopilot systems. The agency then opened a second probe, which is ongoing, evaluating whether Tesla's "recall remedy" to resolve issues with the behavior of its Autopilot, especially around stationary first responder vehicles, had been effective. The NHTSA has also warned Tesla that its social media posts may mislead drivers into thinking its cars are capable of functioning as robotaxis, even though owners manuals say the cars require hands-on steering and a driver attentive to steering and braking at all times. A site that tracks Tesla-involved collisions, TeslaDeaths.com, has reported at least 58 deaths resulting from incidents where Tesla drivers had Autopilot engaged just before impact.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Friday fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, hours after the agency reported that job growth in the U.S. had slowed to a near-halt. In a Truth Social post that also directed even more fire at Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump accused BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer of being a political appointee who was manipulating jobs data. "I was just informed that our Country's "Jobs Numbers" are being produced by a Biden Appointee, Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, who faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's [Harris'] chances of Victory," Trump wrote. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified," he added. CNBC has reached out to the BLS for comment. NBC News confirmed that McEntarfer has been fired. The BLS operated under the Department of Labor, whose commissioner, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, is a Trump appointee. In particular, the large revisions have been a target. In his spending plan this year, Trump proposed an 8% reduction in staff at the bureau, raising questions over the integrity of its counts on employment, consumer prices and multiple other economic metrics. The bureau has had to impute a growing amount of estimated data into a number of its reports. "Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes," the president wrote. "McEntarfer said there were only 73,000 Jobs added (a shock!) but, more importantly, that a major mistake was made by them, 258,000 Jobs downward, in the prior two months. After the June numbers had been released initially, the White House put out a statement calling it a "June Boom." The weak jobs report Friday preceded a sharp drop in markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off more than 500 points and the tech-focused Nasdaq off more than 2%. "I can't believe what I just saw," said Peter Mallouk, president and chief investment officer of Creative Planning. Trump's social media post seemed like a parody or satire at first, Mallouk said. "We can't have a set of numbers come out and fire somebody that served under numerous administrations in various roles because you don't like the numbers." Along with his tirade against McEntarfer and the BLS, Trump for at least the third time Friday tore into the Fed's Powell, who has advocated that the central bank not lower interest rates until it has a better idea of how the president's tariffs will impact inflation. "The Economy is BOOMING under 'TRUMP' despite a Fed that also plays games, this time with Interest Rates, where they lowered them twice, and substantially, just before the Presidential Election, I assume in the hopes of getting 'Kamala' elected – How did that work out?" "Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should also be put 'out to pasture.'" The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy arm, on Wednesday voted to keep its benchmark interest rate steady, where it has been since December. However, following the weak jobs report, futures markets priced in a strong possibility the Fed will cut in September. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Friday said that he ordered two nuclear submarines "to be positioned in the appropriate regions" in response to warnings made to the United States this week by high-ranking Russian official Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev in a social media post on Monday wrote that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine "is a threat and a step towards war." "Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country," Medvedev wrote on X that day. Trump earlier Monday had said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners. On Friday, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, "Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that." "Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences. I hope this will not be one of those instances," Trump said. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" Medvedev, in his tweet Monday, wrote, "Trump's playing the ultimatum game with Russia: 50 days or 10… He should remember 2 things." "Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country. Don't go down the Sleepy Joe road!" Medvedev added, referring to former President Joe Biden. Trump in a Truth Social post on Thursday warned Medvedev about his rhetoric, while also taking a shot on Russia's trading partnership with India. I don't care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care," Trump wrote. "We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World. "Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together," Trump said. "Let's keep it that way, and tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he's still President, to watch his words. Medvedev responded Thursday with a statement saying, "If a few words from a former Russian president can provoke such a nervous reaction from the sitting and supposedly formidable president of the United States, then clearly Russia is entirely in the right and will continue on its chosen path." "As for his remarks about the 'dead economies' of India and Russia and 'venturing into dangerous territory,' perhaps he should revisit his favorite movies about the living dead and recall just how dangerous the mythical 'Dead Hand' can be," Medvedev said. The Dead Hand is Russia's system for automatically launching nuclear strikes if a nuclear attack is detected against the country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two sexual abuse victims of Jeffrey Epstein and the family of late Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre on Friday blasted President Donald Trump after learning that Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell had been transferred to a less restrictive prison in Texas from Florida. "This move smacks of a cover up," Epstein victims Annie Farmer and Maria Farmer, as well as Giuffre's relatives said in a statement. "President Trump has sent a clear message today: Pedophiles deserve preferential treatment and their victims do not matter," the statement said, noting that the two women and Giuffre's family had not been notified of Maxwell's transfer before media reports of it. Maxwell's transfer to minimum security camp in Bryan, Texas, came after two days of meetings she and her lawyer had last week in Tallahassee, Florida, with a top Justice Department official. That official, Deputy Attorney Todd Blanche, is Trump's former criminal defense lawyer. Trump is a former friend of Epstein and Maxwell. "It is with horror and outrage that we object to the preferential treatment convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has received," the statement said. "Ghislaine Maxwell is a sexual predator who physically assaulted minor children on multiple occasions, and she should never be shown any leniency," the statement said. "This is the justice system failing victims right before our eyes. The American public should be enraged by the preferential treatment being given to a pedophile and a criminally charged child sex offender. "This move smacks of a cover up. A senior administration official told NBC News, "Any false assertion this individual was given preferential treatment is absurd." "Prisoners are routinely moved in some instances due to significant safety and danger concerns," the official said. "They wait anxiously and expect to be afforded full access to all relevant information concerning the criminal conduct that has so severely damaged them," Scarola said. "Then, once properly informed, they look forward to having their voices be heard with respect to any action concerning Ms. Maxwell that might be contemplated." Maxwell was convicted at trial in 2021 of crimes related to grooming underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Blanche met with Maxwell for hours last week after saying he was interested in learning whether she had information about other potential abuses of girls and women in Epstein's orbit. Blanche asked Maxwell "maybe about 100 different people," her lawyer David Oscar Markus said last week. Blanche's meeting raised questions about whether the Trump administration will seek a reduction of Maxwell's sentence or whether President Donald Trump will pardon her. The Justice Department and Trump have been criticized for nearly a month for failing to release evidence accumulated in an investigation into Epstein despite prior promises to make that information public. The New York Sun first reported that Maxwell had been transferred from her prison in Florida. Epstein died in August 2019 from a jailhouse suicide, weeks after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Manhattan Shooting:

It was just after 1:30 a.m., and Jessica Tisch was walking the eerie quiet of 345 Park Avenue, surveying the detritus of a deadly attack.

As the scrunch of broken glass cut the silence and blood still glistened on the floor, a distraught Tisch confronted her most challenging moment yet as New York City's police commissioner. Mere hours earlier, a lone gunman with an assault rifle stalked this very space, ending the life of four people before taking his own. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marcus Lemonis — the multimillionaire entrepreneur known for dishing out tough love tactics and advice to small businesses across the US — returned to reality television this summer. "Every episode, I'm meeting businesses at a crossroads," he told viewers during the double episode premiere of Fox's "The Fixer." From 2013 to 2021, Lemonis also hosted another reality show, CNBC's "The Profit." Its premise was similar to that of "The Fixer": Lemonis offered capital and advice to what were described as "struggling" small businesses in exchange for partial ownership and being put "100% in charge." It also resulted in a sprawling mess of lawsuits, arbitrations, confidential settlements, and small business owners who say that Lemonis damaged their companies and reputations. Of the roughly 100 businesses featured on "The Profit," more than 50 filed lawsuits, engaged in mediation talks, or settled with Lemonis and NBCUniversal over the harm they say they endured. Business Insider has learned that in 2021, NBCUniversal, CNBC, Comcast, Lemonis, and the show's production company settled for $11 million, with 40 companies that appeared on "The Profit" paid $275,000 each. In two cases, NBCUniversal, Lemonis, and their affiliated companies secured more than $20 million in judgments, loan repayments, and legal fee awards after lawsuits filed by companies that appeared on the show went to arbitration. Business owners have accused Lemonis and NBCUniversal of aggressive tactics, broken promises, loading on debt, and deals that unraveled after filming. Business Insider interviewed more than a dozen people involved with the show and reviewed thousands of pages of court records, correspondence, and confidential settlement documents. Lemonis and NBCUniversal have denied the allegations, saying the CEO was only trying to help companies already in trouble. In an interview with Business Insider, Lemonis said he had won "any claim that was ever brought against me." I sleep at night very well," Lemonis said. "And the amount of money that I ever got out of the businesses — including loans, interest, in any business of any kind — this isn't specific to any business — was zero." Now, Fox has brought Lemonis back to the air with a familiar concept. Lemonis, 51, got his start selling cars and hustling RVs, snapping up dealerships in the early 2000s that he rolled into a national chain. In 2024, he took over as executive chairman of Beyond, Inc., the parent company of Bed Bath & Beyond, shortly after the home goods brand declared bankruptcy. He was appointed principal executive officer a year later. "The Profit" first aired in July 2013, part of an attempt by CNBC — NBCUniversal's business news channel — to find programming for the after-market hours. Lemonis promised to invest his money, often in exchange for an ownership stake, to help revamp small businesses across the country. He would negotiate on-air, handshake agreements with business owners and declare himself "100% in charge" before implementing a slew of changes. If owners expressed doubt, Lemonis and producers told them to "trust the process," business owners alleged in legal and mediation records. The show took off on social media and, within three years, CNBC said it was its most-watched original series telecast with 1.9 million viewers. In early 2021, Gerard Fox, a Los Angeles-based litigator with a background in high-profile commercial and entertainment law, sent a series of letters to lawyers at Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal. The letters, which have been reviewed by Business Insider and have never previously been reported on, were put together on behalf of dozens of participants on "The Profit," detailing what they described as their negative experiences with the show. After Fox sent his letters, both sides entered into mediation, according to one person involved, heading off potential litigation by many of the businesses. The settlement agreement was signed by senior executives at Comcast, NBCUniversal, CNBC, Lemonis, and the production company, and included non-disparagement clauses for the companies involved and a reciprocal confidentiality clause. Parties on both sides of the settlement denied wrongdoing. Gerard Fox declined to comment for this story. After a lawsuit he filed on behalf of another business that appeared on the show was dismissed in federal court, a judge sanctioned Fox, saying she was misled about the terms of that dismissal. "While some did not succeed, the show aimed to help businesses get to profitability and shine a light on the challenges that face small business owners across the country." Many business owners declined to comment, with some citing contracts they signed prior to filming that stipulated heavy fines for speaking about the show. In 2023, NBCUniversal and the production company settled with five more businesses, which were represented by the law firm Quinn Emanuel, according to court documents. That same year, NBCUniversal also settled with the owners of an Illinois marina company who claimed that their business was disparaged on the show. Lemonis was not a party to these settlements. At least five people said they had been suicidal or engaged in suicidal ideation, according to the report. "If the narratives presented in these interviews reflect what actually happened to those whom I interviewed, I can see how they were injured and how and why their symptoms arose," Marmer concluded. "Most of them will need ongoing treatment to recover from the PTSD and gaslighting they experienced." "I was surprised that CNBC stuck with him as long as they did," said Dan Isenhart, a longtime employee at the Southern California wine shop Amazing Grapes, which filed for bankruptcy three years after appearing on the show and was not part of the settlement. For some companies, appearing on "The Profit" was a boon. Mike Anderson said revenue for his and his brother's business, now focused on screen printing, is 10 times what it was when they filmed their show. Another business owner, Ana Quincoces, said her ongoing relationship with Lemonis has been fruitful, including work he directed her way. The two considered opening a restaurant together, she said. Quincoces added that her prior experience with reality TV — she appeared on "The Real Housewives of Miami" — may have better prepared her for the experience. By 2021, Steve Weissmann's business, Tumbleweed Tiny House, was bankrupt, embroiled in litigation it would ultimately lose, and millions of dollars in debt to Lemonis. "We were growing at 60 percent compound annual growth rates, which is very successful growth," he told Business Insider. On the first day of filming, Lemonis expressed concern at the way Weissmann accounted for customer deposits, Weissmann said. When Weissmann asked Lemonis what the future of the company looked like to him, Lemonis responded, "You not going to jail," according to a transcript from the taping. When he went home after filming, Weissmann said he held his wife while they cried, and she vomited. Weissmann, who said that his accounting was above board, said he decided to take the deal offered on-air or risk being called a criminal on TV. What did make it to air was Weissmann telling Lemonis, "I'm running on the edge." They ultimately verbally agreed to a deal that involved Lemonis loaning $3 million to the business in exchange for 75% ownership. It also involved a radical change to Tumbleweed's business model. Lemonis told Weissmann to move Tumbleweed away from custom builds and toward standard units. According to statements in court filings, after the episode aired, Lemonis eventually stopped responding, and Tumbleweed was left with excess inventory from the production of standard units. After months of turning down orders for custom homes, Tumbleweed started to run out of cash, according to statements in court documents. Along the way, Tumbleweed also took on loans of around $2.8 million from a Lemonis company to stay afloat. Less than three years after appearing on "The Profit," in 2020, Tumbleweed filed for bankruptcy, which Weissmann called "devastating." Weissmann responded by filing a counterclaim and then a lawsuit against NBCUniversal, Lemonis, the production company, alleging fraud and breaches of fiduciary duty, among other claims. An arbitrator sided with the defendants, writing "the weight of the evidence shows that Lemonis was attempting to 'save' Tumbleweed, not have it fail, even if he did not ultimately succeed." In early July, a judge confirmed a $14.4 million arbitration award to NBCUniversal, Lemonis, Camping World, and the production company against Weissmann and Tumbleweed, including $7.7 million in attorney fees. An arbitrator awarded $7.1 million, including more than $6 million in attorney fees, to NBCUniversal, the production company, and Camping World after the trustee of the bankrupt design firm Precise Graphix lost in arbitration. Other business owners allege that Lemonis took advantage of companies he pledged to help, according to interviews and legal records reviewed by Business Insider. In one 2016 lawsuit, the owners of a Pennsylvania-based restaurant franchise, My Big Fat Greek Gyro, said they applied in hopes of expanding and selling more franchises. While filming, the lawsuit said, they agreed to a deal with Lemonis for $350,000 in exchange for a 55% stake in the business. "Eighteen months into the show, we had no income." The lawsuit, which alleged, among other things, fraud, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty, is ongoing in state court. Lawyers for Lemonis have called the claims "baseless," arguing he invested millions of dollars to try to "salvage plaintiffs' floundering business," and allegations of misconduct were, in reality, Lemonis "operating the business pursuant to his undisputed decision-making powers as the controlling owner of The Simple Greek." The 2021 settlement talks were not the first time that participants on the show attempted to notify NBCUniversal about their complaints, according to Fox's letters and other records obtained by Business Insider. In 2013, a business owner hired an attorney to prevent NBCUniversal from airing their episode, after they said misrepresentations were made during filming, the letters say. That year, the family member of a different business owner wrote to CNBC's president and chairman; NBCUniversal's CEO; and several other network executives. She said the show portrayed her family in a false light and defamed them, according to the letters. While speaking on the "Shark Tank Podcast" in 2015, Lemonis said that following one of the episodes, he "got emails from the family and aunts and uncles and cousins and how upset they were that I had portrayed them that way." CNBC aired the show's final episode in September 2021. Now, as another batch of businesses appear on Fox's "The Fixer," Steve Weissmann says he wishes he'd never said yes to "The Profit." "I was on a reality television show and made to look like an idiot." Have a tip about reality TV, Hollywood, or the networks?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump isn't saving the SAVE plan. The Department of Education announced earlier in July that interest charges for student-loan borrowers on the SAVE plan are restarting on August 1 after being paused for a year while the plan was facing legal challenges. SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden, intended to give borrowers more affordable monthly payments with a shorter timeline to debt relief. Interest rates vary depending on when the loan originated. Linda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, said in a statement that she recommends borrowers "quickly transition to a legally compliant repayment plan," like income-based repayment, to avoid balance growth. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of student-loan borrowers grappling with changes to debt relief and repayment in the last year. Share your story by emailing asheffey@businessinsider.com and read more here: Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Chuck Schumer sent a letter to McMahon saying that the restart is "devastating for millions of American families." "It defies logic and the law that a months-old preliminary injunction against SAVE, which makes no mention of the interest-free forbearance, requires you to start charging interest to millions of borrowers in forbearance now," they wrote. The lawmakers also cited a backlog in income-driven repayment plan processing that would make it difficult for borrowers on SAVE to switch to a new plan. While the department said in its press release announcing the interest charges that borrowers who switch to a new plan "can expect quick and timely processing," the department in May reported a backlog of nearly 2 million income-driven repayment applications. The income-based repayment plan, which the department specifically mentioned as a viable option for SAVE borrowers, is also facing a debt relief processing delay. The department posted on Federal Student Aid that loan forgiveness through IBR plans is paused to update payment counts without providing a timeline for when relief will resume. For now, borrowers can choose to remain on SAVE while interest accumulates, or they can switch to a new plan and make payments. These changes come amid Trump's broader plans to dismantle the Department of Education. Share your thoughts with this reporter at asheffey@businessinsider.com.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Our tariff bill is $2 billion, and that's a net number," Farley said in an earnings call. The company had projected a tariff hit of $1.5 billion in its last quarter. Farley told analysts he expected automakers to adopt a regional rather than globalized approach toward their businesses. "We increasingly see Europe, North America, and Asia becoming kind of regional businesses with tariff rates that are aligned for those three or four regions," Farley said. Farley said in an interview with Bloomberg on the same day that the Trump administration's reduced tariffs on Japan would give its Asian rivals a "meaningful" cost advantage. Last week, President Donald Trump said the US would lower its tariffs on Japan to 15% from 25%. The reduced tariffs, lower labour costs, and favorable exchange rates "really advantage their export," Farley said. Farley told Bloomberg that Ford was working with the Trump administration to "minimize our tariff expense so that we can get more competitive." Farley said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this year that Trump's 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico was a "windfall for South Korean and Japanese companies." If it goes beyond that, obviously, it will be billions and billions of incremental profit headwinds for the company," Farley told the outlet in February. On Wednesday, Ford's shares fell by nearly 1.6% in after-hours trading. The company's shares are up by 9.8% year to date. "The administration is simultaneously working with our domestic steel, aluminum, and copper industries to ensure that they can meet the needs of American industry by expanding production right here at home," Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House, said. "Revitalizing the American auto, steel, aluminum, and copper industries are not mutually exclusive goals," he added. August 1, 12:00 a.m. — This story has been updated with comments from Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy scrambled to calm investor concerns over growth at the company's cloud and AI business. Jassy fielded tough analyst questions about AWS's growth and its position in the AI race. The stock tumbled 7% in after-hours trading, weighed down by disappointing profit guidance and Jassy's vague responses on AI. During the call, Jassy was asked about rival companies' "significantly faster cloud growth." AWS reported revenue growth of 17%, a far slower rate than Microsoft and Google's cloud businesses. Jassy said AWS has a much bigger revenue base, which makes comparing growth rates difficult. He also said AWS has better security and functionality than peers, while stressing its "pretty significant" leadership position in cloud market share. The Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak followed up by asking about Wall Street's "narrative right now that AWS is falling behind" in AI, with concern about losing share to competitors. He pointed to AWS's lower-cost Trainium AI chip as a potential draw for customers seeking better price performance. He rattled off new agentic tools and developer features and then circled back to familiar territory, comparing today's AI shift to the early days of the original cloud boom, which AWS pioneered. "Remember 85% to 90% of global IT spend is still on-premises," Jassy said. Colin Sebastian, a senior research analyst at Baird, told BI that despite AWS's continued growth, the market's reaction was concerning. "Contrasting with Azure and Google Cloud Platform growth, it's hard to disprove the emerging Wall Street narrative that competitors are gaining ground and momentum from AWS," he said. During the call, Jassy added that AWS still had capacity issues across electricity, chips, and server components, with power being the "single biggest constraint." He said it would most likely take several quarters to meet the demand shortage. One encouraging sign for AWS is that its cloud market share has barely budged over the past year.</p>
