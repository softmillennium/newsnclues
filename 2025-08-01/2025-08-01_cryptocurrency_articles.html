                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's 10th anniversary celebration was marked by an uptick in institutional demand for Ether as an alternative treasury reserve asset, prompting Wall Street to look past Bitcoin. Ethereum's 10th anniversary was marked by a significant milestone in terms of institutional crypto adoption, as cryptocurrency treasury firms surpassed $100 billion in collective investments on Thursday. Ethereum's 10th birthday brought renewed corporate interest in Ether (ETH), which saw the 10 largest corporate crypto treasury firms amass over 1% of the total Ether supply since the beginning of June, according to a Tuesday report by Standard Chartered. Ether's corporate adoption is “happening faster than with Bitcoin during its early treasury adoption phase,” since Ether enables corporations to tap into staking yields and “actively generate value,”  Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at Brickken asset tokenization platform, told Cointelegraph. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, circulated an early version of the white paper in 2013. Here's a look back into Ethereum's first decade, featuring the ICO boom, DeFi summer and the rise and fall of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Corporate cryptocurrency treasuries are emerging as a new class of public companies bridging traditional finance and digital assets, signaling increasing institutional interest in crypto. Corporate cryptocurrency treasury firms, including Strategy, Metaplanet and SharpLink, have collectively amassed about $100 billion worth of digital assets, according to a Galaxy Research report released Thursday. Corporate buyers are becoming a key source of Ether liquidity alongside US spot ETH exchange-traded funds, which recently posted 19 consecutive days of net inflows, a record for the products. “We think they may eventually end up owning 10% of all ETH, a 10x increase from current holdings,” the bank said, adding that Ether treasury firms have more growth potential than Bitcoin treasuries, from a “regulatory arbitrage perspective.” Abu Dhabi-based Bitcoin miner Phoenix Group launched a $150 million strategic cryptocurrency reserve, becoming the first publicly listed company on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) to establish a digital asset treasury. “Holding Bitcoin and other strategic digital assets isn't just about exposure. It's about alignment,” said Munaf Ali, co-founder and CEO of Phoenix Group. “We believe in the long-term value these networks represent, and our treasury strategy reflects that belief.” Publicly listed Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies became the largest Ether (ETH) treasury firm after announcing plans to acquire up to 5% of Ether's supply. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet is seeking to raise 555 billion yen ($3.73 billion) through a new stock offering to support its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The company, which is known as “Asia's Strategy,” announced Friday that it will issue perpetual preferred shares to fund its goal of acquiring 210,000 Bitcoin (BTC) by the end of 2027. The shares will offer up to a 6% annual dividend, depending on market conditions and investor demand. “The Company intends to actively pursue equity financing as part of its ‘Bitcoin Strategy,' which aims to acquire 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027,” it said. “We believe that introducing Bitcoin-backed preferred shares represents a pioneering effort to fill this gap.” Metaplanet's stock offering comes a day after Cointelegraph reported corporate crypto treasury firms had surpassed $100 billion in collective investments, with Bitcoin-focused treasuries amassing $93 billion worth of that value. Strategy, the world's largest corporate Bitcoin treasury firm, has launched similar capital-raising efforts. Decentralized finance platform Veda has appointed a former US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official to its ranks as it ramps up efforts to expand crosschain yield products aimed at institutional investors. During her SEC tenure, Le advised Congress on early drafts of digital asset legislation and served on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Global Markets Advisory Committee. According to her LinkedIn profile, Le was involved in some of the SEC's earliest crypto enforcement actions. She served in the SEC's Enforcement Division from 2016 to 2021, a pivotal period in the agency's crackdown on unregistered securities offerings tied to initial coin offerings (ICOs). During that time, the SEC brought actions against the promoters of BitConnect's lending program and against LBRY, alleging both conducted unregistered securities offerings. In 2021, the agency also initiated one of its earliest DeFi-related enforcement actions, charging Blockchain Credit Partners with securities fraud.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On July 31, 2025, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins delivered a major policy address at the America First Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., unveiling “Project Crypto”—a Commission-wide initiative to modernize securities regulation in support of President Trump's vision of the United States as the “crypto capital of the world.” Framing the moment as a defining opportunity for American leadership in digital finance, Atkins outlined a regulatory agenda focused on integrating “on-chain” (on blockchain technology) software systems into US markets, enabling decentralized finance, and launching a new “innovation exemption” to accelerate the commercial deployment of novel technologies. His remarks signal a significant shift toward a more flexible regulatory posture that could shape the future of the US digital asset market for years to come. Atkins emphasized his view that most crypto assets are not securities and that being classified as a security should not be a deterrent to development. He expressed support for crypto asset securities that offer features like voting rights and distributions. Atkins also rejected the need for premature decentralization or offshore structuring and advocated instead for a regulatory environment that encourages innovation and includes American investors. Atkins stressed that market participants must have “maximum choice” in how they custody and trade crypto assets. He reaffirmed his strong support for self-custody, calling it a “core American value,” while recognizing that many investors will continue to rely on SEC-registered intermediaries like broker-dealers and investment advisers. He also called for allowing market participants to operate across multiple business lines under the most efficient licensing structure possible and expressed support for regulatory flexibility that protects investors without imposing unnecessary burdens. Atkins identified enabling “super-apps” as a key priority of his chairmanship. He asserted that the federal securities laws do not prohibit SEC-registered venues from listing non-securities today. He explained that these systems vary in structure—some are fully decentralized and operate without intermediaries, while others have identifiable operators. Both models, he emphasized, should be accommodated within the regulatory framework. Atkins stressed the importance of enabling decentralized systems, such as automated market makers, which facilitate non-intermediated financial activity. Atkins also stated that the SEC will work to protect pure publishers of software code, clarify the distinction between intermediated and disintermediated activity, and establish practical rules for intermediaries operating on-chain. These systems, he said, should not be stifled by duplicative or unnecessary regulation. Atkins concluded by calling for a more flexible regulatory posture that prioritizes commercial viability. He proposed a new “innovation exemption” to allow novel business models and technologies to enter the market quickly, even if they don't fit neatly within existing SEC rules. This exemption would be principles-based, requiring compliance with core objectives of federal securities laws without imposing rigid or incompatible requirements. Atkins suggested that conditions under the exemption could include periodic reporting, use of whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality—which restrict transactions to pre-approved, compliant participants—and limitations on tokenized securities that do not comply with standards like ERC-3643, which embeds features such as identity verification and transfer restrictions. Atkins's speech marks a major shift in the SEC's approach to digital assets. Market participants should actively monitor key developments (including the GENIUS Act, the PWG Report, and market structure legislation), consider engaging directly with the Crypto Task Force, and review their business structure, products, and compliance programs to position themselves for this new regulatory framework.2</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The administration didn't give the Senate Agriculture Committee a full explanation when it halted Quintenz's committee vote this week that would have advanced his approval to a final Senate floor vote. "Many in our industry have significant concerns about this nomination," Winklevoss told CoinDesk. "Mr. Quintenz is not aligned with the president's stated agenda and objectives." Read More: Quintenz, Trump's Pick as Potential U.S. Crypto Watchdog, Delayed by White House Winklevoss and his twin brother, Cameron, fellow co-founder of Gemini and other shared business interests, are among the prominent crypto insiders who've occupied a front seat — literally — in the White House's recent campaign to elevate the U.S. digital assets industry. And when the president signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law, they were sitting in the front row beside other prominent figures, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Tether CEO Paulo Ardoino. So they've come to occupy a prominent place in the president's view of the crypto industry, raising questions about whether Gemini can get Quintenz booted from consideration. But Tyler Winklevoss argued it would be a mistake to put Quintenz in charge. The Gemini CEO contends that Quintenz has the wrong views on protecting developers, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), federal spending and is raising ethical red flags with reported communications he's made on behalf of the company he serves as a board member, Kalshi. "Quintenz supports prosecuting smart contract developers," Winklevoss said, calling it a "disqualifying position." In October 2018, then-Commissioner Quintenz gave a speech on smart contracts, saying that a developer should potentially be seen as legally liable if they could recognize their work would be used to skirt government regulations. The industry has a strong take on this matter, arguing that creators shouldn't be punished for how their creations are used. In much the same way that manufacturers of cars and firearms communication technologies aren't pursued by criminal prosecution for how their products are used by bad actors, the sector argues that digital assets innovators similarly shouldn't be on the hook for how their platforms and tools are utilized downstream, as long as the products are not actively managed by those who wrote the code. The industry position seems to fall in line with a speech Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins gave on Thursday to announce his agency's "Project Crypto," in which one of its effort will be "protecting pure publishers of software code." Winklevoss said recent revelations of emails sought under the Freedom of Information Act, in which Quintenz and an associate seem to have requested insight into the agency's work and deliberations on Kalshi rivals, "raise serious questions." Behnam's agency fought the industry in court, including Kalshi, though it recently abandoned that dispute. While CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline Pham has argued the agency took the wrong path, she said it's difficult to reverse its position on event contracts, which she characterized as "a sinkhole of legal uncertainty and an inappropriate constraint on the new administration." "The Trump Administration wants to cut red tape and deregulate," Winklevoss said. Republicans have routinely acknowledged that the agency is likely to seek more resources to allow it to oversee a broad new area of the financial sector and — for the first time — actively regulate a spot market, meaning a market where actual assets are traded, such as bitcoin BTC$114,887.46. When asked about it in a CoinDesk TV interview this week, top Trump crypto adviser Bo Hines granted that the agency may need more resources. The Gemini co-founder also interpreted some of Quintenz's past comments on central-bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as being open to discussion on a U.S. version — a possibility that's treated as toxic by Republican politicians and most of the crypto industry. But Quintenz's remarks in 2020 were relatively superficial, suggesting that it'd be important that the CFTC "stays abreast of legal and regulatory questions" around the government tokens, which he described in public remarks as an "area of particular interest to me." "You should not be interested in CBDCs or entertaining that kind of totalitarian technology," he said. "That in itself is disqualifying and against everything our industry stands for." From congressional candidates up to Trump, Republican lawmakers have painted the concept of CBDCs as a government campaign to seek control and surveillance over citizens' finances. But the idea never progressed further than a discussion point with some Democratic lawmakers and a topic of technical study among regulators and has never risen to an active project in the U.S., as China and Europe moved to implement government-backed digital currencies. The five-member commission currently has only two members — one from each party — and both of them have said they're leaving soon. That could potentially leave a freshly confirmed chairman alone atop the agency. But if Quintenz's nomination is abandoned or significantly delayed, people familiar with Acting Chairman Pham's plans suggest she's eager to move on, potentially in the coming weeks. Even if things get back on track, his final confirmation vote by the overall Senate could be further delayed. If Quintenz does continue through the process and become chairman, some legal experts have cast doubt on the strength of policymaking from a single commissioner on what's meant to be a five-member group. "I think when looking at the quorum rules, the agency can still act," former CFTC Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero told CoinDesk TV in a Thursday interview with Jennifer Sanasie. She suggested the potential investors in the space — including from traditional financial institutions — "they are all going to want some certainty." And that can be provided, she said, by the White House nominating more names and getting a full commission confirmed by the Senate, "but we haven't seen that, yet." When questioned about the value of having both parties represented on the commission during his confirmation hearing, Quintenz declined to second-guess Trump's nomination process.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. Even as crypto finds growing traction on Wall Street and among retail investors, few people regard the blockchain technology that powers it as useful or relevant to their day-to-day lives. A crypto startup called Subzero Labs wants to change this, and it plans to launch its own blockchain designed for use beyond just speculation. “We're doing something for the real-world users,” Ade Adepoju, cofounder and CEO of Subzero Labs, told Fortune. The startup announced Friday that it had raised $20 million in a seed round led by the crypto investment firm Pantera Capital. In 2021, he decided to take the plunge into crypto when he joined the startup Mysten Labs as an engineer. Founded by former Meta developers, Mysten Labs is one of the main companies behind the Sui blockchain, whose tech stems from Mark Zuckerberg's failed attempt to launch his own stablecoin. Adepoju helped build Sui from conception to launch, but, in early 2024, he took a career break. “I wanted to take a step back and observe what it meant to make a network actually successful,” he said. As he pondered his next move, he linked up with his cofounder Lu Zhang, also a former employee of Mysten Labs, and decided to get into the business of launching his own blockchain. Together, the two created Subzero Labs, which currently has 20 employees. Some might argue that, at a time when there are dozens of active blockchain projects, the world is not exactly clamoring for another one. In response, Adepoju argues that none are good enough yet to run real-world applications. “When you actually ask, ‘do we need another one?' it's like asking, ‘do we need another iPod? He's hoping his new blockchain, dubbed Rialo, will be that iPhone. An acronym, Rialo stands for “Rialo isn't a layer 1.” Layer-1 blockchains are like Ethereum, which is a decentralized network of servers that processes and stores data. Adepoju says Rialo isn't a layer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. He does say the blockchain is designed for non-crypto developers and that it allows engineers to replicate tools usually implemented outside a blockchain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What Happened: Speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Friday, Saylor emphasized that Bitcoin is "digital capital" and highlighted that Strategy's business model revolves around acquiring BTC and issuing structured credit products — including preferred stock, backed by it. He dismissed concerns about the size of Strategy's position, arguing that owning even up to 7% of the total Bitcoin supply is not excessive, especially for a public company leading the way in digital asset treasury management. Strategy now holds 628,791 BTC, or roughly 3% of Bitcoin's total fixed supply, valued far above acquisition levels. Saylor underlined the firm's disciplined, long-term BTC accumulation strategy. He forecasted that Bitcoin could deliver a 30% annual return over the next 20 years, outpacing traditional assets. "We don't want to own all the Bitcoin, we're just part of the first wave," Saylor said, referencing over 160 public companies now integrating BTC into their balance sheets. Saylor further argued that once regulation catches up, even tech giants like Apple and Microsoft will opt to hold Bitcoin over fiat, treasuries or gold. Why It Matters: Strategy just reported its strongest quarterly profit ever, bolstered by Bitcoin's rally and growing investor interest in BTC-backed structured products. Its latest offering, a $2.5 billion issue of Bitcoin-linked securities, is the largest IPO of 2025 so far, showing deep market demand.

A DIVIDED federal appeals court has overturned the fraud conviction of a former product manager at OpenSea, the world's largest marketplace for non-fungible tokens, in what prosecutors called the first insider trading case involving digital assets. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan agreed with Nathaniel Chastain that erroneous jury instructions could have led to his conviction merely for acting unethically, by misusing information that had no real value to his employer.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that its Crypto Task Force will host a series of roundtables across the country to provide opportunities for additional stakeholders to meet with Commissioner Hester Peirce, who leads the Crypto Task Force. “We want to hear from people who were not able to travel for the roundtables that took place this past spring in Washington, D.C. and may not have had a voice in past policymaking efforts,” said Commissioner Peirce. “The Crypto Task Force is acutely aware that any regulatory framework will have far-reaching effects, and we want to ensure that our outreach is as comprehensive as possible.” According to information available to BaFin, the company is offering banking business and/or financial services on its website finxtoro.org without the required authorisation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Hamieverse, a purpose-driven Web3 ecosystem combining gaming, AI mentorship, and immersive storytelling, announced today the development of its first on-chain game, to be built on Abstract Chain. The new game represents a major milestone in Hamieverse's mission to fuse entertainment with self-development and real-world impact. “Every day, billions run in circles chasing progress that never comes. Buried in debt, drained by meaningless jobs, and starved of purpose, we've accepted the trap. Hamie was born to shatter it,” said Mateen Mohammed, the Hamieverse's founder. In contrast to many blockchain games criticized for unbalanced mechanics, the Hamieverse is committed to fair, skill-based systems that reward strategy, learning, and consistent engagement. Each gameplay element connects to a four-stage philosophical framework representing personal transformation and the Hamieverse's ethos: To support this journey, Hamie AI functions as a personal digital mentor, offering mindset support, tailored insights, and behavioral tools to accelerate progress. The decision to build on Abstract Chain was guided by a shared belief that solving blockchain's user experience problem will finally bring mass adoption. “Our goal is to create meaningful, engaging, and accessible experiences. Abstract's tech stack allows us to onboard Web2 without friction or pain points. The first on-chain game is part of a broader August release slate that includes: Meanwhile, the Hamieverse Foundation has broken ground on its most ambitious mission yet: a solar-powered deepwater well in rural Africa, bringing sustainable clean water to over 2,000 people. This project exemplifies the belief that digital culture can produce real-world positive impact. “It spoke of decentralizing power, enabling radical transparency, resisting censorship, and banking the unbanked. So I set out to build something fundamentally different, rooted in real utility, unshakable transparency, real-world impact, and technology designed to empower self-development. Hamieverse is a Web3 ecosystem designed to help users break free from the psychological and financial traps of modern life through immersive gaming, multi-dimensional storytelling, gamified self-development, and AI-powered mentorship.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DraftKings Inc., the leading sports betting company, has officially received final court approval for its $10 million settlement with NFT buyers, marking the resolution of a legal dispute surrounding allegations that its nonfungible tokens (NFTs) violated securities laws. In a ruling issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Denise J. Casper of the District of Massachusetts granted final approval of the deal, stating it is “in all respects, fair, reasonable, and adequate to the settlement class.” The approval brings closure to a case filed by lead plaintiff Justin Dufoe, who alleged that DraftKings' NFTs constituted unregistered securities and led to financial losses for purchasers. Under the DraftKings $10M deal NFT buyers final approval settlement, approximately 26% of the midpoint of estimated damages—ranging between $18 million and $58 million—will be recovered by eligible class members. The court also approved attorney fees totaling over $3.33 million, along with nearly $53,000 for litigation expenses. Dufoe was awarded a $50,000 service award in recognition of his role in the case. Filed in early 2023, the lawsuit claimed DraftKings' NFT drops gave purchasers a reasonable expectation of profits, based on the company's continued control of the platform and marketplace. While DraftKings sought to dismiss the suit, arguing the NFTs did not meet the definition of securities, Judge Casper denied the motion in July 2024, allowing the case to proceed and ultimately leading to this settlement. Attorneys representing the NFT buyers included firms Berman Tabacco, Kirby McInerney LLP, Hannafan & Hannafan Ltd., and G. Dowd Law LLC. DraftKings was represented by WilmerHale and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. USA Herald covers everything from breaking news to investigative journalism.</p>

The Information Commissioner's Office has issued guidance to help organisations disclose documents securely after serious data breaches, including at the Ministry of Defence. Emily Keaney, deputy commissioner at the ICO, said: “We have seen a number of serious data breaches, including at the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Ministry of Defence, which have involved documents being disclosed without proper checks for hidden personal information – this crucial step cannot be missed. “All organisations must have robust measures in place to protect the personal information they hold and prevent it from being inadvertently disclosed. Edwards said inadvertently sharing data in this way “is not a new or novel issue” but is one that organisations “must guard against because the consequences, as in this case, can be severe. The ICO chose not to issue a fine in this case. Edwards explained that the ICO had "applied considerable resource" over the last two years to understand what happened, how it happened and what the MoD was doing to ensure it would not happen again. He said the ICO "determined that there was little we could add in this case that would justify the further allocation of resource away from other priorities. "Organisations must do better to ensure mistakes like this don't happen and understand the serious implications to people's lives if they get it wrong. "We recognise that there are issues of public confidence and accountability, and that we possess specific skills which other accountability bodies might wish to call on in order to gain the reassurance of a formal investigation. We remain willing to have those conversations with relevant stakeholders." Personal information can be hidden or not immediately visible in documents, and if they are not checked properly, it may be disclosed by accident – sometimes with serious consequences. The new guidance contains practical steps and how-to videos to help organisations understand how to check documents, including spreadsheets, for hidden personal information and reduce the risk of a data breach. It includes simple checklists and how-to videos, covering topics such as: Read the most recent articles written by Tevye Markson - Former Sun editor David Dinsmore appointed as perm sec-level director of comms</p>

In this respect, the Pakistan Crypto Council's (PCC) CEO, Bilal Bin Saqib, who is also the 0Prime Minister's Special Assistant on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, shared exclusive thoughts on this development. Hence, this move is focused on commencing Pakistan's exclusive epoch of financial sovereignty. Saqib also mentioned that Pakistan plans to gear up for a transparent and secure digital currency ecosystem. Thus, rather than just experimenting, the authorities are laying a robust groundwork to carry out the wider economic shift. In line with the statement of Saqib, establishing a unique and flawless crypto framework to incorporate crypto assets will be a significant step toward a broader change in the worldwide economy. Apart from that, Jameel Ahmed, the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), also announced a notable development. Thus, he confirmed the start of a pilot project for digital currencies, parallel to the drafting of legislation to regulate virtual assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR ) has confirmed that it is actively exploring the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as part of its broader strategy to promote financial inclusion and digital innovation. It would offer added benefits, including faster transactions, secure offline payments, and improved access in areas affected by network disruptions or electricity outages—especially in rural communities. The Bank has begun conducting a five-month closed-loop proof-of-concept phase with a limited group of participants, including staff from both the central and commercial banks, merchants trialing offline payments, and institutions testing USSD features. The project focuses on understanding user experience, technical feasibility, and potential risks. Areas under examination include cybersecurity, legal frameworks, and the integration of CBDC into Rwanda's existing payment infrastructure. Strengthening payment resilience during network or power outages The pilot is expected to conclude in October 2025. However, the central bank clarified that no formal launch is planned at this stage. This initiative marks a significant milestone in Rwanda's digital finance journey, as the country continues to position itself as a regional leader in inclusive and tech-driven financial systems.

Botswana🇧🇼 Passes a Virtual Assets Bill to Regulate Trading of Cryptocurrencieshttps://t.co/MujR12HcgN This process includes internal capacity building, research, and stakeholder consultations,” Pelaelo said. This approach aligns with the cautious and research-driven stance seen across Southern Africa, where central banks in Namibia, Zambia, and South Africa have all undertaken similar assessments. Namibia's central bank confirmed earlier in 2024 that it was developing a CBDC sandbox to guide further testing. Next Phase of Project Khokha, South Africa's 🇿🇦 CBDC, to Explore Interoperability and ‘DAO Principles' Botswana's financial regulator has also observed global developments, especially from nations that have launched or piloted CBDCs like Nigeria (eNaira) and Ghana (eCedi), to inform its next steps. This made Botswana one of the few African nations with a formal legal framework for crypto and virtual asset regulation, attracting players like Yellow Card, which operates under the new regime. Additionally, Botswana has been highlighted for its commitment to modernizing its payment systems as part of a regional push toward interoperable and inclusive digital finance ecosystems in the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
