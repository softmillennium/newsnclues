                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Order suggests president might be ready to launch nuclear strike against Russia as tensions rise over Ukraine war Donald Trump has said that he has deployed nuclear-capable submarines to the “appropriate regions” in response to a threatening tweet by Russia's former president Dmitry Medvedev, suggesting that he would be ready to launch a nuclear strike as tensions rise over the war in Ukraine. In a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump wrote that he had decided to reposition the nuclear submarines because of “highly provocative statements” by Medvedev, noting he was now the deputy chairman of Russia's security council. “I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,” Trump responded. “Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences, I hope this will not be one of those instances.” Medvedev, who was sidelined when Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, is also an avid fan of X, formerly Twitter, where he often posts aggressive and curiously worded attacks against western countries and leaders in the evening in Moscow. Earlier this week, Medvedev had attacked Trump for shortening his timeline for Russia to make progress toward peace with Ukraine from 50 days down to just 10, saying that he was ready to impose sanctions and other financial penalties against Russia if it didn't comply. “Trump's playing the ultimatum game with Russia: 50 days or 10,” Medvedev wrote in a post. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country. “Don't go down the Sleepy Joe road!” he added, referring to the former US president Joe Biden. Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Trump has voiced frustration with Putin, who he said had been stalling on Trump's efforts to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, a campaign promise that he said that he could achieve in just 24 hours. Another city was just hit,'” he said in at the White House last month. On Friday, he said he wanted a “lasting and stable peace” in Ukraine but gave no indication that he was willing to make any concessions to achieve it, after a week in which Russian missiles and drones again caused death and destruction across Ukraine. “We need a lasting and stable peace on solid foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and would ensure the security of both countries,” said Putin, speaking to journalists on Friday, a week before a new deadline imposed by Trump for hostilities to cease. Last week, the third round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul, but broke up in less than an hour and have so far led to no agreements except on prisoner exchanges. In an apparent reference to Trump's comments, Putin said on Friday: “As for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations.</p>

A small, emaciated Palestinian boy in Gaza named Amir was killed by Israeli forces just moments after receiving aid from American contractors in May, former U.S. Green Beret Anthony Aguilar has recounted. The horrific incident took place during his 45 days in Gaza with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) — and was one of over 800 killings of Palestinian aid seekers near GHF sites. In interviews this week, Aguilar said that on May 28, just two days after GHF sites first opened in Gaza, he and another U.S. guard encountered a boy, who he identified as Amir. Aguilar said that he and the other contractor thought Amir may be hurt, because he was carrying only small bags of rice, flour, and lentils that he picked up from the ground. “The [American contractor] standing next to me — this young boy holds his hand, and he kisses it. Then he comes to me, and he holds my hand, and he kisses it,” Aguilar said in an interview with Tucker Carlson, explaining that kissing hands is a sign of deep respect in Arab cultures. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Aguilar shared pictures of Amir with news outlets. The young boy is small and skinny, his bare feet covered in dust. He had no shoes on, his pants were tattered, he had a kind of a rope or string holding his pants up. I can feel the bones in his shoulder. I can feel the weakness in his arm. Shortly after, Israeli soldiers killed Amir at the same location. Amir left with the crowd to exit the GHF site, as Israeli forces and American contractors ended the aid distribution as they often did, with tear gas, pepper spray, and bullets. And Amir, along with a number of people who left, was promptly shot by Israeli forces and killed, Aguilar said. And they lack basic human decency,” he said. The story of Amir is one of numerous similar incidents that Aguilar says he encountered during his 45 days with GHF in Israel and Gaza. In at least one case captured on video by Aguilar, he says that U.S. contractors have also opened fire on Palestinians. In another instance, Aguilar said that he was told by Israeli soldiers to shoot at children at the aid distribution site, and he refused. He was then disciplined by a higher up within the U.S. firm overseeing GHF operations, Safe Reach Solutions, with the executive telling him to never say no to a client — in this case, the Israeli military. GHF has tried to discredit Aguilar, saying that he was fired and that he is disgruntled and spreading “false allegations.” But Aguilar has refuted these claims, showing documentation of his contract termination and saying that he left his contract early because his concerns over the GHF mechanism were dismissed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs could face a prison sentence “substantially higher” than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges. They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. 3 sentencing. In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed. Each prostitution-related charge carries a potential maximum 10 years in prison. Prosecutors said after the verdict that they thought federal sentencing guidelines meant to prevent wide disparities in sentencings for the same crimes would likely call for a prison term of four to five years. Judge Arun Subramanian will have wide latitude in determining a sentence and can choose to ignore the guidelines, which are not mandatory. Combs' lawyers have said they believe the guidelines, if properly calculated, will call for 21 to 27 months in prison. On the day of the verdict, prosecutors won a bail fight after defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo argued Combs should be freed immediately on bail. And he cited severe conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Combs has been held since his September arrest at a New York hotel. As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,” Agnifilo wrote earlier this week. Prosecutors also said conditions at the federal lockup had improved considerably before Combs was arrested. A federal judge in January 2024 had blasted conditions at the jail, including its extensive lockdowns and inadequate medical care. Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"The demographic and economic losses Russia will suffer as a result of this outbreak will have repercussions for decades and may ultimately even exceed the damage it has sustained from its invasion of Ukraine," the report said. It attributes the rise to several factors including blood transfusions for wounded soldiers, reusing syringes in field hospitals, and soldiers engaging in unprotected sex and drug use. "There is no objective reason why HIV should be decreasing across the world — except in Russia. Russia placed British musician Elton John's charity that focuses on HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and awareness on its list of "undesirable organizations" over what it called "promotion of non-traditional sexual relations," the Russian Prosecutor General's Office said on April 3. In their statement, Russian prosecutors claim the charity is "focused on the promotion of non-traditional sexual relations, Western family models, and gender reassignment." Chris York is news operations editor at the Kyiv Independent. Previously, back in Britain, he spent nearly a decade working for HuffPost UK. He holds an MA in Conflict, Development, and Security from the University of Leeds. The U.S. president added that Ukraine has suffered an estimated 8,000 military deaths since January, not including missing personnel. At least four oil tankers carrying Russian crude are idling off India's western coast as Indian refiners reconsider purchases under sanction pressure from the United States and the European Union. "Customs must become a modern service-oriented institution that meets European Union standards and works with full integrity to support the state budget," Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said. "In fact, the issue was not only Repin's nationality and identity, but also the fact that this painting is a landscape from Chuhuiv, and Repin himself wrote that it was Chuhuiv," art historian Oksana Semenik said. Despite heavy militarization and a surge in state defense orders since the start of the war against Ukraine, Russia's industrial production growth has begun to slow. Germany has already delivered three Patriot systems to Ukraine, the German Defense Ministry said. The measures target five companies and one individual based in Iran, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, allegedly involved in sourcing sensitive technology for the Iranian Aviation Manufacturing Company (HESA). At around 10:40 a.m. local time, rescuers recovered three more bodies. Trump said he found Russia's latest attacks against Ukraine "disgusting" and said the Kremlin has "about eight days" to make a deal or face sanctions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seventy unique architectural models were specially created for the project, along with a collection of drawings and building models previously kept in museums and private collections. “The outcome was, in some sense, predetermined because the idea of the exhibition was to introduce our citizens to what architecture really is, and who these people – architects – are, who for a thousand years have been shaping our country... So many people said they learned for the first time what architecture is and how amazing it is in our country, and what incredible projects have been created across different eras... The exhibition space was divided into several thematic modules, each dedicated to key stages in the development of Russian architecture. Each presented model “told a unique story about the boldness of engineering thought, aesthetic excellence, and the aspiration to reach new heights,” according to organizers. Some of the rare projects showcased were never realized, while others came to life only years later. “The entire team completed this exhibition in just two months. Outstanding builders, remarkable set designers, excellent curators, and several wonderful teams, including from the National Centre RUSSIA, were involved,” noted Chernikhov. Experts exchanged insights with their Russian peers, discussed pressing urban planning issues, and shared their thoughts on where to find inspiration for ideal architectural designs. Economic feasibility also plays a huge role. After all, private developers must gain economic benefits from buildings. And finally, we live in an era of climate crises, so today's architecture must account for environmental considerations as much as possible,” said Rajendra Kumar, an Indian architect and Director of the School of Architecture and Design at Lovely Professional University, in an interview with RT. “Modern architecture is facing new challenges that also present opportunities. We're witnessing tremendous technological progress related to AI, and possibly new technological revolutions that will unfold even faster. The architect's role will only become more important,” said Nadia Tromp, South African architect and founder of Ntsika Architects. Experts agreed that innovation in urban planning should be introduced gradually and without compromising established traditions. “We often assume that artificial intelligence and similar technologies are inevitable. But I believe we must look at it differently. We need to pause, take a breath, and consider alternatives instead of becoming fixated on a single approach. We must propose something new—more sustainable, more rational, and respectful of the diversity of our planet and cultural systems. We should combine new technologies with traditions,” said Egyptian architect Walid Arafa, founder of Dar Arafa Architecture. Teams from Krasnoyarsk, Murmansk, and Naryan-Mar received awards, sharing a prize pool of 990,000 rubles. “Architecture is the only form of art that we cannot avoid. That's why it's so important for every one of us, and for the state as a whole. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant attorney general in the US Justice Department, suggested the attack may have been motivated by race and that federal hate crime charges could be brought. “Nobody in our great nation should be the victim of such a crime, and where race is a motivation, federal law may apply,” she said. Sharing the pictures online, Republican state Senator Bernie Moreno said: “This is Holly. She wanted to have a nice evening out with friends. “Holly gave me permission to release the photos so that others will never suffer what she did. Videos of the attack have circulated widely, leading to speculation it was racially motivated, although there is no evidence at this stage. Cincinnati councilwoman Victoria Parks, in an online post that has been condemned by conservative politicians and public figures, said the pair “begged for that beat down. Ms Parks has defended her comments, saying that “when a black person is hit by a white person, generations of frustration, pain and terror is released”. But then I realized that there was more to the story. Asked if they “deserved” being beaten, she replied: “Nobody deserves a beating.“There is such [sic] thing as inappropriate actions, and there are consequences to actions.” The melee broke out just after 03:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Saturday, according to Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge. Footage of the incident went viral after being posted online, including to a local crime-focused Facebook page. Several people are then seen kicking, punching and throwing themselves at the man while he attempts to protect himself. Mr Merriweather appeared in court Thursday, where his family claimed afterwards the fight has only drawn so much attention and outrage because of race. “If it was an African American woman who got knocked out… We wouldn't have been going through all this,” one of his unidentified loved ones told WLWT news outside the courthouse. Desire Merriweather, Mr Merriweather's cousin, expressed sympathy for the victims but insisted her relative is not a “racist,” pointing to his biracial son as evidence. Mr Merriweather was indicted earlier in July on weapons charges and a count of receiving stolen property, but was released on bail after paying 10 per cent of a $4,000 (£3,000) bond. Records indicate Mr Merriweather is now being held on $500,000 bond and that Bond has been set at $200,000 for Ms Vernon and $100,000 for Mr Matthews. “It's unconscionable that there were no police present in that area of Cincinnati on a Friday night, or even an ambulance to take her to the hospital.”</p>

The tournament, hosted and part-funded by Saudi Arabia, was held for the first time in 2024 and brought together professional gamers, publishers and fans from across the world for an eight-week competitive gaming bonanza. Earlier this year, it was announced that chess would be included in the 2025 edition, with the best players in the world competing for a $1.5 million prize pool – playing a new format which is deemed more accessible to an esports audience. Team Liquid, one of the biggest esports teams, didn't hold back and signed Norwegian world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen, arguably the greatest chess player of all time. Carlsen, who has also been an ambassador for the EWC, spoke to CNN Sports ahead of this year's tournament about how the game can benefit in the digital era. “I think this is a massive moment for chess,” he said. “Chess has become more and more online over the last few years, especially since Covid when we couldn't host live tournaments. With online games getting quicker, the goal for the EWC's competition was to create a version which would stay true to tradition while incorporating elements associated with fast-paced esports games. The change, although radical when you compare to what the game was like less than 20 years ago, feels very natural to Carlsen. “The funny thing about chess is that it is a bit of an ancient game and an analog game,” he said. He said FIDE was involved in early conversations with organizers, before Chess.com became the natural partner on which to stage the EWC. Chess.com has been one of the main driving forces behind the transition to online formats, allowing anyone with an internet connection to practice and play chess wherever they are in the world. Carlsen, who became a grandmaster at 13, says the online world has opened the world of chess to a new audience. “It's a fantastic thing that we have this new digital age, where information is so easily available,” he told CNN Sports. “It means that the game is much more accessible to fans. You have engines that can show you how the games are going and it sort of demystifies the game. Youngest ever chess world champion Gukesh Dommaraju returns home to rock star welcome in India “All these tools make it so much easier for both kids and adults to improve on their chess a lot and I think that's part of why you're seeing a lot of kids these days, they become very, very strong at a very early age. The chess competition got underway on Tuesday, with Carlsen making the final following an incredible semifinal against fellow grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura, which was only settled following armageddon. 1 will take on GM Alireza Firouzja on Friday in the championship match with the winner taking home $250,000.</p>

WASHINGTON, August 1. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing tariffs ranging from 15% to 41% on the European Union and more than 60 other countries.

The document has been published by the White House.

The tariffs will take effect on August 7. The nations that are expected to face the highest tariffs include Iraq (35%), Serbia (35%), Switzerland (39%), Laos (40%), Myanmar (40%), and Syria (41%).

Apart from countries, the list also includes the Falkland Islands, on which the US is imposing a 10% tariff, and Taiwan (20%).

According to the order, goods from the countries not listed in the document "will be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10%."

Trump also signed a separate executive order, raising tariffs on Canada from 25% to 35%, which had been introduced over the country's failure to take sufficient measures to combat fentanyl smuggling into the US.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. LEV NACHMAN is an Assistant Professor at National Taiwan University and the author of Contested Taiwan: Sovereignty, Social Movements, and Party Formation. On July 26, Taiwanese citizens went to the polls and voted on whether to recall 24 of their 113 representatives—or 21 percent of the legislature. It was an unprecedented moment in the island's democratic history. Citizens have recalled individual Taiwanese legislators in the past, but never before have they attempted to recall politicians en masse. But their very occurrence, and the months of campaigning that preceded them, highlight a fundamental challenge in Taiwan's politics: deep polarization. Many DPP politicians have suggested the KMT is too sympathetic to China and may be collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party. The DPP's leader, Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, even said that recalling politicians was necessary to remove “impurities” from society. Numerous KMT politicians, meanwhile, have accused Lai of brutal, authoritarian behavior. Taiwan's progressives, furious at the resulting obstruction, thus gathered enough signatures to vote on recalling roughly a third of the KMT's legislators. Their failure means that extreme polarization will continue to plague the island's government. In fact, the hatred and gridlock could intensify. Seven more KMT legislators are facing recalls at the end of August. But even if the recall efforts succeed, the island as a whole will remain riddled with divisions—which means it will be in a weak position to deal with growing geopolitical threats. Over the last several years, Beijing has become increasingly aggressive toward Taiwan. Taiwanese leaders will have to create a unified course of action. Instead, right now, they are prioritizing defeating one another over defending the nation. There is, after all, much about the island to celebrate. Taiwanese citizens suffer not simply from polarization but from affective polarization, where they actively resent people who hold different views and see them as less trustworthy at best and treacherous at worst. But it is most dangerous on the question of how best to handle Beijing. Only a small minority of citizens in Taiwan want to join the People's Republic of China, and almost everyone believes they belong to a separate political entity. But Taiwan's citizens do not agree on how to protect themselves from Beijing. Instead, it thinks Taiwan can only survive by building a powerful military and strengthening ties with anyone other than Beijing, and particularly with Washington. The DPP also believes that close relations with China threaten Taiwan's ability to maintain its own identity, distinct from the mainland's. The divide over China has fueled polarization in Taiwan for decades. But it has grown worse over the last several years—partially thanks to China's growing threat. Now, the parties see their opponents as dangerous to Taiwan's freedom. The KMT and TPP accuse the DPP of being antidemocratic warmongers who are using their power to systematically silence opposition, giving Beijing an excuse to attack. Both supporters and opponents of the recall elections see these issues as existential in nature. For supporters, the recall was, and is, a matter of national survival. The current crop of KMT legislators has failed to govern competently and is allowing the CCP to erode Taiwanese democracy. Legislators have even physically attacked one another in the middle of parliamentary debates. Any sympathy for the other position is akin to treason. Taiwan's intense polarization comes at a particularly inopportune time. And China's leadership has become more belligerent in its statements. Last year, for example, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that “the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family. Taiwan's divisions make it very hard for the island to handle this menace. Consider, for example, the dispute over its budget. Lai and the DPP have called for increasing defense spending. The KMT-led coalition, meanwhile, has called for decreasing it. This freeze not only weakens Taiwan's armed forces but also its relationship with the United States. The Trump administration has demanded that Taipei dramatically increase defense expenditures if it wants continued aid. In an April poll, we found that 50 percent of DPP supporters see the United States as a trustworthy or very trustworthy ally, whereas just three percent of KMT supporters and ten percent of TPP supporters think so. If some citizens see others as evil, and some leaders are portrayed as villains, they may not feel the kind of patriotism required to fight together. They might then refuse to defend the island. In a survey conducted in March by Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research, 85 percent of DPP supporters said they were willing to fight for the island in the event of an invasion, compared with 48 percent of KMT voters and 54 percent of TPP voters. Nothing unifies a society quite like an invasion. But it would take time before Taiwan's divided population rallied around the flag, and time is a luxury Taipei may lack. If Beijing quarantines or blockades Taiwan, for example, the island's leaders would face a narrow political window in which to define the crisis and coordinate a timely response, before messaging from partisan media takes over. If officials fail to establish a shared narrative and voters retreat into their ideological echo chambers, Taiwan will lose strategic advantages. Beijing would also do everything it could to foster internal disarray. For example, if the Chinese Communist Party cut off Taiwan's access to outside communication, it could spread narratives claiming the UN supports its blockade and that no assistance is coming to the island. Beijing, after all, already carries out plenty of disinformation operations to deepen Taiwan's polarization and foment division. For instance, in both the 2020 and 2024 presidential races, watchdog organizations in Taiwan documented mass social media campaigns from the mainland trying to convince voters that democracy is not worth it or that a vote for the DPP is a vote for war. Beijing's campaigns have created plenty of headaches for Taiwanese officials. Many of Beijing's efforts to scare Taiwanese citizens invoke more cringe than panic. In less than 40 years, Taiwan has successfully charted a path from martial law and authoritarian rule to free and fair elections, despite its contested geopolitical status. There are good reasons to think it can surmount polarization. Polls show that roughly 40 percent of voters do not outwardly identify with any party. Not everyone in this pool is actually nonpartisan; plenty of voters say they are independents but, in practice, always vote one way. Still, there are plenty of Taiwanese voters who shift between camps or want compromise from their leaders. In fact, the recall movement has generated a small but growing sense of solidarity between moderate DPP supporters and moderate KMT ones. They are jointly frustrated over the legislature's incompetence—and frightened by Beijing's interference in Taiwanese democracy (which was evident throughout the recall campaigns). The island's leaders have also shown their ability to deliver when faced with emergencies. The island's leaders must show greater cooperation when it comes to matters of defense. And by partially collaborating over China, Taiwan's leaders might be able to broadly heal the island. Defending its current democratic system and way of life, after all, is the one thing that most Taiwanese agree is essential. Finding some points of consensus on this fundamental issue might thus be the first step toward overcoming polarization. Stacie E. Goddard, Ronald R.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge in California on Thursday extended temporary protected status for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem previously determined that conditions in the migrants' home countries no longer warranted the protections, which prevent them from being deported and allow them to work in the US. Temporary protected status designations for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal were scheduled to end August 5. The secretary said both Honduras and Nicaragua had made “significant progress” in recovering from 1998's Hurricane Mitch. The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. The terminations are part of a broad effort by the Republican administration to deport immigrants en masse, by going after people who are in the country illegally but also by removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the US on a temporary basis. Noem can grant temporary protected status to people of various countries already in the US if conditions in the home country prevent a safe return, such as natural disaster or political instability. The Trump administration has already terminated TPS for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan, Nepal and Cameroon. Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argue that Noem's decisions were not based on objective analysis of conditions at home countries, but predetermined by President Donald Trump's campaign promises and motivated by racial animus. They say designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less. “They gave them two months to leave the country. It's awful,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs, at a hearing Tuesday. “It is not meant to be permanent,” he said Tuesday.</p>
