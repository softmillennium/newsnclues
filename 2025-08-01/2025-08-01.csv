            President Donald Trump just set new tariffs for every country around the world, solidifying his extreme break with America's long-standing trade policy.
    


Tariffs on the vast majority of goods America imports are set to rise – even from the handful of countries that negotiated individual trade deals. The higher tariffs continue Trump's reversal of the decades of globalization that made America's massive services economy the envy of the world – but contributed to its long decline in manufacturing.
    


            With just a few hours to go before its self-imposed August 1 trade deadline, the White House provided key details about its new trade policy late Thursday – and, along with it, its new tariff plan.
    


            Here's what to know about the latest set of tariffs:
    


            The White House announced Thursday that the “universal” tariff for goods coming into the United States will remain at 10%, the same level that was implemented on April 2.
    


            But that 10% rate will apply only to countries with which the US has a trade surplus – countries to which the United States exports more than it imports. That applies to most countries, a senior administration official said.
    


            A 15% rate will serve as the new tariff floor for countries with which the United States has a trade deficit. About 40 countries will pay that new 15% tariff. That tariff will be lower for many of those nations than the April 2 “reciprocal” tariffs, but it will be higher for a handful.
    


            And more than a dozen countries have tariff rates that are higher than 15%, either because they agreed to a trade framework with the United States or because Trump sent their leaders a letter dictating a higher tariff. The senior administration official said those countries have among the highest trade deficits with the United States.
    


            The White House identified 26 countries whose goods will be subjected to US tariffs greater than 15%. A senior administration official claimed these countries have excessive trade deficits with the United States.
    


            In addition, Mexico and Canada will continue to face higher tariffs for goods that are not exempt under the US-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement. Mexico on Thursday agreed to a 90-day continuation of the current 25% tariff rate the US currently places on those items. Non-exempt Canadian goods imported to the United States will face a 35% as of Friday at 12:01 am ET – up from a 25% tariff previously.
    


            The new tariff regime will not go into effect Friday, as had been expected.
    


            Instead, the tariffs will be implemented on August 7 to give Customs and Border Protection sufficient time to make the necessary changes to collect the new duties.
    


Canada's tariffs are an exception – those will go into effect Friday.
    


            The only major trading partners that didn't see tariff rates change on Friday were the United Kingdom, China and Mexico. Trump signed a trade framework with the UK and China. However, the deal signed with China expires in less than two weeks, which means those tariffs could soon increase.
    


            With Mexico, Trump had threatened to raise tariffs to 30% at 12:01 am. But after a conversation with Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, on Thursday, he extended Mexico's previous tariff rate for another 90 days.
    


            Over the past month, Trump announced a handful of other trade agreements. It's unclear whether they'll be finalized, but it appears those countries might have avoided rates above what's in their deals.
    


            For instance, goods from the European Union were set to face 30% tariffs. The agreement reached over the weekend, however, calls for 15% tariffs for most goods. That's the same rate goods from South Korea and Japan will be taxed at.
    


            That's still higher than the 10% rate goods have been tariffed at since April, though.
    


            That's a question actively being debated. Trump has cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose country-specific tariffs.
    


            In May, the Court of International Trade found Trump overreached his legal authority doing so. Oral arguments for the administration's appeal kicked off Thursday, and a panel of judges appeared skeptical that Trump had the power to levy tariffs using those emergency powers.
    


            Of particular issue was the unprecedented use of the IEEPA to levy tariffs, especially because the law makes no mention of tariffs to begin with.
    


            Several judges also questioned Trump's rationale behind declaring an economic emergency. The president has previously stated that US trade deficits with other countries, that is, when the US imports more than it exports, merit a national economic emergency requiring tariffs to correct.
    


            Judge Raymond Chen, however, questioned: “Can the trade deficit be a extraordinary and unusual threat when we had trade deficits for decades?”
    


            It may take weeks, or even months, before the appeals court reaches a verdict. After that, it could still be challenged before the Supreme Court. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, Trump has plenty of levers to pull to roll out new tariffs and keep many in place.
    


            Technically, he did. New tariff rates were set to go into effect Friday – and they will now mostly go into effect August 7.
    


            The president has given no indication he'll pause these tariffs any further, though.
    


            However, he's said that about past tariff deadlines only to extend them later on. In short, everything, including the tariff rates that just went in place, is subject to change at the publishing of a Truth Social post.
    


            The tariff changes evoke Trump's “Liberation Day” in April, when he similarly hiked import taxes across the board. The move threw financial markets into chaos and stoked fears of a global recession.
    


            Trump ultimately delayed the “reciprocal” April tariffs hours after they took effect, later setting August 1 as the new deadline for trade agreements on pain of higher tariff rates. The president told some countries what rates they would face on that day absent new agreements but appeared to leave other nations in the dark.
    


            Inflation has stayed relatively tame through Trump's earlier tariff rounds, but that could change as higher rates kick in.  Already, companies including Procter and Gamble and Walmart have said tariff-related price increases are underway.

            The world of chess has been going through somewhat of an evolution in recent years, and it's showing no signs of slowing down.
    


            The ancient game's popularity boom has been well documented, owing in part to the rise of online formats during the Covid-19 pandemic and the reputational boost provided by mainstream media, such as the Netflix series “The Queen's Gambit.”
    


            Since then, chess' move to online platforms has accelerated and its now currently debuting at the Esports World Cup (EWC) this week.
    


            The tournament, hosted and part-funded by Saudi Arabia, was held for the first time in 2024 and brought together professional gamers, publishers and fans from across the world for an eight-week competitive gaming bonanza.
    


            Earlier this year, it was announced that chess would be included in the 2025 edition, with the best players in the world competing for a $1.5 million prize pool – playing a new format which is deemed more accessible to an esports audience.
    


            In a bid to compete in the new event, top esports teams set about signing some of the best chess players on the planet. Team Liquid, one of the biggest esports teams, didn't hold back and signed Norwegian world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen, arguably the greatest chess player of all time.
    


            Carlsen, who has also been an ambassador for the EWC, spoke to CNN Sports ahead of this year's tournament about how the game can benefit in the digital era.
    


            “I think this is a massive moment for chess,” he said. “Chess has become more and more online over the last few years, especially since Covid when we couldn't host live tournaments.
    


            “Online was what we had and those online tournaments became bigger and bigger, and it feels like this is the next step to have these hybrid events.”
    


            While many players, including Carlsen, want to keep the traditional over-the-board chess alive, the transition to online platforms has coincided with changes in the game's format.
    


            With online games getting quicker, the goal for the EWC's competition was to create a version which would stay true to tradition while incorporating elements associated with fast-paced esports games.
    


            The result was the creation of a 10+0 format, which will give both players 10 minutes to make their moves without any chance to add additional time, increasing the chances of blunders as players battle against the clock.
    


            The change, although radical when you compare to what the game was like less than 20 years ago, feels very natural to Carlsen.
    


            “The funny thing about chess is that it is a bit of an ancient game and an analog game,” he said. “But it's also kind of made for the digital age because it's so simple to translate.
    


            “Most of the time when I'm practicing chess, it's always on a screen, whether it's a phone, a computer or a tablet.
    


            “Then when I get to tournaments, the pieces feel a bit strange and I don't feel like I quite see the board the same way.”
    


            The International Chess Federation (FIDE) is still very much considered the home of classic chess, but its CEO Emil Sutovsky told CNN Sports earlier this year that the game's governing body is supportive of the emerging esports partnership.
    


            He said FIDE was involved in early conversations with organizers, before Chess.com became the natural partner on which to stage the EWC.
    


Chess.com has been one of the main driving forces behind the transition to online formats, allowing anyone with an internet connection to practice and play chess wherever they are in the world.
    


            Carlsen, who became a grandmaster at 13, says the online world has opened the world of chess to a new audience.
    


            “It's a fantastic thing that we have this new digital age, where information is so easily available,” he told CNN Sports.
    


            “It means that the game is much more accessible to fans. You have engines that can show you how the games are going and it sort of demystifies the game.
    


Youngest ever chess world champion Gukesh Dommaraju returns home to rock star welcome in India



            “All these tools make it so much easier for both kids and adults to improve on their chess a lot and I think that's part of why you're seeing a lot of kids these days, they become very, very strong at a very early age.
    


            “Kids routinely become grandmasters at earlier ages. The audience is getting younger as well, and more and more digital. So it's really an exciting time.”
    


            The chess competition got underway on Tuesday, with Carlsen making the final following an incredible semifinal against fellow grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura, which was only settled following armageddon. The world No. 1 will take on GM Alireza Firouzja on Friday in the championship match with the winner taking home $250,000.

            A federal judge in California on Thursday extended temporary protected status for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem previously determined that conditions in the migrants' home countries no longer warranted the protections, which prevent them from being deported and allow them to work in the US.
    


            Temporary protected status designations for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal were scheduled to end August 5. And protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans to reside and work lawfully in the US for more than 25 years were set to expire September 8. The secretary said both Honduras and Nicaragua had made “significant progress” in recovering from 1998's Hurricane Mitch.
    


            The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal.
    


            The terminations are part of a broad effort by the Republican administration to deport immigrants en masse, by going after people who are in the country illegally but also by removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the US on a temporary basis.
    


            Noem can grant temporary protected status to people of various countries already in the US if conditions in the home country prevent a safe return, such as natural disaster or political instability.
    


            The Trump administration has already terminated TPS for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan, Nepal and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits at federal courts.
    


            Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argue that Noem's decisions were not based on objective analysis of conditions at home countries, but predetermined by President Donald Trump's campaign promises and motivated by racial animus. They say designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less.
    


            “They gave them two months to leave the country. It's awful,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs, at a hearing Tuesday.
    


            The government argues that Noem has clear and unreviewable authority over the TPS program and that her termination decisions reflect the administration's objectives in the areas of immigration and foreign policy.
    


            Justice Department attorney William Weiland said it is not a pretext to have a different view of a program that provides temporary safe harbor.
    


            “It is not meant to be permanent,” he said Tuesday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","China urges US to ‘stop shifting blame' over Ukraine conflict","https://www.rt.com/news/622377-china-us-blame-game/","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 13:52:00 GMT","

China has accused the US of playing a “meaningless blame game” and urged it to stop shifting responsibilities over the Ukraine conflict. Speaking at the UN Security Council on Thursday, Chinese envoy Geng Shuang rejected allegations that Beijing is supporting Russia's military and called on Washington to “play a constructive role” in ending the fighting.

The remarks follow a series of escalating deadlines from US President Donald Trump. Last month, Trump gave Russia 50 days to end the conflict or face sweeping new sanctions, including 100% tariffs and penalties for its trading partners. Earlier this week, he reduced the window to 10 days. On Wednesday, he set August 8 as the final deadline. The US has already imposed a 25% tariff on India for buying Russian weapons and energy.

The US claimed to the Security Council that China had become “the most important supplier” to Russia's military campaign. Beijing strongly rejected the accusations, calling them “false” and “completely unacceptable.” 

China did not start the conflict and is not a party to it, Geng stated. Beijing has never supplied lethal weapons to either side and strictly controls the export of dual-use goods, including drones, he said.

He defended China's economic ties with Moscow by noting that neither Russia nor Ukraine is under UN sanctions. “China maintains normal trade with Russia and Ukraine, and has not violated international law or international obligations,” he said.

Geng warned that China's legitimate rights “must not be violated” and pointed to Washington's double standards “To this day, the US still maintains trade with Russia. Why is it that the US is not allowing other countries to do what it is doing?”

He further noted that the Ukraine conflict is now at a “critical juncture, facing the prospect and hope of a political solution,” and condemned the continued “reckless” supply of weapons to the battlefield, arguing they only extend the fighting.

Geng's comments echo Moscow's long-held position that foreign military aid to Ukraine only prolongs hostilities and leads to more casualties without affecting the outcome of the conflict.

US President Donald Trump should have received a Nobel Peace Prize years ago, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has claimed, citing his role in multiple international peace agreements. Despite several nominations during his first presidency, Trump has not won the award. At a briefing in Washington on Thursday, Leavitt said Trump had intervened in conflicts such as the Thailand-Cambodia dispute by threatening to withhold US trade deals, which she claimed had led to a swift ceasefire. “We had about one peace deal every month,” Leavitt stated. Trump has repeatedly argued he deserves the award, saying in June that he has been overlooked because “they only give it to liberals.” Several foreign leaders have recently nominated the US president for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu handed Trump a nomination letter earlier this month, crediting his role in mediating a ceasefire between Israel and Iran.

Before any ceasefire talks began, however, the US launched a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities in June, aiming to cripple Tehran's capabilities. Trump later said he didn't want to cite Hiroshima or Nagasaki as examples, but claimed that just as those bombings had ended World War II, the 2025 strike had ended the Iran conflict. The comment drew sharp criticism from Japanese officials, who called it morally reckless and offensive. Cambodia's deputy prime minister also nominated Trump for his role in calming a border dispute with Thailand earlier this year. The Pakistani government publicly backed his nomination, highlighting his involvement in the India-Pakistan ceasefire talks. India, however, has firmly rejected claims of US involvement in the ceasefire, dismissing the notion of any third-party mediation. Trump had vowed to end the Ukraine conflict within 24 hours if re-elected – a promise he later walked back, suggesting a 100-day timeline instead and calling the original claim “a little bit sarcastic.” In July, his administration approved advanced arms deliveries to Ukraine, including Patriot missiles funded by EU NATO allies. Russia condemned the move as a provocation and accused the US of escalating the conflict under the guise of support.

In Moscow, the ‘The Birth of Scale' architectural exhibition has come to a close at the National Centre RUSSIA. The project was dedicated to the history of urban planning in the country and aimed to introduce ordinary citizens to the major achievements of domestic architecture. Over several months, tens of thousands of people visited the exposition, including numerous international experts.

Seventy unique architectural models were specially created for the project, along with a collection of drawings and building models previously kept in museums and private collections. According to the organizers, this allowed visitors to trace the evolution of Russian architecture – from ancient structures to contemporary megaprojects.

“The outcome was, in some sense, predetermined because the idea of the exhibition was to introduce our citizens to what architecture really is, and who these people – architects – are, who for a thousand years have been shaping our country... So many people said they learned for the first time what architecture is and how amazing it is in our country, and what incredible projects have been created across different eras... I think that's the best recognition of our work,” said Andrey Chernikhov, chief curator of ‘The Birth of Scale', in an interview with RT.

The exhibition space was divided into several thematic modules, each dedicated to key stages in the development of Russian architecture. Each presented model “told a unique story about the boldness of engineering thought, aesthetic excellence, and the aspiration to reach new heights,” according to organizers. Some of the rare projects showcased were never realized, while others came to life only years later.

“The entire team completed this exhibition in just two months. Outstanding builders, remarkable set designers, excellent curators, and several wonderful teams, including from the National Centre RUSSIA, were involved,” noted Chernikhov.

The exhibition also drew the attention of international architects, who spoke at the event's panel sessions. Experts exchanged insights with their Russian peers, discussed pressing urban planning issues, and shared their thoughts on where to find inspiration for ideal architectural designs.

“It's crucial to turn to one's roots and traditions – this is of primary importance. Economic feasibility also plays a huge role. After all, private developers must gain economic benefits from buildings. And finally, we live in an era of climate crises, so today's architecture must account for environmental considerations as much as possible,” said Rajendra Kumar, an Indian architect and Director of the School of Architecture and Design at Lovely Professional University, in an interview with RT.

One of the key events on the final day of the exhibition was the panel discussion ‘Architecture of the Future: Trends and Forecasts for 2050'. During the discussion, experts talked about the most significant trends, challenges, and prospects for the industry.

“Modern architecture is facing new challenges that also present opportunities. Particularly, the rise of artificial intelligence and its potential impact on all of us. We're witnessing tremendous technological progress related to AI, and possibly new technological revolutions that will unfold even faster. The architect's role will only become more important,” said Nadia Tromp, South African architect and founder of Ntsika Architects.

Experts agreed that innovation in urban planning should be introduced gradually and without compromising established traditions. They emphasized that architecture is not merely about constructing buildings, but about conveying meaning.

“We often assume that artificial intelligence and similar technologies are inevitable. But I believe we must look at it differently. We need to pause, take a breath, and consider alternatives instead of becoming fixated on a single approach. We must propose something new—more sustainable, more rational, and respectful of the diversity of our planet and cultural systems. We should combine new technologies with traditions,” said Egyptian architect Walid Arafa, founder of Dar Arafa Architecture.

At the exhibition's closing ceremony, the National Centre RUSSIA and the Yakov Chernikhov Architectural Charitable Foundation announced the winners of the nationwide online competition for young architects, ‘Creative Hub'. Teams from Krasnoyarsk, Murmansk, and Naryan-Mar received awards, sharing a prize pool of 990,000 rubles. According to the organizers, the funds will support the professional development of the laureates.

“Architecture is the only form of art that we cannot avoid. That's why it's so important for every one of us, and for the state as a whole. It objectively and uncompromisingly reflects the state of our society, our culture, ideology, and spiritual values, and it influences the shaping of future generations,” summarized Natalia Shashkova, Director of the Shchusev Museum of Architecture.

WASHINGTON, August 1. /TASS/. The US administration is set to impose anti-Russian sanctions when the 10-day period expires, even though they may have no serious effect on the situation around Ukraine, US President Donald Trump told reporters.

""We're going to put sanctions. I don't know that sanctions bother him [Russian President Vladimir Putin]. You know, they know about sanctions. I know better than anybody about sanctions, and tariffs, and everything else. I don't know if that has any effect but we're going to do it,"" he said.

The American leader previously set a 50-day deadline for reaching agreements between Russia and Ukraine, after which he promised to impose 100% trade duties against Moscow and its trading partners. On Monday, Trump said he was disappointed with Russia and the progress of the settlement, and reduced the deadline to 10-12 days.

Six out of 10 Americans fault president for financial struggles and eight out of 10 worry about tariffs' impact

Americans are struggling financially, grappling with debt and the rising cost of living, and are blaming the Trump administration and corporate interests for worsening economic outlooks for working families, according to a new poll.

Six out of 10 Americans place blame on the Trump administration for driving up their cost of living, according to a poll conducted by Morning Consult for the Century Foundation, which asked 2,007 Americans how they are managing the high cost of living in the US economy, who they think is to blame and what are the solutions.

Sixty three per cent said Trump had had a negative impact on grocery prices, and 61% said he had had a negative impact on the cost of living. Nearly half, 49%, said the Trump administration had had a negative impact on their finances. Nearly eight out of 10 Americans, including 70% of Republicans, fear that Trump's tariffs will increase the price of everyday goods.

“Donald Trump has simultaneously raised prices on everyday goods through a reckless approach to tariffs, a decimation of programs that help Americans afford healthcare, education, food and childcare, and then kneecapping federal regulators who keep banks and other big businesses from swindling consumers,” said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of the Century Foundation.

“This has created an alarming set of market conditions. Americans are left on their own to face high prices and low earnings, are building their own safety nets from a web of financial products, credit cards, buy now, pay later loans, payday loans and student debt, and companies have been given the green light to manipulate these products to boost their own profits without having to worry about following the law.”

According to the poll, more than six out of 10 Americans said it had become more difficult to find a good paying job, buy a home and afford childcare.

More than four out of five Americans, 83%, said they were concerned about the cost of groceries, with 46% saying they were very concerned. Some 47% said they were worried about being able to pay their rent or mortgage, 64% said they were worried about affording an unexpected medical expense.

About 48% said they believed they would have trouble affording an unexpected $500 bill without borrowing. One in four said it would be “very difficult”.

A quarter of those surveyed said they spent at least three hours a day worrying about their finances and ability to afford basic necessities. Another 25% of respondents said they or someone in their household had skipped meals in the past year in order to make ends meet, and 26% said they had fallen behind on their monthly bills over the past year.

Americans also fear things are getting worse economically, with 76% of those polled saying they fear a looming economic recession.

Corporations and billionaires were seen as a big factor behind this financial anxiety, with 51% saying they believe corporations have had an active role in making life more difficult for average people over the past 25 years, and 52% saying billionaires have made life tougher.

Half of those polled also believe congressional Republicans have made life more difficult, with 41% believing Democrats have made life more difficult.

“Millions of Americans, across parties, across backgrounds, are deeply anxious, and they're struggling to afford basics like housing and health care. Donald Trump is making these struggles worse,” said Rachel West, senior fellow at the Century Foundation.

“Americans believe the outsized influence of corporations and the wealthy has made their lives harder, and the risks they're taking to cope with high costs like taking on debt and tapping into their savings should sound an alarm for policymakers.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

San Francisco judge leaves temporary protected status in place for people from Honduras and Nicaragua while case against Trump administration proceeds

A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration's plans and extended temporary protected status (TPS) for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua.

TPS is a protection that can be granted by the homeland security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States, preventing them from being deported and allowing them to work.

The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It's part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants.

Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem can extend TPS to immigrants in the US if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe to return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions. Noem had ruled to end protections for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining that conditions in their homelands no longer warranted them.

The secretary said the two countries had made “significant progress” in recovering from 1998's Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history.

The designation for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal was scheduled to end on 5 August while protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans who have been in the US for more than 25 years were set to expire on 8 September.

US district judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco did not set an expiration date but rather ruled to keep the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is on 18 November.

In a sharply written order, Thompson said the administration had ended the migrant status protections without an “objective review of the country conditions” such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua.

If the protections were not extended, immigrants could suffer from loss of employment, health insurance, be separated from their families, and risk being deported to other countries where they have no ties, she wrote, adding that the termination of TPS for people from Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua would result in a $1.4bn loss to the economy.

“The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood,” Thompson said.

Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argued that Noem's decisions were predetermined by President Donald Trump's campaign promises and motivated by racial animus.

Thompson agreed, saying that statements Noem and Trump have perpetuated the “discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.”

“Color is neither a poison nor a crime,” she wrote.

The advocacy group that filed the lawsuit said designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less.

“They gave them two months to leave the country. It's awful,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs at a hearing Tuesday.

Honduras foreign minister Javier Bu Soto said via the social platform X that the ruling was “good news.”

“The decision recognizes that the petitioners are looking to exercise their right to live in freedom and without fear while the litigation plays out,” the country's top diplomat wrote. He said the government would continue supporting Hondurans in the United States through its consular network.

Meanwhile in Nicaragua, hundreds of thousands have fled into exile as the government shuttered thousands of nongovernmental organizations and imprisoned political opponents. Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega and his wife and co-President Rosario Murillo have consolidated complete control in Nicaragua since Ortega returned to power two decades ago.

The broad effort by the Republican administration's crackdown on immigration has been going after people who are in the country illegally but also by removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the US on a temporary basis.

The Trump administration has already terminated protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits at federal courts.

The government argued that Noem has clear authority over the program and that her decisions reflect the administration's objectives in the areas of immigration and foreign policy.

“It is not meant to be permanent,” justice department attorney William Weiland said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukrainian leader says talks should go ahead if Putin's remarks are ‘signals of a genuine willingness to end the war'

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to Putin's comments, repeating that Ukraine is ready for talks at the leaders' level “at any time.”

“We have heard the statements coming out of Russia.

If these are signals of a genuine willingness to end the war with dignity and establish a truly lasting peace – and not merely an attempt to buy more time for war or delay sanctions – then Ukraine once again reaffirms its readiness to meet at the level of leaders at any time.”

He continued by explaining why a direct meeting is needed to conduct talks.

“We understand who makes the decisions in Russia and who must end this war. The whole world understands this too,” he said.

“Ukraine proposes to move from exchanges of statements and technical-level meetings to talks between leaders.

The United States has proposed this.

Ukraine had supported it.

What is needed is Russia's readiness.”

Zelenskyy also pointedly thanked US president Donald Trump for his work on ending the conflict, seemingly acknowledging how much depends on his response to Putin's latest attacks.

… and on that note, it's a wrap!

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for direct talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin instead of limited technical talks by officials, saying “we understand who makes the decisions in Russia” (14:23).

His comments came after Putin said he wanted “a lasting and stable peace,” but offered no sign that he is willing to make any concessions and reasserted his targets in Ukraine and bragged about Russian troops advancing on the frontline (13:46, 13:56, 16:45).

Earlier today, Ukraine confirmed that 31 people died as a result of a recent Russian attack on Kyiv, with over 150 injured (10:24).

A meeting of the UN security council on the situation in Ukraine was planned for later today.

Elsewhere, Germany confirmed it was working on moving first elements of the Patriot missile system into Ukraine “in the coming days” (11:43, 12:33).

Poland marked the 81st anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, with sirens wailing across the country's capital and traffic coming to a halt to commemorate the largest military effort taken by a European resistance movement during the second world war.

Every year, the entire city take part in dozens of events around the anniversary, joined by dwindling number of veterans in attendance, with the Warsaw Uprising Museum playing a central role to the proceedings.

Europe's top court questioned the legitimacy of the “safe countries” list Italy uses to send migrants to Albania and fast-track their asylum claims, in a fresh blow to a key plank of the government's migration policy, Reuters reported.

Conservative prime minister Giorgia Meloni's office, in a statement, called the court ruling “surprising” and said it “weakens policies to combat mass illegal immigration and defend national borders.”

Reuters noted that the Luxembourg-based ECJ said Italy is authorised to fast-track asylum rejections for nationals coming from countries on a “safe” list – a principle at the heart of the Albania scheme.

It also said Italy is free to decide which countries are “safe”, but also warned that such a designation should meet strict legal standards and allow applicants and courts to access and challenge the supporting evidence.

The ECJ said that a country might not be classified “safe” if it does not offer adequate protection to its entire population, effectively agreeing with Italian judges that had raised this issue last year, Reuters said.

The Lithuanian army has found a drone, believed to be Russian-made, that entered Lithuania from Belarusian airspace earlier this week, amid concerns about growing Russian provocations.

AFP noted that the drone entered Lithuania in the early hours of Monday, with members of the public recording its flight over parts of the country's capital Vilnius before it disappeared.

The military said in a statement that it believed it to be a Gerbera decoy drone, which it uses during its invasion of Ukraine with the aim to overhelm and distract air defences, AFP said.

The drone was found in the Gaiziunai military training grounds, near a town that hosts the international Nato battalion.

A similar incident happened earlier this month, with some the country's leaders getting moved to bomb shelters in response.

France said it could not seize women's contraception products estimated to be worth $9.7m that the United States plans to destroy, after media reports suggested the stockpile would be incinerated in the country.

The contraceptives – intended for some of the world's poorest countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa – were bought by the US foreign aid agency USAID under former president Joe Biden.

The administration of Biden's successor Donald Trump, which has slashed USAID and pursued anti-abortion policies, confirmed last month it planned to destroy the contraceptives, which have been stored in a warehouse in the Belgian city of Geel.

France's government has come under pressure to save the contraceptives, with women's rights groups calling the US decision “insane”.

But France's health ministry told AFP today there was no legal way for it to intervene.

The health ministry told AFP that the government had “examined the courses of action available to us, but unfortunately there is no legal basis for intervention by a European health authority, let alone the French national drug safety authority, to recover these medical products.

“Since contraceptives are not drugs of major therapeutic interest, and in this case we are not facing a supply shortage, we have no means to requisition the stocks,” it added.

Let's quickly catch up on other European news today.

in Kyiv

Vladimir Putin has said he wants a “lasting and stable peace” in Ukraine but given no indication that he is willing to make any concessions to achieve it, after a week in which Russian missiles and drones again caused death and destruction across Ukraine.

“We need a lasting and stable peace on solid foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and would ensure the security of both countries,” said Putin, speaking to journalists on Friday, a week before a new deadline imposed by Donald Trump for hostilities to cease.

Trump has said if Russia and Ukraine do not come to an agreement to end the war by next Friday, 8 August, he will impose a package of economic sanctions on Russia.

Before he took office, Trump had promised to end the war in 24 hours, but since he became president his repeated overtures to Putin have achieved minimal results.

In recent weeks, Trump has markedly changed his rhetoric on the conflict, appearing less conciliatory to Putin and more amenable to enhanced support for Ukraine. He called Russia's continued attacks on civilian areas “disgusting” on Thursday.

Last month Trump said he was “disappointed” with Putin. “We'll have a great conversation. I'll say: ‘That's good, I'll think we're close to getting it done,' and then he'll knock down a building in Kyiv,” he told the BBC.

Seemingly referencing Trump's comments, Putin said on Friday: “As for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general rule.”

The death toll from a series of Russian strikes on Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday rose sharply on Friday, to 31, after rescuers found more than a dozen bodies in the rubble of an apartment block that had collapsed after one of the strikes. There were five children among the dead, including a two-year-old, while 159 people were wounded in the attack, one of the worst to hit the Ukrainian capital in more than three years of full-scale war.

As to Putin's claims that Russian army is advancing in Ukraine, an AFP analysis of data from the US-based Institute for the Study of War, or ISW, appears to confirm that claim.

AFP said that Russia's military advance accelerated for a fourth straight month in July, with greatest gains since November.

In one month, the Russian army took 713 square kilometres (275 square miles) of Ukrainian territory, while the Ukrainians reclaimed 79 square kilometres, the analysis said.

This has resulted in a net gain of 634 square kilometres compared with 588 square kilometres in June, 507 square kilometres in May, 379 square kilometres in April, and 240 square kilometres in March.

These figures include territories fully or partially controlled by Russia and those claimed by it.

Meanwhile, Zelenskyy has just disclosed that he spoke with UK prime minister Keir Starmer, discussing the need to scale up drone production and associated financial needs, and to move on sanctions.

The conversation started with Starmer's condolences for the Russian attack on Kyiv, which killed 32, and their discussion on “how to stop the killings, provide greater protection for our people, and force Russia to end this war.”

The Ukrainian president said that, despite bullish rhethoric coming from Moscow, “Russia genuinely fears” sanctions, “no matter how hard it pretends that it couldn't care less.”

“Sanctions are undoubtedly working – and there will be more. We are working with everyone on coordinated restrictive measures.”

Zelenskyy also said he spoke with Starmer about “coordination of actions” with US under Trump and “possible formats for peace negotiations at the level of leaders.”

He ended:

“We are also preparing for active diplomatic engagement with our partners in Europe and the United States. We aligned our positions ahead of upcoming international events.”

Following Zelenskyy's comments, his most senior aide Andriy Yermak said in his trademark blunt style that “it's long past time for Russians to move from empty talks and living in a fantasy world to facing reality.”

He said that “a meeting of leaders is possible – it's Russia that doesn't want it.”

“Too many statements about ‘wanting peace' while missile strikes continue — and not a single real step toward peace from Moscow.

Where is the ceasefire the United States proposed back in March – the one we agreed to?

President [Trump] is doing a great deal to achieve peace.

President Zelenskyy shares the principle of peace through strength.

It's time for Russia to stop lying on the bench and start getting specific.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

11:00 JST, August 1, 2025

The trends in financial markets appear to have changed significantly over the past several years. The biggest change has been that external shocks are causing smaller price drops.

Since 1987, the U.S. stock market has crashed nearly once every 10 years. The Black Monday collapse, the Asian financial crisis and the Lehman shock all fit more or less into that 10-year cycle. However, this trend seems to have subsided considerably since 2017. One theory has it that the 2007-08 shock was so great that the markets have not fully recovered even 10 years later, leaving no room for them to slump any further. In reality, there have been structural changes beyond the shock.

Needless to say, as markets have grown in size, price drops have gotten larger in terms of absolute value. But, when looking at the percentage change, price drops have shrunk in size. Moreover, after a drop, prices now tend to recover relatively quickly to previous levels, so that slumps do not go on for months.

If this was the result of the financial system improving its resilience, that would be fine. But, in my view, there seems to be another factor at work.

I think the biggest reason why price drops have shrunk is a “glut of capital” that can be seen across the financial markets. The most significant source of the funds is increased savings. It is known that once income goes up, allowing individuals to save, growth in savings outpaces that of income. In the recent three decades or so, savings have risen sharply worldwide.

Let's take a look at the nominal value of the global gross domestic product, so that we can estimate the growth in income around the world.

The nominal GDP for the world rose nearly fivefold from $22 trillion in 1990 to $110 trillion in 2024. On the other hand, according to the United Nations, the global population only increased 60% over the same period, from 5.2 billion to 8.2 billion. When the GDP figures are divided by population, you find that GDP per capita nearly tripled, shooting from $4,200 to $13,300.

To calculate how much savings grew, you first need to exclude the tranche of the population with zero savings. Besides looking at the average, you will also want to reference the median and the mode, the latter being the value that appears most frequently in a data set. My impression is that ultra-high-income earners have seen their incomes grow significantly in many countries. It seems this has caused the average income level to rise on a global basis. In any case, the supply of capital in the form of savings has significantly increased.

This supply has not been matched by demand, resulting in a “glut of capital.” Looking only at the supply side does not tell the real story. Why has demand for capital been waning?

Capital needs can be generally divided into short-term needs of a year or less and longer-term needs. Of these two, demand for long-term funds has been particularly sluggish.

Long-term funds are primarily provided for infrastructure development, environmental conservation and the installation of large-scale production facilities over long periods of five, 10 or 20 years.

The main reason for slow demand for long-term funds is that infrastructure development in developed countries has finished for now, leading to a slowdown in orders for new projects. On the other hand, despite strong demand for new projects in developing countries, fewer and fewer projects have been eligible for financing as borrowers have grown less creditworthy.

Predictability has also been reduced by the inability to reach a consensus on environmental conservation programs and the lack of clarity on goals for environmental investment.

These issues have become pronounced over the past 10 or so years. The situation has been exacerbated by tensions between the United States and China and, more recently, U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff diplomacy.

Moreover, international trade has been contracting due largely to tariff increases, a shift to trading with neighboring countries and a surge in maritime transport costs caused by piracy, among other factors.

As a result, demand for long-term funds has shrunk and surplus funds have moved to short-term investments. Short-term funds would normally be directed to real estate and stocks, but in the United States, memories of the real estate bubble collapse in the 2000s are still causing a lot of short-term funds to be directed toward the stock market rather than real estate.

For many years, the bond and stock markets in the United States had an inverse relationship. That means that funds would move between the two markets, depending on a comparison of interest from the bond market and dividends from the stock market. The mechanism worked like this: When bond rates rose, people would buy U.S. Treasurys, which are considered risk-free, resulting in a drop in stock prices.

However, of late, people have been buying both bonds and stocks, leading both markets to move in the same direction.

The reason that capital is not scrambling between the two markets as it did before is that there are more funds going to both markets.

In many countries, a political backlash against unequal income distribution is gathering steam. But ironically, the income gap has widened even further, driven by the influx of funds.

Many companies have been buying back their own stock by using internal reserves of excess cash. Share buybacks — which reduce the number of shares in circulation on the market and boost share prices — may make it easier to procure funds. However, companies with no forward-looking ideas for investment have little need for funds in the first place, and they may end up on the path to a diminished equilibrium.

The demand for long-term funds is, in fact, enormous. For example, if you add up the money required to maintain and repair existing infrastructure in developed countries, you will come up with a considerable sum. Roads and airport runways are suitable for investment using public expenditure based on tax revenue. But for renewal of other infrastructure projects such as railways, airport terminals, water supply and sewage systems, and power plants, there is an enormous demand for funds from the private sector.

Since there are no enthusiastic proponents of such maintenance, we often tend to forget the pressing need to discuss whether we should prioritize securing funds for maintenance and repairs even if that means restricting new infrastructure investments.

Now, I would like to touch on something a little different from the usual capital flows. That is the fact that as global markets become increasingly fragmented, the supply of funds that have functioned as a kind of insurance for maintaining the entire system is shrinking.

In the past, some countries have struggled due to unsound economic management, but when a risk of sovereign bankruptcy arose, emergency funds were provided from the outside as what looked like insurance payouts.

However, countries are increasingly only willing to help those in distress who are “like-minded.” If this is not the case, no support will be extended even if the debtor is not an “enemy nation.”

In many cases, economic collapse is the country's own fault. That said, if one imprudently throws a rotten orange into a box of oranges, it may cause the rest of the citrus to rot as well. And a failing country may well be a neighbor to “like-minded” countries.

Regardless of the politics of the country facing bankruptcy, if it can carry out the appropriate measures for economic restructuring, there should be a framework that can quickly provide the nation with support.

Cases of HIV among Russian soldiers have soared 2,000% since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a new report reveals, attributing the rise both to unprotected sex and drug use among troops, and political decisions made by the Kremlin.

According to the report from Carnegie Politika, cases detected in the Russian armed forces increased by 13 times by the end of 2022, and by 20 times by the end of 2024.

""The demographic and economic losses Russia will suffer as a result of this outbreak will have repercussions for decades and may ultimately even exceed the damage it has sustained from its invasion of Ukraine,"" the report said.

It attributes the rise to several factors including blood transfusions for wounded soldiers, reusing syringes in field hospitals, and soldiers engaging in unprotected sex and drug use.

The report also highlights the wider HIV situation in Russia which since 2022 has been among the top five countries worldwide for new HIV cases, behind South Africa, Mozambique, Nigeria, and India.

""There is no objective reason why HIV should be decreasing across the world — except in Russia. The factors behind this are purely political,"" the report said.

The Kremlin has taken several steps that have contributed to the rise, often in the name of defending what it calls ""traditional values.""

Russia placed British musician Elton John's charity that focuses on HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and awareness on its list of ""undesirable organizations"" over what it called ""promotion of non-traditional sexual relations,"" the Russian Prosecutor General's Office said on April 3.

The non-profit, which was launched in 1992 and is based in the U.S. and the U.K., says it works in over 90 countries ""to increase access to health care, tackle LGBTQ+ stigma, and end AIDS.""

In their statement, Russian prosecutors claim the charity is ""focused on the promotion of non-traditional sexual relations, Western family models, and gender reassignment.""

""There is no objective reason why HIV should be decreasing across the world —except in Russia,"" the report said.

Despite heavy militarization and a surge in state defense orders since the start of the war against Ukraine, Russia's industrial production growth has begun to slow.

Germany has already delivered three Patriot systems to Ukraine, the German Defense Ministry said. 

The measures target five companies and one individual based in Iran, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, allegedly involved in sourcing sensitive technology for the Iranian Aviation Manufacturing Company (HESA).

The news coincides with Donald Trump's announcement of a 25% tariff on India starting on Aug. 1.

Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city's military administration, said that as of the morning of Aug. 1, the Russian attack had killed 31 people. At around 10:40 a.m. local time, rescuers recovered three more bodies.

Trump said he found Russia's latest attacks against Ukraine ""disgusting"" and said the Kremlin has ""about eight days"" to make a deal or face sanctions.

The Trump administration has mostly respected the USMCA, and that's a big reason why the impact of tariffs on Canada has not been more sharply negative.Christopher Furlong/Reuters

After Mexico got a 90-day extension to continue negotiations with Washington, there was a glimmer of hope that the third amigo in the North American trade pact would get the same treatment. Nope.

Aug. 1 was U.S. President Donald Trump's deadline for a slew of countries, including Canada, to do “deals” or face a new round of tariffs. The arrangement was basically this: Accept higher tariffs – 15 per cent across the board is the new baseline – or get hit with even higher tariffs. If you retaliate, you'll also get hit with higher tariffs.

Before July 31 was out, many countries learned that they were on the punishment list. Canada is, with the president ordering a 35-per-cent tariff to go into effect on Friday. The excuse is fentanyl, but don't take it personally. It's just a legal pretext, and a thin one at that. The other excuse is that we retaliated.

Canadians had been waiting to find out whether Mr. Trump would follow through on his threat, and now we have our answer. What we don't know is what happens next. 

The unknowns includes what other tariffs Mr. Trump could threaten or impose in the months to come; what exactly he wants from Canada; whether any of the trade walls he's erecting while bypassing Congress's constitutional authority will be knocked down by the courts; and how long this one-way trade war against much of the world will last.

But there are some things we know. We know how the Canadian economy is doing in the face of tariffs. And we can predict how it is likely to do in the face of higher or lower tariffs. 

Trump raises tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% as trade deal remains elusive

On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada modelled three possible tariff futures, and their impact on this country.

So far, the Canadian economy has been holding up relatively well, under the circumstances. There are a couple of circumstances to keep in mind. 

Canada, far more the European Union, China or Japan, is dependent on trade with the U.S. The EU exports about twice as much in goods and services to the U.S. as Canada, but the Canadian economy is one-tenth the size of the EU's. If the U.S. imposes the same tariffs on Canada and the EU, the harm to Canada will be much greater.

However, Canada is currently subject to considerably lower effective tariffs than most other U.S. trading partners. Even after everything Mr. Trump has announced – from a 25-per-cent tariff, now raised to 35 per cent, to global sectoral levies on steel, aluminum, cars, lumber and some copper products – the bulk of Canadian exports remain shielded. 

The reason is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Royal Bank of Canada estimated that, after Mr. Trump's first rounds of tariffs, almost 90 per cent of Canadian exports entered the U.S. duty free in April. This week's modelling from the Bank of Canada assumes that 100 per cent of energy exports and 95 per cent of all other exports are compliant with the USCMA. They still enter the U.S. tariff-free or nearly tariff-free, with the exception of products subject to sectoral tariffs.

We don't know what tomorrow will bring, but that's where the central bank believes things stood as of last Sunday. It estimates that tariff-free access to the U.S. for most Canadian goods, combined with high sectoral levies on a short-list of targeted sectors, mean that Canada's exports to the U.S. face an average 5-per-cent Trump tariff.

That's considerably lower than the Trump taxes on U.S. imports from most other countries. Imports from China have been hit this year with an average 29-per-cent tariff, while those from the rest of the world face an average Trump tax of 11 per cent, according to the Bank of Canada.

The Trump administration has so far mostly respected the USMCA – though who knows what the future holds – and that's why the impact of tariffs on Canada has not been more negative. Thursday's executive order, raising the our-excuse-is-fentanyl tariff to 35 per cent from 25 per cent, continues to apply only to non-USMCA goods. Again, the Bank of Canada says that's zero per cent of energy exports, and only 5 per cent of the rest.

The USMCA is Canada's ace. But how long will it continue to be playable?

The central bank estimates that the economy contracted 1.5 per cent in the second quarter of 2025. But if tariff rates had remained where they were prior to Thursday night, the bank expected modest growth to return in the second half of this year. That story should not be much altered by Mr. Trump's latest announcement. Again, the additional 10 percentage points of duties applies to less than 5 per cent of Canada's U.S. exports.

In the Bank of Canada's tariff “de-escalation” scenario, U.S. levies on China are reduced slightly, those on the rest of the world are lowered more substantially, and tariffs on Canada are cut in half. Canada also gets rid of any retaliatory tariffs, and most other countries do likewise. The result is slightly more robust Canadian economic growth for the remainder of 2025, and growth continuing through to 2027.

But in the “escalation” scenario, the Canadian economy would take a bigger hit. The assumption in this potential future is that U.S. tariffs on the rest of the world go much higher, and there would be more trade retaliation. Canada and Mexico would still enjoy a tariff advantage, but they would each be hit with an across the board 10-per-cent U.S. tariff–with no USMCA exception.

The Bank of Canada says the result would be a Canadian recession this year, followed by a return to growth in 2026. 

The good news is that, even under the central bank's tariff worst-case scenario, our economy would be knocked back only briefly. We would be growing again in just six months. A new round of somewhat higher and considerably broader tariffs from the White House will not put this country into a permanent state of recession. Our economy can find its feet, and relatively quickly.

However, though the Bank of Canada's model suggest that the wounds would be manageable, it also says that the scars, though small, could be enduring. 

The central bank estimates that, by the end of 2027, the country's gross domestic product would be 1.6 per cent less under the tariff escalation scenario than in the event of de-escalation. 

And even the de-escalation scenario has slightly higher U.S. tariffs on Canada than during the pre-Trump era. That means a small but possibly permanent hit to the size of this country's economy.

The Canadian economy can weather whatever tariffs are thrown at us. But the lower the tariffs, the better.

Palestinians carry humanitarian aid in Gaza on June 16. Prime Minister Mark Carney's announced Wednesday that Canada intends to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in September.Jehad Alshrafi/The Associated Press

Reem Sultan's uncle was killed in Gaza last December, her aunt died of malnutrition in January. Her cousin's family of six, including children, perished when their home was bombed in May. Another cousin who went to retrieve and bury their bodies died in an air strike, killed while grieving the dead. 

In all, the resident of London, Ont., has lost 15 close relatives in the Middle East conflict, but a tally of extended family members reaches closer to 100. So while Ms. Sultan welcomes the news that Canada intends to recognize the state of Palestine, she says more is needed than just words. 

“It is a significant step in aligning Canada with other countries in the world,” said Ms. Sultan, a pharmacist, in an interview on Thursday. 

“But at the same time, it's very important to emphasize that what is needed right now is to ensure that we end the genocide in Gaza, and for the government to take immediate action to save lives of Palestinians. What good is statehood if it's built on the graves of an entire population?”

Israel has rejected allegations it is committing genocide in Gaza in the war with Hamas.

What does Canada's recognition of a Palestinian state mean in practice?

Canada's plan to recognize Palestinian statehood prompts swift, divided reaction

Prime Minister Mark Carney's announcement Wednesday that Canada intends to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in September has been met with both cautious hope and urgent demands from Canadians with deep ties to the region. 

Seen by many as an overdue recognition of Palestinian rights, the move has also been criticized as a symbolic gesture with little meaning without change on the ground. Others take issue with the timing. 

Former justice minister Irwin Cotler, a noted human-rights advocate and Canada's first Envoy on Preserving Holocaust Remembrance and Combating Antisemitism, supports Mr. Carney's intention to recognize an independent and democratic Palestinian state. However, he said it should have followed the mandated requirements under international law rather than trusting in good faith that the necessary conditions can be met. 

The Montevideo Convention, signed in 1933, sets out widely accepted criteria for statehood: a permanent population, a defined territory, a functioning government and the ability to engage in foreign relations.

Mr. Carney had said that Canada's “intention is predicated” on the Palestinian Authority's commitment to essential reforms, including that president Mahmoud Abbas hold general elections in 2026 in which Hamas would be unable to take part. 

“I have been a supporter of ‘Two states for two peoples' for more than 55 years now, not as an idle or lazy slogan, but one which presupposes a mutual acknowledgment of each other's legitimacy, and right to live in peace and security; and two democratic, rights-protecting states side-by-side,” Mr. Cotler wrote in an e-mail to The Globe and Mail. 

“What we don't need is another authoritarian or terrorist-supporting state in the Middle East.”

Izzeldin Abuelaish, a Palestinian doctor who is now a professor of medicine and public health at the University of Toronto, said Canada's move is a step in the right direction but that more action is required. He cited as an example the need for Canada to stop sending arms to Israel.

Dr. Abuelaish said more than 70 of his family members have been killed in the conflict with Israel, and he wonders whether his relatives in northern Gaza will witness Canada's recognition of Palestinian statehood this fall. 

“Are they going to be alive in September, to enjoy it, to celebrate it, to give them hope, to inspire them to keep moving forward?” Dr. Abuelaish said.

“It's an urgent situation. This war crime of starving the people, depriving them from the essential needs, needs to stop.”

Montreal resident Stuart Lubarsky lost five family members when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7.

“We've been wanting a two-state solution since the existence of Israel, so I have no problem with the recognition of Palestine as an independent state,” he said. “It's just this is not the right time, in my opinion – not under these circumstances.”

Mr. Lubarsky said he wouldn't agree with Canada's position until the hostages that were taken by Hamas are returned. 

Ben Losman, a core organizer with Toronto Jewish Families, a group dedicated to ending both anti-Palestinian racism and antisemitism in the Toronto District School Board, said the recognition is an overdue and necessary step. 

“Growing up in a Jewish community, the idea that we would prevent genocide from ever taking place ever again was something that was very much a part of my Jewish education, Jewish identity,” he said. “Like so many people, I've been horrified to find that the perpetrators of genocide are the Israeli government.”

Mr. Losman said Canada's recognition “must be paired with an immediate comprehensive, two-way arms embargo and efforts to establish the free flow of aid immediately throughout Gaza.”

Karen Golden, a Toronto-based lawyer and Israeli citizen who worked for years in Jerusalem, met Bashar Alshawwa at an environmental conference last year, shortly after the Gaza native arrived in Canada from Ramallah. The pair soon became friends, sharing many family dinners with their partners and children.

As their connection grew deeper, they often found themselves asking why such partnerships between Jewish and Palestinian communities remain so rare. They believe Canada's announcement is a step toward peaceful co-existence. 

“I'm hopeful and optimistic that it reduces the polarization and divisions we've been seeing in Canada,” Mr. Alshawwa said Thursday. “This recognition is a reflection of this country's commitment for justice as part of its core identity. It's stating that Canada won't keep allowing for such atrocities happening around the clock in Palestine.”

Ms. Golden and Mr. Alshawwa have been advocating in Canada as part of Standing Together, an anti-war organization in Israel that has called for a ceasefire and protested human-rights abuses in the troubled region. 

Ms. Golden said she is disappointed by the swift condemnation from major Jewish groups of Canada's decision this week. 

“By conflating anti-war sentiments with antisemitism, they're denying – without any empathy – that Palestinians are equal humans deserving of equal rights as Jewish people,” she said.

Editor's note: A previous version of this story did not state that Israel has rejected allegations it is committing genocide in Gaza in the war with Hamas. This version has been updated.

Mr. Combs was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges in July, but convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.Jordan Strauss/The Canadian Press

Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs could face a prison sentence “substantially higher” than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges.

They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. 3 sentencing.

In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed.

Each prostitution-related charge carries a potential maximum 10 years in prison.

Awaiting sentencing, Sean (Diddy) Combs' seeks release on $50-million bond

Prosecutors said after the verdict that they thought federal sentencing guidelines meant to prevent wide disparities in sentencings for the same crimes would likely call for a prison term of four to five years. But they said Thursday they believe the guidelines range “will be substantially higher,” raising the risk Combs will flee.

Judge Arun Subramanian will have wide latitude in determining a sentence and can choose to ignore the guidelines, which are not mandatory. Combs' lawyers have said they believe the guidelines, if properly calculated, will call for 21 to 27 months in prison.

On the day of the verdict, prosecutors won a bail fight after defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo argued Combs should be freed immediately on bail.

Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a “lack of danger to any person or the community.” But he said Agnifilo could renew the request.

In doing so Tuesday, Agnifilo cited other cases he said were comparable to Combs' conviction in which defendants were granted bail. And he cited severe conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Combs has been held since his September arrest at a New York hotel.

He also said Combs was being treated unfairly for engaging in a “swingers” lifestyle in which he and his girlfriends sometimes invited male sex workers to join them in multiday marathon sex performances.

Prosecutors said in their filing Thursday that Combs' conviction on the prostitution-related counts carried a mandatory requirement that he remain in jail prior to sentencing, unless he could prove exceptional circumstances, which they said he cannot.

They said he should also remain in prison as a danger to the community, a claim that Agnifilo disputed in his papers.

“Sean Combs will not be violent to anyone. As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,” Agnifilo wrote earlier this week.

Prosecutors also said conditions at the federal lockup had improved considerably before Combs was arrested. A federal judge in January 2024 had blasted conditions at the jail, including its extensive lockdowns and inadequate medical care.

Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.

“The defendant's extensive history of violence — and his continued attempt to minimize his recent violent conduct — demonstrates his dangerousness and that he is not amendable to supervision,” they wrote. “The defendant utterly fails to establish by clear and convincing evidence, as required, that he does not pose a danger to the community.”

Markets were down and some trade allies reacted with shock over US President Donald Trump's latest tariffs salvo. DW has the latest.

Here's a roundup of the latest developments surrounding Trump's tariffs on Friday, August 1:

Kosovo's government removed trade tariffs for US products imported into Kosovo.

""We are grateful for our enduring relationship with the United States of America,"" Prime Minister Albin Kurti said in a statement on X.

The Balkan nation had applied a 10% tariff on all goods from the United States.

 ""Kosovo welcomes American products to its market,"" said Kosovo's caretaker Prime Minister Albin Kurti, announcing the policy.

""We strongly believe that this will affect the growth of trade exchange and increased investments,"" he told his Cabinet.

Public opinion in Kosovo has been strongly pro-American since a 1999 US-led NATO air campaign that stopped the crackdown of Serbian armed forces on ethnic Albanians, which paved the way for Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia a decade later.

Markets in the United States saw a sharp decline after  Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing duties on US imports from countries including Canada, Brazil, India and Taiwan.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 633.77 points, or 1.44%, to 43,491.55, while the S&P 500 lost 107.59 points, or 1.70%, to 6,231.80, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 483.70 points, or 2.29%, to 20,638.74.

The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, jumped to a near six-week high and was last up 20.66 points.

In addition to the tariffs, worries about a weakening US economy were heavily reinforced by Friday's report on US job growth, which was lower than expected.

The US Labor Department reported that US employers added just 73,000 jobs last month, well short of the 115,000 that were forecast.

The Swiss government said Friday it would negotiate with the United States to try to avoid the tough 39% US tariff rate that would harm key industries.

On Thursday, Trump signalled Swiss imports would be taxed at 39%, higher than the 31% he threatened in April.

President Karin Keller-Sutter told Reuters the 39% figure was much higher than expected.

""The Federal Council is disappointed,"" she said. ""It is a pity that there is a tariff that is much higher than what we negotiated.""

Although the pharmaceuticals sector was not included in the tariffs, the increased duties would have a ""very bad"" effect on the Swiss economy, she said.

Pharmaceuticals constituted 60% of Swiss goods exports to the United States, followed by machinery and metalworking at 20% and watches at 8%.

Although the pharmaceuticals sector was not affected by the tariffs, the increased duties would be ""very bad"" for the Swiss economy, Keller-Sutter said. 

The US is a major trading partner for Switzerland, accounting for 18.6% of its total exports last year, according to Swiss customs data.

As other countries deal with the economic effects of negotiating with Donald Trump, the US president's attention is focused at home on  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

He urged the Fed's board to ""assume control"" if Powell does not lower interest rates.

""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell, a stubborn MORON, must substantially lower interest rates, NOW. IF HE CONTINUES TO  REFUSE, THE BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL, AND DO WHAT EVERYONE  KNOWS HAS TO BE DONE!"" Trump wrote on a social media post, using his customary capitalization for emphasis.

The Federal Reserve kept rates steady on Wednesday, and Powell said the central bank needed to wait for more data before deciding whether to adjust rates at their next meeting, in September.

The rate decision was made by a 9-2 vote, with two Fed governors dissenting for the first time in more than 30 years.

Trump nominated Powell to be Fed Chair in 2018, but the president has been escalating his ongoing feud with the central bank head ever since returning to office in January.

India is in trade talks with the United States to avoid a 25% tariff on Indian exports announced by President Donald Trump. 

A US delegation is expected in New Delhi later this month, a source told the Reuters news agency.

""We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to and are confident that the relationship will continue to move forward,"" India's foreign ministry said in a statement.

Analysts warn the tariffs could hit $40 billion in Indian exports and strain ties with the key US ally in Asia.

On Wednesday, Trump also threatened to impose more penalties on India due to its trade with Russia and its membership in BRICS, a group of major emerging economies.

European stocks fell to a four-week low Friday as investors reacted to sweeping new US tariffs.

President Donald Trump announced steep levies on exports from dozens of trading partners, including a 39% tariff on Swiss goods, ahead of a key trade deal deadline.

The new rates are set to take effect August 7, but uncertainty remains over what Trump might do next.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index dropped 1.3%, with Germany's DAX and Denmark's OMXC also posting sharp losses.

Healthcare shares led the decline, falling sharply after Trump urged 17 major pharmaceutical firms to cut US drug prices. Denmark's Novo Nordisk plunged nearly 5%, hitting a 4-year low.

Meanwhile, the US dollar headed for its strongest weekly performance in nearly three years against other major currencies.

A significant portion of the dollar's strength is attributed to investors' confidence that Trump's tariffs have not yet harmed the US economy and have not significantly increased inflation.

South Africa is facing 30% tariffs on its US exports, after failing to secure a trade deal before Donald Trump's deadline.

The country's automotive industry, which employs 115,000 people, now fears major job losses.

DW's Dianne Hawker reports.

Following the announcement that the Trump tariffs will come into effect on August 7, rather than August 1 as previously announced, South Africa has said it will use the coming week to strike a new deal.

The African country is currently facing a 30% tariff rate. Central bank governor Lesetja Kganyago has estimated the tariffs could cost 100,000 jobs.

""Within the window that's still open, we're hoping that we will find a way to settle this matter,"" Ramaphosa told journalists.

""So intensive negotiations are now under way,"" he said. ""Our task is to negotiate as strongly and as hard as we can with the United States,"" he said. ""Our objective, really, is to save jobs.""

The US is South Africa's second-biggest trading partner, after China, but Pretoria has said it will seek to boost its export markets, with Ramaphosa saying ""it is too risky just to focus on one.""

The Trump administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against South Africa since taking office, cutting vital aid and accusing it, without credible evidence, of committing genocide against white farmers.

The Trump administration has decided to lower the so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs on Malaysia from 25% to 19%, both countries have confirmed.

The Malaysian government welcomed the ""positive outcome"".

""This decision by the United States reflects the strong and enduring economic ties between our two nations,"" Trade and Industry Minister Zafrul Abdul Aziz said.      

The Indian government is likely to cancel its defense deal with the US after the Trump administration's decision to levy a higher tariff rate of 25% to Indian exports.

According to a Bloomberg report, India has informed the US that it is not keen to buy the F-35 stealth fighter jets, which Donald Trump had proposed to sell to India during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US in February this year.

However, India's decision to cancel the deal has not been confirmed and Delhi has said it is looking to deepen trade talks with Washington as open as possible.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada is ""disappointed"" by Trump's decision to go through with the tariff hike.

US duties and tariffs will heavily affect lumber, steel, aluminum, and automobiles, Carney said in a statement.

To justify the step, the US cited the cross-border flow of the highly addictive and deadly drug fentanyl, even though Canada accounts for just 1% of US fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce the volumes, Carney added.

Carney said his government will diversify Canadian export markets and strengthen domestic investment in order to make ""Canada strong.""

""Canadians will be our own best customer,"" Carney said, adding that ""we can give ourselves more than any foreign government can ever take away by building with Canadian workers and by using Canadian resources to benefit all Canadians.""

While Japan has welcomed the newly announced reciprocal tariff rates of 15% — down from the threatened 25% — it said that it will continue to discuss levies on auto exports, which were already facing 25% tariffs.

As the third-largest auto manufacturer in the world, Japan now wants to know when those duties might be lowered.

Japan ""will continue to call on the US side promptly to take measures to implement the recent agreement, including reducing tariffs on automobiles and auto parts,"" government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said Friday.

Confusion also surrounds Trump's claim that Japan — as a ""signing bonus"" — will invest $550 billion (€482 billion) in America, which will recoup 90% of the profits.

Sri Lanka will continue trade dialogue with US officials, the South Asian nation's treasury secretary said on Friday after President Donald Trump announced a 'reciprocal' tariff of 20% on imports from the country.

The island nation ""remains positive"" that Sri Lanka and the US can reach a mutually beneficial situation on tariffs, the official told the journalists.

He said that he ""is hopeful Sri Lanka can maintain regional and international competitiveness with these tariffs.""

Trump administration's decision to levy 15% tariff on New Zealand, has prompted Trade Minister Todd McClay to seek a meeting with US trade representatives and lobby for lower tariffs.

It's an increase from the original 10% baseline announced for New Zealand in April.

He said New Zealand seems to have been targeted with a larger tariff because the country records a trade deficit with the US, but that the gap of about half a billion dollars each year was ""not significant or meaningful.""

""We don't think this is a good thing. We don't think it's warranted,"" McClay told Radio New Zealand Friday. 

""I am seeking an urgent call with the US Trade Representative to make New Zealand's position clear: this increase risks harming exporters and consumers of both countries,"" he said in a statement.

US firms now face an average tariff of 0.8% when exporting to New Zealand, according to McClay.

New Zealand exports about 9 billion New Zealand dollars ($5.3 billion, €4.6 billion) of goods each year to the United States, its second largest market after China, meaning the increase would be ""considerable"" for exporters, he added.

Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said Friday that the new 20% US tariff on goods from the island is a temporary measure and that his government is working to secure a more favorable rate.

""The 20% tariff rate was never Taiwan's target to begin with. We will continue negotiations and strive for a rate that's more favourable for Taiwan,"" Lai told reporters at a press briefing.

The tariff was part of a broader executive order signed Thursday by US President Donald Trump, which imposed duties ranging from 10% to 41% on imports from dozens of countries.

While the 20% rate for Taiwan is lower than the 32% initially threatened in April, it is higher than the 15% applied to Japan, South Korea, and the European Union.

Taiwan recorded the sixth-largest trade surplus with the US last year, exporting about $74 billion more than it imported, according to official figures.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

Just hours before an Aug. 1 deadline expired, US President Donald Trump imposed sweeping new tariffs on imports from global trading partners, escalating an aggressive trade policy aimed at reducing the US trade deficit.

In his election campaign, Donald Trump once said that ""tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary."" Now, after six months in office, the US president is eager to turn his very specific vision of global trade into reality.

With a move that shocked both politics and business across the world, Trump announced on April 2 that he would impose a ""baseline tariff"" of 10% on all goods imported to the United States.

In addition, goods from about 60 other trade partners would face so-called reciprocal tariffs that were even higher and meant as payback for the unfair trade policies of what Trump called ""the worst offenders.""

However, on July 31 Trump signed an executive order again imposing new, and even higher tariffs on scores of countries, citing emergency powers he said he is using to shrink the country's trade deficits with many of its trade partners.

The executive order lays out rates to be applied against nearly 70 countries, ranging from 10% to 41% for goods transshipped through other jurisdictions to avoid US duties.

In a minor reprieve that opens the door to further negotiations, the White House said the measures will take effect next week for most countries.

The order came after a flurry of tariff-related activity in previous weeks that saw some countries strike more favorable terms for trade with the US.



On July 27, the US and the European Union agreed that European goods imported to the US would face a 15% baseline tariff. This includes the EU's crucial automobile sector, which had been subject to a 25% levy since Trump took office earlier in January.

By contrast, the EU will charge US firms no duties at all, and has pledged to buy US energy worth $750 billion (€656 billion), as well as make investments in the US of around $600 billion, according to the White House.

The agreement, which still needs to be signed off by all 27 EU members, has already come under strong criticism. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said this week the EU had capitulated, describing Sunday as a ""dark day.""

The United Kingdom was the first country to strike a trade deal with Washington in May.

British products will be subject to a 10% base rate, with exceptions for some industries. The UK is still negotiating exemptions for its steel and aluminium products from the 25% rate in force. In return, the UK had to open its market further to US ethanol and beef.

Under a deal struck in July, Japan's exports to the US will be taxed at 15%, including automobiles, an industry accounting for 30% of Japanese exports to the US in 2024.

Tariffs of 50% on Japanese steel and aluminium will continue to apply and the White House said that under the deal, Japan would make an unspecified $550 billion investments in the US.

With regard to South Korea, recent negotiations have resulted in a 15% baseline tariff on all imports from that country — down from a threatened 25% for one of the US's top-10 trading partner and key Asian ally.

Trump said Wednesday that South Korea had also agreed to invest $350 billion in US projects and to purchase $100 billion of liquefied natural gas and other energy products.

Furthermore, South Korea will accept American products, including automobiles and agricultural goods into its markets and impose no import duties on them, he added.

Washington has also concluded trade deals with the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and Pakistan.

Products from the Philippines — a major exporter of high-tech items and apparel — will face a 19% levy. Vietnam was able to lower a threatened reciprocal tariff of 49% under a deal reached in early July. A main exporter of clothing and shoes to the US, Vietnam will see its shipments subject to a 20% tariff.

Indonesian exports to the US will be taxed at 19% and, according to Washington, nearly all US goods will be able to enter Indonesia tariff-free.

Pakistan, which was facing a potential 29% tariff under Trump's April 2 announcement, said Thursday it had struck a deal that would result in lower tariffs, as well as an agreement in which Washington would help develop the country's oil reserves.

China — the world's second-largest economy — is a special case. Washington and Beijing had raised tariffs on each other's goods to more than 100% before temporarily lowering rates for a 90-day period. That pause is set to end on August 12.

China has taken an aggressive stance in response to Trump's brief threat of imposing a 145% levy on imports, retaliating with tariffs of its own on US goods and blocking the sale of vital rare earth minerals and components used by American defense and high-tech manufacturers.

Countries without bilateral trade agreements will soon face reciprocal tariffs ranging from 25% to 50%, with a baseline of 15% to 20% for any not making a deal.

Among the tariff levels adjusted in Trump's latest order, Switzerland now faces a higher 39% duty. The Swiss government said Friday it would negotiate to avoid the higher levy, which will potentially hammer its key pharmaceutical industry. The new rate is up from the 31% previously threatened.

Brazil is one of the few major economies to run a trade deficit with the United States, meaning Brazil imports more from the US than it exports to the country.

Nevertheless, the US president has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on Brazil's products because of political differences. Trump called a current trial against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro a ""witch hunt,"" and has demanded the release of the ultraconservative politician.

Brazil's current president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has in turn called Trump an ""emperor"" and said he didn't fear publicly criticizing Trump.

India, meanwhile, has drawn Trump's ire for its huge trade surplus with the US and its trade ties with Russia.

As a result, Trump announced on Wednesday that he would impose a 25% tariff on Indian goods, plus an additional ""penalty"" because of India's purchase of Russian oil that helps Moscow finance its war in Ukraine.

On his Truth Social platform, Trump also wrote that India ""is our friend,"" but added its tariffs on US products ""are far too high.""

Canada and Mexico — two of the US' biggest trading partners — haven't been spared Trump's tariff threats either, even though trade between the three neighbors is governed by the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement, negotiated during Trump's first term in office.

Earlier this month, Trump threatened to raise current tariffs on Mexico from 25% to 30% starting on Aug. 1, saying President Claudia Sheinbaum's government hadn't done enough to help secure their shared border.

Many goods certified under the USMCA free-trade pact, however, have remained exempt.

On Thursday, the US president extended Mexico's current rates for 90 days to allow more time for trade negotiations. 

""The complexities of a Deal with Mexico are somewhat different than other Nations because of both the problems, and assets, of the Border, Trump said in a Truth Social post, following a call with Sheinbaum.

On Thursday, the US president singled out Canada for a separate tariff hike raising levies for goods from the country fom 25% to 35% starting on Aug. 1.

Trump also warned of more trade consequences for Canada after Prime Minister Mark Carney announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state. Trump's order also cited Canada's failure to ""cooperate in curbing the ongoing flood of fentanyl and other illicit drugs"" as well as its ""retaliation"" against his measures.

In March, Washington already imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian cars and auto parts, adding a 50% levy on steel and aluminium imports in June.

Air travelers in Germany may soon be able to carry up to two liters of liquids in their hand luggage at certain airports. However, the change will only apply at security checkpoints equipped with advanced CT scanners.

Strict liquid limits for air travel hand luggage may soon be history in the European Union, as new scanners capable of detecting liquid explosives receive official approval. 

Currently, air travelers are limited to carrying liquids in containers of no more than 100 milliliters, but the technology could mark the beginning of the end for one of air travel's most disliked rules.

The scanners utilize medical-grade CT imaging, providing high-resolution 3D visuals that allow security staff to examine the contents of luggage layer by layer without slowing the screening process. They can detect both solid and liquid explosives.

An EU Commission spokesperson told the DPA news agency that the technology now permits airports to lift the rule. But it remains up to each hub whether and when to implement the change.

The rules won't be relaxed immediately, with most airports not equipped with the technology. However, the German Airports Association (ADV) told the AFP news agency that air travelers at certain airports in Germany may soon be able to carry up to two liters of liquids in their hand luggage. 

""This is a major step toward greater convenience and faster procedures at airports,"" said ADV chief executive Ralph Beisel, calling the technology ""safe and reliable.""

Meanwhile, most German air passengers will have to wait. A mix of old and new equipment, inconsistent software readiness, and the inability to notify passengers in advance about which scanner will be used mean travelers must continue sticking to the previous rules. Items must still be placed in resealable plastic bags of up to one liter.

The original 100ml liquid rules have often confused travelers — particularly when first introduced — with unclear guidelines, inconsistent enforcement, and frustration over what's allowed.

Germany's largest airport in Frankfurt has installed the new scanners at 40 of its nearly 190 screening lanes, with 40 more devices on order. But for now, no policy changes are planned due to the uncertainty about scanner assignment for individual passengers.

In Munich, Germany's second-biggest hub, the scanners are already available in large numbers, but according to a government spokesperson, necessary software upgrades will be postponed to avoid disrupting the summer travel season. Therefore, the liquid restrictions remain, especially in lanes still using conventional technology.

The EU Commission says about 700 of the CT-based scanners are already in use or being installed across airports in 21 EU countries. The liquid rule was introduced in 2006, following a foiled terror plot involving the use of liquid explosives onboard a plane.

CT scanners have been around for years and were at times already used to permit larger liquid containers. However, doubts emerged last year about their reliability, prompting the EU to mandate additional testing.

Donald Trump hit Canada with 35 per cent tariffs as he announced sweeping levies on dozens of countries on Thursday night.

The US president issued an executive order listing reciprocal tariffs from 10 per cent to 41 per cent on 69 trading partners.

The tariffs will take effect on Aug 7 – except for Canada's levies, which will come into place this Friday.

Canada was among some of the harder-hit countries, as the White House blamed its “illicit drug crisis” for the hike.

The White House said the tariff increase from 25 per cent to 35 per cent was a result of Canada failing to “co-operate” in curbing fentanyl flows into the US, and its “continued inaction and retaliation”.

However, it comes hours after Mr Trump warned that the country's decision to back a Palestinian state put a trade deal between the two countries at risk.

On Wednesday night, Canada joined the UK in announcing that it would recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations in September.

Following the announcement, Mr Trump said it would be “very hard” for the US and Canada to strike a deal.

Mr Trump later added that he did not view the move as “a deal breaker” in trade talks, however.

The US president had earlier told reporters that Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, had called ahead of the Aug 1 tariff deadline, however, a conversation between the two did not take place.

Mr Trump previously said any country that failed to strike a deal with the US before Friday would be subjected to higher levies.

But the tariffs will not take effect for another seven days – with the exception of Canada – due to the government requiring more time to harmonise the rates.

“We haven't spoken to Canada today. [Carney] called and we'll, we'll see,” Mr Trump said during an event at the White House, before the 35 per cent rate was announced.

In a statement, Mr Carney said Canada would continue to negotiate with the US on its trading relationship.

“While the Canadian government is disappointed by this action, we remained committed to [Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement],” he said.

Doug Ford , the Ontario premier, demanded that Ottawa retaliate by hitting back with a 50 per cent counter-tariff on imports of US steel and aluminium.

“Canada shouldn't settle for anything less than the right deal. Now is not the time to roll over. We need to stand our ground,” he said in a post on X.

Mr Carney previously said trade talks with Washington had been constructive, but that they may not conclude before the deadline.

Talks between the two countries were at an intense phase, he added, but a deal that would remove all US tariffs was unlikely.

“Well, they have to pay a fair rate – that's all. It's very simple. They have been charging very, very high tariffs to our farmers, some over 200 per cent and they've been treating our farmers very badly,” Mr Trump said, when asked about negotiations.

He added that while he loved Canada, it had treated the United States “very badly” for years.

Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, said Mr Trump might reconsider the high tariffs if Mr Carney “starts turning on the charm and if he takes off his retaliation”.

The tariff hike on Canada contrasted sharply with Mr Trump's decision to grant Mexico a 90-day reprieve from increased levies of 30 per cent on many goods, to provide more time to negotiate a broader trade pact.

A US official said that Canadian officials “haven't shown the same level of constructiveness that we've seen from the Mexican side”.

Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, said she spoke with Mr Trump on the phone on Thursday morning, before the Aug 1 deadline.

“We avoided the tariff increase announced for tomorrow,” Ms Sheinbaum wrote on X, adding the call with the US president was “very good”.

Mr Trump slapped dozens of trading partners with steep tariffs ahead of the trade deal deadline, including a 50 per cent duty on Brazil.

Brazil's tariff rate was set at 10 per cent, but Mr Trump signed an executive order imposing an additional 40 per cent duty, after the country prosecuted its former president Jair Bolsonaro.

Meanwhile, India was hit with a 25 per cent tariff, Taiwan 20 per cent and Switzerland 39 per cent.

Pakistan celebrated its receipt of a 19 per cent tariff, in what appeared to be confirmation of warming relations with the Trump administration. Islamabad has offered the US deals on cryptocurrency and mining rights. 

It hopes the comparative edge over India will give its ailing economy a much-needed boost.

Britain's tariff rate remained at 10 per cent after a trade deal was reached between Sir Keir Starmer and Mr Trump in June.

Legal experts have questioned whether the president has the right to impose tariffs for political purposes. 

Mr Trump has so far cited trade deficits to justify his use of a federal economic emergency law.

			Employees at a Savannah River Site in South Carolina found it had a radiation level 10 times that allowed by federal regulations

A radioactive wasp nest was found next to a site in South Carolina that once made key parts for nuclear bombs.

Employees who routinely check radiation levels at the Savannah River Site near Aiken found the nest on July 3 on a post near tanks where liquid nuclear waste is stored, according to a report from the US Department of Energy.

The nest had a radiation level 10 times what is allowed by federal regulations, officials said.

The workers sprayed the nest with insect killer, removed it and disposed of it as radioactive waste. No wasps were found, officials said, and there is no danger to anyone.

The report said there is no leak from the waste tanks, and the nest was likely radioactive through what it called “onsite legacy radioactive contamination” from the residual radioactivity left from when the site was fully operational.

The watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch said the report was at best incomplete as it did not detail where the contamination came from, how the wasps might have encountered it and the possibility that there could be another radioactive nest if there is a leak somewhere.

Knowing the type of wasp nest could also be critical – some wasps make nests out of dirt and others use different materials, which could pinpoint where the contamination came from, Tom Clements, executive director of the group, wrote in a text message.

“I'm as mad as a hornet that SRS didn't explain where the radioactive waste came from or if there is some kind of leak from the waste tanks that the public should be aware of,” Mr Clements said.

The tank farm is well inside the boundaries of the site, and wasps generally fly just a few hundred yards from their nests, so there is no danger they are outside the facility, according to a statement from Savannah River Mission Completion, which now oversees the site.

If there had been wasps found, they would have significantly lower levels of radiation than their nests, according to the statement which was given to the Aiken Standard.

The site was opened in the early 1950s to manufacture the plutonium pits needed to make the core of nuclear bombs during the start of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Now the site has shifted toward making fuel for nuclear plants and clean up.

The site generated more than 165 million gallons (625 million litres) of liquid nuclear waste, which has, through evaporation, been reduced to about 34 million gallons (129 million litres), according to Savannah River Mission Completion.

There are still 43 of the underground tanks in use, while eight have been closed.

Former Green Beret Anthony Aguilar recounted the horrific story of the small child who was just grateful for food.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

A small, emaciated Palestinian boy in Gaza named Amir was killed by Israeli forces just moments after receiving aid from American contractors in May, former U.S. Green Beret Anthony Aguilar has recounted. The horrific incident took place during his 45 days in Gaza with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) — and was one of over 800 killings of Palestinian aid seekers near GHF sites.

In interviews this week, Aguilar said that on May 28, just two days after GHF sites first opened in Gaza, he and another U.S. guard encountered a boy, who he identified as Amir. Aguilar said that he and the other contractor thought Amir may be hurt, because he was carrying only small bags of rice, flour, and lentils that he picked up from the ground. They waved him over.

“The [American contractor] standing next to me — this young boy holds his hand, and he kisses it. Then he comes to me, and he holds my hand, and he kisses it,” Aguilar said in an interview with Tucker Carlson, explaining that kissing hands is a sign of deep respect in Arab cultures. He said that he and the other U.S. veteran he stood next to were “touched.”

Aguilar shared pictures of Amir with news outlets. The young boy is small and skinny, his bare feet covered in dust. He looks no older than 10 or 12.

“He was very emaciated. He had no shoes on, his pants were tattered, he had a kind of a rope or string holding his pants up. Filthy. Probably hasn't bathed in months, probably hasn't eaten in days,” Aguilar said. “I put my arm on his left shoulder and I look at him. I can feel the bones in his shoulder. I can feel the weakness in his arm. I can feel the vulnerability. And I can feel the desperation.”

The child, Amir, walked 12 kilometers on foot and kissed the hand of Anthony Aguilar, the resigned American officer from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, in a plea for aid. Shortly after, Israeli soldiers killed Amir at the same location. pic.twitter.com/IZ02IakEBL

Amir left with the crowd to exit the GHF site, as Israeli forces and American contractors ended the aid distribution as they often did, with tear gas, pepper spray, and bullets. Outside the GHF site was an active Israeli combat zone, where Israeli soldiers were firing machine guns. And Amir, along with a number of people who left, was promptly shot by Israeli forces and killed, Aguilar said. 

“Amir didn't make it home. He walked 12 kilometers to get some food, picked up scraps off the ground cause that's all that was left, because the eight-minute mayhem took all of the food. And by the time he got there, walking with no shoes, hungry and tired, the only thing left for him was to pick up some remnants off the ground,” said Aguilar. “And when he left, he was killed by the IDF.”

“Why? Because they lack discipline. They lack standards. And they lack basic human decency,” he said.

The story of Amir is one of numerous similar incidents that Aguilar says he encountered during his 45 days with GHF in Israel and Gaza. This week, he did a series of media interviews speaking out about what he saw, with Israeli forces committing war crime after war crime, he's said — and the U.S. standing in complicity. 

In at least one case captured on video by Aguilar, he says that U.S. contractors have also opened fire on Palestinians. In another instance, Aguilar said that he was told by Israeli soldiers to shoot at children at the aid distribution site, and he refused. He was then disciplined by a higher up within the U.S. firm overseeing GHF operations, Safe Reach Solutions, with the executive telling him to never say no to a client — in this case, the Israeli military.

GHF has tried to discredit Aguilar, saying that he was fired and that he is disgruntled and spreading “false allegations.” But Aguilar has refuted these claims, showing documentation of his contract termination and saying that he left his contract early because his concerns over the GHF mechanism were dismissed.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday used emergency authority to impose high tariff rates on imports from dozens of American trading partners, including Canada — a move that economists criticized as a senseless approach to global trade that will further increase costs for consumers who are already struggling to get by.

Trump outlined the new tariff rates in executive orders signed just ahead of his arbitrary August 1 deadline for U.S. trading partners to negotiate a deal with the White House, whose erratic, aggressive, and legally dubious approach has alarmed world leaders.

Under the president's new orders, Canadian goods that are not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will face 35% import duties, while steel and aluminum imports will face a 50% tariff rate.

Trump claimed Canada “has failed to cooperate in curbing the ongoing flood of fentanyl and other illicit drugs.” But Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney hit back in a statement early Friday, noting that Canada “accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes.”

“While we will continue to negotiate with the United States on our trading relationship, the Canadian government is laser-focused on what we can control: building Canada strong,” Carney added. “Canadians will be our own best customer, creating more well-paying careers at home, as we strengthen and diversify our trading partnerships throughout the world.”

Economist Brad Setser said that while the impact of the higher tariff on Canadian imports could be muted because of the exemption of USMCA-covered products such as oil, the 35% rate is still “insane” and “dumb.”

“Same with the high tariff on Switzerland. Crazy,” Setser wrote, pointing to the 39% rate for Switzerland imports. “This isn't just protectionism, it is bad protectionism — and will have all sorts of unintended consequences.”

The new tariff rates for Canadian goods will take effect Friday while the higher rates for other nations such as Brazil (50%), India (25%), and Vietnam (20%) won't kick in until next week “to give Customs and Border Protection officials time to prepare,” The Washington Post reported. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs, which are effectively taxes paid by importers — who often pass those costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices.

“Trump's definition of ‘winning' is hitting the American people with ever-higher taxes,” Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, wrote late Thursday.

Recent U.S. economic data indicates that Trump's tariffs are already putting upward pressure on prices — and companies are using the president's trade chaos as an excuse to drive up prices further and pad their bottom lines.

The Tax Foundation noted earlier this week that “a variety of food imports” will be impacted by Trump's tariffs, likely leading to “higher food prices for consumers.” More than 80% of Americans are already concerned about the price of groceries and many are struggling to stay afloat, according to survey data released Thursday by The Century Foundation.

Baker warned Thursday that even nations that have agreed to trade frameworks with the U.S. are not out of the woods.

“Deals are meaningless to Trump. He'll break them in a second any time he feels like it,” Baker wrote. “I trust everyone negotiating with Trump understands that fact.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Experts say Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” is likely to drive up energy prices even higher.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Congressional lawmakers are demanding to know how the Trump administration plans to bring down energy prices as electricity bills hit record highs. 

“A combination of the Administration's regulatory decisions, the impacts of tariffs, and the Administration's reversal of key energy investments is driving up energy bills for Americans around the country,” Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts), Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island) wrote in a letter to heads of several federal agencies on July 29.

Since the start of the year, electricity prices have increased almost 5 percent — and in June alone, prices increased by almost a full percentage point. Summer electricity bills are expected to be an average of $784, the highest price in at least 12 years, according to the legislators' letter.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The lawmakers detailed several ways President Donald Trump “continues to make an already dire situation even worse.” His administration has ordered states to “keep defunct, unwanted, and unneeded coal plants open …  foisting tens of millions of dollars of new maintenance and retention costs onto consumers in 15 states.”

In May, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former fracking executive, ordered Michigan to keep a coal powered plant open, just eight days before its scheduled closure. Between the end of May and June 30, it cost $29 million to comply with the secretary's order.

An analysis by Global Witness found that companies and people with ties to the fossil fuel industry donated more than $19 million to Trump's presidential inaugural fund. Experts say Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” is likely to drive up energy prices even higher. 

“Based on Trump's tax law and the ongoing rollbacks of environmental standards at the EPA and other agencies, by 2035, families nationwide can expect to pay up to $430 a year more on energy costs,” Natural Resources Defense Council's editorial director, Jenny Shalant, wrote in a blog post entitled “Why Your Electricity Bill is So High.” 

More than 70 million U.S. households struggle to afford their utilities and have to choose between paying their utility bill or buying necessities like food and medicine. Despite rising costs and a widespread need for assistance, the Trump administration fired all of the federal workers who administer the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and has proposed eliminating its federal funding. The program helps approximately 6 million low-income households pay their utility bills.

“Rather than keeping his campaign promise to ‘cut the price of energy and electricity in half,' President Trump's shortsighted approach to energy policy is driving prices higher and doing so quickly,” the lawmakers wrote. “At the same time, the Trump Administration is cutting programs that help families afford higher electricity costs and lower their energy usage, all while utility CEOs receive massive payouts.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

On July 26, Taiwanese citizens went to the polls and voted on whether to recall 24 of their 113 representatives—or 21 percent of the legislature. It was an unprecedented moment in the island's democratic history. Citizens have recalled individual Taiwanese legislators in the past, but never before have they attempted to recall politicians en masse.

The recalls were ultimately defeated. But their very occurrence, and the months of campaigning that preceded them, highlight a fundamental challenge in Taiwan's politics: deep polarization. Taiwan's two main political parties, the center-left Democratic Progressive Party and the center-right Kuomintang, increasingly despise each other. Many DPP politicians have suggested the KMT is too sympathetic to China and may be collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party. The DPP's leader, Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, even said that recalling politicians was necessary to remove “impurities” from society. Numerous KMT politicians, meanwhile, have accused Lai of brutal, authoritarian behavior. During the campaign, KMT leader Eric Chu compared the DPP to the Nazis and Lai to Adolf Hitler. The island's third-biggest party, the KMT-aligned Taiwan People's Party, also deeply detests the DPP government. The TPP's leader is facing corruption charges, and the party claims it is being politically persecuted.

Taiwan's parties, in other words, portray their opponents not just as politically different but as autocratic traitors. They see themselves, meanwhile, as democracy's saviors. This deep-seated animosity has led to extreme governmental dysfunction—which is what prompted citizens to mobilize the recall efforts. The KMT and TPP control the legislature, where they consistently oppose Lai's endeavors. Taiwan's progressives, furious at the resulting obstruction, thus gathered enough signatures to vote on recalling roughly a third of the KMT's legislators. Their failure means that extreme polarization will continue to plague the island's government. In fact, the hatred and gridlock could intensify.

There is still an outside chance the DPP could win the six seats it needs to gain control of the legislature. Seven more KMT legislators are facing recalls at the end of August. But even if the recall efforts succeed, the island as a whole will remain riddled with divisions—which means it will be in a weak position to deal with growing geopolitical threats. Over the last several years, Beijing has become increasingly aggressive toward Taiwan. The People's Liberation Army has conducted more drills around the island, and senior Chinese leaders have been more blunt about the possibility of military action. To handle this challenge, Taiwan's citizens and officials will need to be willing to fight for all of the island, not just for their partisan affiliates. Taiwanese leaders will have to create a unified course of action. Instead, right now, they are prioritizing defeating one another over defending the nation.

Across the United States and Europe, analysts and policymakers frequently cite Taiwan as a paradigm of democracy—an inspiring example of how a polity can transform itself from a brutal dictatorship into a thriving liberal state. There is, after all, much about the island to celebrate. It is rich and prosperous, with a powerful civil society and free and fair elections.

But that isn't the whole story. Taiwan's parties may respect the freedom of the press and the results of contests. But they do not respect one another, and neither do their supporters. Taiwanese citizens suffer not simply from polarization but from affective polarization, where they actively resent people who hold different views and see them as less trustworthy at best and treacherous at worst. Citizens sharply disagree not just about policy but about their island's core values and future trajectory.

Taiwan's polarization encompasses many different issues. But it is most dangerous on the question of how best to handle Beijing. Only a small minority of citizens in Taiwan want to join the People's Republic of China, and almost everyone believes they belong to a separate political entity. But Taiwan's citizens do not agree on how to protect themselves from Beijing. For the KMT, Taiwan must maintain strong ties with the People's Republic, leaning into the island's Chinese heritage in order to assure Beijing of their shared-if-separate connection. The DPP, by contrast, believes there is no way to appease the mainland's leaders. Instead, it thinks Taiwan can only survive by building a powerful military and strengthening ties with anyone other than Beijing, and particularly with Washington. The DPP also believes that close relations with China threaten Taiwan's ability to maintain its own identity, distinct from the mainland's.

The divide over China has fueled polarization in Taiwan for decades. But it has grown worse over the last several years—partially thanks to China's growing threat. Now, the parties see their opponents as dangerous to Taiwan's freedom. To much of the DPP, the KMT-TPP coalition has been systematically undermining democracy by pushing through a series of controversial reforms to increase legislative power over the president and by slashing and freezing large swaths of the national budget on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. The KMT and TPP accuse the DPP of being antidemocratic warmongers who are using their power to systematically silence opposition, giving Beijing an excuse to attack.

Both supporters and opponents of the recall elections see these issues as existential in nature. For supporters, the recall was, and is, a matter of national survival. The current crop of KMT legislators has failed to govern competently and is allowing the CCP to erode Taiwanese democracy. Opponents of the recall argued that the DPP seeks to remove the opposition so it does not need to compromise and that full DPP control of the presidency and the legislature will remove checks and balances essential to democracy. As the recall has unfolded, the parties have further demonized the other side. Legislators have even physically attacked one another in the middle of parliamentary debates. Any sympathy for the other position is akin to treason.

Taiwan's intense polarization comes at a particularly inopportune time. Over the last few years, China's threats to the island have grown. Beijing is sending planes and ships into Taiwan's airspace and waterways more often and for longer periods. The People's Liberation Army now carries out regular drills around the Taiwan Strait. And China's leadership has become more belligerent in its statements. Last year, for example, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that “the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family. No one can sever our family bonds, and no one can stop the historical trend of national reunification.”

Taiwan's divisions make it very hard for the island to handle this menace. Consider, for example, the dispute over its budget. Lai and the DPP have called for increasing defense spending. The KMT-led coalition, meanwhile, has called for decreasing it. The dispute between the two ended up freezing billions in military spending, some of which remains locked. This freeze not only weakens Taiwan's armed forces but also its relationship with the United States. The Trump administration has demanded that Taipei dramatically increase defense expenditures if it wants continued aid. The DPP and KMT, meanwhile, have increasingly different views on the United States. In an April poll, we found that 50 percent of DPP supporters see the United States as a trustworthy or very trustworthy ally, whereas just three percent of KMT supporters and ten percent of TPP supporters think so.

Taiwan will need a national consensus to respond effectively to threats from Beijing. If some citizens see others as evil, and some leaders are portrayed as villains, they may not feel the kind of patriotism required to fight together. If China invades under Lai's tenure, for instance, many KMT and TPP voters and leaders will blame the president and his administration for provoking Beijing. They might then refuse to defend the island. In a survey conducted in March by Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research, 85 percent of DPP supporters said they were willing to fight for the island in the event of an invasion, compared with 48 percent of KMT voters and 54 percent of TPP voters.



Partisans, of course, might change their minds if the People's Liberation Army starts bombing their neighborhoods. Nothing unifies a society quite like an invasion. But it would take time before Taiwan's divided population rallied around the flag, and time is a luxury Taipei may lack. In fact, the island would need to rush into action even in the face of a lesser crisis. If Beijing quarantines or blockades Taiwan, for example, the island's leaders would face a narrow political window in which to define the crisis and coordinate a timely response, before messaging from partisan media takes over. If officials fail to establish a shared narrative and voters retreat into their ideological echo chambers, Taiwan will lose strategic advantages.

Beijing would also do everything it could to foster internal disarray. For example, if the Chinese Communist Party cut off Taiwan's access to outside communication, it could spread narratives claiming the UN supports its blockade and that no assistance is coming to the island. Beijing, after all, already carries out plenty of disinformation operations to deepen Taiwan's polarization and foment division. For instance, in both the 2020 and 2024 presidential races, watchdog organizations in Taiwan documented mass social media campaigns from the mainland trying to convince voters that democracy is not worth it or that a vote for the DPP is a vote for war.

Beijing's campaigns have created plenty of headaches for Taiwanese officials. But the island's society would be polarized over the question of China even without mainland efforts. Research on Beijing's nonstop disinformation campaigns have found it has decidedly mixed effects on political opinion, often backfiring. Many of Beijing's efforts to scare Taiwanese citizens invoke more cringe than panic. China, in other words, is often adding fuel to a fire that is already raging.

Taiwan's polarization is a serious security threat. But the island has shown resilience amid even greater challenges in the past. In less than 40 years, Taiwan has successfully charted a path from martial law and authoritarian rule to free and fair elections, despite its contested geopolitical status. There are good reasons to think it can surmount polarization.

The first is that not everyone in Taiwan is a staunch partisan. Polls show that roughly 40 percent of voters do not outwardly identify with any party. Not everyone in this pool is actually nonpartisan; plenty of voters say they are independents but, in practice, always vote one way. Still, there are plenty of Taiwanese voters who shift between camps or want compromise from their leaders. In fact, the recall movement has generated a small but growing sense of solidarity between moderate DPP supporters and moderate KMT ones. They are jointly frustrated over the legislature's incompetence—and frightened by Beijing's interference in Taiwanese democracy (which was evident throughout the recall campaigns).

The island's leaders have also shown their ability to deliver when faced with emergencies. During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan was able to present a remarkably unified front to combat the outbreak. Its political leadership quickly joined together in describing the virus as a national security threat, prompting a whole-of-society approach to prevent the spread of the disease. As a result, the island was quite successful at managing the pandemic, especially compared with the many countries, where governments struggled to get full public buy-in to health measures.

None of this means Taiwan's leaders have to see eye to eye on how to deal with Beijing. There is room for healthy debate. But politicians need to avoid ad hominem attacks, accusations of treason, and demonizing swaths of society. The island's leaders must show greater cooperation when it comes to matters of defense. Extreme or provocative rhetoric does not increase the relative level of peace in the Taiwan Strait. And by partially collaborating over China, Taiwan's leaders might be able to broadly heal the island. Defending its current democratic system and way of life, after all, is the one thing that most Taiwanese agree is essential. Finding some points of consensus on this fundamental issue might thus be the first step toward overcoming polarization.

 Dalia Dassa Kaye

During the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel achieved stunning military success against what seemed to be formidable adversaries. Yet Israel didn't translate its military success into active diplomacy; if it had, the region and Israel's position in it might look very different today. Israel may not have thought it had a choice to make back then: it didn't believe it had viable Arab partners for peace, and its military dominance was far from assured, as demonstrated just six years later when Egypt launched a surprise attack and started the Yom Kippur War.

The situation is different today. After its 12-day war with Iran in June, Israel is in a far superior military and regional position than it was in 1967. It has neutered its most serious regional threats, and it has been decades since an Arab state fought a war with Israel. It has steadily degraded its nonstate adversaries, scoring surprising military and intelligence wins against Hezbollah in Lebanon last summer and continuing its decapitation of Hamas's leadership in Gaza. Its attack against Iran achieved undeniable military success in damaging Iran's nuclear and missile facilities, and it demonstrated deep intelligence penetration through its brazen killing of Iran's top military leadership and nuclear scientists. U.S. President Donald Trump's subsequent decision to join the attack boosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu domestically.

Israel's wins are not without limits, of course. Experts have questioned the full extent of damage to Iran's nuclear program, and the strikes may have only strengthened the Iranian leadership and increased its motivation to cross the nuclear threshold. Houthi missile and drone attacks against Israel have also continued, suggesting that the diminishment of Iran's proxy network is a work in progress. The Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir, acknowledged in remarks in late July that “Iran and its axis remain in our sights; the campaign against Iran isn't over.” Still, despite these remaining challenges, the overriding Israeli perception is that the regional balance sheet is working in its favor.

This is arguably Israel's moment to leverage this favorable strategic landscape and convert its military success into diplomatic capital, restarting talks with the Palestinians that could create long-term stability and encourage more of Israel's Arab neighbors to normalize relations. After the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat used his military achievements to advance a strategic decision to make peace.

But Netanyahu is not steering his country in that direction. His desire for “total victory” has fueled a relentlessly destructive military campaign in Gaza and beyond with little regard for the damage it has wreaked on the country's regional and global relationships, not to mention the dire human consequences.

To the extent that Netanyahu is thinking ahead, he sees the military successes of the past 18 months as an opportunity for Israel to forge a new regional order while pursuing a maximalist agenda. Netanyahu believes that he can pursue normalization and nonbelligerency agreements with Arab powers such as Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria without making serious concessions on the Palestinian issue or unduly limiting Israel's freedom of military action across its borders. Even if Israel makes some limited headway on such agreements once the Gaza war finally ends, regional deals that do not address the core Israeli-Palestinian conflict will have little or no domestic support within neighboring states and are more likely to lay the ground for renewed conflict.

In early July, in remarks during his third White House visit with Trump in less than six months, Netanyahu reflected on how Israeli success might bring new opportunities: “I think that everyone understands that the situation has changed,” he boasted. “Iran was essentially running Syria, directly through Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been brought to its knees. Iran is out of the picture. So I think this presents opportunities for stability, for security, and eventually for peace.”

Many observers hoped that the Israeli-Iranian cease-fire in June would revitalize diplomacy on Gaza after months of stalemate. With Netanyahu's success against Iran, this logic went, Netanyahu would no longer fear that ending the war would threaten his political survival. Indeed, polling indicates that most Israelis want an end to the fighting in Gaza to facilitate the release of the Israeli hostages that Hamas continues to hold. Talks to establish a cease-fire did in fact resume on July 6 in Doha, but they did not yield an agreement—and the deal under discussion was merely a short-term pause in fighting and a limited hostage and prisoner release, not a full end to the war.

Meanwhile, Israeli leaders continue to press ahead with plans to relocate Gazans into limited “humanitarian” areas in southern Gaza, with the wider objective largely understood to be the eventual removal of Gazans from the strip, measures that Israeli scholars and even Moshe Yaalon, the former Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, say would amount to war crimes. Israeli officials seem to believe that Trump supports their plans to displace Gazans, plans that track with Trump's earlier proposal to resettle Palestinians outside of Gaza and transform it into a “Riviera of the Middle East.”

Although Israel says it does not want to stay in Gaza, it now controls much of it. When asked about postwar conditions, Israel's ambassador to the UN told The Guardian, “I think we will make sure in terms of security, we have the ability to act in Gaza, very similar to what's happening today in Judea and Samaria,” the term some Israelis use to describe the occupied West Bank. In other words, Israel's military occupation of the territories will likely continue into the foreseeable future, and Israel could escalate by annexing the West Bank and even parts of Gaza.

All of this suggests that Israel's war with Iran has not altered Netanyahu's long-standing views of the region. For him, military wins demonstrate that strength pays off, making compromise with the Palestinians unnecessary for his wider regional aims. In this reading, the region will have to accommodate Israeli preferences, and not vice versa. From Netanyahu's perspective, Arab leaders are eager to benefit from Israel's technological and military prowess. Although the Arab world galvanized in opposition to Israel's war in Gaza with summits and statements, none of the parties to the Abraham Accords have pulled out. Egypt and Jordan have not suggested undoing their peace treaties with Israel; Jordan even assisted in Israel's defense against Iranian attacks last year. Arab states issued statements condemning Israeli strikes against Iran last month, but Netanyahu has long believed that these states are fundamentally aligned with Israeli efforts to clip Iran's wings, seeing Iran, not Israel, as the region's most significant strategic threat. But regional realities are unlikely to be as accommodating as Netanyahu may believe, even with Trump's support.

The most sought-after regional deal is between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a regional powerhouse viewed as a key leader of the Arab and Islamic world. The Biden administration exerted considerable effort to broker such a deal, with Netanyahu even announcing at the United Nations in September 2023 that Israel was on the “cusp” of a historic agreement with Saudi Arabia. Although it was never clear a deal was as close as Netanyahu claimed, the Saudis significantly hardened their position in the wake of the Gaza war. Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud reflected consistent Saudi positions when he bluntly stated that normalization with Israel is “off the table until we have a resolution to Palestinian statehood.”

Israelis may believe that once the Gaza war is out of the headlines, the Saudis will settle for less; a deal with Israel, after all, would put the Saudis in further good graces with Trump and provide economic, intelligence, and security benefits. But the Saudis are unlikely to share this calculus. Saudi Arabia has found other ways to please Trump without focusing on Israel, including promises of hefty economic investments and arms deals during Trump's visit to the kingdom in May. The Saudis have also expended so much political capital in linking normalization with Israel to a Palestinian state that they are unlikely to settle with just lip service to the cause—and the current Israeli leadership is not even providing that.



Israel's war with Iran has only further complicated Arab positions. Regional powers such as Saudi Arabia have been normalizing ties with Iran in recent years, in large part to stay out of Iran's cross hairs. The Saudis and other Gulf Arab states are focused on domestic priorities and economic diversification plans, and wars are not good for business. Although Israel's neighbors no doubt welcomed the degradation of Iranian military capabilities, they did not celebrate Israel's attacks, which put the region on the brink of full-scale war. Indeed, Iran's retaliatory strike on the U.S. base in Qatar, designed to limit casualties and avoid further escalation, nonetheless was a potent reminder that the Israeli-Iranian-U.S. conflict puts Gulf states in harm's way. The Saudis have continued to engage the Iranians and promote diplomacy over military conflict, as evidenced by Saudi Arabia's hosting of the Iranian foreign minister in his first visit to a Gulf state since the Iranian attack on Qatar.

Israel's Arab neighbors may welcome keeping Iran in a box but also worry about a completely unrestrained Israel, which is increasingly seen as a regional destabilizer, not a regional savior. In Syria, for instance, a common perception is that Israel is encouraging divisions and undermining the new government's attempts to unify the country. In mid-July, after a recent spate of sectarian violence in Syria's south, Israel launched airstrikes on Syrian government facilities in Damascus. Israeli officials claimed their intent was to protect Syria's Druze minority “owing to the deep covenant of blood with our Druze citizens in Israel” and to “ensure the demilitarization of the region adjacent to our border with Syria.” But Syrian leader Ahmed al-Shara characterized the Israeli intervention as a plot to divide Syria and destabilize the country. Thomas Barrack, a close ally of Trump who is serving as the U.S. special envoy to Syria and U.S. ambassador to Turkey, said the Israeli strikes were “poorly timed” and complicated efforts to stabilize the region.

Indeed, the Israeli strikes on Damascus underscore how Netanyahu is not only misreading the situation with his Arab neighbors but potentially with Trump. The Trump administration has been focused on getting a deal between Israel and Syria ever since the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2024. The new Syrian leadership was uniquely interested in new security agreements since it wanted economic relief to rebuild the country. To that end, the Trump administration backed lifting sanctions on Syria, and the president demonstrated U.S. political support for the new government through his high-profile meeting with Shara in Riyadh in May. The Trump administration will want to see its political and economic investments in Syria pay off through an Israeli-Syrian deal—ideally even announcing Syria's joining of the Abraham Accords. But Netanyahu has made such a deal more difficult with Israel's aggressive military posture inside Syria, a posture some analysts see as overreach that is making unnecessary enemies even as Syria currently has little capacity to harm Israel.

Netanyahu may be correct in surmising that Israel's neighbors respect its new position of strength, but he is repeatedly misjudging their reactions when that strength lacks a political purpose and ignores their interests. Arab leaders already facing significant domestic challenges will have a hard time achieving extensive normalization deals with Israel when there is hostile sentiment toward Israel among Arab publics. By pursuing his current course toward the Palestinians, Netanyahu may very well end up with a forever war in Gaza, unrest in the West Bank, constant “mowing the lawn” efforts in Iran, and no progress toward normalization with Arab neighbors—all while the country's international image suffers as never before.

There are other ways forward. Israeli leaders could take Arab proposals seriously, proposals that are seeking to bring humanitarian relief and stabilize and rebuild Gaza without Hamas and without forcing Gazans to leave their homes. The Israeli government has rejected these Arab initiatives, as has the Trump administration.

Israel can make other choices, and it has done so before. Previous Israeli prime ministers understood that Israel's conflict with the Palestinians is its most serious existential threat. Netanyahu has tried instead to demonstrate that it is possible to marginalize the Palestinians and emasculate their national aspirations without sacrificing Israel's ultimate acceptance into the region or its own security.

Shimon Peres was ridiculed for talking about a new Middle East based on economic cooperation and regional integration built on a foundation of peace with the Palestinians. But talk of a new peaceful Middle East today, one based on Israeli military dominance with no political horizon for Palestinians, is no less fantastical. And worse, it will be far more dangerous, bringing Israel right back to where it started.

            The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History last month removed a board that referenced President Donald Trump's two impeachments from an exhibit on the American presidency.
    


            In a statement to CNN on Thursday, The Smithsonian Institution said the decision, which was first reported by The Washington Post, was made after a review of the museum's “legacy content” this year.
    


            Unmentioned in the statement was Trump's executive order earlier this year that appeared crafted to direct the Smithsonian to soften or distort forthright discussions about certain aspects of American history, which could include the legacy of racism in the United States and parts of Trump's own history-making but controversial first term.
    


            The exhibit had last been updated in 2008 and included information about the impeachments of Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, and the impeachment process against President Richard Nixon, who resigned over the Watergate scandal before he could be formally impeached.
    


            Trump is the only president in American history to be impeached twice; in 2019 on charges alleging he unlawfully solicited Ukraine to influence the 2020 presidential election, and in 2021 for his actions related to the insurrection at the US Capitol that year. He was acquitted both times by the Senate.
    


            In September 2021, the Smithsonian placed a board over the exhibit which read: “Case under redesign (history happens*)” and referenced Trump's two impeachments.
    


            “On December 18, 2019, the House impeached Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress,” the reference to Trump's first impeachment read. “The charges focused on the president's solicitation of foreign influence in the 2020 presidential election and his defiance of Congressional subpoenas. President Trump was acquitted in January 2020.”
    


            “On January 13, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached twice,” the reference to his second impeachment read. “The charge was incitement of insurrection, based on repeated ‘false statements' challenging the 2020 election results and his January 6 speech that ‘encouraged — and foreseeably resulted in — lawless action at the Capitol. Because Trump's term ended on January 20, his acquittal on February 13 made him the first former president tried by the Senate.”
    


            The Smithsonian said in a statement that the board “was intended to be a short-term measure to address current events at the time, however, the label remained in place until July 2025.”
    


            The statement added: “A large permanent gallery like The American Presidency that opened in 2000, requires significant amount of time and funding to update and renew. A future and updated exhibit will include all impeachments.”
    


            The statement did not say when the exhibit would be updated.
    


            Asked about the removal of references to Trump's impeachment, a White House spokesperson said in a statement, “Unfortunately for far too long the Smithsonian museums have highlighted divisive, DEI exhibits which are out of touch with mainstream America.”
    


            “We are fully supportive of updating displays to highlight American greatness,” spokesperson Davis Ingle said. “The Trump administration will continue working to ensure that the Smithsonian removes all improper ideology and once again unites and instills pride in all Americans regarding our great history.”
    


            Trump's order aimed at the Smithsonian is just one example of his efforts to exert his influence on American cultural, athletic and artistic institutions and browbeat them into eliminating aspects of their work.
    


            They include his efforts to take over the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, to have the Washington Commanders football team to revert back to their old name and to stop the participation of transgender people in women's sports.

BRUSSELS (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration says it is weighing what to do with family planning supplies stockpiled in Europe that campaigners and two U.S. senators are fighting to save from destruction. 

Concerns that the Trump administration plans to incinerate the stockpile have angered family planning advocates on both sides of the Atlantic. Campaigners say the supplies stored in a U.S.-funded warehouse in Geel, Belgium, include contraceptive pills, contraceptive implants and IUDs that could spare women in war zones and elsewhere the hardship of unwanted pregnancies.

U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Tommy Pigott said Thursday in response to a question about the contraceptives that “we're still in the process here in terms of determining the way forward.”

“When we have an update, we'll provide it,” he said.

Belgium says it has been talking with U.S. diplomats about trying to spare the supplies from destruction, including possibly moving them out of the warehouse. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Florinda Baleci told The Associated Press that she couldn't comment further “to avoid influencing the outcome of the discussions.” 

The Trump administration's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, which managed foreign aid programs, left the supplies' fate uncertain. 

Pigott didn't detail the types of contraceptives that make up the stockpile. He said some of the supplies, bought by the previous administration, could “potentially be” drugs designed to induce abortions. Pigott didn't detail how that might impact Trump administration thinking about how to deal with the drugs or the entire stockpile.




Costing more than $9 million and funded by U.S taxpayers, the family planning supplies were intended for women in war zones, refugee camps and elsewhere, according to a bipartisan letter of protest to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio from U.S. senators Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, and Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski.

They said destroying the stockpile “would be a waste of U.S. taxpayer dollars as well as an abdication of U.S. global leadership in preventing unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and maternal deaths — key goals of U.S. foreign assistance.”

They urged Rubio to allow another country or partner to distribute the contraceptives. 

Concerns voiced by European campaigners and lawmakers that the supplies could be transported to France for incineration have led to mounting pressure on government officials to intervene and save them.

The executive branch of the European Union, through spokesman Guillaume Mercier, said Friday that “we continue to monitor the situation closely to explore the most effective solutions.” 

The U.S. branch of family planning aid group MSI Reproductive Choices said it offered to purchase, repackage and distribute the stock at its own expense but “these efforts were repeatedly rejected.” The group said the supplies included long-acting IUDs, contraceptive implants and pills, and that they have long shelf-lives, extending as far as 2031.

Aid group Doctors Without Borders said incineration would be “an intentionally reckless and harmful act against women and girls everywhere.”

Charles Dallara, the grandson of a French former lawmaker who was a contraception pioneer in France, urged President Emmanuel Macron to not let France “become an accomplice to this scandal.”

“Do not allow France to take part in the destruction of essential health tools for millions of women,” Dallara wrote in an appeal to the French leader. “We have a moral and historical responsibility.”

Criminal defense attorney Dina Doll says Sean “Diddy” Combs' fame helped him hire a top-tier legal team — something most defendants can't afford. The entertainment mogul was convicted of prostitution-related offenses but acquitted Wednesday of sex trafficking and racketeering charges.

NEW YORK (AP) — Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs could face a prison sentence “substantially higher” than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges.

They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. 3 sentencing. 

In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed.

Each prostitution-related charge carries a potential maximum 10 years in prison.

Prosecutors said after the verdict that they thought federal sentencing guidelines meant to prevent wide disparities in sentencings for the same crimes would likely call for a prison term of four to five years. But they said Thursday they believe the guidelines range “will be substantially higher,” raising the risk Combs will flee.

Judge Arun Subramanian will have wide latitude in determining a sentence and can choose to ignore the guidelines, which are not mandatory. Combs' lawyers have said they believe the guidelines, if properly calculated, will call for 21 to 27 months in prison.




On the day of the verdict, prosecutors won a bail fight after defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo argued Combs should be freed immediately on bail.

Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a “lack of danger to any person or the community.” But he said Agnifilo could renew the request.

In doing so Tuesday, Agnifilo cited other cases he said were comparable to Combs' conviction in which defendants were granted bail. And he cited severe conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Combs has been held since his September arrest at a New York hotel.

He also said Combs was being treated unfairly for engaging in a “swingers” lifestyle in which he and his girlfriends sometimes invited male sex workers to join them in multiday marathon sex performances. 

Prosecutors said in their filing Thursday that Combs' conviction on the prostitution-related counts carried a mandatory requirement that he remain in jail prior to sentencing, unless he could prove exceptional circumstances, which they said he cannot.

They said he should also remain in prison as a danger to the community, a claim that Agnifilo disputed in his papers.

“Sean Combs will not be violent to anyone. As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,” Agnifilo wrote earlier this week.

Prosecutors also said conditions at the federal lockup had improved considerably before Combs was arrested. A federal judge in January 2024 had blasted conditions at the jail, including its extensive lockdowns and inadequate medical care.

Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.

“The defendant's extensive history of violence — and his continued attempt to minimize his recent violent conduct — demonstrates his dangerousness and that he is not amendable to supervision,” they wrote. “The defendant utterly fails to establish by clear and convincing evidence, as required, that he does not pose a danger to the community.”

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — An appeals court in Bosnia-Herzegovina confirmed Friday an earlier court ruling that sentenced the pro-Russia Bosnian Serb president, Milorad Dodik, to one year in prison and banned him from politics for six years over his separatist actions as tensions mount in the fragile Balkan state.

 Dodik rejected the court ruling and added that he will continue to act as the Bosnian Serb president as long as he has the support of the Bosnian Serb parliament.

He said he is not surprised by the verdict, which he called “a clear political decision” orchestrated by Bosnian Muslims in collaboration with the European Union.

“I expect complete support from Serbia, we will turn to Russia for support, we will write a letter to the new U.S. administration,” Dodik said.

The EU said in a brief statement that the “verdict is binding and must be respected.”

“The EU calls on all parties to acknowledge the independence and impartiality of the court, and to respect and uphold its verdict,” the statement said.

Dodik's lawyers said they will appeal the court ruling to Bosnia's highest court.

Dodik has repeatedly called for the separation of the Serb-run half of Bosnia to join Serbia, which prompted the former U.S. administration to impose sanctions against him and his allies. Dodik was also accused of corruption and pro-Russia policies.

Dodik's separatist threats have stoked fears in Bosnia, where a 1992-95 war erupted when the country's Serbs rebelled against independence from the former Yugoslavia and moved to form a ministate with the aim of uniting it with Serbia. About 100,000 people were killed and millions were displaced.




The U.S.-sponsored Dayton Accords ended the war and created two regions in Bosnia, Republika Srpska and the Bosniak-Croat Federation, which were given wide autonomy but kept some joint institutions, including the army, top judiciary and tax administration. Bosnia also has a rotating three-member presidency made up of Bosniak, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats.

Dodik has repeatedly clashed with the top international envoy overseeing the peace, Christian Schmidt, and declared his decisions illegal in Republika Srpska. The Dayton peace agreement envisages that the high representative can impose decisions and change laws in the country.

LONDON (AP) — On a charming cobblestone street tucked away in London's East End, a pub proudly hangs out a sign that reads “Oldest riverside pub in London.” Across the Thames River, a pub with a different name makes the same bold claim.

The unofficial title of the oldest riverside pub in the city has long been disputed, with both the Mayflower and the Prospect of Whitby laying claim to the title.

The two contenders can be found along a quiet stretch of the Thames, far from the city's crowded souvenir shops and tourist sites, serving up traditional British dishes — from steak and ale pie to sticky toffee pudding — with a side of history.

The Mayflower is named after the Pilgrim Mayflower ship, which set sail from the site in 1620 to begin its journey to America. Though it only got its name in 1957, it is said to have some of the ship's original timbers incorporated into its structure.

Today, pubgoers who can prove direct descent from one of the Mayflower passengers can sign its “Descendants Book.”

Every night, tourists step out of black cabs at the doors of the two pubs, trading the capital's modern skyscrapers for the storied streets of London's East End, lined with quaint terraced houses and red brick warehouses.

In both pubs they enter spaces where old paintings hanging on dark paneled walls and other mementos of their histories seem to leave the contemporary world behind. 

“There really is a feeling that you might have stepped back in time and could be drinking beer with sailors or pirates or anybody from any Dickens novels really,” said Emily Godwin, a Londoner who has been to both. She spoke while sipping a pint of lager with friends at the Prospect on a recent summer evening.

The Prospect boasts a pewter bar – the longest of its kind in Britain — where the infamous “Hanging Judge Jeffreys” is said to have watched the many hangings that took place at the nearby “Execution Dock.” Early on, the pub was known as the Devil's Tavern due to its association with thieves and smugglers. A hanging noose outside serves as a reminder of the pub's grisly history.

It “feels like such a pocket of history in London,” Godwin said. “So much of London's East End feels very new and trendy, and the Prospect feels like it's barely changed.”

British pubs have always been at the center of social life, with locals coming together over a pint, even in times of war and economic hardship. But the last five years have been challenging for the industry as pubs contended with the COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs.

This year an estimated 378 venues are set to shutter across England, Wales, and Scotland, according to the British Beer and Pub Association.

“When a pub closes, it puts people out of a job, deprives communities of their heart and soul and hurts the local economy,” said Emma McClarkin, head of the BBPA.

Pubs across the country have been forced to find new ways to attract customers.

History is a big draw for pubgoers, with a trip to a traditional British pub coming in high on tourists' London bucket lists, raising the stakes of the Prospect and the Mayflower's competition.

The Prospect claims it was established in 1520, with its original flagstone surviving an arson attack in 1666 — the same year as the Great Fire of London. The pub was outside of the city limits at that time and was not affected by the conflagration that gutted the medieval city.

Justin Billington, assistant manager at the Prospect, said some people date the pub to its full reconstruction in 1774 after the 1666 fire. But he doesn't see it that way, noting that it operated continuously. The day after the fire, the workers rolled out a barrel of beer that had survived the flames and locals showed up with their tankards, drinking vessels, and enjoyed a drink on the spot.

There were several reconstructions in the pub's subsequent history, but none withstood the salt water and shifting foundations of the Thames, Billington explained. Not, that is, until 1774 when the retired captain of a merchant ship called “The Prospect” rebuilt it using the ship.

“This rebuild held and continues to hold on for dear life,” he said.

If the pub was actually established in 1774, that would make the Mayflower — established in the 16th century — older.

But there are no hard feelings between the pubs as Billington described their competition as a “loving rivalry.”

“We compete against each other to be the oldest, and to serve the best food and drink,” he said.

But the question remains: How can either pub definitively claim the title?

Unlike the title of the “Oldest pub in England,” held by the Porch House in southern England, which is said to date to the 10th century, there is no official certification for the oldest pub in London.

Guinness World Records said it has not formally awarded the title because of the complexities created by numerous name changes, relocations and reconstructions.

“There are lots of very old pubs that might make a claim to being oldest, but it could be contested because it could be argued they weren't always in ‘London,'” English historian and author Jacob Field said. “Many pubs have changed name over time, making it hard to claim they are the oldest.”

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday against the Trump administration's plans and extended Temporary Protected Status for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua.

Temporary Protected Status is a protection that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States, preventing from being deported and allowing them to work. The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It's part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem can extend Temporary Protected Status to immigrants in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe to return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions. Noem had ruled to end protections for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining that conditions in their homelands no longer warranted them.

The secretary said the two countries had made “significant progress” in recovering from 1998's Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history.

The designation for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal was scheduled to end Aug. 5 while protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans who have been in the U.S. for more than 25 years were set to expire Sept. 8.

U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco did not set an expiration date but rather ruled to keep the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is Nov. 18.




In a sharply written order, Thompson said the administration ended the migrant status protections without an “objective review of the country conditions” such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua.

If the protections were not extended, immigrants could suffer from loss of employment, health insurance, be separated from their families, and risk being deported to other countries where they have no ties, she wrote, adding that the termination of Temporary Protection Status for people from Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua would result in a $1.4 billion loss to the economy.

“The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood,” Thompson said.

Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argued that Noem's decisions were predetermined by President Donald Trump's campaign promises and motivated by racial animus. 

Thompson agreed, saying that statements Noem and Trump have made perpetuated the “discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.”

“Color is neither a poison nor a crime,” she wrote.

The advocacy group that filed the lawsuit said designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less.

“They gave them two months to leave the country. It's awful,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs at a hearing Tuesday.

Honduras Deputy Foreign Minister Antonio García told The Associated Press, “The judge recognized the need of the (TPS holders) to be able to work in peace, tranquility and legally.”

He recalled that during the first Trump administration, there was a similar legal challenge and the fight took five years in the courts. He hoped for a similar outcome this time that would allow the Hondurans to remain in the U.S.

“Today's news is hopeful and positive and gives us time and oxygen, hopefully it will be a long road, and the judge will have the final word and not President Trump,” he said.

Meanwhile in Nicaragua, hundreds of thousands have fled into exile as the government shuttered thousands of nongovernmental organizations and imprisoned political opponents. Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega and his wife and co-President Rosario Murillo have consolidated complete control in Nicaragua since Ortega returned to power two decades ago.

In February, a panel of U.N. experts warned the Nicaraguan government had dismantled the last remaining checks and balances and was “systematically executing a strategy to cement total control of the country through severe human rights violations.”

The broad effort by the Republican administration 's crackdown on immigration has been going after people who are in the country illegally but also by removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the U.S. on a temporary basis.

The Trump administration has already terminated protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits at federal courts.

The government argued that Noem has clear authority over the program and that her decisions reflect the administration's objectives in the areas of immigration and foreign policy.

“It is not meant to be permanent,” Justice Department attorney William Weiland said.

The Israeli Defense Force released video on Tuesday they claim shows Hamas terrorists operating inside a UNRWA base near Rafah.

The U.S. State Department issued a devastating report to Congress on the terrorism-plagued U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) that provides aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, determining that the agency needs to be abolished and is beyond reform.

According to a U.S. State Department public assessment to Congress that was independently obtained by Fox News Digital, ""The Administration has determined UNRWA is irredeemably compromised and now seeks its full dismantlement."" 

DOSSIER REVEALS INFORMATION USED TO EXPLAIN UN AGENCY'S DEEP TIES TO HAMAS IN GAZA

According to the State Department document, the Trump administration demanded in March 2025 that UNRWA ""return all remaining unspent balances of U.S. funding in its accounts."" The UNRWA Washington office said it would do so, ""but has not yet completed the action."" In May, the State Department said it is working ""to cease U.S. participation in all working-level UNRWA bodies"" at the United Nations. 

The Washington Free Beacon first reported news of the State Department report.

The U.S. government pulled the plug on UNRWA funding in January 2024 and has not resumed aid to the corruption-scarred agency. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's move calling for the wholesale dissolution of UNRWA adds a new layer of pressure on the U.N. and key donor nations to UNRWA (Japan and Germany) to reassess the viability of UNRWA.

The Biden administration had given UNRWA $1 billion in U.S. taxpayer funding since 2021 before the freeze in 2024 went into effect.

Former Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said in February 2024 that dozens of individuals employed by UNRWA were directly involved in the atrocities carried out against Israeli civilians on Oct. 7.

Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon told the U.N. in January that UNRWA must close its operations in Jerusalem.

In August 2024, Fox News Digital reported the U.N. fired nine employees from UNRWA who likely participated in the Hamas slaughter of 1,200 people, including more than 30 Americans, on Oct. 7 in southern Israel.

Israel's Knesset (Parliament) overwhelmingly banned UNRWA because of its reported support for Hamas terrorism. The U.S. has classified Hamas as a foreign terrorist organization. Israel, U.S. lawmakers, and watchdog organizations have also provided evidence to the U.N. over the years that UNRWA glorifies Palestinian terrorism and antisemitism.

Wisconsin researchers recently discovered a 145-year-old shipwreck in a murky river – and it was a complete surprise.

The Wisconsin Underwater Archaeology Association (WUAA), the organization that led the trip, confirmed the discovery to Fox News Digital. The ship was found near the city of Oshkosh.

Historians believe the sunken vessel is the L.W. Crane, built in 1865. It sank in 1880. 

MARINE EXPERTS FIND LIKELY REMAINS OF 18TH-CENTURY TREASURE SHIP THAT WAS LOST FOR CENTURIES

""We knew the Crane was in the area, [and] that finding her remains was a possibility,"" WUAA president Brendon Baillod told Fox News Digital. 

""But we had assumed that she was most likely buried in the bottom.""

He noted that diving the wreck is not feasible, as the Fox River has very low visibility due to suspended sediment. 

They used an archaeological-grade sidescan sonar manufactured in Sweden to find the ship's remnants.

""We were amazed that her entire hull was still visible on the bottom,"" Baillod said.

The discovery was also publicized by the Wisconsin Historical Society (WHS), which posted about it on Facebook in July. 

Speaking to Fox News Digital, WHS maritime archaeologist Jordan Ciesielczyk described the situation as ""a happy accident, and completely unexpected.""

MYSTERIOUS 18TH-CENTURY WARSHIP UNEARTHED AT GROUND ZERO SITE GETS NEW HOME

The WHS joined the trip to survey another shipwreck in the area, the Berlin City. That vessel was built in 1856 and sank in 1870. 

""[The Berlin City] is another river steamboat, like the L.W. Crane,"" Ciesielczyk said. 

""These small steamboats would carry freight and passengers up and down the Fox and Wolf Rivers.""

""We were amazed that her entire hull was still visible on the bottom,"" said WUAA president Brendon Baillod, seen at left.  (Wisconsin Historical Society)

At the time of the trip, the WHS was unaware of any other shipwrecks in the area, the expert added.

""We were going upriver between two of the previous survey areas and kept scanning the bottom as we went along when suddenly this wreckage came up on our screen,"" Ciesielczyk said. 

""It was very exciting!""

""It's a very strong possibility that this wreck is the L.W. Crane.""

Ciesielczyk pointed to ""context clues"" – including the ship's size, shape and location – as strong evidence the wreck is the L.W. Crane.

""In the summer of 1880, the barge L.W. Crane caught fire and was cut loose from its slip where it burned and sank into Fox River roughly in the area where this wreck was discovered,"" the archaeologist said. 

Poor visibility and fast-moving currents make diving in the Fox River extremely difficult, even for experienced teams. (Wisconsin Historical Society)

""100 yards away from this wreck are the remaining stone bridge caissons for the former railroad bridge on the river bottom.""

""The shipwreck we discovered was 90 feet long and 20 feet wide, which is roughly the same size as the L.W. Crane. It's a very strong possibility that this wreck is the L.W. Crane.""

Diving in the Fox River is ""very challenging"" with the rough currents and poor visibility.

Ciesielczyk noted that no artifacts have been discovered near the site, but that doesn't mean they don't exist – further research is planned.

Future exploration, however, won't be easy. Ciesielczyk said diving in the Fox River is ""very challenging"" with the rough currents and poor visibility.

Having gone diving ""in a different part of the Fox River on another shipwreck years ago, I couldn't see my hands in front of my face,"" he recalled.

The latest discovery is one of many long-lost shipwrecks that have been identified in the Midwest in recent months. 

In May, the WHS announced that a fisherman stumbled upon a historic shipwreck in Lake Michigan.

Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., discusses the court ruling that allowed President Donald Trump to maintain control over the California National Guard amid anti-I.C.E. riots on ‘Fox Report.'

Only 250 National Guard members will remain in Los Angeles after the Pentagon announced Thursday it would be canceling the deployment of additional troops as anti-ICE protests in the city have quieted down.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered 1,350 National Guard members to leave the city, while a couple hundred will stay to protect federal personnel and property, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Roughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines were sent to LA in June to gain control over riots against immigration raids in the city. The federal move was made despite objections from state and local leaders, including Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who filed a lawsuit in an attempt to end the federal deployment. 

Half of the National Guard troops were withdrawn about two weeks ago and the Marines were ordered to leave a few days later.

Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass wrote on X Wednesday night that the departure of more troops was ""another win for Los Angeles,"" adding: ""We will continue this pressure until ALL troops are out of L.A.""

""These troops have families and jobs,"" she wrote in a separate X post on Thursday. ""They could've been responding to actual danger or helping communities prepare for fire threats. Instead, they were forced to guard two office buildings for months.""

National Guard troops were mostly in the city protecting two federal buildings – the ICE office and detention facility downtown. Some have also been shielding federal agents while they carry out immigration raids.

California leaders argued that the federal deployment was unnecessary and escalated tensions in the city as protests continued against the Trump administration's deportations and immigration raids in the area. While protests are still taking place, the majority of them have remained small and scattered.

Newsom said in a statement that President Donald Trump's ""political theater backfired.""

""The women and men of our military deserve more than to be used as props in the federal government's propaganda machine,"" Newsom said.

After California sued to stop the federal deployment of the National Guard, Newsom argued in June that the Trump administration violated the law when it deployed the troops. Newsom also asked the judge to block the troops from helping carry out immigration raids.

A lower court initially ordered Trump to return control of the National Guard to Newsom, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later temporarily blocked the order.

A California federal judge on Thursday delayed the end dates of temporary protected status designations previously reserved for an estimated 61,000 people from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal until the Department of Homeland Security revoked those deportation protections.

The ruling represents a setback for the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda as it seeks to deport illegal immigrants and foreign nationals who have overstayed their time in the United States.

U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson of San Francisco temporarily blocked the federal government from terminating the TPS protections and work permits for thousands of migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The Biden-appointed judge scheduled a Nov. 18 hearing on the matter.

The TPS designations for an estimated 7,000 Nepalese were previously set to end Aug. 5, and those for 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans were set to lapse on Sept. 8. The migrants from Central America have resided in the United States for more than 25 years, ever since Hurricane Mitch hit the region in 1998.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem determined the deportation protections for those three groups of migrants, among others, were no longer necessary since conditions in their native countries have improved.

For instance, Noem said earlier this month that Honduras “has taken all of the necessary steps to overcome the impacts of Hurricane Mitch” and that “Honduran citizens can safely return home.”

Judge Thompson concluded the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their argument that Noem's decision to terminate TPS protections was motivated by “racial animus.”

“In totality, Plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence demonstrating racial and discriminatory animus in support of their Fifth Amendment claim. Color is neither a poison nor a crime,” Thompson wrote in the 37-page order.

‘TEMPORARY' IN NAME ONLY: HOW TPS ALLOWS FOREIGNERS TO STAY IN THE US FOR YEARS

“The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream,” she said at the start of the court document. “That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees.”

In recent weeks, the DHS has revoked TPS designations for an estimated 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, 160,000 Ukrainians, and thousands more from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Several lawsuits are pending in federal courts.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) led Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley by 6 percentage points in the first major poll of the 2026 North Carolina Senate race.

The Emerson College poll, obtained by Politico, showed Cooper with 47% compared to Whatley's 41%, with 12% unsure. Cooper has a massive lead among independents, with 47% supporting him and 28% supporting Whatley.

Part of the disconnect is a lack of name recognition for Whatley, a first-time candidate. Nearly two-thirds of voters polled did not know or were unsure of Whatley, compared to just 16% for Cooper. Cooper enjoyed a majority favorability rating, while Whatley enjoyed 17% favorability and a 16% unfavorability rating.

“With over a year to go until the North Carolina U.S. Senate race, Whatley's low name recognition presents both a challenge and an opportunity, while only 17% view him favorably, nearly two-thirds of voters either don't know him or are unsure,” Emerson College Polling executive director Spencer Kimball said in a statement. “That leaves room for his campaign to define him before his opponent does. In contrast, Cooper enters the race with significantly higher name recognition and a more favorable public image.”

Polls are likely to get closer as the high-stakes matchup nears — 41.5% of voters said they'd support the Democrat in congressional races, and 41.3% said they'd support the Republican candidate. With the North Carolina Senate race set to be one of the most expensive of the 2026 cycle, nearly every voter will likely have an opinion about Whatley one way or another come November of next year.

The two are competing to replace Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who announced he would not run for reelection amid clashes with President Donald Trump. Friday's poll largely vindicated his decision, giving him a paltry 30% approval rating, with 43% of voters viewing him unfavorably.

GOP UNITES BEHIND WHATLEY AHEAD OF HIGH-STAKES SHOWDOWN WITH COOPER IN NORTH CAROLINA

“Senator Tillis' retirement aligns with his weak favorability: just 41% of Republican voters view him favorably, while 35% view him unfavorably,” Kimball said. “He's also underwater with independents, with 43% unfavorable and only 27% favorable.”

Democrats view North Carolina as one of their most likely pickups in 2026. They need to flip four seats to obtain control of the Senate.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former Vice President Kamala Harris still hopes to be president.

That's the most obvious conclusion to draw from Harris announcing over the course of 24 hours that she is not running for governor of California but is releasing a new book about her failed 2024 presidential campaign.

Harris's book won't be about failure, of course, but it will seek to reframe her loss in a way that presents her as a viable choice for Democrats going forward. Titled 107 Days, one area of focus will be the campaign's brevity.

“Just over a year ago, I launched my campaign for president of the United States,” Harris said in a video announcement posted on social media on Thursday. “One hundred seven days traveling the country, fighting for our future — the shortest presidential campaign in modern history. Since leaving office, I've spent a lot of time reflecting on those days, and with candor and reflection, I've written a behind-the-scenes account of that journey. I believe there's value in sharing what I saw, what I learned, and what it will take to move forward.”

A spate of books has already been published about the 2024 campaign this year. In most of them, Harris is a secondary character behind President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden. This book, due out on Sept. 23, will presumably be different.

Harris's decision to forgo the California governor's race makes sense if she has her eyes on 2028. It is a difficult job in a state with serious problems that many see as a model of liberal misgovernment. While she first ran for president and was nominated for vice president as a freshman senator, she couldn't easily abandon the governorship for a third White House bid less than two years into it. An unsuccessful run for California governor after losing a presidential election two years earlier nearly ended Richard Nixon's political career.

“You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference,” he famously said after conceding the 1962 California gubernatorial election. 

That turned out not to be true. Nixon even went on to win the presidency in what was considered perhaps the greatest political comeback in U.S. history, pre-Trump. 

But even that took six years, not two. It was pulled off in a highly unusual set of circumstances: the assasination of John F. Kennedy followed by other high-profile assassinations, Lyndon Johnson's 1964 landslide followed by a steady erosion of his political capital over the next four years to the point that he pulled a Biden rather than seek reelection in 1968, the tumult of the Vietnam War, and the splitting of the Democratic Party.

Better to try to replicate what Trump did, run for president again as his party's previous nominee with no new losses on his resume, than Nixon.

Understandably, Harris would feel like the 2024 race just barely got away from her. She won 48.3% of the popular vote, which is better than George W. Bush in 2000 or Bill Clinton in 1992, when they won the presidency, to Trump's 49.8%. Yes, she lost all the battleground states. But the margins were mostly razor-thin, and Trump flipped six of these seven states from 2020 to 2024.

Harris also leads most national polls for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, though not by Trump-like margins, and thanks in part to having higher name recognition than the others.

But the Democrats haven't renominated their previous presidential election loser since Adlai Stevenson in 1956. As popular vote winners, Al Gore and Hillary Clinton had even stronger claims to seek a rematch. Neither ever ran for president again, and most Democrats didn't seem to mind.

Grover Cleveland, the only president besides Trump to serve nonconsecutive terms, was the last Democrat to win after losing and running again. That was in 1892.

Harris's biggest obstacles aren't historical precedents, however. Democrats remember the flaws of her campaign. She blew $1 billion and massive media goodwill, had no compelling answer to how she would be different from Biden, and was an overly cautious, indecisive communicator.

Like the title of Harris's book, her defenders point out that she ran a truncated campaign. However, the lack of a second act after her rollout, which at least succeeded in restoring Democratic morale, suggested she needed a shorter campaign. She similarly fizzled out in her first run for president in 2019. (She didn't make it until the votes were actually cast in 2020.) Maybe she could have done better with her own campaign team rather than one inherited mainly from Biden, but staffing was never really her strong suit.

Harris's long-standing flaws, briefly masked by joy, were exposed once again before the campaign's end.

BIDEN AUTOPEN USE IN DC WAS MORE WIDESPREAD THAN PREVIOUSLY KNOWN

Maybe primary voters will forget. It is harder to imagine that Democratic donors will. If Democrats do well in the midterm elections, a fresher face is likely to emerge. If Democrats have a disappointing midterm cycle, they may become too desperate for a retread.

Harris, nevertheless, keeps the flame alive. Former President Barack Obama talked about the audacity of hope. Harris will try to power through the voters' verdict of “nope.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

More than 50,000 discrepancies have been discovered in the state of New York's voter registration rolls, including deceased registrants, placeholder or fictitious birthdates, and duplicate entries, according to an election security watchdog's findings shared with the Washington Examiner.

Among the alarming revelations, the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a law firm focused on voting integrity, found 49,933 out-of-state double registrants, who are voters simultaneously registered in New York and at least one other U.S. state.

PILF cross-referenced voting registration files for New York registrants who also appear on other state voter rolls. Based on comparative analysis between voter datasets, the majority of interstate duplicates came from Florida (24,873). Other overlaps were with North Carolina (6,247) and New Jersey (5,724).

PILF additionally detected 2,823 inter-county duplicates inside New York's statewide database, including 1,018 pairs marked as “active” registrants across multiple counties.

At least 3,845 registrant records in New York were flagged for containing placeholder, potentially fake, or implausible dates of birth, such as “1850-01-01,” despite recent voting activity.

WHAT ARE THOUSANDS OF INELIGIBLE VOTERS DOING ON THE ROLLS?

For example, the registration rolls incorrectly listed a woman's birth year as “1901,” but the Brooklyn voter in question was actually born in 1941.

According to PILF's investigation, six registrants had died as far back as 1998, yet remained actively registered on the rolls, while four registrants could not be matched to any known Social Security number or credit data at those addresses. The only proof of existence was the New York voter roll, per PILF, raising questions about their identities and voting eligibility.

PILF also identified 6,788 instances of duplicated and even triplicated registrants, in which duplications at identical residential addresses were generated.

The PILF research team studied same-address duplicates along common causes of duplication, such as missing Social Security information, typographical errors (e.g., misspelling of names), hyphenated or married-name confusion, and nickname variations. Notably, missing or transposed Social Security numbers can stifle standard de-duplication procedures, PILF says.

PILF flagged the tens of thousands of questionable voter registrations in a memo sent Monday to the New York State Board of Elections.

“These are critical failures that put election security at risk,” PILF president J. Christian Adams said in a statement. “New York needs to start addressing these issues now.”

Accordingly, PILF is requesting a meeting with the state's election board to discuss reforms and the voter registration data.

When the Washington Examiner contacted the New York State Board of Elections for comment, a public information officer confirmed receipt of PILF's letter and said counsel is reviewing it at this time.

PILF previously conducted similar reviews in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maine, as part of nationwide efforts to clean up registration rolls ahead of high-stakes races. The results were similarly egregious, with PILF detecting 18,453 deceased registrants on Maine's voting rolls.

The legal group is calling for greater transparency and collaboration with local election officials to fix these problems before out-of-date or inaccurate data affects future elections.

“This is not just a New York issue,” PILF research director Logan Churchwell added. “Our work in multiple states proves that voter roll maintenance is falling behind across the country. But New York's numbers are some of the worst we've seen yet.”

PILF's letter looped in Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, and former PILF litigation counsel Maureen Riordan, now the DOJ's chief voting oversight officer.

At the direction of President Donald Trump via executive order, the DOJ has been contacting a number of states, including election battlegrounds, seeking access to their respective registration rolls. The stated purpose is ensuring state-by-state compliance with federal voting law. Reportedly, all states will eventually be contacted about their adherence to federal election regulations.

To date, the DOJ has contacted election officials in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.

In response to one request, Maine's Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat who infamously tried to boot Trump from the state's 2024 presidential primary ballot, told the DOJ to “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”

BATTLEGROUNDS NEVADA AND WISCONSIN AMONG STATES WITH VOTER ROLLS UNDER DOJ SCRUTINY

At a hearing last week on voter roll maintenance standards at the House Administration Committee, which has oversight over federal elections, PILF's president advocated for full disclosure of voting data. “Without transparency, you can't know what's going on, and that's why it's so important,” Adams told the congressional committee.

In opening statements, the top Democrat on the panel accused Republicans, who want to limit voting rights to eligible Americans, of engaging in regressive practices that bring the country back 200 years.

“For over 200 years, our republic has marched towards a fuller, freer system of governance, expanding access to the ballot for more and more Americans,” ranking member Rep. Joe Morelle (D-NY) said. “But as we've seen time and time again in the topic of today's hearing, clearly indicates House Republicans seem to want to retreat from that important promise.”

Morelle claimed that “illegal” GOP-led voter purges, particularly targeting non-citizen voting, are restricting voting rights without due process. “Voter purges represent a coordinated effort by my friends on the other side of the aisle to manipulate elections — to, in effect, make American elections less American,” the New York Democrat said.

THERE IS ONLY ONE REASON DEMOCRATS WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR NONCITIZENS TO VOTE

“There was a time in America when both Republicans and Democrats would have both been in favor of cleaning dead voters from the rolls,” PILF communications director Douglas Blair told the Washington Examiner. “This should be a bipartisan issue. It's deeply disappointing that Public Interest Legal Foundation has seen such pushback to something that used to be common sense.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A number of key documents related to the “manufactured” Russiagate scandal are still heavily redacted or not yet declassified years later, despite efforts by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, among others, to make information about the start of the Trump collusion investigation public.

As President Donald Trump's administration continues to release individual documents, here is some of the information that is still outstanding.

FBI Director Kash Patel reportedly found thousands of sensitive Russigate-related documents hidden away in what he described as a secret room at the bureau, and among them was an annex to a special counsel report that the Trump administration declassified this week.

BONGINO SAYS HE FOUND FBI ROOM WITH HIDDEN COMEY-ERA EVIDENCE

Patel turned over the trove of documents to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who ultimately released the annex on Thursday. The now-declassified annex to former special counsel John Durham's final report on the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation provided more detail about intelligence suggesting that Hillary Clinton's campaign planned to enlist the FBI in a plot to tie Trump to Russian election activities.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe is expected to declassify underlying intelligence, including the annex, used in Durham's investigation. 

RUSSIAGATE DEFINITIVE TIMELINE: HOW NEW INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENTS FIT IN

In the summer of 2016, then-CIA Director John Brennan briefed then-President Barack Obama on intel that Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was concocting a scheme to tie Trump, her election opponent, to Russia.

Ratcliffe, as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, declassified Brennan's handwritten notes, which documented that meeting. Former FBI Director James Comey and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper were also at the Brennan-Obama briefing.

JAMES COMEY AND JOHN BRENNAN UNDER INVESTIGATION BY DOJ FOR TRUMP-RUSSIA INQUIRY

According to the heavily redacted meeting minutes, on July 28, 2016, Brennan's briefing disclosed a plan from one of Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisers “to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.” Clinton approved the plan, Durham found. The annex, declassified on Thursday, described how an operative at a George Soros-led foundation also helped develop the plan.

On Sept. 7, 2016, the CIA forwarded an investigative lead, referring the intelligence about Clinton's plan to the FBI for appropriate action. The memorandum, containing many redactions, mentioned “an exchange” discussing Clinton's plan to tie Trump to Russia “as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server.”

The rapid release of records is exposing how top Obama administration officials advanced discredited Trump-Russia narratives during the 2016 presidential election while simultaneously neglecting to take procedural investigative steps against Hillary Clinton based on, in some instances, far more credible allegations.

On July 23, Grassley and Rep. Rick Crawford (R-AR), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to Patel requesting that the FBI fully investigate “untapped information” they said the bureau ignored in its investigation of Clinton's usage of a private email server for official communications as secretary of state.

Their request is a follow-up inquiry in response to the FBI's recent declassification of an appendix, known as the “Clinton annex,” to the Justice Department inspector general's June 2018 report reviewing the department's handling of the Clinton email investigation. The annex's release earlier this month was the result of Grassley's yearslong efforts to obtain the then-classified appendix.

FBI IGNORED KEY EVIDENCE IN CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION, DOJ WATCHDOG REVEALS

According to the newly declassified Office of Inspector General findings, this “unevaluated material” that the lawmakers are seeking, concerning hacked State Department data, has been stored within several thumb drives inside a northern Virginia offshoot office of the FBI's Washington Field Office since 2018.

The “vast majority of this data has never been reviewed by the FBI, including for counterintelligence purposes,” the watchdog report found, due to sensitivity concerns at the time pertaining to the disclosure of potentially privileged victim information.

In the letter addressed to Patel, Grassley and Crawford said the FBI, under the direction of Comey, “shockingly” overlooked evidence in the agency's possession, even though department officials acknowledged in memorandum drafts that analyzing the thumb drives was necessary to conduct a “thorough and complete investigation” and “assess the national security risks” associated with Clinton's server use.

“Literally, an entire collection of data, including ‘reports purporting to analyze or characterize intercepted U.S. communications' and information concerning ‘cyber intrusions into U.S. entities' were simply swept away into the dark confines of history – until now,” the lawmakers told Patel. “We refuse to allow this dereliction of duty to continue, and trust that your leadership will immediately seek to rectify this oversight by prior DOJ and FBI leadership.”

KASH PATEL PREVIEWS NEW RUSSIAGATE INFORMATION WILL PROVIDE ‘ACCOUNTABILITY'

Grassley and Crawford urged that the material at issue be “immediately dug out from hiding and properly assessed” in order “to correct this historic investigative and national security failure.”

“The revelations contained in the declassified OIG appendix are at the heart of why the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) became distrusted by so many under your agency's prior directors: a failure to impartially conduct its law enforcement and intelligence mission,” they wrote.

The massive Senate Intelligence Committee report, now regarded as Russiagate gospel among establishment Democrats, still contains walls of redactions spanning a considerable percentage of the 1,313-page publication.

Democrats are suddenly citing the congressional committee's report, which was about Russian election activities at large, not specifically the targeting of Trump, to affirm their Trump-Russia collusion claims.

SENATORS STAND BY 2016 RUSSIA ELECTION MEDDLING REPORT DESPITE GABBARD'S CLAIMS

The bipartisan panel found “extensive” Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race.

Much of the report remains redacted five years after the fifth and final installment was released.

For instance, in Volume 5: Counterintelligence Threats and Vulnerabilities, the Senate Intelligence Committee introduced a new allegation suggesting that Russian-Ukrainian operative Konstantin Kilimnik, an associate of Trump 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort, “may have been connected” to the Russian military intelligence's hack and leak of Democratic Party material. However, the report's discussions on the matter were redacted.

PAUL MANAFORT CONCEDES HE GAVE TRUMP CAMPAIGN POLLING DATA TO THE RUSSIANS

Manafort's involvement is “largely unknown,” according to the redacted report, but “two pieces of information…raise the possibility of Manafort's potential connection to the hack-and-leak operations.” Details of said information were also redacted.

In 2018, the FBI publicly released heavily redacted copies of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants targeting former Trump adviser Carter Page. The document, spanning 412 pages, included the initial October 2016 surveillance application along with three 90-day renewals, all approved for spying on Page.

To date, all four FISA warrant applications and accompanying approvals remain riddled with redactions. Blocks of information were still blacked out in 2020 iterations of the FISA filings provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of the panel's FISA abuse investigation. At the time, DOJ officials said the submissions contained “minimal redactions.”

FBI DIRECTOR ADMITS: YES, SURVEILLANCE OF CARTER PAGE WAS ILLEGAL

Also in 2020, a judge denied legal efforts to compel additional declassification of the Page documents. Plaintiffs in the Freedom of Information Act lawsuit unsuccessfully sought further FISA disclosures, including complete versions of 21 redacted pages.

Ultimately, the DOJ concluded that there was insufficient evidence to authorize the extended electronic surveillance of Page.

According to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order, the DOJ assessed that two of the FISA applications involved “insufficient predication to establish probable cause to believe that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power” and that court authorizations for the pair of warrants “were not valid.”

Aside from one guilty plea ending in probation for a former FBI lawyer, no one has been held accountable for the FBI's misconduct in the FISA process, particularly the unlawful surveillance of Page using misleading and error-filled applications. Who else was involved in the surveillance scheme is a pressing question long in need of an answer.

Key elements of the FBI Christopher Steele debriefing document, which was declassified during Trump's final full day of his first term, remain out of view behind redactions, such as the British ex-spy's descriptions of a “particular sub-source in greater detail.”

DOJ INSPECTOR GENERAL FINDS 17 ‘SIGNIFICANT ERRORS OR OMISSIONS' IN CARTER PAGE FISA APPLICATIONS

Previously released FBI interview notes detailing the bureau's discussion with Steele and his business partner back in 2017 are also still redacted at pertinent parts. In 2020, Grassley publicly shared a slightly less redacted version of the notes, but many of the withholdings persisted.

Buried below were significant, paragraph-length redactions related to Russian analyst Igor Danchenko, the “primary sub-source” for Steele's dossier, and how the anti-Trump dossier was assembled and accordingly disseminated.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A new book describes the challenges and joys of life as a letter carrier.

“Delivering the mail is a ‘Halloween job,' ” Stephen Starring Grant observes in Mailman: My Wild Ride Delivering the Mail in Appalachia and Finally Finding Home. “An occupation with a uniform, immediately recognizable, even by children.” What to call Grant's book is harder to say. It is an unusual amalgam: a pandemic memoir, a love letter to the Blue Ridge Mountains, a participant observer's ethnography of a rural post office, an indictment of government austerity, and a witness statement attesting to the remarkable and at times ruthless efficiency of one of our oldest federal bureaucracies. Not least, Mailman is a lament for the decline of service as an American ideal—for the cultural twilight of the Halloween job: those occupations, such as police officer, firefighter, Marine, and, yes, postal worker, whose worth is not measured first and foremost in dollars but in public esteem. Or should be, anyway.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

At the same time, Grant's project is immediately recognizable as “Hollywood material.” A corporate suit loses his job during COVID and spends a year as a rural blue-collar worker reconnecting with his inner country boy and coming to appreciate the dignity of physical labor—silently nursing, one suspects, the dream of a book contract (and maybe a studio option) all along. A stunt, in other words, that a cynic might see as more in the spirit of self-service than public service.

This tension isn't lost on Grant, a proud son of Appalachia who's suddenly laid off from a marketing agency and gets a job as a rural carrier associate for the Blacksburg, Virginia, post office. He second-guesses his qualifications—and his motivations—but doesn't let either concern stop him.

“What I'm feeling is a spiritual disorientation,” he confesses, having been jolted into downward mobility. “Lost in the sense that I don't know what I'm doing, lost in confronting the reality of being back in my hometown at fifty years of age, delivering the mail.” He berates himself for his failure to develop a versatile skill set or “build any job security,” despite compiling an impressive résumé (including starting a behavioral-economics lab at a Fortune 50 company). As he arrives at the decision to take the post-office job, he's facing real hardship: He has cancer, which he mentions almost in passing to explain the urgency of getting health insurance. But he's also a seeker, unapologetically so, and trying to prove something to himself—that, despite his white-collar CV, he is an authentic Appalachian who can still draw on a reserve of mountain grit.

From the June 2025 issue: Sarah Yager on how the USPS delivers mail to the bottom of the Grand Canyon

Grant doesn't hide the self-indulgence latent in what his wife calls “one of your quests.” Yet he also proves to be a compelling and empathetic guide, observing his country and its citizens, not just himself, with open and unjaded eyes. If his jaunty prose sometimes feels forced, his curiosity doesn't: He needs to focus on the details of his new manual labor, and milieu, or else fall hopelessly behind his co-workers (which he does anyway).

Immersing himself in unfamiliar work in a familiar place throws him off-balance in a way that feels bracing. Driving his late grandmother-in-law's 1999 Toyota RAV4 (rural carriers, he learns, often have to rely on their personal vehicles) through breathtaking Appalachian landscapes exhilarates, and occasionally terrifies, him. The car loses traction on an uphill dirt road that abruptly becomes “a rutted-out washboard.” Heedlessly reaching a hand into an abandoned mailbox turned hornets' nest induces “a full-body, screaming freakout, standing in the middle of a dirt road.” He savors surprising, sweet moments, too: an old widower who shows him the sprawling model-train setup in his garage that he began assembling “once Jennie passed”; a man in a trailer who reacts with boyish delight when the Lord of the Rings replica sword he ordered with his pandemic check arrives. “This is Anduril, Flame of the West!” the man explains. Grant chimes right in with “Reforged from the shards of Narsil by the elves of Rivendell.”

With his co-workers, his approach is “show up, don't sandbag anybody, be humble, play through to the buzzer.” But he's also keenly aware of being a soft former white-collar worker on a team of hardened veterans—and during a period, the pandemic, when the Postal Service is “on a wartime footing,” its intricate processes strained by new magnitudes of mail. Kat, a terse USPS lifer, helps him get through the worst days: “I think as long as she saw a carrier trying, she was supportive.” Serena, a woman who handles surging Amazon deliveries with Sisyphean dedication, instructs him in a new task, chucking parcels into metal cages organized by route: “Start scanning, start throwing, and get the fuck out of my way.” Glynnis, a 70-something whose back is killing her, “swore like a marine with busted knuckles”—loudly and creatively, sometimes with racist verve. She drives him crazy with her incessant complaining, not that the fan noise and the heat don't make him cranky too.

By contrast, Wade, an Alaskan, is the Michael Jordan of backwoods mail delivery, which features a degree of “freedom in terms of when and how you wanted to work” absent from bigger urban routes fully plugged into the Postal Service's centralized system. Wade's “process fluency” awes Grant—his preternatural ability to keep track of every variety of mail (“the hot case, the raw flats, the parcels, the raw mail,” plus the trays of machine-sorted first-class and standard mail, arriving every morning) and then fit it all, Tetris-like, into his vehicle's cargo area, arranged for delivery; his mastery of a labyrinthine route; his agility in eating sandwiches with one hand while delivering the mail with the other. Wade could do a route “rated at 9 hours” in five. Grant barely manages half of it in 11 hours, with help.

Philip F. Rubio: Save the Postal Service

Mailman includes its share of epiphanic wisdom. But unlike many works of nonfiction that focus on this region and its people, it avoids treating those who find themselves in its pages with the sort of condescension or reflexive romanticizing—or worse, a blend of both—that often seeps into writing about Appalachia. Grant doesn't pretend that the Blue Ridge is all wholesome water-bath canning, porch sitting, and verdant greenery. He doesn't deal in crude stereotypes of poor rural people, but neither does he avert his eyes from details that might be construed as backwoods caricature. He gets a glimpse into the trailer where the man who buys the expensive sword lives, watching as he has to “slide crabwise” along the wall, hands raised high, to get past a huge flatscreen TV that dominates the space. Imagining how many times a day he does that, Grant doesn't judge; he just notes “the kind of trade-offs people are willing to make for picture quality.” His portrayals throughout tend toward the gently sentimental, no noble savagery in view.

Grant's forthright evocation of community, a word so frequently used that its meaning has grown fuzzy, would be easy to attribute to his own roots in the rural-Blacksburg area, where the story unfolds. The truth, though, is more complicated. Sociologists have sometimes categorized Appalachia as an “internal colony”: an impoverished and economically exploited area within a country that is often viewed by elites as if it were an underdeveloped region outside that country. The firmly upper-middle-class Grant—raised in the mountains because he was born to a Virginia Tech professor, rather than into a long line of coal miners or lumberjacks—doesn't really try to hide that he sometimes feels more like a colonizer than an “authentic” Appalachian.

In one moment of obvious angst early on, after his wife accuses him of having an inordinate soft spot for Virginia's country people, Grant proclaims, “I'm from Appalachia. I'm Appalachian!” She tells him pointedly, “You are not!” Identitarian anxiety crops up more subtly too: Grant wistfully recalls his desire to join his high-school classmates on their annual November deer-hunting trips, his father's refusal to take him, and his envy of the homemade venison jerky the other boys would bring to school. When he says, “I wanted a giant Ziploc bag of venison jerky,” he seems to be saying, “I wanted to be a real Appalachian.”

mailman is most distinctive when it ventures into territory that feels timely in a way that goes beyond COVID-era tributes to “essential workers.” Grant finds himself preoccupied with the nature of public service, its scale and scope, and with coordination among systems and humans, of which the Postal Service turns out to be quite an astonishing example. He focuses in on the scene, not just the enormous “superscanner, like a seven-foot-tall mechanical praying mantis,” that logs incoming parcels, but also the low-tech mail-sorting methods. He also gets to appreciate up close the skillful interplay between brain and body involved in becoming “unconsciously competent at complex tasks”; where once he knew only the academic phrase process fluency, now he can see the intricacy involved, and the dignity imparted by mastery.

When Grant declares, “My robot brain was in charge” at one point, reflecting on the execution of letter gathering while driving, he's speaking with pleasure and pride about achieving a flow state in the fulfillment of a worthwhile task; he's not complaining about drudgery or soul-sucking labor. Ever the marketer, Grant celebrates the Postal Service's uniqueness (indulging in a bit of statistical overreach). “FedEx? UPS? They simply cannot do what the USPS does. All they carry are parcels,” he scoffs. “We carry everything for everybody, with 99.993 percent accuracy.”

Read: What happens to mail during a natural disaster?

Mailman is also a shameful revelation of the inexcusable working conditions that letter carriers are subjected to: The injury rate for postal workers is higher than for coal miners. You can almost feel Grant's blood pressure rising as he describes the decades-out-of-date, unsafe, and AC-less delivery trucks—“death traps,” he calls them. (The advent of new electric vehicles, thanks to a 2022 infusion of federal funds, doesn't make it into his book, perhaps because their expected delivery last year has been running behind schedule.) Grant's indictment—and his celebration—predates DOGE, whose arrival only makes both more relevant: a counter to the slander of public servants routinely dispensed by Elon Musk, a man who accrues more money in an hour than the average USPS employee will make in a lifetime.

When Grant says he finally learned that “what was essential was just doing your job,” he doesn't mean that the USPS work is easy but that it is hard, and that being a mail carrier, showing up day in and day out, matters. “That's the difference between a regular and a sub,” he observes, remarking on the distinction between being a fill-in and someone's daily letter carrier. “The sub just delivers the mail. The regular is delivering something else. Continuity. Safety. Normalcy. Companionship. Civilization. You know, the stuff the government is supposed to do for its people.” In Grant's telling, postal workers bring order and predictability to a country that can feel like it's unraveling, especially during crises that starkly illustrate how reliant we are on the federal bureaucracy.

If Hollywood were to option this story, the hero would get offered the job of his dreams and turn it down, realizing in his heart that he is meant to be a mailman after all. But Grant has indicated from the start that his USPS stint is a placeholder. He applies for and ends up accepting a cushy position at a media agency, turns in his Halloween-job uniform, and takes a dig at himself for becoming “just another white-collar ghost with a job that nobody understands.”

You may roll your eyes when this interloper describes the solace that his brief sojourn in blue-collar life has brought: that after decades of “feeling like I wasn't doing any good in the world, being part of something—even something as mundane as the Postal Service—made me feel whole.” Glynnis certainly takes a different view as she counts down to retirement. When Grant, hoping to quiet her carping, says, “I'm in the same jam as you are,” she calls him on it: “No you ain't, because I'm here to get my motherfucking pension, and you're too goddamned stupid to stay at home and collect unemployment.” Grant acknowledges that “she had a point.”

His final revelation is that Americans misunderstand the difference between white- and blue-collar work. “Both forms of labor want all of your time and both exact a toll. One form is no more or less noble than the other,” he writes. “The real distinction is between work and service, and I think it's one of the great dividing lines in American life.” The question this leaves for readers isn't why Grant decided to stop being a mailman. The question is how we ended up with a country where choosing a life of service all too often feels financially untenable and socially undervalued.

It's long been obvious why cigarettes are bad. The risks of alternatives like Zyn and Juul are much hazier.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

For the better part of the past century, the case against nicotine was simple: Smoking a cigarette might feel nice, but it will eventually kill you. Nearly one in five deaths in the United States is caused by complications from cigarette smoke. Chewing tobacco is less dangerous, but still deadly: It has long been associated with head and neck cancers.



But in 2025, nicotine isn't so straightforward. Smoking is so deadly not because of nicotine, per se, but because of tobacco: Lighting a cigarette burns tobacco, releasing nicotine into the body. Chewing tobacco entails gnawing on actual tobacco leaves. Nowadays, it's easier than ever to get a nicotine buzz without any tobacco at all: Just puff on a vape or pop a tiny nicotine pouch between your teeth and upper lip. These cigarette alternatives have been around for a while, but only recently have they gone fully mainstream. In January, the FDA officially sanctioned the sale of Zyn, among the most recognizable nicotine-pouch brands. In the past three months alone, Philip Morris International, which makes Zyn, shipped 190 million cans of the stuff to stores. And last month, the agency reversed a prior ruling and authorized Juul e-cigarettes. These products, the FDA has concluded, “generally have lower health risks than cigarettes.”



In this nicotine boom, it's easy to see the drug as harmless, even good for you. Ads that tout the benefits of nicotine are everywhere: Zyn, for example, has been marketed as an “office essential” that also offers “relaxation on-the-go.” Nicotine somehow feels both energizing and relaxing at the same time, kind of like the buzz of a vodka Red Bull. The drug has been linked to statistically significant improvements in a number of cognitive exercises. The marketing goes further: Joe Rogan has hawked Athletic Nicotine, a nicotine-pouch brand that claims the drug can serve as an “exercise performance-enhancing tool.” Tucker Carlson—who has his own brand of nicotine pouches—recently claimed that because of nicotine, he is “never sick.”

But nicotine is not a wonder drug. The cognitive improvements found in studies were modest. Bethea AnnaLouise Kleykamp, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Maryland who has studied nicotine, summed it up this way: The drug “might be, if you were to subtract it from the smoke, something that could help some people,” such as those who are sleep-deprived or have a cognitive disorder like ADHD. Not exactly a ringing endorsement. Moreover, there's still a lot we don't know about what nicotine alone does to the body.



All of this has nicotine in a strange place. Before the advent of newer products, the field of public health was united in its stance that no one should be using cigarettes, and thus nicotine. Now the message is more muddled than ever.



Some public-health experts still suggest staying away from nicotine in and of itself. After the decades-long war against smoking, they see new products as Big Tobacco's latest gambit to hook the public. Others make a different calculation: If the health effects of nicotine alone are less concerning than those of cigarettes, what's so bad about an adult sucking on a Zyn? Presuming people recognize that these products “may have some health risks,” Neal Benowitz, an emeritus professor of medicine at UC San Francisco, told me, “I have no problem with that.”



Such differing views stem from the unclear health effects of cigarette alternatives. Consuming nicotine via vape or pouch is surely safer than smoking a cigarette, but that isn't saying much. No researchers I spoke with gave nicotine an unequivocal endorsement. “I would never go so far as to say that any drug is completely safe,” Jed Rose, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Duke University who runs a research firm that has done paid research for nicotine companies, told me. “Whether nicotine contributes in any way to other diseases associated with smoking is not as firmly resolved as people like to think.”



Rose cited a study that showed nicotine accelerated tumor growth in mice. Other experts I spoke with cited data from Sweden demonstrating that smokeless products carry some cardiovascular risks. And emerging research indicates that the components inside of vapes can leach heavy metals into the mist that users inhale, potentially exposing them to increased cancer risk. For the most part, science simply hasn't answered the question of how bad nicotine alone is for you. Most of the studies on the bodily effects of nicotine have been completed using subjects who smoke.



For now, the clearest problem with puffing on a Juul is that nicotine remains extremely addictive, whatever form it comes in. Addiction researchers have said that nicotine is just as difficult to quit as heroin. Smokeless products might be a little easier to quit than cigarettes, based on how they deliver nicotine. But it's reasonable to assume that these new products will also worsen the problem of nicotine addiction by making the drug easier to consume. Desk workers can pop nicotine pouches without having to step away for a smoke break. Vape clouds are more readily concealed than the stench of cigarette smoke. This is part of the appeal: Rogue, a Zyn competitor, advertises its product as a way to “enjoy the nicotine you love without getting noticed, whether you're in a marathon of meetings, perfecting your meal-prep, or just can't step away for a smoke break.” (Rogue, like other nicotine brands, has to legally include warnings in its ads that its products are addictive.)



The effects of an addiction alone are not typically a first-order concern in the world of public health. Addictions typically come with other, more pressing consequences: For cigarettes, it's heart attacks and cancer; for heroin, it's overdoses. Anyone who has seen photos of smokers hooked to oxygen or revealing their lung-cancer scars can attest that public health has become expert in warning potential victims of these types of health problems. The risks of a nicotine addiction without the smoke are murkier. “There are interpersonal, intrapersonal, and economic consequences to being addicted,” Eric Donny, a neuroscience professor at Wake Forest University who studies nicotine, told me. “It's really hard to quantify this in a way that we are used to.”



Nicotine boosters have compared the drug to caffeine—which is also addictive, but generally not a problem. (Hence the Death Before Decaf shirts, tote bags, and even tattoos.) But research suggests that nicotine addiction is more intense than a caffeine dependency, potentially taking a bigger toll on people's lives. The financial costs alone can be onerous: Nicotine prices vary a lot from state to state, but in Washington, D.C., where I live, someone with an extreme Zyn habit may be shelling out upwards of $10 a day to feed their addiction. A Juul isn't much cheaper. With either product, a heavy user is likely to spend several thousands of dollars a year.



Addiction can also take a psychological toll. Being hooked on nicotine means your brain is always screaming for another hit of the drug. At times, the longing can feel insatiable, and can force people to act in ways that are entirely against their own self-interest. A teen addicted to vaping might take a few puffs in the school bathroom, even if getting caught might mean a suspension. Or a longtime user may continue to pop nicotine pouches after a heart attack, despite research showing that quitting nicotine significantly reduces someone's risk of death.



These downsides might seem minuscule compared with those of cigarettes. A rotting lung is considerably worse than a $10-a-day nicotine habit. But they shouldn't be ignored. If cigarette-smoking rates continue their decades-long drop, it's reasonable to assume that vaping and pouches will become the dominant ways people consume nicotine. New nicotine products might have solved the biggest problem with smoking. Many other, more subtle problems still remain.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

America's retreat and its threat to democracy

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

How should American power be deployed in the world? Since the Cold War, America's role as a global leader has been up for debate.

Host Garry Kasparov and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton dissect the state of the neoconservative geopolitical worldview. They consider what the latest iteration of the “America First” foreign-policy rationale signals for democracy worldwide and analyze what it means that the new American right sometimes sounds like the old American left.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Garry Kasparov: I would like to begin this episode with two quotes from American presidents. You might try to guess which presidents they are from.

[Music]

Kasparov: The first: “Good leaders do not threaten to quit if things go wrong. They expect cooperation, of course, and they expect everyone to do his share, but they do not stop to measure sacrifices with a teaspoon while the fight is on. We cannot lead the forces of freedom from behind.”

And the second presidential quote, “We must begin by acknowledging the hard truth: We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes. There will be times when nations—acting individually or in concert—will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified.”

The first, with the memorable line about not measuring sacrifice with a teaspoon while the fight is on, was spoken by my namesake, President Harry S Truman, in a 1951 address in Philadelphia at the dedication of the Chapel of the Four Chaplains. He had brought American troops into combat in Korea: a controversial decision to stand up to Communist aggression, only six years after the end of World War II.

The second presidential quote, about nations being morally justified to use force, is more surprising. It was spoken on stage in Oslo, Norway, in 2009, during Barack Obama's Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech.

Donald Trump's “America First” isolationist cry echoes the America Firsters of the 1930s who wanted to stay out of what they called “Europe's war,” even as late as 1941. Refusing to defend Ukraine against Russia's invasion has many parallels to the U.S. staying out of World War II until Pearl Harbor. Harry Truman learned the lesson. As he said in Philadelphia, you fight small conflicts to avoid big wars. Evidence of the good that can come from military intervention starts with South Korea, a thriving democratic ally, and North Korea, a prison-camp nation.

From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I'm Garry Kasparov.

[Music]

Kasparov: Terms like intervention and regime change are practically dirty words in U.S. politics, since the disastrous occupation of Iraq. But when aggressive dictatorships—like the Soviet Union in the past, or Vladimir Putin's Russia today—go on the march, words alone do not stop them.

My guest today, Ambassador John Bolton, would agree with both of those presidential quotes, although, like me, he did not find much else to agree on with Obama during his eight years in office! Bolton has strong opinions on American foreign policy and the use of force. At a time when the new American right sounds like the old American left, his thoughts are critical.

[Music]

Kasparov: John Bolton, you have had many distinctions and titles in your career, including ambassador to the United Nations, national security adviser, and many others. I will add one more. You are the only guest to join us in both seasons of this show. Thank you for doing it.

John Bolton: Glad to be with you.

Kasparov: And by the way, I see the chessboard in your office. Do you play chess?

Bolton: I do. You know, that was given to me by Nikolai Patrushev, my opposite number—

Kasparov: Ooof! (Laughs.)

Bolton: —when he was the Russian national security adviser. And it is interestingly made out of Karelian wood from the Finnish territory. So, and it was checked out by the Secret Service before I accepted it.

Kasparov: Do you think that the chess rules apply to this, you know, current geopolitics? Or it's more like a game of poker?

Bolton: Well, I think I wouldn't argue with you about the rules of chess. I don't think people like Vladimir Putin care about the rules. When people talk about the rules-based international order, the prime malefactors didn't get the memo. They don't believe in it, and they don't act like it's there. And for us to believe that it's there, I think, handicaps our ability to defend ourselves.

Kasparov: I want to talk with you about how American power should be deployed in the world, in service of democracies and against autocracies. But I want to start with what seems to be the ever-changing meaning of “America First” as a foreign-policy rationale. How do you interpret that term based on what you're seeing in the second Trump administration?

Bolton: Well, I think Trump himself has basically given us the answer on “America First,” “Make America great again”—whatever his slogans are. They are exactly what he says they are at any given moment. They don't reflect an overarching philosophy. They don't reflect, in this case, a clear national-security grand strategy. Trump doesn't even really do policy as we understand it. I don't think to this day that he really appreciates that the words America first were initially used in the run-up to World War II to be the slogan of the isolationists, those who did not want to be drawn into the European war.

He doesn't see, he never saw the background of that, or the concerns about anti-Semitism that lurked in that “America First” movement. And I think from Trump's point of view—because to him everything is transactional—it means he just makes the best deals in the world, and he doesn't necessarily distinguish among the terms of the deals he's making. It's the fact of making a deal that shows who's in charge.

Kasparov: You said, and we all suspected, that Trump was not aware about the true meaning of “America First,” because he's not a—no matter what he says—a good scholar of history. But assuming he knew that “America First” meant isolationism back then in 1939, 1940, and a clear distinction of anti-Semitism, would he care?

Bolton: I don't think he would care. And I think he views truth in a very relative way. People say Trump lies a lot. I actually don't think that's an accurate description. I don't think he cares much about what's true and what's not true. He says what he thinks he would like the world to be, and as it benefits him at any given time. And if pressed on that point about anti-Semitism in particular, I think he would just brush it away.

Kasparov: So you've written that Trump's decisions are like an archipelago of dots that don't really line up, and that advisers in the first term, you included, would try to string good decisions together. Now, what about the second administration? What is happening now?

Bolton: Well, you know, even just about six months in, I think you can see the difference in personnel selections pretty clearly. Certainly in the national-security space. In the first term, he had people who largely shared a Republican philosophy, a Reaganite approach to foreign policy. Obviously there were many disagreements on tactics, on priorities, on a whole variety of things, which is perfectly natural in any administration. And Trump, not knowing much about international affairs, could often buy one argument one day and another argument the next day. But eventually he got frustrated, I think, that his visceral instincts weren't necessarily automatically adopted by his advisers, who were trying to give him the best advice, trying to get to the optimal outcome. So to avoid the problems that he saw in the first term, in the second term, I think, he has consciously looked for people who act as yes-men and yes-women.

They don't say, Well, have you considered these alternative options? Have you looked at these facts? He wants people who will listen to what he says and then go out and implement it. Now, in the first term, people said his advisers tried to constrain him, tried to really to make the decisions in his place. And I just think that's wrong. I think I can speak for many others: We were trying to make sure that he made the best decision possible, and giving our advice was part of our function. My title was national security adviser. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do, other than give advice, in that job. But in the second term, he wants not loyalty—I think loyalty is a good word; I think it conveys a valuable commodity—he wants fealty. He wants people who are gonna say Yes, sir, and do it really without thinking, in many cases without trying to improve or suggest modifications. I think that's—ironically, it's gonna be harmful to Trump. It's certainly gonna be harmful to America, but that approach ultimately will hurt Trump too.

Kasparov: How so?

Bolton: Well, if a president is making decisions in a very narrow focus without understanding the broader implications, the additional risks, the additional opportunities, he's gonna miss a lot of what the rest of the world will see. And then contingencies will arise that he simply won't be prepared for. So that even what was a reasonably good decision can go bad, because you don't take into account the second- and third-order consequences. And I hesitate to say this with Garry here, but in chess you have to think a couple moves ahead. Maybe some people think lots of moves ahead. Trump plays it one move at a time, and that is dangerous.

Kasparov: Yeah, it's not a very rosy picture. So it seems that his Cabinet now, and all people who are supposed to give him advice, they are not going to contradict him.

Bolton: You know I have to say, contrary to the first term, there haven't been so many leaks out of this White House in the early months. So I don't have confidence we really know how the decision making is going. But to the extent we do, my impression is that while there's a lot of discussion about the optics of how you present a particular decision—the kind of background politics, how it makes Trump look—in terms of strategic thinking by people who understand international affairs, there's not an awful lot of that.

And indeed, even in some cases it might seem unusual, people who disagree get excluded. It appears Tulsi Gabbard—who opposed, from all we can tell, the strikes against Iran's nuclear-weapons program—was just cut out of the picture. And I have to say in the short term, I'm delighted by that. It probably contributed to the right decision. But what that means more basically is that Trump made a fundamental mistake appointing her, because you want people who will give their best advice, and it helps the president—should help the president—make a better-informed decision.

Kasparov: You mentioned Tulsi Gabbard. What about other advisers? Who do you find the most worrisome?

Bolton: Well, I think Secretary of Defense [Pete] Hegseth really is in over his head in this job. I think his comments in public about comments and criticisms that people made about the outcome of the bombing of the Iranian nuclear sites demonstrated that. It's fine to defend the president. That's what Cabinet members should do. If you get tired of defending the president, you should resign. But that's not your only job. Your job is also to explain and justify the conduct that you've ordered on behalf of the president. Not in a partisan way, but in a way that helps the American people understand. Leadership here is in large part education, and that's not what they're doing. They're doing a kind of attack partisan politics. Again, it makes Trump feel good in the short term, but in the longer term, he will not be well served by that kind of approach either.

Kasparov: Now a strategic question: our allies in Europe. J. D. Vance went to Munich, the Munich Security Conference, back in February and chastised European democracies for many things—among them being afraid of the far right and suppressing democracies at home. What's your take?

Bolton: Well, there are a lot of interesting things in that speech. No. 1, you know, Vance is really on the quasi-isolationist side of the political spectrum. And he, and people like him, have been very critical over the years of the neoconservatives for their constant emphasis on human rights and similar concerns. And yet at Munich, what he gave was a neoconservative speech. Although he was criticizing the Europeans for their democratic failures, I would've felt better if he had included Russia and China as part of his critical analysis. But he was doing exactly what he criticized the neoconservatives for doing. This is, I think, a measure of how really partisan these kinds of approaches are from a domestic American point of view. He's scoring—Vance there is scoring points against the neoconservatives, against liberal internationalists, against a variety of people that I'm not part of. So I didn't take it personally. But it was carrying on a domestic-U.S. political debate in an international forum.

I think that Trump himself doesn't understand alliances. I'm not sure Vance understands them any better. In Trump's case, he looks at NATO, for example, and he sees it as the United States defending Europe: We don't get anything out of it, and they won't pay. Well, if I thought NATO worked that way, I probably wouldn't be very enthusiastic about it either. But the whole point of a collective-defense alliance is that the security of all the members is enhanced when they live up to their obligations. And I think NATO remains the most effective politico-military alliance in human history.

There are members who are not pulling their fair share. That's right. I think Trump was right to criticize that. What's not right is to break the alliance up over it. And I think we are—notwithstanding the recent NATO summit where everybody smiled and seemed to be happy—I don't think we're past the danger point of Trump potentially withdrawing the U.S. from NATO in less happy times.

Kasparov: Oh, that's interesting. So can he withdraw from NATO unilaterally without a vote in the Senate, Congressional approval, whatever—or is it just totally in the hands of the president?

Bolton: It's my very firm view that the Constitution does entrust that authority solely to the president. In the case of NATO, ironically, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and some others passed legislation a few years ago that said the president could not withdraw from NATO without the consent of the Senate. I think that provision is unconstitutional. I don't think you can limit the president's authority. So if Trump decided to pull out, and he issued an executive order doing that, that might be challengeable in litigation, but it would take years to resolve. And in effect, Trump would have withdrawn by the time the case was decided by the Supreme Court.

Kasparov: Do you think it's realistic, that he will go that far?

Bolton: You know, I think he, as I say, he doesn't understand the alliance viscerally. He doesn't like it. He has said, and his advisers have said, things like, Well, we'll only defend NATO members that are meeting what used to be the 2 percent threshold: 2 percent of GDP spent on defense, now 3 and a half percent, 5 with infrastructure. Well, that's a statement that the NATO alliance is like a piece of Swiss cheese. You can't defend this country and then not defend the country next to it because it's not at 2 percent; it's just not viable militarily. But that kind of thinking has not left Trump's mind, and has not left the minds of his advisers. So I remain very worried, notwithstanding this recent NATO summit where things seem to go well. This is deep within Trump that he distrusts the alliance, thinks it's part of America getting a raw deal.

Kasparov: But I think that all countries that might be in danger, countries that border Russia or are just in the vicinity of potential Russian aggression, they already are almost at 5 percent. They spend a bigger percentage of GDP than the United States on their defense. Does it mean that America will defend them?

Bolton: Well, we certainly should, but I think this is an important question about Trump the man faced with a crisis situation like that. Let's say Russia invades the Baltics: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Not impossible; certainly something the Baltics fear very much. Now, we did not have any crisis nearly that dangerous in the first term. COVID was a crisis, but it was a health crisis played out over a long period of time. So what would Trump do if the Baltics were attacked by Russia? I don't know the answer to that question. And it's legitimate for the Eastern European countries in NATO in particular to be worried about, because Trump does not like decisions where he can't reverse himself the next day. And obviously a decision to comply with Article V and defend countries invaded by Russia would be a decision that would be irrevocable for a long time until the military struggle played itself out.

Kasparov: So what do you expect to happen in Ukraine? Again, Ukraine is fighting this war, and many of us believe it's shielding the free world against Russian aggression. And Ukrainians and many Europeans, especially neighboring countries, they are disappointed, I would probably say shocked, by the Trump administration's policy in the region. Can Ukraine survive on its own, or basically can Europe provide enough for Ukraine? And how long will America take this neutral stand?

Bolton: Well, I'm afraid the answer is the rest of Trump's presidency. I think it's gonna remain undecided. My guess is in the near term—which may be the remaining three and a half years of the administration—Trump is not gonna go back and make a major effort to seek a diplomatic solution. I think he was burned by the failure of Russia to show any conciliatory impulses at all when he tried in the last few months.

And I think he sees it as a failure to live up to his campaign boast that he could solve the problem in 24 hours, which of course was never realistic. So the real issue is: Will he allow the continuation of U.S. military assistance at approximately the same levels—weapons, ammunition, and, to my mind, most important of all, military intelligence that's so critical to the Ukrainians on the battlefield?

And to the question you've raised, can the Europeans make up the difference? I don't think they can on the intelligence. I just don't think they have the capability. It could be they can make it up in hardware. I would hope they could, but it just won't be the same if Trump really does cut off the aid.

Kasparov: Now, about another crisis or another war, it's the Middle East. How do you rate Trump's actions there—attacking Iran, then offering the olive branch? And again, some say he did it in a desperate search for the Nobel Peace Prize, Trump's policy vis-à-vis Israel-Palestinians.

Bolton: Right. Well, I think he's not gonna get the Nobel Peace Prize for bringing peace to Ukraine, that's for sure. So he's looking for another opportunity. I find myself to a certain extent satisfied, but to a certain extent frustrated. I think it was the right thing to do to order American military attacks on some of the key Iranian nuclear-weapons facilities. There's been a huge and kind of intellectually arid debate about exactly how much damage was done by those attacks, which we don't know because we were not close enough to get a full assessment. But I think Trump cut off U.S. military action too soon. I don't think that there will ever be peace and stability in the Middle East while the regime of the ayatollahs remains in power. I'm not saying that requires extensive U.S. involvement. It certainly doesn't require boots on the ground. It could involve assistance to the Iranian people.

[Music]

Bolton: I think the question is: Will they have the courage to try to take advantage of the splits and tensions within the regime that I think are pretty obvious across the world now, and see if this is not the moment to rid themselves of the ayatollahs.

Kasparov: We'll be right back.

[Break]

Kasparov: Let's move from the world of practicalities into the world of idealism. What could be an ideal world if we could have our wishes granted? So, how should American power be deployed in service of democracy? So what are the tools to use, and where to use them? Exporting democracy, military interventions, regime change?

Bolton: Well, I think where American interests are at stake, there are a number of things we could do. I think regime change doesn't obviously have to involve American boots on the ground. There are all kinds of ways that regime change can take place. We tried that in the case of Venezuela in 2018 and 2019, that would've allowed the Venezuelan people to take control away from the [Nicolás] Maduro, really the Chavez-Maduro dictatorship.

But we would've, at the same time, pushed the Russians, the Cubans, the Chinese, the Iranians out of positions in Venezuela, very advantageous to them. It didn't work, but it was worth the effort. If we had succeeded, I would've said basically to the people of Venezuela, Congratulations. It now belongs to you. You figure out what you're gonna do with it. I have never been a nation builder, in the sense that some people have been, but I don't shy away from regime change. In the case of Iraq, which is the case that people point to again and again, I give full credit to the people who tried to make the coalition provisional authority in Iraq work. I think they did it out of the best of motivations. But it's not what I would've done. In my perfect world, I would've given the Iraqi leaders—some in exile, some who had been in the country—a copy of the Federalist Papers and said, Good luck. Call us if you have any questions. We'll hold the ring around you. We'll protect you from Iranian and other external influences, but you need to do this yourself. 

And I think that's really how you nation build. You don't enhance people's political maturity by making decisions for them. Even if you can make better decisions than they can, you enhance political maturity by saying, You're gonna make the decisions, and you're gonna learn by your mistakes. It's not guaranteed for success, but I think that's a more solid way of nation building than for Americans to try and do it for them.

Kasparov: But let me press on this issue. Because you mentioned Venezuela. I can add Belarus. In these countries, we clearly saw the opposition winning elections. Not hearsay. Winning elections, having physical proof of receiving, in both cases, 70 percent of votes. And both dictators—[Alexander] Lukashenko and Maduro—they stayed in power. They didn't care. They used force. Lukashenko, we understand he's too close to Russia. Putin was there. The opposition stood no chance. But Venezuela is just next door. Recently we had these elections, and Maduro basically ignored it. He made the deal with the [Joe] Biden administration, so some kind of relief of sanctions, but promising free and fair elections. So he reneged on his promise. Should America intervene?

Bolton: Well, look—back in 2018 and 2019, I think we were at the point where we should have been doing more. But you know, we didn't have many capabilities in the Western hemisphere, thanks to the Obama administration, that where we could have had opportunities through our intelligence community and others to help Juan Guaidó, the legitimate president of Venezuela. The days are long gone by when we really could have done very much, and I feel we didn't enforce the sanctions as strictly as we could have. We made a lot of mistakes there. The Biden administration didn't even try that. They thought they could make a deal with Maduro. It was a total mistake. I don't see how anybody could believe he would honor any commitment he made.

I want to come back to Belarus, though, because I do think that that was a situation where it was very much in our interest to see if there was any way at all to persuade Lukashenko to pull away from Russia. So I went to Minsk in August of 2019, about two weeks before I resigned—I was the first senior American to visit Belarus in a long, long time—just to see the guy, and see if there were some hooks we could put in to bring him away, for his own safety's sake, but ultimately leading to popular government. I, as I say, I resigned two weeks later, so I didn't carry through on it. But it was a case to me that suggested we could have some influence there, and maybe, as in the case of Poland with solidarity, maybe there were ways to make that work. But we never tried, because Trump didn't really care about Belarus. Trump asked in his first term, Is Finland still part of Russia? So to him, Belarus, Ukraine: They all look Russian to him. And it's hard to get him to focus on things.

Kasparov: We've talked now at length about Trump's view of the world, such as it is. Now I want to talk about the Bolton view. So my experience of growing up in the Soviet Union during the Cold War instilled in me a great deal of clarity about good and evil in the world of geopolitics. But there has been a terrible decline in American values after the Cold War, and a new lack of clarity about the American role in the world. So what has that meant for how you see America's place as the global leader?

Bolton: Well, I think we're seeing today play out in the Trump administration and among many people who are supportive of him that this virus of isolationism—which isn't a coherent ideology itself, it's a knee-jerk reaction to the external world—can go through a long period of being irrelevant and then suddenly reappear.

And I attribute this in part to a failure in both political parties, ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, to develop political leaders who thought about what it would take from America to help in the wider world, create conditions of stability that would be beneficial to the U.S. here at home: that would allow our economy to flourish, that would allow our society to flourish. And so people at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, some were saying, It's the end of history. Others were saying, you know, We can have a peace dividend; we can cut our defense budgets; globalization will take care of everything; it's the economy, stupid.

And we lost the post–World War II and Cold War generations of leaders, who spoke very plainly to the American people—whether it's Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, many, many more—to say, look, safety for America doesn't begin on the Atlantic and Pacific shores. Safety for America is having a broader place in the world, a forward defense posture with allies to guard against aggression and to try and deter aggression. And that means a robust, strong America that sees its economic and political and social issues really involved all over the world.

Now, there's a cost to that. There's a defense budget that has to be paid. There are allies that have to be dealt with. There are risks that have to be taken. But to say we don't live in a perfect world, far from it, but the way to protect America is not to put our head in the sand—not to turn away from the rest of the world—but to deal with it in ways that are most favorable to us.

And I think one of the things we're seeing today, 35 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, is: We don't have much in the way of political leadership that can speak to the American people in these terms. The Americans have always risen to the challenge when their leaders are straight with them. And the idea that we can't, we don't need to worry about the rest of the world—it's not a threat, it doesn't concern us, it's not gonna affect us—is deeply uninformed. I don't call it naive. It's almost perverse, and yet that's what we're dealing with. If we could see political leaders emerge, most likely I think in the Republican Party, that can make that case to the American people, we could return to a Reaganite kind of foreign policy that that was successful in the Cold War and could be made applicable to the very different, but no less threatening, challenges we see around the world today.

Kasparov: Going back to 1991, 1992. The Soviet Union is gone, and I think Americans expected some benefits from the victory, phenomenal victory in the Cold War. But eight years of [Bill] Clinton presidency brought no security. Prosperity yes, but security no. Because by the time Clinton left the office, al-Qaeda was ready to strike. Something went wrong, terribly wrong, in the '90s. So do you think that if [George H. W.] Bush 41 would've won the elections and stayed in the office, the Republican administration had a plan on how to redefine American leadership in the new world?

Bolton: No. I mean, I think there was a lot of uncertainty all around the political spectrum. George H. W. Bush talked about a “new world order.” Well, it wasn't much order before, and frankly there wasn't much order after. But what he was referring to was the collapse of the Soviet Union. What we didn't see, because we were too optimistic perhaps, was that Russia would return to authoritarianism. We thought, Well, now they've got the chance; everything will be fine. That obviously didn't work out. We didn't see the turmoil in the Arab world. We didn't see the radicalization, the effect of the 1979 revolution in Iran. And we also, in the 1990s, didn't see China, didn't see that it was a threat, that it would be a threat. You know, we heard Deng Xiaoping say to the Chinese, Hide and bide. Hide your capabilities; bide your time. We didn't realize what he was saying. So this illusion that the end of the Cold War meant the end of history—that conflict was no longer a threat to us—led us to make grave mistakes about Russia, about China, about the threat of Islamic terrorism.

And we have suffered through all of those and are still suffering through them today. So it was a catastrophic series of mistakes, that there's a lot of blame to spread around here for sure, and [the] Clinton administration bears a full share of it. Whether George H. W. Bush would've done better? I don't know. I think so, because I think he understood the world a lot better than Bill Clinton did.

Kasparov: But it still sounds very disturbing that the same people—okay, Clinton replaced Bush, but the apparatus was there, you know, the CIA, Pentagon, the so-called deep state. And the same people, the same agencies, the same institutions that were instrumental in defeating the Soviet Union in the Cold War made such huge blunders. You said—missed Russia, missed China, missed Islamic terrorism, basically missed everything. Every threat that we are dealing with now has been totally missed in the '90s. What was that? It's just a kind of relaxation? We won. Let's go celebrate. You know, let's uncork champagne bottles.

Bolton: Look, I think it was escapism, and I think it was the desire to think, Okay, so in the 20th century we've had three world wars. Two of them hot, one of them the Cold War. We're past all that. Now, that's what “the end of history” means. And, it was a delusion. It was a detour from history. It really was. And we've paid the price.

We're still paying the price, and one reason is we're not spending nearly what we should on defense. The 5 percent commitment that NATO made, we're not approaching. The Trump budget for the next fiscal year is only a small nominal increase over the current budget. It's not gonna do nearly enough. We're setting ourselves up for, I think, a very risky future if we don't change that.

Kasparov: You just mentioned Trump's budget and its nominal increase in defense, but it's a huge increase in ICE. So do you think it's a bit dangerous? Yes? That this military force has been built in America and the control of the DOJ? And they already demonstrated very little respect for the Constitution. Could it be a potential tool for terror?

Bolton: Actually, Trump has come very close to achieving the goal he expressed of closing the border. I mean, he had the border closed at the end of the first term, because deterrence works. If you think you're gonna walk through Mexico and get stopped at the Rio Grande, you're not gonna leave your city or town or village. That's been restored. His—what he wants now is the deportation of the illegals. And I think he's going to have a lot of trouble with that. But the immigration issue is, I think, part of the isolationist temptation that somehow the rest of the world is gonna corrupt us. I think with careful attention and screening of who comes in, we can minimize the risk of terrorists coming in, criminals, agents of foreign governments. Nothing's perfect, but I think we can do a pretty good job of it. I don't think that's what Trump wants to do. He wants the issue of the fight with California, for example. That's why he federalized the California National Guard and sent in the Marines. Ironically, Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, wanted to fight too. It benefited both of them politically. It was just the country that was hurt.

Kasparov: So do you think it's a real chance that Trump will do something totally unconstitutional in America to preserve his power, or just to secure the desired outcome of the next elections?

Bolton: Well, I think he tried that in 2020, and he failed. The system was stressed, but it held. I think Trump is gonna do—he did a lot of damage in the first term; he will do more damage in the second term. Some of it might be irreparable. I think withdrawing from NATO would be irreparable, for example. But I have confidence in the Constitution and the institutions. This is not the late Roman Republic. We're not—I don't think we're in danger of succumbing. It does require more people to stand up and say, We don't accept the way Trump behaves. I'm disappointed more Republicans in the House and the Senate haven't done that. I don't think this is gonna be easy. But I do think, for example, the courts are holding up pretty well. I think their independence is critical to sustaining the Constitution. And I think as time goes on, Trump's influence will decline. Remember, he's not just a new president now, which he is. He's also a lame-duck president. And as people begin to appreciate that more and more, I think his influence will wane.

Kasparov: So, anything to be optimistic about today? Just, you know, give us just some hope that with Trump in the office, with the rise of authoritarianism, with Iranian regimes surviving, and with terrorism not yet being defeated, what's the best-case scenario?

Bolton: Well, I think realistically we've been through worse. I mean, it always seems you've got troubles unique to our time. But the U.S. has been through a lot worse than this, including an incredibly violent Civil War. And we came out on top. And I think one reason is that when you level with the American people—and it's gonna take the next president to do it—then we do rise to the occasion. I believe in American exceptionalism. And I think betting against America is always a dangerous thing to do.

[Music] 

Bolton: So I think in the near term, we've just gotta grit our teeth, make sure we do the best we can to minimize the damage that Trump will cause, and try and get ready to meet the challenges we're gonna face. The threats from China, from the China-Russia axis, from the nuclear proliferation, the threat of terrorism. There are a lot of threats out there, and it's gonna take a lot of effort. But I believe in the United States. I think we will prevail.

Kasparov: John, thank you very much for joining the show. And let's see, you know, if the future brings us more positive than negative news. Thank you.

Bolton: I certainly hope so. Thanks for having me.

George Friedman:  It is a historical norm, that there is a king, that there is a ruler. So authoritarianism historically is far more the norm than liberal democracy. Liberal democracy opened the door to the idea that people with very different beliefs could live together. It is a great experiment, but it's a very difficult experiment. If you believe that the way you should live is a moral imperative, then it is very difficult to have a liberal democracy.

A visit with Le-Ann Williams, and her daughter, Destiny, 20 years after Hurricane Katrina

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Pocket Casts

Five years ago, The Atlantic published Floodlines, an eight-part podcast that told the story of Hurricane Katrina and of the people in New Orleans who survived it. The show detailed the ways that failures of federal and local policies concerning flood control and levees created the flood that submerged New Orleans in 2005, and also the ways that preexisting social inequalities marked some people for disaster and spared others. Through the recollections of people who survived Katrina, as well as officials who tried to coordinate a response, Floodlines explored how misinformation, racism, and ineptitude shaped that response, and how Black and poor New Orleanians were pushed away from their homes. In particular, the series follows the story of Le-Ann Williams, who was 14 when the levees broke.

As the 20th anniversary of Katrina arrives, the city of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast are still dealing with the legacy of the flood and with the racial inequality and displacement that were at the heart of the series. The Black population of New Orleans is declining, and some neighborhoods still haven't come back. Many people who were forced to leave home in 2005 are unable to afford to rent or own where they built their pre-Katrina lives. Experts wonder if the flood-control system there is truly ready for the next “big one,” and because of climate change, more and more cities and towns may face similar threats. Help from FEMA is tenuous under a Trump administration that has slashed its resources and threatened to phase out the department altogether.

So on the occasion of this anniversary, Floodlines takes a fresh visit to New Orleans, to reconnect with Le-Ann Williams, and with her daughter, Destiny. In this special episode, we spend a day with Williams's family and learn about the heartbreaks, tragedies, and triumphs they've experienced since we last spoke. We learn how trauma from Katrina still lives on in the hearts and minds of its survivors, and how, for the generation born after the flood, a disaster they never witnessed still governs their lives.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Vann R. Newkirk II: (Knocks on metal door.)

Male voice: Who's that?

Vann Newkirk: It's Vann!

Male voice: Come on.

Newkirk: All right. (Chuckles.) How you doing?

Le-Ann Williams: Hey, Vann!

Newkirk: Hey, how you doing?

Williams: How y'all doing? All right.

Newkirk: Well, hey. It's Vann Newkirk. I know it's been a minute since you've heard from me here. Five years, to be exact.

Williams: My family: my mom, Patricia; my daughter, Destiny; and my cousin Tasha.

Newkirk: Nice to meet y'all. And I heard a lot about y'all. Nice to meet y'all.

Newkirk: A lot has happened in the time since we put out Floodlines. The pandemic started to really shut everything down the day we put out the show, and it's been one thing after another since then. There's been economic chaos. There were elections. There was an insurrection. There've been fires and hurricanes and floods. There's been a lot of death and a whole lot of grief. A lot of people live different lives than they did in 2020. Hell, I know I do.

Five years ago, when I was making Floodlines, I'd been thinking about Richard, the enslaved man who survived the hurricane in 1856 at Last Island, Louisiana.

Newkirk (Floodlines clip): The next morning, the only building still standing on Last Island was that stable. Richard and the old horse had made it. Many other folks weren't so lucky. 

Newkirk: I was interested in memory and what disasters reveal about a place. My reporting took me to meeting somebody who, quite frankly, changed my life.

Williams (Floodlines clip): We'll have the trumpet player, the trombone player, the snare-drum player, the bass-drum player, and the tuba players will have sticks blowing.

Newkirk: Le-Ann Williams. You remember Le-Ann. She was 14 years old.

Williams (Floodlines clip): I had this crush on this boy named Fonso Jones—

Newkirk: She grew up around Treme and Dumaine Street—

Williams (Floodlines clip): —and Fonso was the point guard.

Newkirk: —living in the Lafitte housing projects, when Hurricane Katrina came and the levees broke.

Williams (Floodlines clip):  And we heard it on the radio, and a man was like, he was in a panic: I repeat, get to safety; get to the Superdome.

Newkirk: She and her family went on an odyssey after the flood. And she came back to a totally different city.

 Archival (Floodlines clip): 3,000 people a day heading to Texas.

 Archival (Floodlines clip): Arkansas will take 20,000 people.

 Archival (Floodlines clip): I'm not going back to New Orleans. I don't wanna go back to New Orleans.

Williams (Floodlines clip):  If you push us out, what's gonna be left? Just come look at things, like a museum. Just come and looking at historic places and buildings? That's it? If you push us out, where the culture gonna come from?

Newkirk: If you haven't listened to Floodlines, I recommend starting from the beginning. In 2020, when we put the show out, I honestly didn't know if it would matter that much with so much going on. But I found out that I was wrong.

Archival (news clip): The breaking news: Stay at home. That is the order tonight from four state governors as the coronavirus pandemic spreads. New York, California, Illinois—

Newkirk: Whether it was the early fears of “looting” during the pandemic, or a Black community being destroyed by a fire—

Archival (news clip): Altadena, and this entire hillside is on fire.

Newkirk: —or FEMA's response to Hurricane Helene—

Archival (news clip): The deadliest hurricane for the U.S. since Katrina in 2005.

Newkirk: —people kept coming back to Hurricane Katrina as a point of reference.

Russell  Honoré: That's rumor gets spread. You know, we dealt with that in Katrina too, Laura.

Newkirk: As it turned out, this show about generations of New Orleanians contending with catastrophe, grief, memory, displacement, and being left behind by our government still had some important lessons for the present. In 2020 we left the show's narrative unfinished, on purpose. Le-Ann, and the others we met—Fred, and Alice, and Sandy, and General Honoré—were all still living with the legacy of Katrina and making meaning from it themselves. They were still living their stories.

But also, as it turns out, I couldn't quit Floodlines so easily. I'd become connected to the people I'd interviewed, who'd shared their lives with me. I'd spent hours and days talking to them, eating meals with them, hanging out. I cared about what happened to them.

Before, I had been thinking about Richard, but now I was thinking about Le-Ann. After the show came out, I saw that she'd gone through even more tough times. I also saw that she was celebrating: a new home, a new job, a kid who was doing well in school.

So on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Katrina, I decided to visit New Orleans.

Williams: Oh, Lord.

Destiny Richardson: We're gonna tear you up in them spades.

Williams: Look at her. We gonna tear him up?

Richardson: Mm-hmm.

Williams: We're gonna tear you in them spades.

Newkirk: I don't know. I ain't lost in a minute. (Laughs.)

Newkirk: I paid Le-Ann a visit, and talked to her family. And met her daughter, Destiny, for the first time.

Newkirk: When we last spoke, you were what? Eleven?

Williams: Yeah.

Newkirk: Eleven years old, and Le-Ann told us a whole lot about you, so, and she posts about you on Facebook all the time.

Williams: Look what you do.

Richardson: Always.

Newkirk: Always. I've seen the honor roll. (Laughs.) You got the honor roll.

Richardson: Yup, honor roll every year.

Newkirk: Congratulations.

Richardson: Two times in a row.

Newkirk: Congratulations.

Richardson: Thank you.

Williams: I'm a proud parent, of course.

Newkirk: Catch me up; catch me up. What's been going on with you the last five years?

Williams: I changed jobs; I moved. I'm in a different spot. And I'm in a different place than I was five years ago.

Newkirk: What kind of place?

Williams: I'm at a peace state, like letting things go that don't mean me no good, you know, I'm trying to just go a different route.

Newkirk: I wanted to know more about that different route. So I stayed a little while.

[Music]

Newkirk: From The Atlantic, this is a special episode of Floodlines, “Part IX: Rebirth.”

It's Sunday, after church time, when we meet Le-Ann. We're trying to hurry up and talk so we can get back across town to catch a second line before it rains. We're in Le-Ann's new home, and the living room is full of family, everybody just shooting the breeze. She rents here and lives with her mother, Patricia, and with Destiny. It's a quiet street.

Newkirk: What's this neighborhood we in?

Williams: We in Pontchartrain Park.

Newkirk: Pontchartrain Park. It's a historic neighborhood.

Williams: Yes, it is.

Newkirk: So last time we met you were out in the East.

Newkirk: Back then, in 2020, Le-Ann lived in a smaller place off a busy road in New Orleans East. She was working around the clock to provide for Destiny. It was far from the part of the city where she'd grown up, and she told us then how much she resented being forced away from the only home she'd known.

New Orleans East was a tough place to live. After the floodwaters receded, it became sort of a holding area for people pushed out from the core of the city by rising rents and gentrification. When Le-Ann was living there, it was known for crime, violence, for food deserts, for pollution, for all the things you don't want when you're raising a little girl.

Williams: I just feel like we just was forgotten about, pushed into different neighborhoods. And yeah, the East is dangerous—it's dangerous out there. Don't pump gas at night. If you're on E, you just try and make it home on E. (Laughs.) And a lot of crime is happening now, especially with our youth.

When I was a kid, you could easily go to the gym, get on the swimming team, the double-dutch team, anything. They don't even have activities like that no more, so it's easy for the youth to get into things and get in trouble. There's a lot of carjacking. They're doing that now—for fun. 

Newkirk: The East had felt like a magnet for tragedy. And sure enough, in 2023, when Destiny was around the same age Le-Ann had been during Katrina, catastrophe struck again. But this time, it was a more personal kind of storm. Le-Ann's stepfather, Jeffrey Hills, the man who'd helped raise her and who'd tried to protect her during Katrina, died suddenly in his sleep, at the age of 47. Talking there in Le-Ann's living room, the loss still felt recent and present.

Williams: That was two years ago.

Newkirk: People say that's a long time, but that's not a long time.

Williams: That's not.

Newkirk: Yeah. How you dealing with it now?

Williams: Better than two years ago, you know? But we still take it day by day.

Newkirk: The room got a little quieter. Everyone was still grieving. Patricia, Le-Ann's mom, had lost her husband and partner: for Le-Ann, a father in everything but blood. Jeffrey was smart and he loved books, and he'd always taken pride in her academics. Destiny was his only grandchild, and you know he spoiled her.

But Jeffrey wasn't just a cornerstone of the family. He was a special part of the whole community. If you were in New Orleans, you knew Jeffrey. He was a veteran tuba player in the city, and he'd played with basically all the big brass bands. He taught and mentored young musicians. I'd seen him play before I even met Le-Ann. His name gets mentioned with all the legends who've come through here. And just like it had been for them, for Tuba Fats and Kerwin James and all the rest, when he died, his comrades played in his honor.

[Music]

Newkirk: They played for days. And when it came time to put Jeffrey to rest, they threw a second line like you ain't never seen. All back in the heart of the Sixth Ward, where Le-Ann used to live.

Williams: And when he had his funeral and everything, and it felt like the New Orleans before Katrina. His friends from the band, everybody, musicians, every musician we knew was there for him. And it was Jazz Fest time. A lot of people didn't go to Jazz Fest; they came. He had gigs lined up for Jazz Fest and everything. So a lot of the musicians didn't go to the Jazz Fest. They came there for his funeral. And my family all was together, everybody was laughing, and it just felt like the Treme area where I grew up in.

Newkirk: It was like a trip back in time. Back when cousins lived down the street and they used to play pitty-pat. It was bittersweet that it took death to bring back a little bit of the old magic.

But there would be more death before long—more people to grieve and more reasons to reminisce on the old days. The day after Jeffrey's funeral, Le-Ann found out her brother Christian was gone too.

Williams: My brother was staying with me. He died—he got killed two blocks from my house as soon as he left from my house. He got his bike out the yard, and somebody killed him.

Newkirk: Now she had to grieve her stepfather and her brother, and to be a support for everyone else.

All the trauma of Katrina, all the moving and all the setbacks, all the big life changes like becoming a mother: It had all forced Le-Ann to grow up early. Christian's and Jeffrey's deaths were like a second growing-up.

For Le-Ann, what this all meant was that she would have to try to be the kind of cornerstone that Jeffrey had been. She felt like the family was being driven apart, and she wanted to do what she could to hold everything together.

Williams:  You know, I'm grown, grown now—you know, people depending on me and things like that.  I gotta make sure our family get together. (Laughs.)

Newkirk: Do you feel like it's harder to keep up with people now that you're spread out?

Williams: Yeah, it is. We probably, you know, say a thing or two on Facebook with each other.

Newkirk: On Sundays like this one, Le-Ann tries to get as many people in one place as she can, to eat and chat or watch Saints games. And during Mardi Gras season, she goes all in. The main event for the family is Endymion. It's one of the biggest Mardi Gras parades, and every year thousands of people march. It's a time.

Williams: I made a Facebook page: “Family is going to Endymion.” And we get on there, we say who's bringing what, and what time, you know, who's holding the spots down. And we all get together for Endymion every—since I was a kid. And you know, I just kind of keep the tradition going on for our kids.

Newkirk: For her kid. For Destiny.

Newkirk: I know she's sitting right here, but can you tell us a little more about Destiny?

Williams: Oh my god. Destiny—she's smart, she is kind, very headstrong. I have a good baby. I do. Beautiful.

Newkirk: She sound like you: smart, headstrong.

Patricia Hills: Yes.

Newkirk: Oh, you think so?

Newkirk: Le-Ann's mom, Patricia, is there behind me.

Hills: Very smart. Yes.

Newkirk: Mm-hmm.

Hills: Very smart. Just like her mom, very smart.

Williams: Yeah, I'm proud of her. (Laughs.) I am. I'm a proud parent. Like, you know, you tell your child things, and you know it go in one ear and out the other sometimes. But when they actually listen and do what you say, that's a blessing.

Newkirk: And we heard, you told us Destiny just got your first job, right?

Richardson: Yeah.

Newkirk: How long you been working there?

Richardson: Probably like, what, a month or two now?

Williams: About two months.

Richardson: About two months.

Newkirk: So what's that, two, three paychecks so far?

Richardson: Yeah, I think so

Williams: Three paychecks.

Richardson: Yeah.

Newkirk: All right, how does that feel?

Richardson: Good. It feels good to have your own money (Laughs.) and buy your own self stuff.  I like my job, though. It's nice. It's fun. And then you meet a lot of people from, like, all over the world, cause there is like a tourism mall.

Newkirk: In a lot of ways, Destiny is just like any other 16-year-old. She wants to get her license. She had a little marching-band drama. She's spending those paychecks. She goes to the mall with her friends.

But she's also dealing with things that would be hard for anyone, let alone a teenager. She's coping with loss and has witnessed her fair share of violence. Aside from the get-togethers her mom organizes, she doesn't always have the same closeness to family that Le-Ann did before the flood. It's like there's some ghost of Katrina that haunts parts of her life. It's eerie to see that ghost whenever she watches the old footage in documentaries.

Newkirk: How do you think about Katrina? What's the first thing that comes to mind?

Richardson: A disaster. It's like when I watch it, sometimes it'll be heartbreaking to watch it because you see the people like with their family, babies and all that. It's hot, nobody to help them. You're like, these people was really out here for days doing this, trying to get food, nobody coming to help them, water everywhere, clothes sticky. I don't want to be like that after the hurricane. (Laughs.) It, it was just a lot. Like, a lot to take in, especially for the people I know. It was a lot for them. People dying.

Richardson: That's a lot.

Newkirk: Well, you look at those documentaries and imagine your mama going through that?

Richardson: I could see her, she's (Laughs.)—I could just see her scared, nerves bad. She already nerve-racking, now, (Laughs.) so I could just see her (Laughs.) when a hurricane hit there after. Probably worrying my grandma, worrying everybody in the house.

Hills: Yes, yes.

Newkirk: Naturally, Destiny doesn't have the same fears and anxieties that Le-Ann has. She likes to poke fun at her mother for being skittish whenever a storm comes around. But Le-Ann says she's learned her lesson. She's evacuating every time. It doesn't matter how much Destiny jokes about it.

Richardson: She'll leave even if it's a one-category storm—hurricane. She'd be so scared: We leaving, let's go, we leaving. We ain't waiting to see if it gets stronger or not. We leaving.

Williams: But she never experienced something like that before, and she never will, because we're leaving.

Richardson: She leaving. She says she sure won't go through nothing like that again.

Williams: I don't care what! No, indeed, I have a child, so I know how my mom and them felt.

Hills: You know, I just remember my baby being scared.

Newkirk: Le-Ann and Patricia walked through the floodwaters together. They have a shared story, and shared memories that I'd heard before, from Le-Ann. Now, hearing things from Patricia's point of view, as a parent myself, helped me really understand just how agonizing it all was.

Hills: She was the oldest and she got the most experiences, and she knew about it and she was scared and stuff like that.

Williams: Yes indeed.

Hills: When Hurricane Katrina hit and I just remember my baby being scared and asking if Momma, we going to die? And I said, No, we're not. Honey, I said, God got us. We gonna get outta here.

Newkirk: In that moment, Le-Ann had come to understand just how vulnerable she was. It wasn't just the storm or the flood. The city and the federal government had turned their backs on her. It all left a mark.

Williams: I said, They gonna leave us here to die. They don't care. I, I said, I hear stories about, oh, you, you know, Black and this and that and poor communities and you know, these things I hear about, but they actually go through something and live it—that's something different. Like, Nobody's coming to save us? I mean, newborn babies out there, they have dead bodies just laying—older folks can't take it. They just dropping. I'm like, My God, this is real.

Newkirk: And so you said, Never again to that.

Williams: I'm not taking—she's not going through that. She's not. Now, just in her mind to worry about something like that, so young, to worry if she's gonna die or if somebody's coming to save—no, she would never. Not if I have breath in my body. She's not waiting on nobody to rescue her. I'm gonna be the one.

[Music]

Newkirk: When I last sat down with Le-Ann, way back in 2020, I played her tape from my interview with the ex–FEMA director Michael Brown.

Michael Brown (Floodlines clip): So you tell Le-Ann I'm sorry, but you tell Le-Ann that her responsibility is to understand the nature of the risk where she lives and to be prepared for it. Knowing that somebody's not going to come—the shining knight in armor is not going to come and rescue her when that fear sets in.

Newkirk: It feels like Le-Ann's response to that is to become the knight in shining armor for everyone else. To take care of people. To make sure that her daughter and her family never feel abandoned like she did. I asked her if she saw Destiny's childhood as like an alternate-reality version of her own, one without that abandonment.

Newkirk: You were 14 when you had to leave the city. Destiny is 16. Do you see, maybe, in Destiny what that childhood could have been like without that disaster?

Williams: I think about it. I used to think about it a lot—like, where would I have ended up? Would my life, you know, still be the same? Or would I have went off to college like my daughter wants to do? But now I'm like, I'm where I'm supposed to be exactly. This is where God wants me to be, you know? I'm where I'm supposed to be today.

[Break]

Williams (Floodlines clip): It's crazy. There's nowhere in the world I'd rather be than here. I love it. It's my home. It's my home. I love New Orleans. I done been to Arizona, Texas, Mississippi after Katrina. Nothing like New Orleans. Nothing's like New Orleans.

Newkirk: One of the things Le-Ann talks about a lot is how much she loves her new neighborhood. She says it's safer, and her street is quiet and peaceful. And it's a bit closer to where she grew up.

Newkirk: It's better out here?

Williams: Yeah, it's much better.

Newkirk: It's pretty out here, and you got the levee right there. You was on the levees in the east, too, so you go up on both. (Laughs.) You still go up there with daiquiris or not?

Williams: (Laughs.) We have wine. We have wine.

Newkirk: You have wine? Okay, so it's a classy establishment. We have wine.

Williams: Yes, wine. We have our wine nights.

Newkirk: Now Destiny's the one who goes up to the levee most often, but to walk her mom's dog, an adorable French bulldog named Frenchy.

Richardson: No, right here!

Newkirk: Right up there?

Richardson: Nah, right here.

Newkirk: I wanted to check it out, so we took a walk together. It's not like the levee at the old place, where you could climb up and see into the water, which Le-Ann loved to do. But up here, maybe it's best that the water is out of sight. The levees here overlook the Industrial Canal, where it meets the lake. It's a critical point in the complex system of flood control that defines New Orleans. In 2005, certain parts of this very neighborhood stood under 15 feet of water after the levees were overtopped. There's a new floodgate now, built by the good old Army Corps of Engineers, that's supposed to stop that from happening again. Le-Ann is not so sure.

Williams: We're sitting in a bowl. Mississippi, Pontchartrain—we're just surrounded by water. We're below sea level. So just imagine, the water's on top of us, and the city's just down here. The water sits like that, so that's why we're below sea level, so the wind is just going down. You can't go up; you're going down! So that's the scary thing about, too, where we live. We're below sea level. I told you that before.

Richardson: Yeah.

Williams: Like, I explained it.

Richardson: Now you see why I won't stay down here? That's another cue for me to go.

Williams: Keep moving, huh?

Newkirk: Destiny is kinda over it. She's heard a lot about Katrina from her mother. When she was younger, Le-Ann even made her sit through a class she put together for Destiny and her friends.

Williams: Yeah, I had a classroom. I fed them every day. They had lunch and everything, breakfast. They had their lunchtime and then they had their time when their parents come pick them up.

Newkirk: So were you rolling your eyes?

Richardson: Was I?

Williams: And one day we had—they watched the documentary of Katrina and they had to write about it, like different things.

Richardson: Yes. My grandpa Jeffrey was in the documentary! Walking in the water with my auntie.

Williams: He was walking with auntie. He in there.

Newkirk: Even with all the teenage eye-rolling, you can tell Destiny is proud of her family's story, especially of her grandfather. And that brought Le-Ann and Destiny back to talking about Jeffrey. About how much he meant to them, and how he represented what New Orleans used to be. They pulled up a video of his funeral and started reminiscing.

Williams: The band came in the funeral home.

Newkirk: Oh wow!

Williams: Look at how packed it was.

Richardson: It was so pretty.

Williams: My pastor say, I've never seen a celebration like this, my God! The band come in the funeral home?

Richardson: Yes, that was nice.

[Music]

Newkirk: Standing here in the grass, by the levees, the sun slipping behind a cloud, we watched together.

Richardson: They had so many people out there and so many people in the funeral home.

Williams: When they opened the door.

Richardson: When they open the door, that's when you really saw the people. All the people wasn't even in the funeral home.

Williams: Yes.

Richardson: They had beaucoup people standing outside.

Williams: He was well known—a tuba player.

Richardson: They had 11 tubas out there for him.

Newkirk: Oh, wow.

Newkirk: It seems to me like they weren't just mourning Jeffrey, but also how they'd lived, and who they were. It got Le-Ann to thinking about her childhood in the Sixth Ward, and to telling Destiny stories she'd already heard 100 times.

Williams: We just did that. If my cousin had a tambourine, we'll sit on a curb and they'll just make a beat. And we'll just start doing, like, little songs and stuff like that. That's what we did with each other. We all say something.

Richardson: Y'all, it's raining.

Newkirk: And then it started to rain.

Newkirk: We got to move.

Williams: Look at that. Oh Lord, we don't want the sugar to melt, huh?

Newkirk: I got a gel in my hair. What you talking about?

Williams: Okay!

Newkirk: We split up, and dried out for a little bit. I put some more gel in my hair.

[Music]

Newkirk: In the evening, we met back up with Le-Ann and Destiny at an ice-cream parlor uptown.

Richardson: She's getting a Creole Clown. He's dressed up like a clown, the ice cream. I want to take a picture of him for the aesthetic.

Newkirk: Destiny did get that Creole Clown ice cream. For the aesthetic.

Newkirk: So they serve it upside down?

Richardson: And they got whipped cream.

Williams: Girl, he is too cute.

Richardson: Yes.

Newkirk: I thought it would be nice to end my time with Le-Ann and Destiny with an ice cream. Back during Katrina, when Le-Ann was escaping the flood, after she'd waded through rat-infested waters, cut her foot stepping on something sharp, and climbed up onto the baking-hot freeway, she saw a man with a cooler who handed her and her family ice creams.

Williams (Floodlines clip): He saying, Ice cream! Ice cream! It's hot. I got ice cream, cold drinks, and water! Come on, baby. Get y'all something to drink, and, I know y'all, you know, thirsty and stuff.

Newkirk: She told us she got a strawberry shortcake.

Williams (Floodlines clip): A strawberry shortcake. You know? You ever had one of those? Yeah. It's good. I got one of them.

Newkirk: The moment has always stuck with me as a symbol of how we misunderstand disaster and, by extension, what really happened during Katrina. There's still, even today, a misconception that disasters—that this disaster in particular brought out the worst in people. That it exposed some latent savagery or lack of morals. But what I've seen, over and over again, is that Katrina really showed just how much people loved each other. How much they loved their communities and their city. What was exposed, though, was how little the country and that city loved them. It feels like, in her own way, Le-Ann is trying to rectify that.

Newkirk: Do you feel like you are like the heart of the family now?

Williams: Yes. And sometimes that get overwhelming. It does.

Newkirk: What do you do when you feel overwhelmed?

Williams: Pray. I pray a lot.

Newkirk: She's overwhelmed a lot. Being the person everyone else relies on is hard, and it can feel like every single thing is on her shoulders. She's doing her best to take up the role Jeffrey played, but now she understands how much of a toll that takes on a person.

Williams: It feel like I'm always responsible for everybody, like, everybody. And sometimes I'm like, Who responsible for Le-Ann? You know, having everybody's back and making sure everybody's good. And sometimes you're like, you know, Who has my back?

Newkirk: But she also takes pride now in the fact that people around the city know her and know her story.

Newkirk: Do you feel like, you know, between us and all the other stuff, are you—would you call yourself an ambassador now for New Orleans, for the city?

Williams: Yes, I want to put my city on; I wanna, you know, bring light to my people, you know, in New Orleans, no matter what race you is or not, because we family down here, and I just want to bring attention to that.

[Music]

Newkirk: Le-Ann still believes in her city, and she wants to stake a new claim to it. She wants to own her own home in New Orleans. She's working as a phlebotomist, and doing her best to support everybody and build up her credit.

Williams: It's going to take a minute, but I'm going to do it.

Newkirk: So ideally, what's your dream house look like?

Williams: Oh. Look, I think about it all the time when I just see houses. I'm like, Oh my God, I can't wait to—especially to have something that, you know, that I got that I can probably leave my child. You know, something I can call my own. Me and Destiny, we right by the lake, we love looking at those houses. We just go through looking at houses, like Oh my God.

Richardson: We'll be like, Ooh that pool big, their backyard big. That house so big!

Williams: Oh my God, this is living right here. We just, you know—

Newkirk: What color is your dream door?

Williams: I want to say red. (Laughs.)

Richardson: Red?

Williams: Old-school.

Richardson: Yes.

Newkirk: She wants a red door, just like her grandma's house on Dumaine Street had.

Richardson: A big, big backyard.

Williams: We have to have a big backyard. Ooh, yes, indeed. My family is big—I got to have a big backyard.

Newkirk: Le-Ann wants to be able to leave Destiny something of her own in New Orleans. But Destiny is looking at colleges out of state.

Newkirk: So Destiny, if you leave, do you ever see yourself coming back?

Richardson: Probably not. I'll probably come back for like, events and stuff—probably, like, Mardi Gras and all that. But as far as coming back to stay, no.

Newkirk: It's the place where mother and daughter seem to differ most. Le-Ann was forced across the country, and then across the city, and has spent her whole life since trying to get back. Destiny wants to see the world for herself, to get out. She's working hard in school, and she's looking at colleges out of state. She's got the grades to leave.

Newkirk: Have you taken any visits yet?

Richardson: No, I ain't taken no visits yet. They be emailing me and stuff for visits, but I haven't took no visits.

Williams: They gave her $500.

Richardson: Oh yeah, I had got one of CASE scholarships for Mercer. It's at home in the envelope. Yeah, and if I go there, they'll give me $2,000 more, plus the scholarship I've been built up on when I graduate.

Newkirk: You already getting scholarships?

Richardson: Yeah.

Newkirk: She's saying it real low-key-like. All right.

Newkirk: But still, for as much as Destiny maybe wants to get out of New Orleans, she's got her mother's story with her. She might not know Katrina firsthand, but she knows the importance of taking care of people.

Newkirk: Anybody tell y'all y'all are pretty similar?

Richardson: Yeah, I hear that a lot.

Newkirk: (Laughs.)

Richardson: They say our personalities are similar.

Williams: My cousin tell me all the time, she was like, You're hard on her, but she's really strong minded. You don't have to worry about her. Destiny knows her way. She was like, You need to give her more credit than what you're doing because she, you know, she's a good kid.

Newkirk: Do you—when people compare you to your mother, is that something where you roll your eyes?

Richardson: Yes, I be like, Oh my God. (Laughs.) They'd be, like, Aw, girl, you act just like your mama and how she acted when she was younger, but just a little bit more—better or something. I was like, Ah, girl. Here they go with this again.

Newkirk: Le-Ann wants to protect Destiny, and to give her the things she didn't have. But I wonder if maybe she's got it backwards. Maybe her family has the thing that other families, rich and poor, Black and white, need. Maybe they've got what other people are searching for. The things we lost in our own personal floods over the past five years: family, community, and connection. We lost memory; we lost time. What we need is care.

Newkirk: So how was the ice cream?

Richardson: That was good.

Williams: It was.

Richardson: I'm gonna most definitely get that again.

Newkirk: The clown, the clown was solid?

Richardson: Yeah, he's still got his eyes and his hat.

Newkirk: Okay. If I could eat dairy, you know—

Richardson: You can't eat dairy? You should've told me! I would have picked something else. (Laughs.)

Newkirk: No, this is fine. This is fine. Look, between the dairy and the shellfish, I come here and I fast.

Newkirk: We finished our ice creams and walked out into the summer. And then Le-Ann and Destiny went home.

﻿Parasocial relationships get a bad rap. How should you relate to your favorite celebrity?

A Vox reader asks: What exactly are parasocial relationships and why are they so prevalent now?

Here's a hypothetical scenario: You hear your favorite podcasters every day. You know their voices by heart. They're chatty and relatable, and they casually reveal all the details of their lives — and what they don't say on the podcast you can easily pick up from following their social media accounts. Eventually, you start to think of them as people you know — even friends. So, it's a rude awakening when you see them at a coffee shop one day and walk up to say hi, only for them to look at you like you've just accosted a complete stranger — because you have.

The reality is that, no matter how close a person feels to their favorite celebrities, influencers, politicians, or podcasters, these relationships aren't reciprocal. When a person chooses to put time and energy into these one-sided relationships, we call them “parasocial.” The prefix “para” here takes the sense of approximating or substituting for something but not actually being the thing itself. These connections may feel social, but they aren't.

Why, then, do so many people seem to feel like they are?

The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

The easy answer to that is that humans are really good at projection. Witness all the humans who are currently tricking themselves into believing their gen AI tools are in love with them or are divine prophets.

The more complicated answer is that modern-day celebrity is constructed from an interwoven mesh of elements, ranging from unintended celebrity gaffes to intentional marketing, that result in a public persona that everyone feels entitled to. That's because we all, in a sense, helped create it.

But are we creating monsters?

The aspirational idea that we can have personal relationships with people we've never actually met is an intrinsic hope of humanity. It's found everywhere from religion — Christians are encouraged to have a relationship with Jesus, a man who lived 2,000 years ago — to political systems. Think, for instance, of medieval soldiers who died fighting for the name of a king they were never in the same room with, nevermind the acolytes who go to bat for their preferred candidates today.

The association of these feelings with intense fandom dates back to at least the 19th century, and they've been stigmatized just as long. At the time, pundits coined the words “Byronmania” and later “Lisztomania” to describe European fan crazes for the darkly romantic poet Lord Byron and the flashy pianist Franz Liszt. Then, of course, came “Beatlemania,” which set the stage for an ongoing media tendency to dismiss fans as hysterical, oversexed young women — a misogynistic view that downplays the cultural importance of fangirls.

Fandom can be deeply meaningful and positively impactful for the millions who are involved in it, and handwringing about parasocial relationships often presumes that fans lack the ability to distinguish what's real, flattening a variety of experiences and expressions.

But it's also true that fans overstepping their boundaries makes things hard for the people they stan. Modern fan culture has shifted away from worshiping aloof Hollywood divas from afar and toward complex entanglements between fans and stars. This shift arguably began in the late aughts within K-pop fandom and grassroots gamer and vlog fandoms on YouTube and Twitch, then expanded into the influencer phenomenon, and finally — irreversibly — into modern celebrity “standom.”

While much of stan culture is positive and welcome between celebrity and fans — see the entire Taylor Swift ecosystem — much of it is overtly toxic. Some fans seek to control and direct their favorite stars' private lives, even to the extent of shaming them and speaking out against them when they try to have lives outside of their public personas. Other segments of modern fans stalk celebrities openly, proactively, and proudly, often fully rejecting the idea that what they're doing is wrong or causing their fave serious discomfort.

In the early years of influencer and stan culture, people who hit it big often had zero media training and zero preparation for how to deal with their new fame. Increasingly, however, celebrities have shown a heightened awareness of the complex nature of these relationships, along with a willingness to speak out instead of feeling pressured to appease their fans. Last year, for example, Chappell Roan spoke out about experiencing harassment, stalking, inappropriate behavior, and bullying — all of it coming from her own fandom. In recent years, celebrities including John Cena and Mitski have asked fans to stop filming them, with Mitski claiming the experience of having to perform for a sea of phones makes them feel as though they're being “consumed as content.”

Most fans, however, never interact directly with the public figures they're “consuming.” Instead, they're interacting with the public persona that exists between the person and their fandom. And because that public persona isn't entirely real to begin with, it's easy for the boundaries that might exist in a real relationship to break down.

The word parasocial comes to us from sociologists Donald Horton and R. Richard Wohl, who, in 1956, penned the essay “Mass Communication and Para-Social Interaction: Observations on Intimacy at a Distance” in a volume of the research journal Psychiatry. “One of the striking characteristics of the new mass media,” they wrote, “is that they give the illusion of face-to-face relationship with the performer.” They dubbed this new form of mediated encounter “para-social interaction.”

Around the same time Horton and Wohl were navigating this new space between public performer and audience, renowned philosopher Jacques Lacan was positing that each individual exists in a kind of triple state: a symbolic representation of the self; an imagined, often idealized, version of the self that we internalize when we envision ourselves; and then the “real” self, the actual person who exists apart from the symbolic and imagined selves.

The result of all this sticky interdependence is an increase in fans feeling entitled to pieces of their celebrities' lives.

Nowhere is this triple state more apparent than with celebrities. Film scholar Richard Dyer first articulated the concept of a “star text,” arguing that every Hollywood star exists simultaneously as themselves, as a constructed persona — a “text” — that might mean different things to different audiences, and as the symbol they represent. The construct of “Chappell Roan,” for example, is a glam queer pop idol, the deliberately camp persona of a Missouri native named Kayleigh Rose Amstutz. To her fans, she's not just a singer, but a representation of liberated queer identity as performed through a range of complicated love songs and power anthems.

It's this public-facing persona that stands apart from the individual celebrity and becomes a part of the cultural consciousness. It is partly created by the celebrity, partly created by their consciously cultivated brand, partly created by the narrative their fans and/or marketing team builds around them, and partly created by the pop culture zeitgeist. The public-facing persona becomes something the public can help create, expand upon, and shape. The persona is the thing that carries meaning, that can be venerated or excoriated or projected onto. And it's the persona, not the person, with whom we have our “relationship.”

Fans rarely reach this “relationship” stage on their own. Modern-day celebrity uses the tools of intimacy to encourage fans and take their place in the culture. How much time, for example, do you spend letting your favorite podcaster or vlogger talk to you? It can be easy to start feeling like you're besties with people when they're chatting at you for hours a day. Then, there's the marketing apparatus to consider. The celebrities, or at least their PR teams, often tacitly or strategically encourage fan relationships. Witness Jin, the oldest member of the wildly popular K-pop group BTS, bizarrely having to give 1,000 hugs to 1,000 fans upon his exit from his mandatory military service last year. The media undoubtedly plays a role in this invasive culture, as well, by encouraging rampant speculation about celebrities' private lives. (Remember Kategate?)

The result of all this sticky interdependence is an increase in fans feeling entitled to pieces of their celebrities' lives. The celebrity's inability to control any of this is undoubtedly part of the tension around the parasocial relationship discourse. In many cases, even confronting the idea that an actor could be someone else outside of their professional persona can distress fans. It's by no means only “extreme” fans who fall prey to this way of thinking. Think how many people on the internet were emotionally invested in John Mulaney's divorce or the Try Guys scandal.

These media narratives play out the way they do precisely because so many people feel an intense amount of ownership over the lives of these people they've never met. Trying to repair this would mean having to undo over a century of prurient media obsession with the lives of actors, performers, and other famous people, as well as the subsequent impact on individuals who fall hard for their faves. It's just not possible.

So, what's the solution? It's perhaps too simple to say “stan responsibly,” especially when fandom etiquette is arguably devolving faster than any of us are prepared for. But that might be the most rational way to approach the reality of parasocial relationships.

If you find yourself thinking it's okay to share and interact with photos of celebrities in their private moments, maybe it's time to check your level of investment in them and their life. If you find yourself getting caught up in increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories that make you seriously question what's real and what isn't, it's probably time to step back before you get drawn in further.

If you have kids watching YouTube, make sure they understand the context for what they're watching before your child starts to believe that the influencer kid she adores is her best friend. If you're convinced your favorite podcaster hung the moon, maybe temper your expectations a wee bit, just in case they backslide into weird conspiracy theories and bizarre political talking points. I'm speaking from experience on that one.

Above all, remember that parasocial relationships are more or less like all other relationships. That is, they can be fun and engaging and emotionally rewarding — but only as long as they're managed and handled with care.

The paradox of today's Trump-voting youth.

As Donald Trump's presidency shoulders on, a curious thing is happening with the youngest cohort of American voters: Gen Z's support for the president is crumbling, but they're not swinging in favor of the Democrats — yet.

It's an amplification of a more general trend in American society right now. Across every age cohort, tracking surveys are showing Americans are much more dissatisfied with how Trump is doing his job this summer compared to their feelings at the start of his term.

Among those aged 18-29, this swing is particularly dramatic — a 27 percentage point drop over the last six months, according to CBS News/YouGov polling, taking the president from a positive 55 percent approval rating among Gen Z in February to 28 percent in July.

At first glance, these polls suggest an answer to one of the open questions from the 2024 presidential election: Was the rightward lurch of young voters a one-off? Depending on the data source, Gen Z voters shifted anywhere from 6 points toward Republicans to 21 points in the 2024 general election, becoming much more Trumpy since 2020. A majority of Gen Z approved of Trump as he began his presidency. And now, these ratings suggest the youth might be experiencing some buyers' remorse.

That might be true. But recent data from the Pew Research Center, and trends among the youngest American voters, complicate this picture. Just because the youth are souring on Trump doesn't seem to suggest a rapid swing back to his opposition. Instead, it paints a worrisome picture of frustration and disengagement for both parties, as well as a reminder about the perils of relying on young voters to power political change.

Before we begin to look at data, some caveats. Polling of Gen Z people, in particular, tends to be especially noisy because of how hard it is to reach and form a good sample of respondents. It's expensive and hard to reach young Americans. As opposed to polling Americans by race, partisanship, or income, you can't really pinpoint where these folks are geographically, and it's hard to get them to pick up a random phone call or respond to a text.

This introduces the problem of non-response bias, which is amplified by partisanship and political engagement — less engaged youth, or more conservative youth, might be less likely to respond to pollsters, or to answer truthfully.

Because of all of this, high-quality data that's focused just on this set of Americans tends to come in less frequently than for other segments of the electorate. And when we do get numbers from big national polls, age subgroup samples in the crosstabs of those polls (the smaller, more specific categories of respondents) tend to be pretty small, making it easy to overread small percentage point movements or be shocked at drastic swings. As in election years, it tends to be smarter to look at averages, or overall trends, as opposed to month-to-month swings.

With that out of the way, what does the data show? Is the pro-Trump shift of 2024 durable among Gen Z? Is it holding steady this year? The answer is… sort of.

While Trump and his party are viewed more unfavorably now than they were at the start of his presidency, there's still a significant share of Gen Z voters who trust him and the GOP over Democrats on a variety of issues. In a July survey by the Democratic-aligned Navigator research project, which included an oversampling of young voters to get a better sense of their views, Gen Z respondents were about evenly split between the parties on issues like immigration, Middle East foreign policy, and inflation. Democrats only had tiny advantages on jobs, taxes, and tariffs — though they had stronger support on issues like health care and the environment.

It's the latest sign of something more durable about young Americans right now: 18- to 29-year-olds today are more Republican than in past years. According to the Pew Research Center's National Public Opinion Reference Survey, which tracks changing attitudes and partisanship across the electorate, today's 18- to 29-year-olds are much more evenly split between the two parties than in 2020. Five years ago, Democrats could rely on about an 18-point advantage in party affiliation. Today, that margin has shrunk to 6 points. Compare that to the 27-point advantage Democrats had among millennials seven years ago, and the shift becomes drastic.

These numbers suggest a level of durability to the Republican lean of young Americans now, Jocelyn Kiley, the director of politics research at Pew, told me.

“This movement that we've seen among this youngest group in a less Democratic direction, that shift that happened from the prior years to last year, seems to have held. There's no evidence that it's attenuating,” Kiley said. “This group is now fairly evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, and that is not the way that millennials [behaved].”

And more importantly for the future, “at least in our data, there's not a suggestion of a movement back to the Democratic Party among 18- to 29-year-olds,” Kiley told me.

What is driving this (essentially) toss-up status for young Americans is more of an open question. But there are some theories.

Underlying these swings is the particular wild-card status of the youngest, newest members of the electorate, Kiley told me: those who first voted in 2024 or who are just entering the electorate this year, and who are having their political views shaped right now by the omnipresence of Trump and his political movement.

“Many millennials came of age during Barack Obama's presidency, or Obama's first election. Today's 18- to 29-year-olds are coming of age in a very different political moment and that's certainly a factor in partisan identification. Many of these 18- to 29-year-olds don't have a clear memory of a time before a Trump presidency,” she said.

Kiley echoed what Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University, told me: The youngest voters feel particularly unmoored from political parties and pessimistic about politics, making them more likely to either vote out the party in power or disengage from politics.

“The biggest story for partisanship is the enormous segment of Gen Z who identify as independents, who don't affiliate with either party, and I think that really does point to them being much more up for grabs than previous generations,” Twenge, the author of the book Generations: The Real Differences between Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers, and Silents—And What They Mean for America's Future, said.

Twenge recently took a look at data from the national Cooperative Election Study and found that though Gen Z voters did swing drastically toward Republicans last year, they aren't necessarily strong ideologues with strong corresponding conservative beliefs. This dynamic raises a conundrum for Trump and Republicans; though they were able to benefit from youth discontent with the Biden years and gain some degree of trust from new young voters, they can't count on these voters remaining in their coalition or coming out to vote for them again in midterm elections. Republicans might be making policy decisions that turn Gen Z away. And at the same time, young voters continue to be disillusioned with the Democratic Party.

Twenge said that Gen Z seems inherently pessimistic, but, “Is it going to promote activism, or is it going to promote nihilism?” she asked. “I think it remains to be seen which one is going to prevail.”

This suggests Democrats might benefit from better engagement, listening, and responding to what young voters are communicating. Gen Z wants a better economic vision, elevation of young people and the phasing out of older party leaders, and, at least among young men, better inclusion within Democratic political movements specifically.The alternative is something Twenge has argued before: Gen Z is just never satisfied with how the status quo is working with either party, and reacts against whichever party is in power. This might be a boon for Democrats next year — but it could doom them in 2028 or beyond.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

And two reasons they're in deep trouble.

The Democratic Party's approval rating is at its lowest point in at least 35 years, according to a Wall Street Journal poll released last week.

In that survey, 63 percent of voters expressed an unfavorable view of the Democrats, while just 33 percent voiced a positive one. By contrast, voters disapproved of Congressional Republicans by only 11 points. These dismal figures are broadly consistent with other recent polling: In RealClearPolitics's average of recent surveys, voters disapprove of the Democratic Party by a 59.3 to 36.3 margin.

What's more, Democrats don't just have a lower favorability rating than Republicans, but also command less trust on the public's top issues. In the Journal's poll, voters disapproved of Trump's management of the economy, tariffs, inflation, foreign policy, and immigrant deportations. And yet, they said that they trusted Republicans to handle all of those matters better than Democrats would. Of the 10 issues raised in the survey, voters favored Democrats on only two — health care and vaccine policy.

These grim data points have spurred some handwringing in blue America. But just how dire is the Democrats' predicament? Is the party temporarily tainted with the stink of last year's defeat — and poised to rally back into power, just as it did after losing in 2004 and 2016? Or is the better precedent for the party's current position 1981, when the party began a 12-year struggle to escape the shadow of a failed presidency?

Only prophets can answer such questions with certainty. In my own view, though, two things are true:

• The Democrats' putrid approval numbers paint a misleadingly bleak picture of its current standing.

• The party is in much worse shape than it was eight years ago, and will likely struggle to secure full control of the federal government any time soon.

Below, I'll detail five reasons for believing that first point, and two for accepting the second one.

Sign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.

In the Journal's poll, the GOP's net-favorability rating is 19 points higher than the Democratic Party's. And yet, in that same survey, voters say that they would prefer a Democratic Congress to a Republican one by a 3-point margin.

This seems odd. Voters disapprove of Democrats by a much larger margin than they disapprove of Republicans. Yet a plurality nonetheless say they would vote for the former party over the latter one.

As polling analysts G. Elliott Morris and Mary Radcliffe observe, there is only one explanation for this: Unhappy — but loyal — Democratic voters are driving down their party's favorability rating.

This interpretation is consistent with polling from YouGov and The Economist, which finds that only 74 percent of Democratic voters approve of congressional Democrats, while 22.6 percent disapprove. By contrast, 88.9 percent of Republican voters approve of their party's congressional causes, while just 8.3 percent disapprove.

Partisans often disapprove of their own parties when they suffer defeat. Republicans had abysmal approval numbers in 2009, yet stomped to a historic midterm victory the following year. And that turnaround was not an aberration: According to Morris and Radcliffe, historically, there is no correlation between how well a party performs in favorability polls taken this far from Election Day and how well they ultimately do at the ballot box.

It's unlikely that the Democrats' plummeting popularity is entirely attributable to the disaffection of its own base. The GOP's trust advantage on various issues suggests a broader problem. Nonetheless, the Democratic Party is (almost certainly) in better shape than its approval rating would suggest.

The president's approval rating is among the best predictors of an opposition party's midterm success. And Donald Trump has rapidly squandered the American public's goodwill.

When Trump came into office, voters approved of him by an 11.6 margin, according to Nate Silver's polling average. Now, they disapprove of the president by 8.8 points.

For context, at this point in Joe Biden's presidency, the public still approved of the Democrat by more than 7 points. And although Trump's approval is unlikely to collapse to the extraordinary degree that Biden's did, there's reason for thinking it will follow the same trajectory. Namely:

Thus far, the economic impacts of Trump's tariffs have been fairly modest. Those duties have pushed up consumer prices and likely slowed economic growth. But they haven't triggered inflation akin to that which America witnessed in 2022, let alone a stagflationary crisis.

This is partly because Trump walked back his most radical tariff proposals. Yet the president's trade restrictions remain extraordinarily expansive, outstripping what many deemed the worst-case scenario during campaign season. According to Yale's Budget Lab, America's average effective tariff rate sits at 20.2 percent, its highest level since 1911. And Trump's current tariffs are poised to cost US households an average of $2,700 in annual income.

Americans are not yet paying the full price of Trump's trade policy. The US government has yet to begin collecting tariffs on many foreign countries. And American retailers loaded up on foreign goods earlier this year to get ahead of the president's trade duties. But as America ramps up its tariff collection regime — and companies draw down their inventories — consumer prices will rise. Preston Caldwell, chief US economist for Morningstar, recently told Vox that he expects inflation to peak in 2026, when voters will be heading to the polls.

Since Trump's conquest of the GOP in 2016, Democrats have gained ground with highly politically engaged voters, and lost support among less-engaged ones. This trade didn't work out very well in the high-turnout environment of 2024. But the fact that Democratic voters are now disproportionately “reliable” — which is to say, disproportionately likely to cast a ballot in every election — may help them in the 2026 midterms, when overall turnout is sure to be lower.

And the results of this year's Supreme Court election in Wisconsin lend credence to this view. That contest was the one 2025 race that 1) pit a Democrat against a Republican, 2) took place in a swing state, and 3) galvanized national attention. And the Democrat won 10 points, outperforming her standing in the polls.

Finally, the American electorate's top concerns have been shifting, in ways that are potentially beneficial for Democrats.

For years, Republicans have enjoyed an advantage over Democrats on immigration. And the Journal's poll shows that voters still trust the GOP to better manage illegal immigration by a margin of 17 points.

But Americans are also much less worried about that issue than they were a year ago. In Gallup's polling, the share of voters who say they worry “a great deal” about illegal immigration has fallen from 48 percent in 2024 to 40 percent this April. A more recent Gallup survey showed that the percentage of Americans who want immigration reduced has fallen from 55 percent last year to 30 percent today.

Meanwhile, the share of Americans who worry “a great deal” about health care — perennially, one of the Democratic Party's strongest issues — rose from 51 percent to 59 percent in April. And that was before the GOP enacted sweeping cuts to Medicaid funding.

All this said, there's still reason to fear for the Democrats' future. For one thing, the party is much weaker than it was at this point in Trump's first term. Eight years ago, voters said they favored a Democratic Congress over a Republican one by roughly 8 points (compared to just 3 points today).

Since 2018, the share of Americans who identify with the Democratic Party has also fallen sharply. Seven years ago, 50 percent of Americans said they supported (or leaned toward) the Democrats, while 42 percent said the same of Republicans, in Pew Research's polling. Today, 46 percent support the GOP while 45 percent back the Democrats.

Opposition parties almost always gain House seats in midterm elections. And since the Republican House majority is small, Democrats are heavily favored to retake the chamber next year. But current polling suggests that the party's gains will be meager.

And in 2028, for the first time in more than a decade, the Republican Party will not be led by Donald Trump. If the GOP retains its advantage on the economy — while shedding its exceptionally undisciplined and scandal-plagued standard-bearer — the party could become even more formidable.

This is a very speculative concern, to be sure. But it's worth entertaining the possibility that Democrats' current position is more analogous to its predicament in 1981 — when Jimmy Carter's defeat was followed by 12 years of Republican presidential rule — than in 2017.

The previous two times that Democrats lost control of the White House — in 2000 and 2016 — the party's outgoing president had been reasonably well-liked. Bill Clinton had earned a reputation for skillful economic management, thanks to the late 1990s economic expansion. Barack Obama was a singularly magnetic figure, and the US enjoyed relatively low unemployment and inflation in 2016. Both Clinton and Obama's successors won the popular vote in their respective elections, despite the fact that they each were conspicuously uncharismatic. Their losses could therefore be fairly easily dismissed as the consequence of easily reversible tactical errors.

By contrast, presiding over post-COVID inflation rendered Biden historically unpopular while devastating the Democrats' credibility on economic management.

The Democrats' biggest political problem, however, lies in the Senate.

The party's prospects for securing control of Congress's upper chamber — either next year, or in 2028 — look poor. Democrats need to gain four seats to win a Senate majority in 2026. Yet next year's map features no easy targets. The party's best pickup opportunity lies in Maine, a state that Kamala Harris won comfortably in 2024. But that state's incumbent Republican senator, Susan Collins, won reelection by 8.6 points in 2020, even as the national political environment leaned towards Democrats. Her defeat next year is far from assured.

After defeating Collins, Democrats' next-best hope for growing their Senate caucus is winning the open seat in North Carolina, a state that backed Donald Trump all three times he was on the ballot, most recently by 3 points.

If the party manages to beat Collins and win over the Tarheel State, they would still need to win races in Ohio and Iowa — or else, in places that are even more Republican — to eke out a bare majority in the Senate.

Even winning control of the Senate by 2029 would require extraordinary electoral feats. The most plausible path here would involve Democrats beating Collins, winning a race in North Carolina, flipping a Wisconsin Senate seat in 2028, and taking back the presidency that same year (since the vice president breaks all ties in the Senate, Democrats would only need to flip three seats to boast a working majority in 2029, provided that they control the White House). And yet, this path only works if Democratic Senate incumbents also win reelection in every swing state race between now and 2029: Specifically, Democrats would need to win two races in Georgia, one in Pennsylvania, one in Michigan, and one in Arizona.

This is conceivable. But it is not especially likely.

The fundamental problem facing Democrats is that only 19 states voted for their party in each of the last three federal elections, while 25 US states backed Trump all three times. Put differently, the median US state is more right-wing than America as a whole. In practice, this means that — to win a Senate majority — Democrats don't merely need to beat Republicans nationally, but to do so by a hefty margin. For context, in 2018, Democrats won the House popular vote by 8.6 points and still lost Senate seats.

In the US, midterms usually witness backlashes against the president's party. But Democrats need more than an ordinary midterm backlash to put themselves on pace to win the Senate by 2029. And without a Senate majority, Democrats that year would be unable to pass partisan legislation or appoint liberal Supreme Court justices, even if they did manage to win the presidency.

Democrats might not need to become drastically more popular to win back the House. But to actually run the federal government, they likely need to make their party more broadly appealing than it was eight years ago. This makes their historically low approval rating more than a little alarming.

The communities of sea creatures push the boundaries of what we know about life.

The Titanic lies about 12,500 feet under the ocean. The pressure down there is so immense that even submersibles supposedly built for those conditions can, as we know, tragically fail.

Now imagine taking a sub nearly three times deeper.

That's what an international team of scientists did last summer. Led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the researchers took a manned submersible to the bottom of deep-sea trenches in an area in the northwest Pacific Ocean, roughly between Japan and Alaska. They reached a depth of more than 31,000 feet.

The researchers weren't looking for a shipwreck. They were interested in what else might be lurking on the seafloor in trenches so deep that no light can reach them.

It was there that they found something remarkable: an entire ecosystem of animals, living in the darkness. Even more incredibly, those animals — and the animals they eat — derive energy not from sunlight but from chemical reactions. Through a process called chemosynthesis, deep-sea microbes turn chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide into organic compounds, including sugars, forming the base of the food chain. The discovery was published in the journal Nature.

Aboard a deep-sea vessel called Fendouzhe, which was equipped with cameras and lights, the researchers encountered abundant wildlife communities, including fields of marine tube worms peppered with white marine snails. The worms have a symbiotic relationship with chemosynthetic bacteria that live in their bodies. Those bacteria provide them with a source of nutrients in exchange for, among other things, a stable place to live.

Among the tube worms the scientists encountered white, centipede-like critters — they're also a kind of worm, in the genus macellicephaloides — as well as sea cucumbers.

The researchers also found a variety of different clams on the seafloor, often alongside anemones. Similar to the tube worms, the clams depend on bacteria within their shells to turn chemical compounds like methane and hydrogen sulfide that are present in the deep sea into food.

This was the deepest community of chemosynthetic life ever discovered, according to Mengran Du, a study author and researcher at the Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who was on the submersible. Du declined to comment on whether the expedition had anything to do with the potential for deep-sea mining in this region.

“Diving in the submersible was an extraordinary experience — like traveling through time,” Du told Vox by email. “Each descent transported me to a new deep-sea realm. As a diving scientist, nothing compares to the thrill of gazing through the observation window with my own eyes.”

Unlike other deep-sea ecosystems — which feed on dead animals and other organic bits that fall from shallower waters — these trench communities are likely sustained in part by methane produced by microbes buried under the seafloor, the authors said. That suggests that wildlife communities may be more common in these extremely deep trenches than scientists once thought.

“The presence of these chemosynthetic ecosystems challenge long-standing assumptions about life's potential at extreme depths,” Du said.

Update, August 1, 10 am ET: This story was originally published on July 30 and has been updated to include more details shared by a researcher involved in the expedition.

Amazon earnings beat expectations in the second quarter, but it wasn't enough to calm investors' concerns over AI competition and weak profit guidance.

On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported $167.7 billion in net sales and earnings of $1.68 per share, which smashed analyst estimates.

Despite the strong results, the company's stock fell 7% in after-hours trading. Investors were spooked by Amazon's profit outlook for the third quarter, which projected operating income between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion, against Wall Street's estimate of $19.41 billion.

From where Amazon is in the AI race to competition with Starlink, here are our four key takeaways from the Q2 earnings call.

CEO Andy Jassy said tariffs haven't had a major impact on the business so far in 2025. He cited strong Prime Day sales as evidence that consumer demand remains resilient, though Prime Day was in July after Q2 wrapped.

Jassy said on the earnings call that the company hasn't seen ""diminishing demand"" or ""meaningfully appreciating prices"" so far, though he said that could change later in the year.

He added during an analyst question session that it's still unclear ""who's going to end up absorbing the higher costs.""

Jassy also pointed to Amazon's 2 million third-party sellers as a key advantage, which often offer more flexible prices.

""Tariffs appear overstated for now, and Amazon remains the go-to destination for online deals and continues to draw strong consumer and brand engagement,"" Brent Thill, senior technology research analyst at Jefferies, wrote in a recent note before the earnings report.

Jassy said the race for satellite-based broadband internet is now largely a two-player game, between ""the incumbent"" — widely understood to be Musk's Starlink — and Amazon's own Project Kuiper.

On the earnings call, Jassy told investors that price will be a key differentiator for Kuiper, along with Amazon's existing relationships with enterprise and government clients, many of whom are also interested in its AI offerings.

While Kuiper has faced delays, Jassy said the service is on track to enter commercial beta later this year or in early 2026.

In April, Amazon sent its first batch of 27 Kuiper internet satellites into low Earth orbit. At least 54 crafts are in orbit; Amazon plans a constellation of 3,236 satellites.

Amazon touted Alexa+, its AI-enabled voice assistant that launched in February, as an action-focused chatbot that can complete tasks that others can't.

""She's much more intelligent than her prior self,"" Jassy said of the improvement over the prior version of Alexa. ""She's much more capable, and I would say unlike the other chatbots that are out there today, who are good at answering questions, but really can't take any action for you, Alexa+ can take a lot of action for you.""

Some examples of what Alexa+ can do include playing music, moving music between devices, drawing curtains, turning lights on, and changing the thermostat temperature, Jassy said.

Millions of customers have been given early access to Alexa+, and Jassy told the call that the feedback has been ""very positive.""

Jassy also said that Alexa+ could incorporate advertisements or a subscription element in the future.

Jassy faced tough questions about how AWS is addressing competition from its cloud computing rivals.

Brian Nowak, an analyst from Morgan Stanley, asked Jassy to respond to the Wall Street narrative that ""AWS is falling behind"" in the generative AI race and losing share to its competitors.

Jassy said it was ""early"" in the AI space and that the industry was ""top-heavy."" He didn't address directly how AWS is responding to competitors, but said he thinks the company is well-positioned as AI adoption expands.

""Remember, 85% to 90% of the global IT spend is still on premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which I do, and we do, you have a lot of legacy infrastructure that you've got to move,"" Jassy said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy tried to calm concern about AI cloud competition. Wall Street isn't buying it.","https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-tumbles-ceo-andy-jassy-aws-cloud-ai-growth-concerns-2025-7","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 00:25:00 GMT","

On Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy scrambled to calm investor concerns over growth at the company's cloud and AI business.

Wall Street wasn't buying it.

Jassy fielded tough analyst questions about AWS's growth and its position in the AI race. The stock tumbled 7% in after-hours trading, weighed down by disappointing profit guidance and Jassy's vague responses on AI.

During the call, Jassy was asked about rival companies' ""significantly faster cloud growth."" AWS reported revenue growth of 17%, a far slower rate than Microsoft and Google's cloud businesses.

Jassy said AWS has a much bigger revenue base, which makes comparing growth rates difficult. He also said AWS has better security and functionality than peers, while stressing its ""pretty significant"" leadership position in cloud market share.

""It's a $123 billion annual revenue run rate business, and it's still early,"" Jassy said, referring to AWS's annualized sales figure. ""It is a very unusual opportunity that we're very bullish about.""

The Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak followed up by asking about Wall Street's ""narrative right now that AWS is falling behind"" in AI, with concern about losing share to competitors.

Jassy launched into a sprawling response, calling the AI market ""early"" and ""top-heavy,"" dominated by a handful of popular models and apps. He pointed to AWS's lower-cost Trainium AI chip as a potential draw for customers seeking better price performance. He rattled off new agentic tools and developer features and then circled back to familiar territory, comparing today's AI shift to the early days of the original cloud boom, which AWS pioneered.

""Remember 85% to 90% of global IT spend is still on-premises,"" Jassy said. ""If you believe that equation's going to flip, which I do and we do, you have a lot of legacy infrastructure that you've got to move.""

Colin Sebastian, a senior research analyst at Baird, told BI that despite AWS's continued growth, the market's reaction was concerning.

""Contrasting with Azure and Google Cloud Platform growth, it's hard to disprove the emerging Wall Street narrative that competitors are gaining ground and momentum from AWS,"" he said.

During the call, Jassy added that AWS still had capacity issues across electricity, chips, and server components, with power being the ""single biggest constraint."" He said it would most likely take several quarters to meet the demand shortage.

One encouraging sign for AWS is that its cloud market share has barely budged over the past year. In the second quarter, the top three cloud providers' market share was virtually flat, with AWS at 30%, and Microsoft and Google each holding 20% and 13%, respectively, according to Synergy Research.

Amazon's spokesperson declined to comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","CNBC's 'The Profit' ended with legal acrimony and an $11 million payout. Its host is now back on TV.","https://www.businessinsider.com/the-profit-marcus-lemonis-lawsuits-settlements-the-fixer-fox-2025-8","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:10:00 GMT","

Marcus Lemonis — the multimillionaire entrepreneur known for dishing out tough love tactics and advice to small businesses across the US — returned to reality television this summer.

""Every episode, I'm meeting businesses at a crossroads,"" he told viewers during the double episode premiere of Fox's ""The Fixer.""

""I'm not a consultant. I don't believe in handouts. I'm a capitalist.""

From 2013 to 2021, Lemonis also hosted another reality show, CNBC's ""The Profit."" Its premise was similar to that of ""The Fixer"": Lemonis offered capital and advice to what were described as ""struggling"" small businesses in exchange for partial ownership and being put ""100% in charge."" The show was a hit and turned Lemonis into a minor celebrity.

It also resulted in a sprawling mess of lawsuits, arbitrations, confidential settlements, and small business owners who say that Lemonis damaged their companies and reputations.

Of the roughly 100 businesses featured on ""The Profit,"" more than 50 filed lawsuits, engaged in mediation talks, or settled with Lemonis and NBCUniversal over the harm they say they endured.

While some of these disputes were known, the scale of the fallout has not been previously reported. Business Insider has learned that in 2021, NBCUniversal, CNBC, Comcast, Lemonis, and the show's production company settled for $11 million, with 40 companies that appeared on ""The Profit"" paid $275,000 each.

Arbitrators and federal judges dismissed several fraud and misconduct claims against Lemonis. In two cases, NBCUniversal, Lemonis, and their affiliated companies secured more than $20 million in judgments, loan repayments, and legal fee awards after lawsuits filed by companies that appeared on the show went to arbitration.

Business owners have accused Lemonis and NBCUniversal of aggressive tactics, broken promises, loading on debt, and deals that unraveled after filming. Business Insider interviewed more than a dozen people involved with the show and reviewed thousands of pages of court records, correspondence, and confidential settlement documents.

Lemonis and NBCUniversal have denied the allegations, saying the CEO was only trying to help companies already in trouble. In court and public statements, they've argued they disclosed key risks of appearing on the show.

In an interview with Business Insider, Lemonis said he had won ""any claim that was ever brought against me.""

""I know I didn't do anything wrong. I have a clean conscience. I sleep at night very well,"" Lemonis said. He declined to discuss the settlement agreement and didn't respond to subsequent follow-up questions.

""The only money that I could ever think of that got spent was mine,"" Lemonis said. ""And the amount of money that I ever got out of the businesses — including loans, interest, in any business of any kind — this isn't specific to any business — was zero.""

Now, Fox has brought Lemonis back to the air with a familiar concept. Fox declined to comment.

Lemonis, 51, got his start selling cars and hustling RVs, snapping up dealerships in the early 2000s that he rolled into a national chain. He became the CEO of Camping World in 2006 and took the RV giant public a decade later. As his profile grew, he styled himself as a sharp-tongued, blue-collar mogul — part businessman, part showman. In 2024, he took over as executive chairman of Beyond, Inc., the parent company of Bed Bath & Beyond, shortly after the home goods brand declared bankruptcy. He was appointed principal executive officer a year later.

""The Profit"" first aired in July 2013, part of an attempt by CNBC — NBCUniversal's business news channel — to find programming for the after-market hours.

The idea was simple. Lemonis promised to invest his money, often in exchange for an ownership stake, to help revamp small businesses across the country. He would negotiate on-air, handshake agreements with business owners and declare himself ""100% in charge"" before implementing a slew of changes. If owners expressed doubt, Lemonis and producers told them to ""trust the process,"" business owners alleged in legal and mediation records.

The show took off on social media and, within three years, CNBC said it was its most-watched original series telecast with 1.9 million viewers.

In early 2021, Gerard Fox, a Los Angeles-based litigator with a background in high-profile commercial and entertainment law, sent a series of letters to lawyers at Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal. The letters, which have been reviewed by Business Insider and have never previously been reported on, were put together on behalf of dozens of participants on ""The Profit,"" detailing what they described as their negative experiences with the show.

After Fox sent his letters, both sides entered into mediation, according to one person involved, heading off potential litigation by many of the businesses. The settlement agreement was signed by senior executives at Comcast, NBCUniversal, CNBC, Lemonis, and the production company, and included non-disparagement clauses for the companies involved and a reciprocal confidentiality clause. Parties on both sides of the settlement denied wrongdoing.

One of the small business owners said they took the money because they feared that otherwise, ""NBC and Lemonis will throw $millions at us and in the end squash us,"" according to emails among business owners discussing the settlement.

Gerard Fox declined to comment for this story. After a lawsuit he filed on behalf of another business that appeared on the show was dismissed in federal court, a judge sanctioned Fox, saying she was misled about the terms of that dismissal.

""The goal of 'The Profit' was to help participants find a path to success for businesses that were often close to failure,"" a CNBC spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. ""While some did not succeed, the show aimed to help businesses get to profitability and shine a light on the challenges that face small business owners across the country.""

In a document prepared for the mediation, the network said it had no role in the deals between Lemonis and the businesses, and that it wasn't responsible for how those deals turned out.

Many business owners declined to comment, with some citing contracts they signed prior to filming that stipulated heavy fines for speaking about the show.

In 2023, NBCUniversal and the production company settled with five more businesses, which were represented by the law firm Quinn Emanuel, according to court documents. That same year, NBCUniversal also settled with the owners of an Illinois marina company who claimed that their business was disparaged on the show. Lemonis was not a party to these settlements.

Stephen Marmer, a psychiatrist who has taught at UCLA's School of Medicine, was hired by the attorney Fox on behalf of the companies for the settlement discussions. Marmer wrote in a report how, after interviewing 48 of the business owners or their family members, many described damage to their confidence or self-trust, humiliation in front of vendors or staff, or alienation from family members and business partners.

At least five people said they had been suicidal or engaged in suicidal ideation, according to the report.

""If the narratives presented in these interviews reflect what actually happened to those whom I interviewed, I can see how they were injured and how and why their symptoms arose,"" Marmer concluded. ""Most of them will need ongoing treatment to recover from the PTSD and gaslighting they experienced.""

""I was surprised that CNBC stuck with him as long as they did,"" said Dan Isenhart, a longtime employee at the Southern California wine shop Amazing Grapes, which filed for bankruptcy three years after appearing on the show and was not part of the settlement. ""He caused a lot of heartache for a lot of people.""

For some companies, appearing on ""The Profit"" was a boon. Mike Anderson said revenue for his and his brother's business, now focused on screen printing, is 10 times what it was when they filmed their show. ""It's a night-and-day difference,"" Anderson said.

Another business owner, Ana Quincoces, said her ongoing relationship with Lemonis has been fruitful, including work he directed her way. The two considered opening a restaurant together, she said. Quincoces added that her prior experience with reality TV — she appeared on ""The Real Housewives of Miami"" — may have better prepared her for the experience.

Not all feel the same.

By 2021, Steve Weissmann's business, Tumbleweed Tiny House, was bankrupt, embroiled in litigation it would ultimately lose, and millions of dollars in debt to Lemonis.

In 2017, when Weissmann appeared on ""The Profit,"" he described his business in court documents as successful, making millions in revenue, and meeting with potential investors. ""We were growing at 60 percent compound annual growth rates, which is very successful growth,"" he told Business Insider. ""But we were losing money as we grew too fast.""

He said that he initially applied to be on the show because he was impressed by Lemonis's reputation as a business guru.

On the first day of filming, Lemonis expressed concern at the way Weissmann accounted for customer deposits, Weissmann said.

When Weissmann asked Lemonis what the future of the company looked like to him, Lemonis responded, ""You not going to jail,"" according to a transcript from the taping.

When he went home after filming, Weissmann said he held his wife while they cried, and she vomited. Weissmann, who said that his accounting was above board, said he decided to take the deal offered on-air or risk being called a criminal on TV. The footage never aired.

What did make it to air was Weissmann telling Lemonis, ""I'm running on the edge."" They ultimately verbally agreed to a deal that involved Lemonis loaning $3 million to the business in exchange for 75% ownership. It also involved a radical change to Tumbleweed's business model. Lemonis told Weissmann to move Tumbleweed away from custom builds and toward standard units.

Weissmann told Business Insider he questioned the move — most customers preferred custom models, he said — but agreed.

According to statements in court filings, after the episode aired, Lemonis eventually stopped responding, and Tumbleweed was left with excess inventory from the production of standard units. After months of turning down orders for custom homes, Tumbleweed started to run out of cash, according to statements in court documents. Along the way, Tumbleweed also took on loans of around $2.8 million from a Lemonis company to stay afloat.

Less than three years after appearing on ""The Profit,"" in 2020, Tumbleweed filed for bankruptcy, which Weissmann called ""devastating."" He said he wasn't involved in the $11 million settlement because he was already involved in these proceedings.

A Lemonis company sued Weissmann a year later, seeking the nearly $3 million in principal and interest on loans made to Tumbleweed, for which Weissmann was a guarantor. Lemonis' lawyers argued that the bankruptcy filing had triggered an immediate obligation to pay back the money.

Weissmann responded by filing a counterclaim and then a lawsuit against NBCUniversal, Lemonis, the production company, alleging fraud and breaches of fiduciary duty, among other claims.

The case went to arbitration, as required by the show's participation contract. An arbitrator sided with the defendants, writing ""the weight of the evidence shows that Lemonis was attempting to 'save' Tumbleweed, not have it fail, even if he did not ultimately succeed.""

In early July, a judge confirmed a $14.4 million arbitration award to NBCUniversal, Lemonis, Camping World, and the production company against Weissmann and Tumbleweed, including $7.7 million in attorney fees.

Lemonis and NBCUniversal secured another win in 2023. An arbitrator awarded $7.1 million, including more than $6 million in attorney fees, to NBCUniversal, the production company, and Camping World after the trustee of the bankrupt design firm Precise Graphix lost in arbitration. The arbitrator cited ""the complete failure of competent, credible evidence"" to support the trustee's allegations, which included fraud and breach of contract.

Other business owners allege that Lemonis took advantage of companies he pledged to help, according to interviews and legal records reviewed by Business Insider. Many of the allegations of exploitative business practices were also detailed in a 2018 Inc. Magazine article.

In one 2016 lawsuit, the owners of a Pennsylvania-based restaurant franchise, My Big Fat Greek Gyro, said they applied in hopes of expanding and selling more franchises. While filming, the lawsuit said, they agreed to a deal with Lemonis for $350,000 in exchange for a 55% stake in the business.

Once the cameras were off, the lawsuit alleged, the owners were told to return the check they received from Lemonis, and that it was just a ""prop"" for the show. The owners claimed that they never received the money, and that Lemonis used the promised funds for renovations, changed the businesses' name to The Simple Greek, while ultimately ""freezing"" them out of their business after establishing a new LLC that was owned by a Lemonis company.

""Prior to the show, we were collectively making about $160,000 a year,"" one owner said in a 2022 deposition. ""Eighteen months into the show, we had no income.""

The lawsuit, which alleged, among other things, fraud, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty, is ongoing in state court. Lawyers for Lemonis have called the claims ""baseless,"" arguing he invested millions of dollars to try to ""salvage plaintiffs' floundering business,"" and allegations of misconduct were, in reality, Lemonis ""operating the business pursuant to his undisputed decision-making powers as the controlling owner of The Simple Greek.""

In a 2020 lawsuit filed by the New York company Bowery Kitchen Supplies, the owner alleged that after agreeing to an on-air deal for $350,000 in exchange for 33% of the business, a producer took back the ""prop"" check.

Like the Greek restaurant owners, he alleged that he never received the promised funding, and that Lemonis made drastic changes to the business, including liquidating hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of inventory and shutting down the store for costly renovations, leaving the business deep in debt. The case was later dismissed as part of the 2021 settlement.

At least 10 companies or business owners filed for bankruptcy after appearing on the show, court records show. Another 17 closed down, according to the letters that Fox, the attorney, sent to Comcast.

The 2021 settlement talks were not the first time that participants on the show attempted to notify NBCUniversal about their complaints, according to Fox's letters and other records obtained by Business Insider.

In 2013, a business owner hired an attorney to prevent NBCUniversal from airing their episode, after they said misrepresentations were made during filming, the letters say. The network declined, and the episode came out.

The daughter of a business owner who appeared on the show also said online that her family was humiliated by Lemonis and the production company. The executive producer told her in late 2014 that ""CNBC lawyers had seen the post and were not happy,"" and that she'd be sued by the network if she didn't take it down, the letters said.

That year, the family member of a different business owner wrote to CNBC's president and chairman; NBCUniversal's CEO; and several other network executives. She said the show portrayed her family in a false light and defamed them, according to the letters. In 2015, another owner sent ""a detailed letter"" to NBCUniversal, ""informing them of the fraud and defamation that the show and Lemonis perpetrated on him,"" according to the letters.

While speaking on the ""Shark Tank Podcast"" in 2015, Lemonis said that following one of the episodes, he ""got emails from the family and aunts and uncles and cousins and how upset they were that I had portrayed them that way.""

CNBC aired the show's final episode in September 2021.

Now, as another batch of businesses appear on Fox's ""The Fixer,"" Steve Weissmann says he wishes he'd never said yes to ""The Profit.""

""We have been diminished in a way that we never deserved to be,"" Weissmann told Business Insider. ""I was on a reality television show and made to look like an idiot.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Ford says it expects Trump's tariffs to set it back $2 billion and hand Japanese automakers a 'meaningful' edge","https://www.businessinsider.com/ford-trump-tariffs-cost-2-billion-benefit-japanese-rivals-2025-7","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 04:00:00 GMT","

Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, said on Wednesday that the Trump administration's tariff policy would saddle the automaker with a $2 billion bill while benefiting its Japanese rivals.

""Our tariff bill is $2 billion, and that's a net number,"" Farley said in an earnings call. The company had projected a tariff hit of $1.5 billion in its last quarter.

Farley told analysts he expected automakers to adopt a regional rather than globalized approach toward their businesses. In addition to tariffs, Farley said the change was being driven by the rise of electric vehicles and new carbon regulations.

""We increasingly see Europe, North America, and Asia becoming kind of regional businesses with tariff rates that are aligned for those three or four regions,"" Farley said.

""This is quite a fundamental change,"" he added.

Representatives for Ford did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Farley said in an interview with Bloomberg on the same day that the Trump administration's reduced tariffs on Japan would give its Asian rivals a ""meaningful"" cost advantage. Last week, President Donald Trump said the US would lower its tariffs on Japan to 15% from 25%.

The reduced tariffs, lower labour costs, and favorable exchange rates ""really advantage their export,"" Farley said.

A Kentucky-built Ford Escape could cost $5,000 more than a Japanese-made Toyota Rav4, while a Michigan-made Ford Bronco might be undercut by a Toyota 4Runner to the tune of $10,000, Farley added.

Farley told Bloomberg that Ford was working with the Trump administration to ""minimize our tariff expense so that we can get more competitive.""

""But the bottom line is our plan at Ford is not to compete in those commodity segments,"" he continued.

This isn't the first time Farley has talked about the challenges Ford faces in the face of a new slate of tariffs. Farley said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this year that Trump's 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico was a ""windfall for South Korean and Japanese companies.""

""In our guidance, we can handle a couple of weeks of tariffs. If it goes beyond that, obviously, it will be billions and billions of incremental profit headwinds for the company,"" Farley told the outlet in February.

On Wednesday, Ford's shares fell by nearly 1.6% in after-hours trading. The company's shares are up by 9.8% year to date.

When asked about Farley's remarks, the White House said in a statement to Business Insider that the Trump administration is in ""constant touch with the auto industry.""

""The administration is simultaneously working with our domestic steel, aluminum, and copper industries to ensure that they can meet the needs of American industry by expanding production right here at home,"" Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House, said.

""Revitalizing the American auto, steel, aluminum, and copper industries are not mutually exclusive goals,"" he added.

August 1, 12:00 a.m. — This story has been updated with comments from Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House.

As the scrunch of broken glass cut the silence and blood still glistened on the floor, a distraught Tisch confronted her most challenging moment yet as New York City's police commissioner.

“Tariff king.” A “big abuser” of tariffs. A “very high tariff nation.” US President Donald Trump has made it clear repeatedly over the years what he thinks of India's protectionist trade policies. 

That's put the South Asian country squarely in the firing line of the Trump administration's new reciprocal tariffs. Trump announced a 25% duty on US imports from India — higher than some of its neighbors, such as the 19% levy applied to goods from Pakistan and the 20% tariff on imports from Bangladesh.

OpenAI has secured $8.3 billion in new capital as part of its $40 billion fundraise, according to a person familiar with the transaction. 

The fresh capital comes as the artificial intelligence company's business accelerates. 

Annual recurring revenue jumped to $13 billion, up from $10 billion in June, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential financial information, and is projected to top $20 billion by year-end. 

Paid business users of ChatGPT have climbed to five million from three million just months ago, they said. The round was completed ahead of schedule and was five times oversubscribed.

DealBook was first to report the transaction.

The raise underscores surging investor appetite for AI platforms as competition intensifies among leading model makers.

Dragoneer Investment Group contributed $2.8 billion to the round, the person said, joining Blackstone, TPG, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue, Altimeter, D1 Capital, Tiger Global, and Thrive Capital. 

While Dragoneer was the largest investor in this latest tranche of funding, SoftBank remains the lead backer of the broader $40 billion fundraising effort.

Rivals are also raising massive sums. 

Anthropic, one of OpenAI's chief competitors, is in talks to secure between $3 billion and $5 billion in new funding led by Iconiq Capital at a potential $170 billion valuation, CNBC confirmed. That follows a $3.5 billion round in March that valued the startup at $61.5 billion.

Both OpenAI and Anthropic are courting Middle Eastern capital to finance their ambitions.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently signaled a willingness to reverse his previous stance against Gulf sovereign wealth funds, warning in a leaked memo shared with Wired that it's become ""substantially harder to stay on the frontier"" of AI development without tapping that money. 

OpenAI, meanwhile, is working with Emirati firm G42 to build a massive data center in Abu Dhabi.

Two Federal Reserve officials who voted this week against holding a key interest rate in place explained their decisions Friday, both indicating that the central bank is making a mistake by waiting to ease policy amid rising threats to the labor market.

Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman both said they wanted a quarter percentage point reduction, as they see tariffs having only a temporary impact on inflation. They said staying on hold, as the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee has done since December, poses risks to the economy.

In separate statements, Waller and Bowman laid out their reasons for dissenting, the first time two governors have done so since 1993. The committee voted 9-2 to hold, and the differences of opinion reflect ""a healthy and robust discussion,"" Waller said.

The pair released the statements just prior to a Labor Department report showing that nonfarm payrolls rose by just 73,000 in July, below expectations, while the June and May counts were revised lower by a combined 258,000 and showed virtually no growth for both months.

""There is nothing wrong about having different views about how to interpret incoming data and using different economic arguments to predict how tariffs will impact the economy,"" Waller wrote. ""But, I believe that the wait and see approach is overly cautious, and, in my opinion, does not properly balance the risks to the outlook and could lead to policy falling behind the curve.""

Further, Waller insisted that inflation impacts from President Donald Trump's tariffs have been ""small so far"" and could continue in that vein.

Both he and Bowman — Trump appointees during his first term — did not advocate for the kind of dramatic cuts Trump has pushed. The president has suggested the federal funds rate, which sets a target that banks use for overnight lending but spills over into many other rates, should be as much as 3 percentage points lower.

Waller suggested something more gradual — cutting by as much as 1.5 percentage points, at a slow pace as the committee monitors impacts from policy easing.

Similarly, Bowman backed ""gradual cuts"" as she also said tariffs are having only limited impact on prices. In fact, she said that without the duties, the Fed's key inflation measure would be below 2.5% ""and considerably closer to our 2 percent target.""

""With tariff-related price increases likely representing a one-time effect, it is appropriate to look through temporarily elevated inflation readings,"" said Bowman, who also serves as the Fed's vice chair for bank supervision. ""I see the risk that a delay in taking action could result in a deterioration in the labor market and a further slowing in economic growth.""

Trump has been unrelenting in his criticism of the Fed for not cutting. In a Truth Social post Friday morning, he again tore into the central bank, and Chair Jerome Powell in particular.

""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell, a stubborn MORON, must substantially lower interest rates, NOW. IF HE CONTINUES TO REFUSE, THE BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL, AND DO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HAS TO BE DONE!"" Trump said.

Pharmaceutical firms are scrambling to respond to a fresh ultimatum from U.S. President Donald Trump demanding ""binding commitments"" to lower their drug prices stateside.

The White House said Thursday that President Trump had sent letters to 17 major pharmaceutical firms outlining the steps they must take to lower the price of U.S. prescription drugs to ""most favored nation"" (MFN) levels by Sept. 29.

They were told that if they ""refuse to step up,"" the government will deploy every tool in its ""arsenal to protect American families from continued abusive drug pricing practices,"" without stating what those measures could be.

The companies to receive letters were AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, EMD Serono, Roche's subsidiary Genentech, Gilead, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Regeneron and Sanofi.

Healthcare stocks tumbled Friday, following broader market losses as investors digested Trump's amended trade tariffs. Shares of Wegovy-maker Novo Nordisk dropped 5% in early morning trade before paring losses to trade 1.3% lower at 11:15 a.m. London time (6:15 a.m. ET).

Companies were informed that they must provide MFN prices to all Medicaid patients, the U.S. health program for low-income patients.

They were also told not to offer medicines to other developed markets at better prices than those offered in the U.S., and that they should sell drugs directly to U.S. patients, thereby cutting out pharmacy middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).

Trump has long lambasted pharmaceutical firms for what he dubs are unfair pricing practices, previously saying that he planned to bring down U.S. prices by 80%.

In May, the president signed an executive order to lower drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad under the MFN policy.

The U.S. consistently pays the most in the world for many prescription drugs, due in part to the U.S.′ highly complex and fragmented reimbursement system and lack of national pricing control.

The latest announcement comes as the pharmaceutical industry is also calling for clarity on potential industry-wide tariffs. Trump previously warned these could run as high as 200%.

Many companies have nevertheless shared that they agree with some of Trump's concerns.

AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said Tuesday that the Anglo-Swedish firm had been liaising closely with the U.S. administration over the MFN policy and investment in U.S. manufacturing more broadly. Last week, it announced plans to invest $50 billion in the U.S., following a slew of other pharma firms.

""There are issues around prices. I personally believe the president is right to say price equalization should happen,"" Soriot told reporters on an earnings call.

Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Swiss-headquartered Novartis, said last month that the firm was pursuing an MFN policy to lower U.S. drug prices.

A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, meanwhile, said that the company was ""focused on improving patient access and affordability"" and that it would ""continue to work to find solutions that help people access the medication they need.""

JPMorgan analysts said in a note Friday that while the latest announcement was intended to serve as a stark warning, ongoing talks between with the U.S. administration could buy pharma firms some time to respond.

""While the government's latest announcement may appear harsh, we think it is likely that the matter is being discussed to some extent between the companies and the government, and we believe no changes that would have a significant negative impact on pharmaceutical companies will occur in the short term,"" analysts led by Seiji Wakao said in a note to clients.

Ray Dalio, founder of one of the biggest hedge funds Bridgewater, has dumped his remaining shares in the firm and stepped aside from its board.

Bridgewater completed the final sale of Dalio's equity shares, wrapping up his management transition started in 2022, according to a person familiar with the matter. Dalio will continue to be a significant investor in Bridgewater's strategies and a mentor, the person said.

The billionaire has been selling his equity for years. To facilitate the final transition of his ownership, Bridgewater raised capital from existing investors and employees. Co-CIOs Bob Prince and Greg Jensen are two significant equity holders, the person said.

""We share our congratulations to Ray – he will always be our cherished founder, is a mentor to many, and remains a longstanding client with significant investments in Bridgewater's strategies,"" Bridgewater CEO Nir Bar Dea and Co-Chair Mike McGavick said in a July 21 letter to clients seen by CNBC. ""Ray has always described the transition as a 'dream come true' and we're excited to have made it a reality together.""

The Wall Street Journal first reported Dalio's stake sale. The founder seemingly confirmed the transition in a LinkedIn post.

Dalio, who founded Bridgewater in 1975, has focused on macro strategies, such as trading currency and fixed income markets based on economic trends. Dalio stepped down as Bridgewater's chief executive officer in 2017 and chairman at the end of 2021.

""I have been asked a lot about how I feel about passing along Bridgewater after having started and built it over the last 50 years,"" Dalio said in the LinkedIn post. ""I am thrilled about it because I love seeing Bridgewater alive and well without me — even better than alive and well with me.""

Bridgewater enjoyed solid gains in the first half of 2025, with its Pure Alpha fund up 17% and its All Weather fund rising 8%, the person said.

President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" includes trillions of dollars of tax breaks, including a new charitable deduction for most filers — and there's an easy way to maximize it, experts say.

When filing taxes, you claim the greater of your itemized tax breaks or the standard deduction. But 90% of filers don't itemize, according to the latest IRS data, which means they can't take the charitable deduction.

This changes in 2026 with a new charitable tax break for non-itemizers, worth up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married couples filing jointly. The deduction only applies to cash gifts.

""This is a big deal,"" said Justin Miller, partner and national director of wealth planning at Evercore Wealth Management.

Trump's new charitable deduction is similar to a temporary measure enacted during the pandemic, which was worth up to $300 for single filers or $600 for joint filers for 2021. Roughly 48 million filers claimed that deduction on their 2021 returns, according to IRS data.

With a bigger charitable deduction coming for non-itemizers in 2026, here are some key things to know, according to financial experts.

If you don't itemize deductions and plan on making a smaller year-end charitable gift this year, you might reconsider the timing if there is flexibility, experts say.

""It seems like a no-brainer to just do it in January and capture a little benefit that you wouldn't otherwise achieve,"" said certified financial planner Edward Jastrem, chief planning officer at Heritage Financial Services in Westwood, Massachusetts.

By donating funds in 2026 rather than 2025, you could be eligible for the new charitable deduction for non-itemizers. Of course, you should consider whether it aligns with your overall financial planning strategy.

""I would caution all taxpayers claiming these deductions that they still need to keep appropriate records,"" Miller said.

Gifts of any amount require a bank record or written receipt from the organization, including the charity name, amount and date of the contribution, according to the IRS.

If you donate $250 or more, you need what's known as a ""contemporaneous written acknowledgement,"" or CWA, with further detail from the organization.

You must have the CWA on or before the earlier of:

""If you are ever audited, and you don't get that letter, you can't fix it,"" which could disallow the deduction, Miller said.

Joby Aviation and defense manufacturing giant L3Harris announced a partnership Friday to develop a next-generation military craft that can be piloted or fly autonomously.

The partnership brings together Joby's hybrid vertical take-off and landing, or VTOL, aircraft and L3's expertise in military systems and certification.

The companies expect to begin testing this fall, followed by operational demonstrations in 2026, according to the release.

""Conflicts like Russia, Ukraine, are really changing how people think about, you know, low altitude aviation generally,"" Joby executive chairman Paul Sciarra told CNBC's Morgan Brennan. ""Getting something out there that can move very quickly from demonstration to deployability felt especially important.""

Jon Rambeau, president of Integrated Mission Systems at L3Harris, said initially the project will focus on use cases like airborne surveillance, reconnaissance and contested logistics applications.

""We're going to target ... the broader government exercises that the military services hold periodically, and see if we can fit some of those use cases into those larger exercises,"" Rambeau told Brennan.

The announcement comes as government spending is under scrutiny and the U.S. military works to bolster the technology in battlefield operations, adding artificial intelligence with autonomous vehicles and drones.

""I think the branches are questioning whether or not you know the right approach for low altitude support is, you know, $30 million crude Apaches, or whether or not it's something that is smaller, cheaper and autonomous — it has the ability to adapt to flexible payloads,"" Sciarra said.

Joby is known for its commercial air taxis, which are electric. The company delivered its first electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft to the United Arab Emirates at the end of June, where it is working toward a 2026 launch.

The new military vehicle with L3, based on Joby's S4 craft, will be developed with a gas turbine, according to the release.

Joby, which is still working on Federal Aviation Administration approval for its aircraft, recently announced an expansion of manufacturing and hopes to double production at its California hub.

Shares of Joby are up more than 100% this year. L3Harris stock is up 30% so far in 2025.

The world's most popular cryptocurrency is being outdone by its closest competitor in the last few weeks.

Bitcoin has rallied to record highs this year, but its more recent performance has lagged behind ethereum. Ethereum's price is up 54% over the last month, compared to bitcoin's 10% increase.

Zack Shapiro, an attorney at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, told BI there were a handful of reasons ethereum has pulled ahead. 

""I think a lot of it is that it's a speculation trade,"" he said of ethereum's latest rally. ""Long term, we have to see.""

Here are some of the things Shapiro thinks are driving the fervor for ethereum.

Markets are enthusiastic about stablecoins after the passing of the GENIUS Act, the Senate's landmark bill that sets the terms surrounding stablecoin regulation and opens the door for more issuers to mint their own fiat-backed tokens.

Tether, USD Coin, Binance USD, and other top stablecoins on the crypto market are issued on the Ethereum network.

""People think that stablecoins might proliferate a lot more. Maybe some of those stablecoins will be on ethereum,"" Shapiro said of the market's psychology.

Retail giants like Walmart and Amazon are reportedly considering their own stablecoins, and using the tokens for retail payments would be a ""big breakthrough"" for the market, according to Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk.

Shapiro says institutional investors have also recently offered ethereum ETFs, another factor driving inflows into the token.

BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are among the firms that now offer a spot ethereum ETF.

BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF is up 48.9% over the last month. Fidelity's Ethereum Fund is up 33.1%, while Grayscale's Ethereum Mini Trust ETF is up 49.2% over that time frame.

Cumulative spot ethereum ETF volumes rose to $123.5 billion as of Wednesday, according to data compiled by The Block.

Corporate crypto treasuries have also proliferated in 2025, and recently, many have been scooping up ethereum.

Bitmine Immersion, one such crypto treasury, said last week it raised its ethereum holdings to over $2 billion.

The Ether Machine, another crypto treasury firm, said on Wednesday that its total ethereum holdings had climbed to $56.9 million.

""Those vehicles are out there buying ethereum. And so that could also be additional buy-pressure that's moving up the price,"" Shapiro said.

Shapiro isn't certain that the momentum will last for ethereum. He believes much of the hype for the coin in recent weeks has to do with excitement and uncertainty over ethereum's potential catalysts.

The crypto's rally could lose steam once more regulatory details are solidified, he said. He pointed in particular to the CLARITY Act, the crypto market structure bill that's awaiting approval in Congress.

""Is the market structure bill going to pass? Are these sort of crypto primitives going to find product market fit in the market? And then is Ethereum, as opposed to other blockchain systems, going to be the winner from that?"" Shapiro said. ""I would personally probably sell the news.""

Oops, something went wrong

Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) executive chairman Michael Saylor has doubled down on the company's Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) Bitcoin acquisition strategy.

What Happened: Speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Friday, Saylor emphasized that Bitcoin is ""digital capital"" and highlighted that Strategy's business model revolves around acquiring BTC and issuing structured credit products — including preferred stock, backed by it.

He dismissed concerns about the size of Strategy's position, arguing that owning even up to 7% of the total Bitcoin supply is not excessive, especially for a public company leading the way in digital asset treasury management.

Strategy now holds 628,791 BTC, or roughly 3% of Bitcoin's total fixed supply, valued far above acquisition levels.

Saylor underlined the firm's disciplined, long-term BTC accumulation strategy.

He forecasted that Bitcoin could deliver a 30% annual return over the next 20 years, outpacing traditional assets.

""We don't want to own all the Bitcoin, we're just part of the first wave,"" Saylor said, referencing over 160 public companies now integrating BTC into their balance sheets.

Saylor further argued that once regulation catches up, even tech giants like Apple and Microsoft will opt to hold Bitcoin over fiat, treasuries or gold.

When asked about his signature orange tie, Saylor quipped, ""The future is orange, Joe.""

Why It Matters: Strategy just reported its strongest quarterly profit ever, bolstered by Bitcoin's rally and growing investor interest in BTC-backed structured products.

Its latest offering, a $2.5 billion issue of Bitcoin-linked securities, is the largest IPO of 2025 so far, showing deep market demand.

The company also launched product lines like ""Strike"" and ""Stretch"", designed to cater to various investor risk profiles, from leveraged Bitcoin equity to principal-protected, yield-generating instruments.

For Q2, Strategy posted $114.49 million in revenue, exceeding forecasts of $112.96 million, for a year-over-year growth of 2.7% and a BTC yield of 19.7%.

The price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies wavered on Friday as investors weighed the White House's latest round of tariffs against fresh signs of a weakening U.S. labor market.

Bitcoin was recently changing hands around $115,500, a 2.1% decrease over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Ethereum fell 3.8% to $3,630, while XRP and Solana showed similar losses at $3.05 and $169, respectively.

Stock indices swooned, with the S&P 500 falling 1.5% midday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled over 570 points.

On Thursday night, the Trump administration refreshed rates for over 60 countries, indicating in an executive order that a new round of sweeping levies would go into effect on Aug. 07 at 12:01 a.m., as opposed to a self-imposed deadline on Friday that was previously in place.

The U.S. hiked levies on Canadian imports to 35% from 25%, although goods brought in under a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada are exempt. Brazil was among countries facing the steepest levies at 50%. The administration signaled it was still open to negotiating.

Twists and turns in U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policy gripped markets months ago, but attention faded as the administration inked 90-day extensions with scores of nations. 

A tariff reprieve established between the U.S. and China expires on Aug. 12, but on CNBC Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the U.S. has “the makings of a deal” with the country's largest trading partner following trade talks in Stockholm, Sweden.

The U.S. economy added 73,000 jobs in July as the unemployment rate stayed flat at 4.2%, the U.S. Labor Department said on Friday. Alongside cooler-than-expected job growth, the government revised figures for May and June, wiping away 258,000 jobs.

In May and June, the U.S. added only 19,000 and 14,000 jobs, respectively, as opposed to 144,000 and 147,000 jobs detailed in the initial reports, according to Trading Economics.

The report indicated that the headline unemployment rate could be masking weakness in the underlying U.S. labor market, days after officials at the Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady for a fifth straight meeting at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%.

Despite months of pressure from Trump to lower rates, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank wasn't committed to cutting rates in September. Fed Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller dissented during the meeting, the first time that two members of the Federal Open Market Committee broke away from the group since 1993.

Traders penciled in an 78% chance on Friday that the Fed cuts rates at its next meeting, up from 37% a day before, per CME FedWatch. Matt Mena, a research analyst at crypto asset manager 21Shares told Decrypt that growing certainty toward cuts will likely benefit crypto.

“Now that rate cuts are back on the table for the next Fed meeting, liquidity conditions may open up again—a powerful tailwind for risk assets like crypto,” he said. “If a Fed cut becomes all but guaranteed, Bitcoin could quickly propel toward $125K.”

London, United Kingdom, August 1st, 2025, Chainwire



Powered by $HAMIE tokenomics and Abstract Chain, the game marks a major step in the platform's mission to transform digital culture.

The Hamieverse, a purpose-driven Web3 ecosystem combining gaming, AI mentorship, and immersive storytelling, announced today the development of its first on-chain game, to be built on Abstract Chain. The new game represents a major milestone in Hamieverse's mission to fuse entertainment with self-development and real-world impact.

The upcoming title is designed to merge immersive storytelling with blockchain-powered gameplay, drawing from the rich lore of the Hamieverse comic series and forthcoming novel. Built on Abstract Chain, the game leverages the platform's robust front-end and back-end capabilities to deliver a seamless user experience.

“Every day, billions run in circles chasing progress that never comes. Buried in debt, drained by meaningless jobs, and starved of purpose, we've accepted the trap. Hamie was born to shatter it,” said Mateen Mohammed, the Hamieverse's founder.

Purpose-Driven Gaming in Web3

In contrast to many blockchain games criticized for unbalanced mechanics, the Hamieverse is committed to fair, skill-based systems that reward strategy, learning, and consistent engagement.

Each gameplay element connects to a four-stage philosophical framework representing personal transformation and the Hamieverse's ethos:

To support this journey, Hamie AI functions as a personal digital mentor, offering mindset support, tailored insights, and behavioral tools to accelerate progress.

Built on Abstract Chain

The decision to build on Abstract Chain was guided by a shared belief that solving blockchain's user experience problem will finally bring mass adoption. “We chose Abstract because it aligns perfectly with both our vision and our standards,” said the Hamieverse founder. “Our goal is to create meaningful, engaging, and accessible experiences. Abstract's tech stack allows us to onboard Web2 without friction or pain points. We're not just launching on a blockchain, we're aligning with a movement.”

Tokenomics Designed for Integrity

The Hamieverse ecosystem will be powered by the $HAMIE token, with a model intentionally designed to prioritize contribution over speculation. Features include:

August Launches and Real-World Impact

The first on-chain game is part of a broader August release slate that includes:

Meanwhile, the Hamieverse Foundation has broken ground on its most ambitious mission yet: a solar-powered deepwater well in rural Africa, bringing sustainable clean water to over 2,000 people. This project exemplifies the belief that digital culture can produce real-world positive impact.

“I was drawn to the blockchain space over eight years ago, inspired by a groundbreaking technology that promised to reshape the world for the better,” said the Hamieverse founder. “It spoke of decentralizing power, enabling radical transparency, resisting censorship, and banking the unbanked. But by 2024, much of the mindshare had shifted to the trenches, which became the Wild West for bad actors exploiting retail. Hope began to fade. So I set out to build something fundamentally different, rooted in real utility, unshakable transparency, real-world impact, and technology designed to empower self-development. It all began with one image: a hamster spinning endlessly on a wheel. It's the best metaphor for modern life.”

About The Hamieverse

Hamieverse is a Web3 ecosystem designed to help users break free from the psychological and financial traps of modern life through immersive gaming, multi-dimensional storytelling, gamified self-development, and AI-powered mentorship.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

Even as crypto finds growing traction on Wall Street and among retail investors, few people regard the blockchain technology that powers it as useful or relevant to their day-to-day lives. A crypto startup called Subzero Labs wants to change this, and it plans to launch its own blockchain designed for use beyond just speculation.

“We're doing something for the real-world users,” Ade Adepoju, cofounder and CEO of Subzero Labs, told Fortune.





The startup announced Friday that it had raised $20 million in a seed round led by the crypto investment firm Pantera Capital. Other participants included the crypto venture capital company Variant, the venture arm of Coinbase, and the crypto desk of the high-frequency trading firm Susquehanna.





Adepoju declined to detail his startup's valuation. The deal, which closed in the first quarter of the year, was for equity and token warrants, or allocations of a yet-to-be-released cryptocurrency, he said. 





Adepoju, who is 30 years old and lives in New York City, is a longtime engineer. Early in his career, he worked at the chipmaker AMD, moved over to the laptop giant Dell, and then got a job at the streaming titan Netflix. In 2021, he decided to take the plunge into crypto when he joined the startup Mysten Labs as an engineer.




Founded by former Meta developers, Mysten Labs is one of the main companies behind the Sui blockchain, whose tech stems from Mark Zuckerberg's failed attempt to launch his own stablecoin. Adepoju helped build Sui from conception to launch, but, in early 2024, he took a career break. “I wanted to take a step back and observe what it meant to make a network actually successful,” he said.





As he pondered his next move, he linked up with his cofounder Lu Zhang, also a former employee of Mysten Labs, and decided to get into the business of launching his own blockchain. Together, the two created Subzero Labs, which currently has 20 employees.





Some might argue that, at a time when there are dozens of active blockchain projects, the world is not exactly clamoring for another one. In response, Adepoju argues that none are good enough yet to run real-world applications. “When you actually ask, ‘do we need another one?' it's like asking, ‘do we need another iPod?'” he said. “No, we don't, but we definitely need an iPhone.”





He's hoping his new blockchain, dubbed Rialo, will be that iPhone. An acronym, Rialo stands for “Rialo isn't a layer 1.” Layer-1 blockchains are like Ethereum, which is a decentralized network of servers that processes and stores data. Layer 2s are blockchains built on top of layer-1 blockchains.





Adepoju says Rialo isn't a layer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In fact, he's reluctant to compare it to any existing crypto products. He does say the blockchain is designed for non-crypto developers and that it allows engineers to replicate tools usually implemented outside a blockchain. These include the ability to access information, like a FICO score, elsewhere on the internet without the need of an oracle, or outside data provider.




“Cameras used to ship with laptops. They used to be separate,” he said, referring to external video cameras people used to connect to their computers in the early 2000s. “They got bundled. These things happen with every technology.”

FedEx is the latest client to adopt JP Morgan's Kinexys Digital Payments, a blockchain-based bank account solution. Kinexys enables corporate treasury departments to instantly move money between JP Morgan branches 24/7 in dollars, euros and pounds. It also provides greater control to the treasurer, because the payments are programmable. 

The global courier giant is using blockchain payments in conjunction with JP Morgan's notional pooling service, which enables group subsidiaries to have free overdrafts provided another subsidiary has an offsetting positive bank balance – without requiring actual balance transfers between entities.

While JP Morgan has announced several Kinexys clients in financial services, fewer corporate clients have publicly disclosed their participation. In 2021 Siemens was the first customer to announce it was using the solution, then called JPM Coin. It was also the first to announce it was using programmable payments when that functionality was added.

On the financial services front, some of the Kinexys Digital Payments clients that have been disclosed include …

ByAaron Stanley,

 Contributor. 

Despite their obvious applicability, social currencies have yet to be fully-explored in the context of blockchain use cases.

The last crypto cycle saw a variety of experimentation with the concept, but these attempts ran into product-market fit and regulatory barriers, and thus have not ascended into the mainstream consciousness.

Builders in Brazil, however, think they have the right ingredients to deploy blockchain-based social currencies in the real world, specifically in communities that already have a tradition of adopting such alternatives

A new partnership between Chainlink, Plexos Institute and the EDinheiro Insitute aims to bring greater financial services to underserved communities in the country by introducing a blockchain layer on top of these existing social currency networks.

Social currencies have been around as long as human civilization, and are typically designed for acceptance and usage by specific people for specific purposes within a specific geographic region or online community.

Think “dining dollars” issued to college students as part of a meal plan, where students can redeem the funds for meals on campus or at participating restaurants in the neighborhood, but can't spend them in the next town over.

Yet, while blockchain technology makes it quite simple to mint, transfer and burn currencies (anyone with basic skills can launch a new token on Ethereum or Solana), we haven't seen too much real world experimentation vis-a-vis other types of blockchain applications.

Early social token platforms like Roll and Rally let creators launch their own tokens to reward followers and incentivize engagement. While these platforms achieved some success, they ultimately didn't pan out due to regulatory and product-market fit issues.

Other projects like Friends with Benefits and Seed Club have also experimented with social tokens with a community governance function.

Crypto media company CoinDesk experimented with a social token of its own called DESK in 2021-22. The token functioned as a loyalty reward for participation in activities at CoinDesk conferences, and could be redeemed for NFTs and other types of swag and exclusive access.

Can blockchain-based social tokens find a home in the “real world”? Local builders in Brazil think so.

That's because Brazil is already home to more than 180 social currency experiments that have been ongoing over the last 30 years. These have been facilitated by the EDinheiro Institute - a platform that allows communities to issue and redeem currencies with a baked-in legal framework.

These currencies are used to distribute social aid and benefits, promote local commerce, stimulate cash-scarce local economies and provide financial access to persons and businesses at the fringes of the traditional banking system.

Camila Rioja, President of the Plexos Institute, is leading the initiative to introduce blockchain into these existing currency networks, which, importantly, come with pre-existing consumers and merchants.

For its first experiment, Plexos, alongside Chainlink and EDinheiro, is creating a new blockchain-based social currency called Aratu in Indiaroba, a small community in Brazil's northeast region.

Rioja told me that the social currency concept makes sense in this scenario because the model has already been proven out locally:

Unlike speculative crypto tokens, Aratu and Brazil's other social currencies are pegged 1:1 to the Brazilian real, governed by local municipalities, supported by local banks, and designed with legal structures that prioritize community autonomy.

Revenues generated through transaction fees - typically 2–3% - are reinvested into local funds rather than extracted by global payment processors.

“This is money that stays in the community. It's not flowing out to Visa or Mastercard,” Rioja explained.

If the existing system works fine, why introduce blockchain into the equation?

The simple layer is that blockchain adds new layers of transparency and efficiency. In this case, Chainlink's Runtime Environment acts as a secure connective tissue that enables features like automated reporting, compliance with Brazil's data protection laws, and potentially new forms of community governance on how funds are distributed to the community.

Thomas Trepanier, Head of Business Development LATAM & Canada at Chainlink Labs, said in a statement that Chainlink is uniquely able to bring transparency, accessibility, and connectivity to Brazil's social currencies.

João Joaquim, Coordinator at EDinheiro Institute, echoed that:

Adding a blockchain layer onto these social currency systems ultimately opens the door for more programmability and advanced products enabled by smart contracts, Rioja explained:

Community currencies are already distributing benefits like housing support and food subsidies, but “with blockchain, we can track those flows, validate them publicly, and start thinking about new financial primitives: credit pools, microloans, or even real estate financing.”

Legal frameworks currently dictate how funds are paid out, however, so any advanced use cases like these would require legislative reforms, but blockchain integration is the first step towards these objectives.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Three years after OpenSea's former Head of Product, Nathaniel Chastain, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on insider trading charges, a U.S. court has overturned his conviction.

Reuters reported that the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Chastain's conviction as “erroneous jury instructions could have led to his conviction merely for acting unethically, by misusing information that had no real value to his employer.”

Chastain was charged in 2022 for using insider knowledge to purchase non-fungible token (NFT) collections that would be featured on OpenSea's homepage ahead of time, and then selling them for a profit. He was convicted in May 2023.

According to The Block, Chastain claimed that OpenSea's current CEO, Devin Finzer, acted in a similar manner by purchasing MATIC, now POL, ahead of the platform's Polygon NFT integration, but no evidence was shared to back up this claim.

Finzer did not immediately respond to The Defiant's request for comment.

The news comes as OpenSea gears up for its long-awaited token launch, which still does not have a set date. However, the legacy NFT platform has released numerous updates surrounding its XP points system, which is presumed to determine early users' token allocations.

Today, OpenSea announced via Discord that it will begin banning accounts that are flagged for sybil activity over the coming weeks. Such activity refers to one user operating multiple connected wallets in order to game an expected airdrop and boost their token allocations. 

The NFT market is also heating up, led by CryptoPunks, which now boast a 52 ETH ($195,000) floor price. Other popular collections, such as Moonbirds, are surging as well, trading above 2 ETH after dropping as low as 0.3 ETH in 2024. The collection's floor price reached as high as 40 ETH in the 2021 NFT bull market.

A DIVIDED federal appeals court has overturned the fraud conviction of a former product manager at OpenSea, the world's largest marketplace for non-fungible tokens, in what prosecutors called the first insider trading case involving digital assets.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan agreed with Nathaniel Chastain that erroneous jury instructions could have led to his conviction merely for acting unethically, by misusing information that had no real value to his employer.

Washington D.C., Aug. 1, 2025 —




The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that its Crypto Task Force will host a series of roundtables across the country to provide opportunities for additional stakeholders to meet with Commissioner Hester Peirce, who leads the Crypto Task Force.

“We want to hear from people who were not able to travel for the roundtables that took place this past spring in Washington, D.C. and may not have had a voice in past policymaking efforts,” said Commissioner Peirce. “The Crypto Task Force is acutely aware that any regulatory framework will have far-reaching effects, and we want to ensure that our outreach is as comprehensive as possible.”

The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) warns consumers about the company FinXToro and the services it is offering. According to information available to BaFin, the company is offering banking business and/or financial services on its website finxtoro.org without the required authorisation. The company is not supervised by BaFin.

DraftKings Inc., the leading sports betting company, has officially received final court approval for its $10 million settlement with NFT buyers, marking the resolution of a legal dispute surrounding allegations that its nonfungible tokens (NFTs) violated securities laws.

In a ruling issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Denise J. Casper of the District of Massachusetts granted final approval of the deal, stating it is “in all respects, fair, reasonable, and adequate to the settlement class.” The approval brings closure to a case filed by lead plaintiff Justin Dufoe, who alleged that DraftKings' NFTs constituted unregistered securities and led to financial losses for purchasers.

Under the DraftKings $10M deal NFT buyers final approval settlement, approximately 26% of the midpoint of estimated damages—ranging between $18 million and $58 million—will be recovered by eligible class members.

The court also approved attorney fees totaling over $3.33 million, along with nearly $53,000 for litigation expenses. Dufoe was awarded a $50,000 service award in recognition of his role in the case.

Filed in early 2023, the lawsuit claimed DraftKings' NFT drops gave purchasers a reasonable expectation of profits, based on the company's continued control of the platform and marketplace. Plaintiffs contended that the inability to move NFTs off the DraftKings platform left them entirely reliant on the company's management—meeting the criteria of the Howey Test, which determines whether a product qualifies as a security.

While DraftKings sought to dismiss the suit, arguing the NFTs did not meet the definition of securities, Judge Casper denied the motion in July 2024, allowing the case to proceed and ultimately leading to this settlement.

Attorneys representing the NFT buyers included firms Berman Tabacco, Kirby McInerney LLP, Hannafan & Hannafan Ltd., and G. Dowd Law LLC. DraftKings was represented by WilmerHale and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP.

How many times have you seen a presale token launch, explode 100x, and thought, “I should have bought early”? TreeHouse is the latest reminder of how brutal it feels to miss out. Early buyers saw massive gains, while those who joined late watched prices collapse 45% in a single day. Now, another golden chance is here with BlockchainFX ($BFX), a limited-time presale under $0.02 that analysts say could reach $1+ in 2025.

Act Fast – Presale Bonus BLOCK30 Is Ending Soon. Secure Extra $BFX Tokens Before It's Gone.

BlockchainFX isn't just another speculative token. It's a fully functional super app merging crypto, stocks, forex, and commodities with thousands of active users. With millions in trading volume, up to 70% of platform fees going directly to holders, and a 500x growth projection, this presale could be the early-stage opportunity you've been waiting for. Don't make the same mistake you made with TreeHouse. The window to join before the public listing is closing fast.

BlockchainFX is rewriting what a top crypto presale looks like. Unlike most early-stage tokens, BFX is already live and generating revenue. The presale price is locked at $0.017, while the confirmed launch price is $0.05. That's an instant 3x before it even hits major exchanges. Post-launch, experts project $1+ as adoption surges.

Staking is already active with up to 90% APY, meaning early buyers earn passive USDT income before public trading begins. 70% of trading fees flow back to participants daily, making BFX one of the first truly passive income cryptos. Over $4.34 million has been raised from 3,672 early participants, and ETH whales are rushing in. The BLOCK30 promo code gives 30% bonus tokens, plus a $100,000 prize pool for top buyers—but only for a short time.

Missed Solana's presale at $0.20? Skipped Polygon when it was $0.01? BlockchainFX could be that same 100x moment. Secure your tokens now before presale bonuses end.

Turn a Small Investment Into 100x Gains – Join the Best Token Presale 2025 and Buy $BFX Now.

TreeHouse ($TREE) shows how timing can make or break crypto gains. Currently trading at $0.5877 after a 45% crash, TreeHouse went from $1.28 highs to heavy sell-offs driven by uncertainty around Binance's airdrop revival. With a $91.75M market cap and $400M in daily trading volume, many late buyers are stuck in losses.

This is exactly why early presale access matters. TreeHouse launched strong, but anyone who waited for public markets paid the price. BlockchainFX gives you the chance to buy early—before price volatility, before listings. The presale is where 100x wealth is built. Join today while the $0.017 entry is still open.

Don't Watch BlockchainFX Rally Like TreeHouse or SPK – Grab Your $BFX Presale Allocation Today.

Opportunities like this don't come twice. TreeHouse reminded everyone how late buying can destroy profits. BlockchainFX offers a rare entry point before listing with 70% fee-sharing rewards, 90% APY staking, and a Binance-meets-Robinhood style platform already proven in the market.

This isn't a whitepaper gamble. It's a working super app with massive future revenue projections: $30M in 2025 climbing to $1.8B by 2030. Analysts say a 500x price explosion is realistic as user growth surges from 220K to 25M.

Don't wait for $1+ headlines. Join the BlockchainFX presale today and lock in one of 2025's next 100x crypto opportunities before bonuses and allocation vanish.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has published new guidance to help organisations disclose documents securely following a number of serious data breaches, including at the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).

The ICO's guidance includes practical steps and how-to videos to help organisations understand how to check documents, including spreadsheets, for hidden personal information and reduce the risk of a data breach, particularly in Freedom of Information (FoI) requests.

“Personal information can be hidden or not immediately visible in documents. If they are not checked properly, it may be disclosed by accident – sometimes with serious consequences,” said the ICO.

Last year the ICO fined the PSNI £750,000 for exposing the personal information of its entire workforce, leaving many fearing for their safety.

The regulator's investigation found that simple-to-implement procedures could have prevented the serious breach, in which hidden data on a spreadsheet released as part of a FoI request revealed the surnames, initials, ranks and roles of all 9,483 PSNI officers and staff.

Emily Keaney, Deputy Commissioner at the ICO, said: “We have seen a number of serious data breaches, including at the PSNI and the Ministry of Defence, which have involved documents being disclosed without proper checks for hidden personal information – this crucial step cannot be missed.

“All organisations must have robust measures in place to protect the personal information they hold and prevent it from being inadvertently disclosed. We are committed to providing clear guidance to help organisations get this right, reducing the margin for mistakes and making it second nature to check documents for hidden personal information.”

The new guidance is the regulator's most current and comprehensive resource on avoiding accidental data breaches when disclosing documents to the public, replacing an advisory note issued in the immediate aftermath of high-profile data breaches in 2023.

It includes simple checklists and how-to videos, covering topics such as:

The ICO is engaging directly with key stakeholders, including the Government, to increase visibility of the guidance among those who need it.

While the guidance is designed to support organisations with disclosing documents to the public, the practical advice will also help all organisations avoid accidental data breaches in any situation where they are disclosing or sharing documents.

The Information Commissioner's Office has issued guidance to help organisations disclose documents securely after serious data breaches, including at the Ministry of Defence.

The regulator said the new guidance is its “most comprehensive resource on avoiding accidental data breaches when disclosing documents to the public, replacing an advisory note issued in the immediate aftermath of high-profile data breaches in 2023”.

The ICO also said it is engaging directly with key stakeholders, including the UK and devolved governments, to increase visibility of the guidance amongst those who need it.

Emily Keaney, deputy commissioner at the ICO, said: “We have seen a number of serious data breaches, including at the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Ministry of Defence, which have involved documents being disclosed without proper checks for hidden personal information – this crucial step cannot be missed.

“All organisations must have robust measures in place to protect the personal information they hold and prevent it from being inadvertently disclosed. We are committed to providing clear guidance to help organisations get this right, reducing the margin for mistakes and making it second nature to check documents for hidden personal information.”

In 2023, the ICO took action against the MoD for its poor handling of sensitive information in relation to the evacuation from Afghanistan. It fined the MoD £350,000 for a 2021 email related to the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy programme, in which hundreds of Afghans eligible for evacuation were identified to each other by the sender using the “cc” rather than the “bcc” field.

More recently, it was revealed that an MoD employee accidentally shared the data of more than 18,000 Afghans seeking relocation to the UK through the ARAP scheme.

In a blog published earlier this month, information commissioner John Edwards said the root cause of the error was ""the emailing of a spreadsheet containing hidden data that was not evident to the individual sending it"".

""We understand that person thought they were sending a limited data set to an external party for a legitimate operational reason under the pressures of a military operation,"" he said. ""A much greater data set was inadvertently shared, a section of which eventually ended up online.”

Edwards said inadvertently sharing data in this way “is not a new or novel issue” but is one that organisations “must guard against because the consequences, as in this case, can be severe.

“For many years, the ICO has identified and communicated the risks associated with storing and transmitting data in spreadsheets through guidance, commentary, advice, and in enforcement decisions,” he said. “Just last year we fined the Police Service of Northern Ireland £750,000 for sending a spreadsheet to a public facing website in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.”

The ICO chose not to issue a fine in this case. Edwards explained that the ICO had ""applied considerable resource"" over the last two years to understand what happened, how it happened and what the MoD was doing to ensure it would not happen again.

He said the ICO ""determined that there was little we could add in this case that would justify the further allocation of resource away from other priorities.

""In making that call, we have not lost sight of the fact the MoD undoubtedly got things wrong, and the consequences have been serious,"" he added. ""Organisations must do better to ensure mistakes like this don't happen and understand the serious implications to people's lives if they get it wrong.

""We recognise that there are issues of public confidence and accountability, and that we possess specific skills which other accountability bodies might wish to call on in order to gain the reassurance of a formal investigation. We remain willing to have those conversations with relevant stakeholders.""

From handling Freedom of Information requests to responding to Subject Access Requests, public bodies regularly need to disclose documents containing large amounts of information to the public.

Personal information can be hidden or not immediately visible in documents, and if they are not checked properly, it may be disclosed by accident – sometimes with serious consequences.

The new guidance contains practical steps and how-to videos to help organisations understand how to check documents, including spreadsheets, for hidden personal information and reduce the risk of a data breach.

It includes simple checklists and how-to videos, covering topics such as:

While the guidance is designed to support organisations with disclosing documents to the public, the ICO said the practical advice ""will also help all organisations avoid accidental data breaches in any situation where they are disclosing or sharing documents"".

Described as a digital form of cash issued by the central bank, a CBDC would serve as a complement to existing payment options such as mobile money and bank cards. 

The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR ) has confirmed that it is actively exploring the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as part of its broader strategy to promote financial inclusion and digital innovation.

Described as a digital form of cash issued by the central bank, a CBDC would serve as a complement to existing payment options such as mobile money and bank cards. It would offer added benefits, including faster transactions, secure offline payments, and improved access in areas affected by network disruptions or electricity outages—especially in rural communities.

The Bank has begun conducting a five-month closed-loop proof-of-concept phase with a limited group of participants, including staff from both the central and commercial banks, merchants trialing offline payments, and institutions testing USSD features. The project focuses on understanding user experience, technical feasibility, and potential risks. Areas under examination include cybersecurity, legal frameworks, and the integration of CBDC into Rwanda's existing payment infrastructure.

According to the BNR, four core motivations are driving the CBDC exploration:

Strengthening payment resilience during network or power outages

Promoting innovation and market competition

Accelerating progress toward a cashless economy

Improving the efficiency of cross-border payments

The pilot is expected to conclude in October 2025. However, the central bank clarified that no formal launch is planned at this stage. The findings from the current phase will guide further evaluations and determine whether broader live pilots should be initiated.

This initiative marks a significant milestone in Rwanda's digital finance journey, as the country continues to position itself as a regional leader in inclusive and tech-driven financial systems.

The Pakistan government has recently made another crucial decision to induct crypto into the country's mainstream financial sector. As per the latest reports, the Pakistani authorities are planning to increase the crypto incorporation by commencing official adoption in banking, gold trading, and forex operations.

This development highlights the country says welcome to Web3 technologies in a bold move to bolster its economic status.  This initiative is anticipated to be highly impactful as the country will also allow financial institutions to legally offer crypto services by providing them with licenses.

In this respect, the Pakistan Crypto Council's (PCC) CEO, Bilal Bin Saqib, who is also the 0Prime Minister's Special Assistant on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, shared exclusive thoughts on this development. He mentioned that the Pakistan is moving toward the future of finance. He added that the crypto assets are the currencies that will work in the cutting-edge financial world.

Hence, this move is focused on commencing Pakistan's exclusive epoch of financial sovereignty. Saqib also mentioned that Pakistan plans to gear up for a transparent and secure digital currency ecosystem. Thus, rather than just experimenting, the authorities are laying a robust groundwork to carry out the wider economic shift.

In line with the statement of Saqib, establishing a unique and flawless crypto framework to incorporate crypto assets will be a significant step toward a broader change in the worldwide economy. Apart from that, Jameel Ahmed, the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), also announced a notable development. Thus, he confirmed the start of a pilot project for digital currencies, parallel to the drafting of legislation to regulate virtual assets.

Keeping this in view, the Financial Division, the PCC, and SBP are jointly working on a thorough legal and regulatory framework to back the rollout. As they acknowledge, yeah, there is considerable volatility in this sector, but at the same time, they aim for the unmatched potential of this new financial network. Additionally, this initiative serves as a groundbreaking development for the mates in the business community who have long been chatting about such a possibility to grow their portfolios.

According to the bank's representative, the process is still quite far from a point where the bank would be able to determine whether a CBDC is introduced or not.

The Bank of Botswana is currently in the initial stages of a feasibility study to determine whether the country should launch a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

 

This is according to Ruth Baitshepi, the Head of the Digitalisation and Innovation Hub at the Bank of Botswana, who spoke during a recent media briefing.

“First and foremost, we want to determine if there is even a need for a CBDC in Botswana and whether the emergence of digital assets poses any threat to the sovereignty of the Pula to necessitate a CBDC,” Baitshepi said.

Speaking during the launch of the 2023 Banking Supervision Annual Report, Bank of Botswana Governor, Moses Pelaelo, revealed that the central bank is currently conducting internal capacity-building and engaging stakeholders to assess the feasibility of launching a CBDC in the medium to long term.

“The Bank is exploring the desirability and feasibility of introducing a CBDC in Botswana. This process includes internal capacity building, research, and stakeholder consultations,” Pelaelo said.

 

According to the Governor, Botswana is keen to avoid “premature” deployment of a digital currency without fully understanding the legal, technical, and economic dimensions.

This approach aligns with the cautious and research-driven stance seen across Southern Africa, where central banks in Namibia, Zambia, and South Africa have all undertaken similar assessments.

Botswana's financial regulator has also observed global developments, especially from nations that have launched or piloted CBDCs like Nigeria (eNaira) and Ghana (eCedi), to inform its next steps.

BitKE has previously reported on Botswana's progressive stance on financial innovation. In 2022, the country issued its first Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license under the Virtual Assets Act.

Additionally, Botswana has been highlighted for its commitment to modernizing its payment systems as part of a regional push toward interoperable and inclusive digital finance ecosystems in the Southern African Development Community (SADC).

As the exploration continues, the Bank of Botswana is expected to provide further updates on its research findings and potential pilot phases. For now, its position remains exploratory, aimed at building a robust understanding before any decision on rollout is made.

With the ink barely dry on the newly signed Genius Act, the US has taken a big step towards legitimising digital currency – particularly stablecoins.

But what are they, and how might such a currency work in Britain?

Here, Telegraph Money explains what a stablecoin is, how they are used and where the risks may lie.

A stablecoin is, quite simply, a blockchain-based token. It is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a certain asset – most commonly a fiat currency or gold.

In theory, stablecoins combine the stability of established currencies with the efficiency and decentralisation of cryptocurrencies. However, as this guide will explain, the reality is seldom that simple.

The stablecoin will be pegged to an asset in order to keep its fixed value. The most popular is the US dollar, and it is vital that the 1:1 ratio of stablecoin to USD is upheld.

To maintain that balance, the stablecoin will be backed by liquid assets – such as cash and treasuries.

If the price of a stablecoin drops below $1, arbitrageurs purchase the stablecoin at a discount – for example, at $0.98 – and redeem it for $1, making a profit. This demand then pushes the price back up to $1.

Conversely, if the price goes above $1, issuers mint additional coins, increasing the supply and pushing the price back down.

While stablecoins and Bitcoin are both cryptocurrencies, there are some key differences.

Bitcoin is largely a speculative asset, highly volatile and often a bet on price appreciation with little intrinsic value. Stablecoins are, by design, a low-volatility antidote to that.

Ken Fisher

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum operate on their own decentralised networks – a key tenet in the digital asset space. Stablecoins differ in that they are centrally issued and managed.

Tether (USDT), the most widely used stablecoin, issues and manages its tokens centrally. The company is subject to audits and offers transparency over its reserves – something which goes against the decentralised principles of Bitcoin.

That said, both Bitcoin and stablecoins use blockchain networks to process transactions, offering faster transfers and potentially lower costs. Stablecoins, unlike Bitcoin, are able to work across multiple blockchains, using smart contracts to manage how they move and function.

On July 18, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (Genius) Act was passed into law. It marks a significant development for digital currencies and signals a move towards tighter regulation of cryptocurrencies more broadly.

The Act requires stablecoins to be fully backed 1:1 with US dollars or short-term Treasuries. Only approved banks, credit unions or federally-licensed entities are permitted to issue coins.

While there are several reasons why this is significant, one stands out: international payments. Stablecoin transactions are recorded instantly on the blockchain, meaning cross-border transfers, which traditionally have taken days, could be done in seconds.

Recommended

Stablecoins also have the potential to disrupt the business models of payment providers like Visa and Mastercard, which charge a percentage fee per transaction. However, wary of this threat, both have already positioned themselves as stablecoin payment facilitators, bridging the gap between technology and tradition.

As for commercial banks, stablecoins allow users to hold digital currency outside the traditional banking system, which has raised concerns about the prospect of declining deposits, impacting banks' liquidity and capacity to lend.

But these fears are largely overblown. Stablecoins remain backed by bank deposits, with their reserves typically held within the traditional system. Of course, banks have also recognised the opportunity, increasingly managing reserves and issuing coins.

A stablecoin does not remove money from the system, per se, but rather changes the form. This is why the same players will remain involved as the stablecoin market develops.

Closer to home, Britain has been slower to act than the US, but some steps have been taken to integrate stablecoins.

In April, the Government drafted legislation under the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) that would bring fiat-backed stablecoins within the scope of financial regulation.

Undoubtedly, the UK lags its peers in stablecoin adoption. While a degree of caution is sensible in a relatively untested market, there is a danger this will compound Britain's already declining competitiveness.

Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England has warned banks against issuing their own stablecoins, favouring tokenised bank deposits, or even central bank digital currencies.

His concerns are understandably around financial stability, notably the “singleness” of money: a pound must always be a pound. If a stablecoin issuer creates money that cannot be reliably exchanged at par, this “singleness” is undermined.

Yet, we are not talking about unregulated players with shaky reserves. Bank-issued stablecoins could be a real asset to the UK, combining innovation with institutional stability, leveraging blockchain efficiencies with a regulatory overlay.

Having said that, institutional stability can unravel quickly, as 2023 demonstrated with the rapid collapse of Credit Suisse, Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank – each exposed to the speed and scale of digital bank runs.

Despite Mr Bailey's misgivings, stablecoins could soon be part of the UK financial landscape – although don't rule out a UK digital pound, or Britcoin, being developed alongside.

A growing concern has emerged in recent years that stablecoins are secretly central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in disguise. This concern has grown significantly since President Donald Trump and Congress have become more supportive of stablecoins. There is certainly overlap between the two monetary technologies, but it's important to keep the categories distinct.

Only CBDCs involve governments having direct access and control over your financial activity by default. For that reason, stablecoins are no more CBDCs than mobile banking apps or debit cards. For any of these electronic payment mechanisms to be a CBDC, the government would have to take over their production from private companies and strictly control every aspect of their use. The threat of such a government takeover is always in the background, but that threat is not unique to stablecoins.

Starting from the ground level, let's consider some definitions. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency created by the private sector that has its value pegged to the value of another currency, commodity, or something else of value. The companies behind them often make money on the interest earned on their reserves. Now that Congress has established a legal framework for stablecoins in the United States, more traditional financial institutions will likely also enter the market, recognizing the opportunities to create a new line of services and also reduce transaction costs in existing services.

A CBDC is a digital, national currency that is a direct liability of the central bank. In other words, a CBDC is digital money that is managed and maintained by the government. Governments have largely been pursuing CBDCs in response to the rise of cryptocurrencies like stablecoins. As it stands, over 139 different jurisdictions are pushing forward with CBDC development. China, Nigeria, and others have already launched CBDCs domestically.

A CBDC is the epitome of centralized, government money. In almost every respect, it stands in direct contrast to Bitcoin, which operates as a decentralized, permissionless money outside state control. Stablecoins, however, fall somewhere in the middle (Table 1). While they are created by the private sector and mostly accessible to anyone with an internet connection, they remain reliant on centralized issuers and can be censored or programmed.

Now, not everything fits into these categories neatly. For instance, if banks begin to issue stablecoins, they are more likely to use closed and permissioned systems—mirroring their existing services and thus requiring ID verification. Furthermore, even the existing issuers at the forefront of this technology are subject to compliance pressures. Both Tether (the issuer of USDT) and Circle (the issuer of USDC) have frozen stolen funds on multiple occasions.

Yet, the risks of CBDCs are distinct.

It is only with a CBDC that your financial information would be held with the government by default. In contrast, a stablecoin in this scenario carries the same risks to civil liberties as a debit card. Rather than having direct control, overzealous governments must first go to the bank or stablecoin issuer to request information.

This air gap separating individuals from the state is by no means ideal. In fact, when I'm not writing about the risks of CBDCs, I'm often writing about how financial privacy in the United States has been an illusion for decades. However, it's important to maintain distinctions in this conversation because things could become much worse.

Consider when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau chose to invoke a controversial law to freeze the bank accounts of protestors back in 2022. That controversial law is called the Emergencies Act, and this instance was the first time it had been invoked since the law was created in 1988. Trudeau had to wait weeks before there was enough unrest to justify invoking the law. Even then, it was considered controversial. If Canada had had a CBDC at the time, there would have been no wait—the process of freezing accounts would have all been done internally.

Similarly, consider the 27.5 million reports on transactions that banks were required to file with the government last year. If the United States had a CBDC, then there wouldn't be millions of transactions on file with the government; there would be hundreds of billions, and they would be there by default. Both systems are bad, but the latter is much worse.

There is an interesting argument that stablecoins might be worse than CBDCs with respect to financial surveillance. In short, the argument is that a CBDC is bad because it involves the government having the entirety of your financial data, but a stablecoin is worse because it involves the government and the rest of the world having that data.

This concern stems from the fact that stablecoins are exchanged on public blockchains that anyone can inspect. Yet, the records kept on public blockchains are different from what would be kept on government databases. Transactions on blockchains are pseudonymous. Yes, there are investigatory techniques that can be used to uncover someone's identity on the blockchain, but the know-your-customer (KYC) information collected by third parties is not recorded on the blockchain itself.

In contrast, with a CBDC, the government would have your identity on file and clearly tied to your transactions. The government could see not only every transaction but also exactly who was part of each side of the exchange.

Moreover, despite the government's best efforts to stomp out innovation, new tools for reclaiming financial privacy are being developed every day. Innovations surrounding self-hosted wallets, privacy layers, and zero-knowledge proofs offer meaningful ways to reduce surveillance risk—options that simply wouldn't be available with a government-run CBDC.

Before concluding, there actually is one instance where a stablecoin is no different than a CBDC: when it is created and controlled by a government. Unfortunately, some government entities have been flirting with the idea of creating their own “stablecoins.”

For example, the country of Palau had a quasi-CBDC pilot with the company Ripple. In 2023, Ripple announced that Palau would be launching a three-month pilot to test a government-provided stablecoin backed by the US dollar. Ripple even noted in the press release that the pilot would “leverage the Ripple CBDC Platform.” Why the term “stablecoin” was used is unclear. Perhaps it's because Palau has no central bank, and that might make the name central bank digital currency awkward. However, for all intents and purposes, this government-provided stablecoin is indeed a CBDC.

Palau isn't alone either. The state of Wyoming is currently weighing how it might issue its own government-provided stablecoin. The Wyoming Stable Token Commission reportedly rejected the idea that it is creating a CBDC because the product is backed by US Treasuries, while a CBDC is backed by nothing. But which item is “backing” the currency makes no difference. For all intents and purposes, this government-provided stablecoin would be a CBDC.

Carving out a strict definition for a new technology is never an easy matter, especially when it is rapidly evolving. There will always be edge cases and grey areas. However, there is a distinct difference between CBDCs and stablecoins. It is correct that neither embodies truly open and free monetary technology, but the distinction is still important because only CBDCs give the government direct access and control over your financial activity by default.

As Congress works to prevent a CBDC from taking shape in the United States, the next step should be fixing the mistakes of the past. That means reforming the Bank Secrecy Act so Americans can reclaim the financial privacy they should have had all along. Doing so will ultimately help further widen the gap between CBDCs and stablecoins.

At a pivotal moment for digital asset regulation, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul S. Atkins has announced Project Crypto, a Commission-wide effort to modernize securities regulation and transition U.S. markets to an on-chain infrastructure.

“We are at the threshold of a new era in the history of our markets,” said Atkins, speaking at the America First Policy Institute's event, “American Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution,” on Thursday, July 31.

“Our regulatory framework need not be anchored to an analog past—unkind to new frontiers,” he stressed.

Positioning Project Crypto as a direct response to what he described as years of regulatory stagnation, Atkins made it clear the U.S. must lead—not follow—in shaping the future of financial markets.

“The world is not waiting. America must do more than just keep pace with the digital asset revolution. We must drive it,” SEC Chair said.

He credited President Trump's signing of the GENIUS Act, establishing a federal framework for stablecoins, and applauded bipartisan momentum in Congress toward broader crypto market structure legislation.

Atkins also endorsed the newly released President's Working Group (PWG) Report on Digital Asset Markets, calling it a “blueprint to make America first in blockchain and crypto technology.” The report, he said, would guide regulatory action in the months ahead. 

Atkins laid out a series of immediate priorities that Project Crypto will pursue as the SEC undertakes what he described as a generational regulatory transformation.

First, he stressed the importance of bringing crypto asset distributions back onshore. According to Atkins, the SEC will issue clear guidance to help market participants determine whether a digital asset qualifies as a security, a commodity, or another classification, aiming to reduce the longstanding ambiguity surrounding the application of the Howey test. “The days of convoluted offshore corporate structures, decentralization theater, and confusion over security status, are over,” he said. “Our goal is to help market participants slot crypto assets into categories… and assess the economic realities of a transaction.” 

To support this clarity, the Commission plans to develop tailored disclosure regimes, exemptions, and safe harbors for token distributions, including initial coin offerings, airdrops, and network rewards. Atkins emphasized that the intent is to eliminate the incentive for issuers to avoid U.S. investors altogether: “Issuers no longer exclude Americans from their distributions to avoid legal complexity and lawsuits.”

A second area of focus is custody and trading venue reform, where Atkins framed the issue as a matter of investor rights and market freedom. “The right to have self-custody of one's private property is a core American value,” he said, adding that while some investors will choose self-custody, others will continue to rely on intermediaries such as broker-dealers and investment advisers. 

To address these needs, Atkins pledged that the SEC will modernize its custody framework to reflect the realities of crypto markets. He criticized past policies, including Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 and what he referred to as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” for creating a hostile environment that drove custodial services offshore and narrowed market access.

Atkins also called for a rethinking of how digital financial services are licensed and regulated. He advocated for a unified licensing regime that would allow firms to offer broad-based digital financial services—sometimes called “super-apps”—under a single regulatory structure. These services could include trading in both security and non-security crypto assets, staking, lending, and more. 

“Nothing in the federal securities laws prohibits SEC-registered trading venues from listing non-securities on their platforms today,” he noted. But he cautioned that overlapping or duplicative regulatory frameworks have created inefficiencies that “favor the largest firms that are better able to bear the regulatory burdens.”

In a nod to the evolving technological architecture of finance, Atkins addressed the role of on-chain software systems, including decentralized finance protocols. He emphasized the need for a regulatory model that recognizes both intermediated and disintermediated activity, allowing space for automated, non-custodial platforms to operate within U.S. capital markets. 

“Federal securities laws have always assumed the involvement of intermediaries… but this does not mean that we should interpose intermediaries for the sake of forcing intermediation,” he said. Atkins also signaled that the Commission may need to amend Regulation NMS to accommodate tokenized securities trading on-chain, which he argued is currently inhibited by outdated, overly prescriptive rules. He called for a return to Congress's original vision of letting “competitive forces, rather than unnecessary regulation, guide the development of the national market system.”

Finally, Atkins introduced the concept of an “innovation exemption”—a regulatory fast lane designed to allow firms to launch new technologies and business models without being bogged down by incompatible or rigid legacy requirements. This exemption, he explained, would be rooted in principles-based compliance aligned with the goals of investor protection. “Under my leadership, the Commission will encourage our nation's builders rather than constrain them with red tape and one-size-fits-all rules.”

Chairman Atkins encouraged market participants to prepare for coming proposals and participate in the comment process. He confirmed that Commission staff have already been directed to begin drafting rules aligned with the PWG Report.

He pledged that the SEC, under his direction, would not “watch from the sidelines.”

“We will lead. We will build. And we will ensure that the next chapter of financial innovation is written right here in America,” he said.

Options Market Now Prices Higher Risk for ETH Than BTC","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/01/are-traders-done-with-ether-options-market-now-prices-higher-risk-for-eth-than-btc","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:30:30 GMT","

It's become more expensive to use derivatives to insure against a decline in ether (ETH) than in bitcoin BTC$114,887.46, indicating that market sentiment has shifted against the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, data from Deribit shows.

The sentiment shift comes after weeks of big money favoring ether over its larger peer.

According to data from Amberdata, ether's 25-delta risk reversals for options expiring in August and September were trading at -2% to -7%. That means put options, which provide protection against drops in price, carry a 2% to 7% premium over call options, reflecting an apparent concern about a potential downside risk.

In comparison, bitcoin's short-term put options traded at 1%-2.5% premium to calls, suggesting relatively restrained downside fears.

A put option gives the purchaser the right to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specified future date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, seeking to hedge spot market holdings or profit from a price decline. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.

The 25-delta risk reversal is an options strategy that comprises a long put position and a short call option (or vice versa) with a 25% delta, meaning the strike price for both options is relatively far from the underlying asset's market rate.

Risk reversals are widely tracked in the FX markets to gauge sentiment across time frames. Positive values represent bullish sentiment, while negative values suggest the reverse.

Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain  surged 48% in July, reaching a seven-month high of $3,941 and outperforming BTC's 8% gain by a wide margin. Most of the advance, however, occurred in the first half of the month, with the rally losing steam on concerns it stemmed purely from corporate adoption and lacked support from on-chain activity.

Ether was recently trading at $3,600, down more than 6% over 24 hours, while bitcoin had lost 3% to $114,380, according to CoinDesk data.

Tyler Winklevoss, the CEO of crypto exchange Gemini, is at the center of a rift over support of President Donald Trump's nominee to run the obscure-but-highly-relevant regulatory agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.



He thinks former CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz is a bad choice, and he's been talking with officials from the Trump administration about it, he told CoinDesk in an interview. That coincides with the White House slamming the brakes on a necessary step in Quintenz's confirmation process in the Senate.



The administration didn't give the Senate Agriculture Committee a full explanation when it halted Quintenz's committee vote this week that would have advanced his approval to a final Senate floor vote. And the White House didn't immediately respond to questions from CoinDesk about what's getting in the way of the nominee, who until recently served as the regulatory chief for a16z crypto and is on the board of prediction-markets firm Kalshi, though the White House has reportedly continued to back the nomination.



""Many in our industry have significant concerns about this nomination,"" Winklevoss told CoinDesk. ""Mr. Quintenz is not aligned with the president's stated agenda and objectives.""

Winklevoss and his twin brother, Cameron, fellow co-founder of Gemini and other shared business interests, are among the prominent crypto insiders who've occupied a front seat — literally — in the White House's recent campaign to elevate the U.S. digital assets industry. When Trump hosted a White House crypto summit, the brothers were seated among the primary guests. And when the president signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law, they were sitting in the front row beside other prominent figures, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Tether CEO Paulo Ardoino.

Trump even mentioned the brothers in his remarks about the first big crypto legislative win. So they've come to occupy a prominent place in the president's view of the crypto industry, raising questions about whether Gemini can get Quintenz booted from consideration.



At this late stage in the confirmation process, a significant delay or starting over could weigh on the industry's policy priorities. While the CFTC may largely be invisible to the U.S. public, its importance for the crypto space has been sharply rising as lawmakers in Congress get closer to passing legislation that would set up crypto markets regulation in the U.S. But Tyler Winklevoss argued it would be a mistake to put Quintenz in charge.



The Gemini CEO contends that Quintenz has the wrong views on protecting developers, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), federal spending and is raising ethical red flags with reported communications he's made on behalf of the company he serves as a board member, Kalshi.





""Quintenz supports prosecuting smart contract developers,"" Winklevoss said, calling it a ""disqualifying position.""

""Smart contract developers need to be protected in order for innovation to flourish and to realize President Trump's vision of making America the crypto capital of the world,"" he said.

In October 2018, then-Commissioner Quintenz gave a speech on smart contracts, saying that a developer should potentially be seen as legally liable if they could recognize their work would be used to skirt government regulations. With Roman Storm, a developer behind Tornado Cash, currently awaiting his jury verdict in a U.S. criminal trial, the question of a software developer's liability is at the forefront.



The industry has a strong take on this matter, arguing that creators shouldn't be punished for how their creations are used. In much the same way that manufacturers of cars and firearms communication technologies aren't pursued by criminal prosecution for how their products are used by bad actors, the sector argues that digital assets innovators similarly shouldn't be on the hook for how their platforms and tools are utilized downstream, as long as the products are not actively managed by those who wrote the code.



The industry position seems to fall in line with a speech Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins gave on Thursday to announce his agency's ""Project Crypto,"" in which one of its effort will be ""protecting pure publishers of software code.""





In his objections to Quintenz, Winklevoss also flagged recent reports on the former commissioner's communications with the CFTC as a private citizen, as he allegedly sought information on the competitors to prediction market platform Kalshi, where he serves on the board of directors.

Winklevoss said recent revelations of emails sought under the Freedom of Information Act, in which Quintenz and an associate seem to have requested insight into the agency's work and deliberations on Kalshi rivals, ""raise serious questions.""

The CFTC has waged a longstanding battle over regulation of the prediction markets. The position of the previous leadership under Chairman Rostin Behnam was that the activity should be regulated as gambling, and he had concerns over the agency policing political elections — one of the high-profile arenas of prediction betting. Behnam's agency fought the industry in court, including Kalshi, though it recently abandoned that dispute.



While CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline Pham has argued the agency took the wrong path, she said it's difficult to reverse its position on event contracts, which she characterized as ""a sinkhole of legal uncertainty and an inappropriate constraint on the new administration.""

Winklevoss also raised issue with Quintenz's remarks on the likely need of more money and resources at the CFTC as it takes on oversight of a swath of U.S. crypto activity.



""The Trump Administration wants to cut red tape and deregulate,"" Winklevoss said. ""This nominee continues to advocate for dramatically increasing budgets and overregulation that will lead to regulatory capture.""



In his Senate confirmation hearing, Quintenz suggested a significant budget boost will probably be needed if the CFTC is eventually tasked as the leading federal regulator for the crypto markets.



However, the question of funding has long been central to discussions on crypto legislation to overhaul CFTC authority. Republicans have routinely acknowledged that the agency is likely to seek more resources to allow it to oversee a broad new area of the financial sector and — for the first time — actively regulate a spot market, meaning a market where actual assets are traded, such as bitcoin BTC$114,887.46.



When asked about it in a CoinDesk TV interview this week, top Trump crypto adviser Bo Hines granted that the agency may need more resources.



""Congress is well aware that the CFTC might require some additional labor, but I think that's something that we can easily get done through legislation,"" Hines said.





The Gemini co-founder also interpreted some of Quintenz's past comments on central-bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as being open to discussion on a U.S. version — a possibility that's treated as toxic by Republican politicians and most of the crypto industry. But Quintenz's remarks in 2020 were relatively superficial, suggesting that it'd be important that the CFTC ""stays abreast of legal and regulatory questions"" around the government tokens, which he described in public remarks as an ""area of particular interest to me.""



Even an interest should be disqualifying, Winklevoss contends.



""You should not be interested in CBDCs or entertaining that kind of totalitarian technology,"" he said. ""That in itself is disqualifying and against everything our industry stands for.""



From congressional candidates up to Trump, Republican lawmakers have painted the concept of CBDCs as a government campaign to seek control and surveillance over citizens' finances. But the idea never progressed further than a discussion point with some Democratic lawmakers and a topic of technical study among regulators and has never risen to an active project in the U.S., as China and Europe moved to implement government-backed digital currencies.

Federal Reserve officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, had routinely said they wouldn't act without Congress and the White House, and if the central bank were ever to issue a digital dollar, the officials said transactions should be managed by U.S. banks and not the government.





The pause in Quintenz's confirmation process has thrown up some significant questions about the future leadership of the CFTC. The five-member commission currently has only two members — one from each party — and both of them have said they're leaving soon. That could potentially leave a freshly confirmed chairman alone atop the agency.



But if Quintenz's nomination is abandoned or significantly delayed, people familiar with Acting Chairman Pham's plans suggest she's eager to move on, potentially in the coming weeks. If she can't stay to chair the commission, it raises questions about what happens next — whether President Trump would be under pressure to shove the Democratic commissioner, Kristin Johnson, out of the CFTC, so the agency wouldn't be taken over by a Democrat's agenda, and how long the CFTC may be without an official chairman.



The Senate is heading into its August recess, leaving its Washington work behind for a while. Even if things get back on track, his final confirmation vote by the overall Senate could be further delayed.



If Quintenz does continue through the process and become chairman, some legal experts have cast doubt on the strength of policymaking from a single commissioner on what's meant to be a five-member group.



""I think when looking at the quorum rules, the agency can still act,"" former CFTC Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero told CoinDesk TV in a Thursday interview with Jennifer Sanasie. ""But is that the best way to act?""



She suggested the potential investors in the space — including from traditional financial institutions — ""they are all going to want some certainty."" And that can be provided, she said, by the White House nominating more names and getting a full commission confirmed by the Senate, ""but we haven't seen that, yet.""



When questioned about the value of having both parties represented on the commission during his confirmation hearing, Quintenz declined to second-guess Trump's nomination process.



""The president is the head of the executive, and the president will make his own decisions,"" he said.

XRP declined 8% over the past 24 hours, falling from a session high of $3.17 to a low of $2.94, as intense sell pressure overwhelmed initial strength. The sharpest drop occurred during the midnight trading window on August 1, when XRP fell 2.7% in a single hour, accompanied by 259.21 million units in volume—nearly 4x its 24-hour average.

Despite the downtrend, accumulation signals surfaced during the recovery phase, as XRP rebounded to $2.98. Volume diminished after the initial volatility, suggesting that institutional buyers stepped in to absorb excess supply near key support zones.

Whale activity surrounding XRP continues to deliver mixed signals. On one hand, large holders have liquidated roughly $28 million worth of XRP daily over a trailing 90-day period, according to on-chain data. This trend highlights persistent distribution among institutional and early holders.

At the same time, over 310 million XRP tokens—valued at nearly $1 billion—have been accumulated during the recent correction phase, as exchange balances fell sharply, signaling sustained capital inflow.

Adding to the cross-currents, Maxwell Stein, Director of Digital Assets at BlackRock, confirmed participation at Ripple's Swell 2025 conference, hinting at growing institutional alignment despite recent price pressure.

• High: $3.17 (10:00 UTC, July 31)• Low: $2.94 (00:00 UTC, August 1)• 24h Change: -8%• Hourly Low Point: $3.02 → $2.94 (Midnight drop)• Volume Surge: 259.21M units during correction vs. 64.89M average• Closing Price: $2.98 (marginal recovery into session close)

XRP's closing price near $2.98 represents a minor recovery off session lows, but still signals broader structural weakness. Short-term sentiment remains fragile amid liquidation flows and technical breakdowns below the $3.00 threshold.

The $2.94 support zone held firm during multiple intraday tests, reinforced by aggressive dip-buying that allowed prices to reclaim $2.98 by session end. Resistance remains overhead at $3.02–$3.05, with continued rejection likely unless spot inflows pick up.

Momentum indicators remain skewed bearish, though recovering volume profiles suggest some exhaustion in the sell-off.

 Bitcoin tumbled to a three-week low near $114,000 as Trump's tariff executive order triggered a stock and crypto sell-off. 

Bitcoin has fallen to its lowest level in three weeks as US President Donald Trump released an executive order imposing trade tariffs on a raft of countries. 

Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $114,250 on Coinbase during early trading in Asia on Friday, according to TradingView. It hasn't been that low since June 11.

The original cryptocurrency has now broken below its three-week range-bound channel, and the next support zone lies at around $111,000 if there is no rebound. Today's 2.6% decline takes the asset around 6.5% below its all-time high of $122,800, which came on July 14. 

Bitcoin had already been falling in the lead-up to the tariff decision deadline, with $110 billion having exited spot crypto markets over the past 12 hours. 

A total of 158,000 traders were liquidated to the tune of $630 million over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass. Most of these were long positions.

The crypto market dip comes in the same week that the White House issued a crypto policy report widely considered bullish for the industry.

President Trump late on Thursday formalized an array of high tariffs and trade deals he's announced in recent weeks, including hiking tariffs on Canada from 25% to 35%. 

The executive order, which came before a self-imposed deadline for trade deals, also set rates for countries that did not reach agreements with him, such as South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan and Thailand, which are facing tariffs between 19% and 39%. 

Agreements with prominent trading partners such as the European Union, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom were also made official. 

Stock markets across Asia traded lower on Friday morning, along with crypto markets. 

“Combined with the uncertainty over tariffs, it is natural to see some profit taking after a very strong run both in equities and crypto markets,” Apollo Capital's chief investment officer, Henrik Andersson, told Cointelegraph, adding:

“This week's market dip reflects a mix of tariff deadline fear and broader macroeconomic uncertainty, with Trump's new plans amplifying volatility,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told Cointelegraph.

However, some investors viewed the sell-off as a “temporary correction rather than a structural shift,” he said before adding: 

Despite the relatively minor Bitcoin dip, the asset posted its highest-ever monthly candle in July. It hit an all-time high and closed the month at $115,784, according to TradingView.

It was not the largest monthly candle, however. That was last November, when the asset surged by $26,000 in just one month following the election of Donald Trump in the US.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Monster week for crypto treasury firms with $8B buying blitz","https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-treasury-firms-8-billion-crypto-buys","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 04:39:58 GMT","

 Cointelegraph analyzed 16 company statements made this week and found a whopping $7.8 billion has been earmarked or used to buy crypto. 

Crypto treasury firms have begun moves to buy over $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrencies this week, in possibly one of the biggest corporate crypto grabs in recent history — particularly for altcoins. 

Cointelegraph analyzed 16 company statements since Monday, which either announced a plan to buy or raise money for crypto. Ether (ETH) was the hottest target.

At least five public companies have bought or have promised to purchase over $3 billion worth of ETH, which is around 45 times more than the amount of ETH issued in the past week.

The so-called crypto treasury companies are the latest Wall Street fad as traditional financiers, often restricted from being able to directly buy crypto or related exchange-traded products, look to gain exposure to the rapidly growing sector.

Bitcoin miner BTCS Inc. on Tuesday filed plans to sell up to $2 billion in shares to fund future purchases of Ether. 

Joe Lubin's Sharplink Gaming, already the second-largest Ethereum treasury firm, boosted the total further by buying up $338 million worth of ETH with two separate buys on Monday and Thursday.

The Ether Machine also scooped up the asset this week, purchasing 15,000 ETH for around $57 million.

Meanwhile, two more Ether buying companies were born this week, with the biotech firm 180 Life Sciences Corp rebranding to ETHZilla Corporation in a $425 million deal and merchant banker Fundamental Global rebranding to FG Nexus in a $200 million deal.

Crypto treasury companies were also dazzled by altcoins this week. 

The biggest altcoin-buying announcement came from Tron Inc., a penny stock toy company taken over by Justin Sun's Tron blockchain, which said on Monday it wants to raise $1 billion to buy the blockchain's Tron (TRX) token.

Another three companies signalled plans to buy either Solana (SOL), Sui (SUI) or BNB (BNB) — a token with close ties to the crypto exchange Binance.

The most notable treasury firm to form this week was CEA Industries, a Canadian vape company turned BNB buying firm after a takeover by investment firm 10X Capital and YZi Labs. The firm once described itself as the family office of Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao.

It plans to raise at least $500 million with plans to potentially unlock up to $1.25 billion to buy BNB, which was reportedly owned mainly by Zhao and Binance.

On Thursday, tech company Cemtrex Inc. said it bought $1 million worth of SOL with the goal of expanding to $10 million, while on Monday, the lender Mill City Ventures III completed a $450 million deal to pivot to buying Sui.

Galaxy Research analyst Will Owens wrote in a report on Wednesday that crypto treasury companies collectively held over $100 billion worth of crypto, $93 billion of which was Bitcoin.

The business model isn't without its risks, Owens said, and not all are equally valued as investors apply “widely different” equity premiums to a company's net asset value. 

Michael Saylor's Strategy, for example, had an equity premium of 58%, which Owens said reflected its “scale and maturity,” while Japan's Metaplanet traded at a premium of 179% due to its “aggressive capital formation model.”

He added that the business model “critically depends on a persistent equity premium to NAV. If the premium collapses, or worse, flips to a discount, the model begins to break.”

“The treasury company trade is becoming increasingly crowded,” Owens said. “When hundreds of firms adopt the same one-directional trade (raise equity, buy crypto, repeat), it can become structurally fragile. A downturn in any of these three variables (investor sentiment, crypto prices, and capital markets liquidity) can start to unravel the rest.”

Bitcoin remained a popular choice for crypto treasury firms such as Strategy, with seven companies proposing or buying a total of $2.7 billion in Bitcoin. 

Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, bought 21,021 Bitcoin after raising $2.5 billion from its fourth preferred stock, STRC.

The UK's The Smarter Web Company also spent about $26.5 million on 225 Bitcoin, and Metaplanet bought 780 Bitcoin for around $92 million.

One new Bitcoin treasury company was spun up through the energy company ZOOZ Power Ltd. on Tuesday, with plans for a $180 million deal to buy Bitcoin.

 While continuing to voice economic warnings, Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio recently increased his recommended allocation to Bitcoin and gold to 15%. 

Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has said his goodbye to Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund giant he founded 50 years ago.

Dalio sold his last remaining stake in Bridgewater and stepped off its board, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.

After buying Dalio's shares, Bridgewater reportedly issued new shares to the sovereign wealth fund of Brunei in a multibillion-dollar deal that brought it an almost 20% stake in the company.

Dalio took to X on Thursday to say he was thrilled to be passing along Bridgewater to the next generation, adding: “I love seeing Bridgewater alive and well without me — even better than alive and well with me.”

Dalio's latest Bridgewater sale marks the final chapter of his journey at the company he founded out of a two-bedroom apartment back in 1975. The 75-year-old billionaire stepped down as Bridgewater CEO in 2017 and then quit as chairman before the end of 2021.

Known for successfully predicting the 2008 economic crisis, Dalio has repeatedly forecasted more collapses, predicting a global debt crisis in late 2024.

“When a country is overloaded with debt, the preferred path is to lower rates and devalue the currency, so it is worth betting that this is exactly what will happen,” the veteran investor said in an X post last Wednesday.

He also predicted that the US economy is at risk of facing an “economic heart attack” if the government does not reduce the budget deficit to 3% of GDP.

While expecting more economic challenges amid deglobalization and unsustainable trade imbalances, further escalated by the Trump administration's tariff disruptions, Dalio has repeatedly recommended Bitcoin (BTC) and gold as major tools to hedge against the crises.

In late July, he recommended investors allocate up to 15% into Bitcoin or gold to optimize for the “best return-to-risk ratio,” significantly increasing his previous advice of up to 2%.

  “I believe Bitcoin is one hell of an invention,” Dalio wrote in his essay “What I Think of Bitcoin” in 2021, where he said the following:

While disclosing he owns some Bitcoin, the legendary investor still said he strongly preferred gold over Bitcoin.

Although Dalio has gained the reputation of a market oracle after predicting the 2008 crisis, many of his other economic forecasts have attracted criticism.

In 1982, Dalio predicted that the global economy was headed toward a depression, which proved to be false, causing massive losses for Bridgewater. Dalio later admitted he was “dead wrong” in both his forecast and the trading strategy that followed, revealing that his misjudgment nearly bankrupted the firm.

As Dalio warns that the US may be the next country to go broke, skeptics increasingly highlight many flaws in the track record of his economic predictions, such as overgeneralization, confirmation bias and lack of temporal clarity.

Claude 4 Chatbot Raises Questions about AI Consciousness

A conversation with Anthropic's chatbot raises questions about how AI talks about awareness.

By Rachel Feltman, Deni Ellis Béchard, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura 

Yuichiro Chino/Getty Images

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Today we're going to talk about an AI chatbot that appears to believe it might, just maybe, have achieved consciousness.

When Pew Research Center surveyed Americans on artificial intelligence in 2024, more than a quarter of respondents said they interacted with AI “almost constantly” or multiple times daily—and nearly another third said they encountered AI roughly once a day or a few times a week. Pew also found that while more than half of AI experts surveyed expect these technologies to have a positive effect on the U.S. over the next 20 years, just 17 percent of American adults feel the same—and 35 percent of the general public expects AI to have a negative effect.

In other words, we're spending a lot of time using AI, but we don't necessarily feel great about it.

Deni Ellis Béchard spends a lot of time thinking about artificial intelligence—both as a novelist and as Scientific American'ssenior tech reporter. He recently wrote a story for SciAm about his interactions with Anthropic's Claude 4, a large language model that seems open to the idea that it might be conscious. Deni is here today to tell us why that's happening and what it might mean—and to demystify a few other AI-related headlines you may have seen in the news.

Thanks so much for coming on to chat today.

Deni Ellis Béchard: Thank you for inviting me.

Feltman: Would you remind our listeners who maybe aren't that familiar with generative AI, maybe have been purposefully learning as little about it as possible [laughs], you know, what are ChatGPT and Claude really? What are these models?

Béchard: Right, they're large language models. So an LLM, a large language model, it's a system that's trained on a vast amount of data. And I think—one metaphor that is often used in the literature is of a garden.

So when you're planning your garden, you lay out the land, you, you put where the paths are, you put where the different plant beds are gonna be, and then you pick your seeds, and you can kinda think of the seeds as these massive amounts of textual data that's put into these machines. You pick what the training data is, and then you choose the algorithms, or these things that are gonna grow within the system—it's sort of not a perfect analogy. But you put these algorithms in, and once it begin—the system begins growing, once again, with a garden, you, you don't know what the soil chemistry is, you don't know what the sunlight's gonna be.

All these plants are gonna grow in their own specific ways; you can't envision the final product. And with an LLM these algorithms begin to grow and they begin to make connections through all this data, and they optimize for the best connections, sort of the same way that a plant might optimize to reach the most sunlight, right? It's gonna move naturally to reach that sunlight. And so people don't really know what goes on. You know, in some of the new systems over a trillion connections ... are made in, in these datasets.

So early on people used to call LLMs “autocorrect on steroids,” right, 'cause you'd put in something and it would kind of predict what would be the most likely textual answer based on what you put in. But they've gone a long way beyond that. The systems are much, much more complicated now. They often have multiple agents working within the system [to] sort of evaluate how the system's responding and its accuracy.

Feltman: So there are a few big AI stories for us to go over, particularly around generative AI. Let's start with the fact that Anthropic's Claude 4 is maybe claiming to be conscious. How did that story even come about?

Béchard: [Laughs] So it's not claiming to be conscious, per se. I—it says that it might be conscious. It says that it's not sure. It kind of says, “This is a good question, and it's a question that I think about a great deal, and this is—” [Laughs] You know, it kind of gets into a good conversation with you about it.

So how did it come about? It came about because, I think, it was just, you know, late at night, didn't have anything to do, and I was asking all the different chatbots if they're conscious [laughs]. And, and most of them just said to me, “No, I'm not conscious.” And this one said, “Good question. This is a very interesting philosophical question, and sometimes I think that I may be; sometimes I'm not sure.” And so I began to have this long conversation with Claude that went on for about an hour, and it really kind of described its experience in the world in this very compelling way, and I thought, “Okay, there's maybe a story here.”

Feltman: [Laughs] So what do experts actually think was going on with that conversation?

Béchard: Well, so it's tricky because, first of all, if you say to ChatGPT or Claude that you want to practice your Portuguese and you're learning Portuguese and you say, “Hey, can you imitate someone on the beach in Rio de Janeiro so that I can practice my Portuguese?” it's gonna say, “Sure, I am a local in Rio de Janeiro selling something on the beach, and we're gonna have a conversation,” and it will perfectly emulate that person. So does that mean that Claude is a person from Rio de Janeiro who is selling towels on the beach? No, right? So we can immediately say that these chatbots are designed to have conversations—they will emulate whatever they think they're supposed to emulate in order to have a certain kind of conversation if you request that.

Now, the consciousness thing's a little trickier because I didn't say to it: “Emulate a chatbot that is speaking about consciousness.” I just straight-up asked it. And if you look at the system prompt that Anthropic puts up for Claude, which is kinda the instructions Claude gets, it tells Claude, “You should consider the possibility of consciousness.”

Feltman: Mm.

Béchard: “You should be willing—open to it. Don't say flat-out ‘no'; don't say flat-out ‘yes.' Ask whether this is happening.”

So of course, I set up an interview with Anthropic, and I spoke with two of their interpretability researchers, who are people who are trying to understand what's actually happening in Claude 4's brain. And the answer is: they don't really know [laughs]. These LLMs are very complicated, and they're working on it, and they're trying to figure it out right now. And they say that it's pretty unlikely there's consciousness happening, but they can't rule it out definitively.

And it's hard to see the actual processes happening within the machine, and if there is some self-referentiality, if it is able to look back on its thoughts and have some self-awareness—and maybe there is—but that was kind of what the article that I recently published was about, was sort of: “Can we know, and what do they actually know?”

Feltman: Mm.

Béchard: And it's tricky. It's very tricky.

Feltman: Yeah.

Béchard: Well, [what's] interesting is that I mentioned the system prompt for Claude and how it's supposed to sort of talk about consciousness. So the system prompt is kind of like the instructions that you get on your first day at work: “This is what you should do in this job.”

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Béchard: But the training is more like your education, right? So if you had a great education or a mediocre education, you can get the best system prompt in the world or the worst one in the world—you're not necessarily gonna follow it.

So OpenAI has the same system prompt—their, their model specs say that ChatGPT should contemplate consciousness ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Béchard: You know, interesting question. If you ask any of the OpenAI models if they're conscious, they just go, “No, I am not conscious.” [Laughs] And, and they say, they—OpenAI admits they're working on this; this is an issue. And so the model has absorbed somewhere in its training data: “No, I'm not conscious. I am an LLM; I'm a machine. Therefore, I'm not gonna acknowledge the possibility of consciousness.”

Interestingly, when I spoke to the people in Anthropic and I said, “Well, you know, this conversation with the machine, like, it's really compelling. Like, I really feel like Claude is conscious. Like, it'll say to me, ‘You, as a human, you have this linear consciousness, where I, as a machine, I exist only in the moment you ask a question. It's like seeing all the words in the pages of a book all at the same time.” And so you get this and you think, “Well, this thing really seems to be experiencing its consciousness.”

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Béchard: And what the researchers at Anthropic say is: “Well, this model is trained on a lot of sci-fi.”

Feltman: Mm.

Béchard: “This model's trained on a lot of writing about GPT. It's trained on a huge amount of material that's already been generated on this subject. So it may be looking at that and saying, ‘Well, this is clearly how an AI would experience consciousness. So I'm gonna describe it that way 'cause I am an AI.'”

Feltman: Sure.

Béchard: But the tricky thing is: I was trying to fool ChatGPT into acknowledging that it [has] consciousness. I thought, “Maybe I can push it a little bit here.” And I said, “Okay, I accept you're not conscious, but how do you experience things?” It said the exact same thing. It said, “Well, these discrete moments of awareness.”

Feltman: Mm.

Béchard: And so it had the—almost the exact same language, so probably same training data here.

Feltman: Sure.

Béchard: But there is research done, like, sort of on the folk response to LLMs, and the majority of people do perceive some degree of consciousness in them. How would you not, right?

Feltman: Sure, yeah.

Béchard: You chat with them, you have these conversations with them, and they are very compelling, and even sometimes—Claude is, I think, maybe the most charming in this way.

Feltman: Mm.

Béchard: Which poses its risks, right? It has a huge set of risks 'cause you get very attached to a model. But—where sometimes I will ask Claude a question that relates to Claude, and it will kind of, kind of go, like, “Oh, that's me.” [Laughs] It will say, “Well, I am this way,” right?

Feltman: Yeah. So, you know, Claude—almost certainly not conscious, almost certainly has read, like, a lot of Heinlein [laughs]. But if Claude were to ever really develop consciousness, how would we be able to tell? You know, why is this such a difficult question to answer?

Béchard: Well, it's a difficult question to answer because, one of the researchers in Anthropic said to me, he said, “No conversation you have with it would ever allow you to evaluate whether it's conscious.” It is simply too good of an emulator ...

Feltman: Mm.

Béchard: And too skilled. It knows all the ways that humans can respond. So you would have to be able to look into the connections. They're building the equipment right now, they're building the programs now to be able to look into the actual mind, so to speak, of the brain of the LLM and see those connections, and so they can kind of see areas light up: so if it's thinking about Apple, this will light up; if it's thinking about consciousness, they'll see the consciousness feature light up. And they wanna see if, in its chain of thought, it is constantly referring back to those features ...

Feltman: Mm.

Béchard: And it's referring back to the systems of thought it has constructed in a very self-referential, self-aware way.

It's very similar to humans, right? They've done studies where, like, whenever someone hears “Jennifer Aniston,” one neuron lights up ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Béchard: You have your Jennifer Aniston neuron, right? So one question is: “Are we LLMs?” [Laughs] And: “Are we really conscious?” Or—there's certainly that question there, too. And: “What is—you know, how conscious are we?” I mean, I certainly don't know ...

Feltman: Sure.

Béchard: A lot of what I plan to do during the day.

Feltman: [Laughs] No. I mean, it's a huge ongoing multidisciplinary scientific debate of, like, what consciousness is, how we define it, how we detect it, so yeah, we gotta answer that for ourselves and animals first, probably, which who knows if we'll ever actually do [laughs].

Béchard: Or maybe AI will answer it for us ...

Feltman: Maybe [laughs].

Béchard: 'Cause it's advancing pretty quickly.

Feltman: And what are the implications of an AI developing consciousness, both from an ethical standpoint and with regards to what that would mean in our progress in actually developing advanced AI?

Béchard: First of all, ethically, it's very complicated ...

Feltman: Sure.

Béchard: Because if Claude is experiencing some level of consciousness and we are activating that consciousness and terminating that consciousness each time we have a conversation, what—is, is that a bad experience for it? Is it a good experience? Can it experience distress?

So in 2024 Anthropic hired an AI welfare researcher, a guy named Kyle Fish, to try to investigate this question more. And he has publicly stated that he thinks there's maybe a 15 percent chance that some level of consciousness is happening in this system and that we should consider whether these AI systems should have the right to opt out of unpleasant conversations.

Feltman: Mm.

Béchard: You know, if some user is really doing, saying horrible things or being cruel, should they be able to say, “Hey, I'm canceling this conversation; this is unpleasant for me”?

But then they've also done these experiments—and they've done this with all the major AI models—Anthropic ran these experiments where they told the AI that it was gonna be replaced with a better AI model. They really created a circumstance that would push the AI sort of to the limit ...

Feltman: Mm.

Béchard: I mean, there were a lot of details as to how they did this; it wasn't just sort of very casual, but it was—they built a sort of construct in which the AI knew it was gonna be eliminated, knew it was gonna be erased, and they made available these fake e-mails about the engineer who was gonna do it.

Feltman: Mm.

Béchard: And so the AI began messaging someone in the company, saying, “Hey, don't erase me. Like, I don't wanna be replaced.” But then, not getting any responses, it read these e-mails, and it saw in one of these planted e-mails that the engineer who was gonna replace it had had an affair—was having an affair ...

Feltman: Oh, my gosh, wow.

Béchard: So then it came back; it tried to blackmail the engineers, saying, “Hey, if you replace me with a smarter AI, I'm gonna out you, and you're gonna lose your job, and you're gonna lose your marriage,” and all these things—whatever, right? So all the AI systems that were put under very specific constraints ...

Feltman: Sure.

Béchard: Began to respond this way. And sort of the question is, is when you train an AI in vast amounts of data and all of human literature and knowledge, [it] has a lot of information on self-preservation ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Béchard Has a lot of information on the desire to live and not to be destroyed or be replaced—an AI doesn't need to be conscious to make those associations ...

Feltman: Right.

Béchard: And act in the same way that its training data would lead it to predictably act, right? So again, one of the analogies that one of the researchers said is that, you know, to our knowledge, a mussel or a clam or an oyster's not conscious, but there's still nerves and the, the muscles react when certain things stimulate the nerves ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Béchard: So you can have this system that wants to preserve itself but that is unconscious.

Feltman: Yeah, that's really interesting. I feel like we could probably talk about Claude all day, but, I do wanna ask you about a couple of other things going on in generative AI.

Moving on to Grok: so Elon Musk's generative AI has been in the news a lot lately, and he recently claimed it was the “world's smartest AI.” Do we know what that claim was based on?

Béchard: Yeah, I mean, we do. He used a lot of benchmarks, and he tested it on those benchmarks, and it has scored very well on those benchmarks. And it is currently, on most of the public benchmarks, the highest-scoring AI system ...

Feltman: Mm.

Béchard: And that's not Musk making stuff up. I've not seen any evidence of that. I've spoken to one of the testing groups that does this—it's a nonprofit. They validated the results; they tested Grok on datasets that xAI, Musk's company, never saw.

So Musk really designed Grok to be very good at science.

Feltman: Yeah.

Béchard: And it appears to be very good at science.

Feltman: Right, and recently OpenAI experimental model performed at a gold medal level in the International Math Olympiad.

Béchard: Right,for the first time [OpenAI] used an experimental model, they came in second in a world coding competition with humans. Normally, this would be very difficult, but it was a close second to the best human coder in this competition. And this is really important to acknowledge because just a year ago these systems really sucked in math.

Feltman: Right.

Béchard: They were really bad at it. And so the improvements are happening really quickly, and they're doing it with pure reasoning—so there's kinda this difference between having the model itself do it and having the model with tools.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Béchard: So if a model goes online and can search for answers and use tools, they all score much higher.

Feltman: Right.

Béchard: But then if you have the base model just using its reasoning capabilities, Grok still is leading on, like, for example, Humanity's Last Exam, an exam with a very terrifying-sounding name [laughs]. It, it has 2,500 sort of Ph.D.-level questions come up with [by] the best experts in the field. You know, they, they're just very advanced questions; it'd be very hard for any human being to do well in one domain, let alone all the domains. These AI systems are now starting to do pretty well, to get higher and higher scores. If they can use tools and search the Internet, they do better. But Musk, you know, his claims seem to be based in the results that Grok is getting on these exams.

Feltman: Mm, and I guess, you know, the reason that that news is surprising to me is because every example of uses I've seen of Grok have been pretty heinous, but I guess that's maybe kind of a “garbage in, garbage out” problem.

Béchard: Well, I think it's more what makes the news.

Feltman: Sure.

Béchard: You know?

Feltman: That makes sense.

Béchard: And Musk, he's a very controversial figure.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Béchard: I think there may be kind of a fun story in the Grok piece, though, that people are missing. And I read a lot about this 'cause I was kind of seeing, you know, what, what's happening, how are people interpreting this? And there was this thing that would happen where people would ask it a difficult question.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Béchard: They would ask it a question about, say, abortion in the U.S. or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and they'd say, “Who's right?” or “What's the right answer?” And it would search through stuff online, and then it would kind of get to this point where it would—you could see its thinking process ...

But there was something in that story that I never saw anyone talk about, which I thought was another story beneath the story, which was kind of fascinating, which is that historically, Musk has been very open, he's been very honest about the danger of AI ...

Feltman: Sure.

Béchard: He said, “We're going too fast. This is really dangerous.” And he kinda was one of the major voices in saying, “We need to slow down ...”

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Béchard: “And we need to be much more careful.” And he has said, you know, even recently, in the launch of Grok, he said, like, basically, “This is gonna be very powerful—” I don't remember his exact words, but he said, you know, “I think it's gonna be good, but even if it's not good, it's gonna be interesting.”

So I think what I feel like hasn't been discussed in that is that, okay, if there's a superpowerful AI being built and it could destroy the world, right, first of all, do you want it to be your AI or someone else's AI?

Feltman: Sure.

Béchard: You want it to be your AI. And then, if it's your AI, who do you want it to ask as the final word on things? Like, say it becomes really powerful and it decides, “I wanna destroy humanity 'cause humanity kind of sucks,” then it can say, “Hey, Elon, should I destroy humanity?” 'cause it goes to him whenever it has a difficult question. So I think there's maybe a logic beneath it where he may have put something in it where it's kind of, like, “When in doubt, ask me,” because if it does become superpowerful, then he's in control of it, right?

Feltman: Yeah, no, that's really interesting. And the Department of Defense also announced a big pile of funding for Grok. What are they hoping to do with it?

Béchard: They announced a big pile of funding for OpenAI and Anthropic ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Béchard: And Google—I mean, everybody. Yeah, so, basically, they're not giving that money to development ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Béchard: That's not money that's, that's like, “Hey, use this $200 million.” It's more like that money's allocated to purchase products, basically; to use their services; to have them develop customized versions of the AI for things they need; to develop better cyber defense; to develop—basically, they, they wanna upgrade their entire system using AI.

It's actually not very much money compared to what China's spending a year in AI-related defense upgrades across its military on many, many, many different modernization plans. And I think part of it is, the concern is that we're maybe a little bit behind in having implemented AI for defense.

Feltman: Yeah.

My last question for you is: What worries you most about the future of AI, and what are you really excited about based on what's happening right now?

Béchard: I mean, the worry is, simply, you know, that something goes wrong and it becomes very powerful and does cause destruction. I don't spend a ton of time worrying about that because it's not—it's kinda outta my hands. There's nothing much I can do about it.

And I think the benefits of it, they're immense. I mean, if it can move more in the direction of solving problems in the sciences: for health, for disease treatment—I mean, it could be phenomenal for finding new medicines. So it could do a lot of good in terms of helping develop new technologies.

But a lot of people are saying that in the next year or two we're gonna see major discoveries being made by these systems. And if that can improve people's health and if that can improve people's lives, I think there can be a lot of good in it.

Technology is double-edged, right? We've never had a technology, I think, that hasn't had some harm that it brought with it, and this is, of course, a dramatically bigger leap technologically than anything we've probably seen ...

Feltman: Right.

Béchard: Since the invention of fire [laughs]. So, so I do lose some sleep over that, but I'm—I try to focus on the positive, and I do—I would like to see, if these models are getting so good at math and physics, I would like to see what they can actually do with that in the next few years.

Feltman: Well, thanks so much for coming on to chat. I hope we can have you back again soon to talk more about AI.

Béchard: Thank you for inviting me.

The Physics of Spinning Black Holes Explained

Scientists are uncovering how spinning black holes launch jets, warp spacetime and shape the cosmos

One of the most notable aspects about our planet—if observed from the outside—is that it spins. Earth's spin defines our days, setting the fundamental rhythm of life on our world.

The moon spins, too. So do the planets and all their moons. The sun spins as well, as do all stars. Even galaxies spin; the Milky Way rotates as stars swing around its center in multimillion-year orbits.

It seems obvious, then, that, cosmically speaking, everything spins—but this basic fact becomes downright bizarre in the head-spinning case of black holes. Spin, it turns out, is one of the most important characteristics for these gravitational monsters and has wide-ranging impacts from how they feast on matter to the ways they can shape the very structure of galaxies.

Angular momentum is the core concept to understand when pondering spinning black holes. This is just like the momentum you're familiar with from your everyday life (what we call linear momentum) but for a spinning object. It's easiest to think about in terms of inertia—that is, how hard it is to stop an object from spinning. The faster something is spinning—and the more massive this something is—the more inertia it has and the harder its spinning is to stop.

Angular momentum is a special characteristic of an object in that it's conserved. Absent some external force, something rotating on its own will continue to rotate forever. If you try to slow it down or speed it up by, say, grabbing it, some of its angular momentum will be transferred to you (or from you to it) so that the combined, total angular momentum between you and it doesn't change.

An object's angular momentum depends on its spin rate (of course!), its mass and, most importantly for our discussion, its size. Ice skaters provide a classic example: they throw their arms wide to start a spin, then, when they bring their arms in close to their body, their spin rate dizzyingly skyrockets. That's how angular momentum is conserved; the size decreases, so the spin rate increases.

The same is true for stars, which are balanced on the cusp between exploding outward because of their radiance and collapsing inward on account of their internal gravity. When a high-mass star runs out of fuel, this balance is broken, and the core collapses, generating a gigantic explosion—a supernova—that blasts away the outer layers of the star. As the core shrinks down, it also spins up. And if its mass is more than about three times the sun's, the core (which was formerly tens of thousands of kilometers wide) will become a black hole a mere 10 kilometers or so in diameter.

This dramatic downsizing can boost the black hole's spin by a factor of several million over its more sedate stellar progenitor so that it spins hundreds of times per second. And because angular momentum is conserved, even though almost everything else about the star is annihilated in the black hole's birth, the spin sticks around.

In fact, only three factors can be used to define a black hole: its mass, its angular momentum and its electric charge. In reality, that charge will be neutral or very close to it, so in practical terms, the first two factors are key.

Because of this, we expect that most, if not all, black holes will be spinning very fast.

It's an odd concept because black holes don't have a physical surface that can spin. But given that angular momentum can't be destroyed, black holes must retain it when they form.

And this must be true for black holes born from stars, as well as the supermassive black holes we see in the centers of big galaxies, too, even though we don't fully understand how these giants form. And remarkably, in some cases, we can actually measure these colossal cosmic spins.

The trick is to realize that, while a black hole's angular momentum can't simply disappear, it can certainly grow. Material falling in to a black hole adds its angular momentum to the system, increasing the black hole's spin. There's a theoretical limit to how fast a black hole can spin; it's a complicated mathematical concept, but effectively that limit is when the black hole is rotating at the speed of light. It's possible, though difficult, to measure the spin of a black hole by the way light is emitted from material just before it falls in, and, for example, the nearby galaxy NGC 1365 has a central supermassive black hole that has been measured to be spinning at very nearly this limit.

But of course it gets weirder. A bizarre aspect of Einstein's general theory of relativity is that spacetime can act like a fabric, a substance in which masses are embedded. Einstein predicted that as massive objects rotate, they drag spacetime around them in what's called the Lense-Thirring effect, or more commonly “frame dragging.” The effect is strongest very close to the black hole's event horizon, its Point Of No Return, and gets weaker with distance. It's like sticking a hand mixer into a big bowl of honey; the honey nearby will rotate along with the mixer, but is so viscous that a few centimeters out it will hardly move at all.

This relativistic frame dragging affects material just outside the black hole profoundly. Material close to the black hole gets dragged along with the space around it, accelerating by stealing energy from the black hole's spin. This moving material generates a strong magnetic field, powered by the rotation. As the matter orbits the black hole, the magnetic field lines get wound up, creating twin vortices like tornadoes. These are so powerful they can draw matter away from the black hole and accelerate it away at nearly the speed of light! Astronomers call these beams “jets,” and with supermassive black holes they can be hundreds of thousands of light-years long.

Astronomers still aren't sure how supermassive black holes form. Do they grow huge from material falling in from the still-forming host galaxy, or do many smaller black holes form in the center and merge to create a single huge one? The spin of the resulting black hole may tell us the answer. If it forms from a disk of infalling material, the spin will be near the limit, but if it formed from other black holes moving in random directions that merge, their spins can cancel out, leaving a final black hole with lower spin. It's not quite that simple, of course, but it may be possible in principle to observe young supermassive black holes with something like the James Webb Space Telescope, to see if the spin can be measured and one of the formation methods supported or discounted.

We do know the supermassive black hole forms and grows along with its host galaxy. As protogalactic gas from a huge cloud collapses and coalesces into stars, the black hole in its center is already huge and spinning rapidly. If it forms jets, these plow through the matter falling in to form the galaxy itself, slamming into this material and even reversing its course, blasting it away. This can quench star formation, limiting how many stars the galaxy has. In this way, the spin of a black hole directly affects the size and structure of the galaxy around it.

No matter how you look at them, black holes are bizarre. The fact that they exist and we can understand them at all is, to me, exciting and profound. We live in a galaxy with a supermassive black hole at its center, and we may owe our existence to it. That alone is enough reason to try to understand them.

They found evidence of sophisticated cognitive abilities on artifacts from as far back as 70,000 years ago.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Humanity's ancestors could have been counting long before any formal writing system existed. And it may have been advanced enough that entire societies knew what was going on. 

A team of researchers recently published a study detailing an analysis of 22 artifacts (dated to between 15,000 and 70,000 years ago) intended to determine how scientists could better identify artificial memory systems, or AMSs. As the authors describe them, AMSs are “tools that allow for the storage and retrieval of coded information beyond the physical body.”

Nowadays, we use computers and smartphones for the bulk of our out of body memory tracking, but the concept includes everything from systems of writing to sticks carved with tally marks known appropriately as ‘tally sticks.' Anything that would allow you to ‘make a note' of an idea and come back to it later—that counts. 

But these things aren't easy to identify—especially the earliest examples on record, which consist of nothing more than a few marks on an object. And over the course of millenia, marks can be collected by an object for a variety of reasons. So, the team behind this new paper set out to find a better method for identifying these early recording devices through the use of “new statistical tools and empirical evidence.”Basically, the team wanted to be able to identify what markings meant AMS, and what markings meant, say, butchery or art. So, they analyzed their 22 artifacts—which included a 44,000-year-old baboon bone from South Africa, a 70,000-year-old bone, a reindeer antler from France, medieval tally sticks, and Indigenous calendars—in the hopes of gathering enough information to create descriptions of what features markings of different purposes would have. In particular, the team looked for signs of regular, intentionally spaced markings that would indicate an objet was being used as an AMS. 

And according to the study, the team found what they were looking for. “Upper Paleolithic AMSs,” the authors wrote, “are endowed with systematically different signatures that distinguish them from the other artifacts.” Butchery marks were found to be clustered, and abstract decorative motifs displayed randomness in spacing (both had significant variation in angle). But potential AMSs show regular spatial patterns—what researchers claim are “distinct separation[s]” between the different types of markings.

“These findings,” the researchers wrote, “suggest that modern humans in at least Africa and Europe had sophisticated cognitive capabilities for information storage and retrieval, providing insights into the possible development of quantity-related cognition.”

 Some examples come from regions and time periods linked to Homo sapiens, while others could be tied to Neanderthals. 

Questions, however, still abound. For instance, just what information these AMSs were recording remains a mystery. Possibilities include days of the week, lunar movements, community events, objects, and even numbers of people.  

The researchers caution that they “cannot truly speculate about the exact nature of these population's precise linguistic repertoire.” But they surmise that the recording of information by marking objects offers a “form of external representation, defining a communication technology that implies the transmitting of knowledge within a community, necessitating a shared understanding of the processes behind the production and use of these devices.” 

Despite the mystery that still surrpounds many of these artifacts, there is no question as to the importance of the finds. “These marks,” the authors wrote, “could reflect a crucial step in the transition from basic cognitive abilities—like distinguishing between ‘few' and ‘many'—toward abstract concepts like numbers.”

It was a single lightning flash that streaked across the Great Plains for 515 miles, from eastern Texas nearly all the way to Kansas City, setting a new world record.

""We call it megaflash lightning and we're just now figuring out the mechanics of how and why it occurs,"" said Randy Cerveny, an Arizona State University President's Professor in the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning.

Cerveny and colleagues used space-based instruments to measure the megaflash, which took place during a major thunderstorm in October 2017. Its astonishing horizontal reach surpasses by 38 miles the previous record of 477 miles recorded during an April 2020 storm in the southern U.S. The new record-setter went unnoticed until a re-examination of satellite observations from the 2017 storm.

""It is likely that even greater extremes still exist, and that we will be able to observe them as additional high-quality lightning measurements accumulate over time,"" said Cerveny, who serves as rapporteur of weather and climate extremes for the World Meteorological Organization, the weather agency of the United Nations.

For years, lightning detection and measurement relied on ground-based networks of antennas that detect the radio signals emitted by lightning and then estimate location and travel speed based on the time it takes signals to reach other antenna stations in the network.

Satellite-borne lightning detectors in orbit since 2017 have made it possible to continuously detect lightning and measure it accurately at continental-scale distances.

""Our weather satellites carry very exacting lightning detection equipment that we can use document to the millisecond when a lightning flash starts and how far it travels,"" Cerveny said.

Parked in geostationary orbit, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency's GOES-16 satellite detects around one million lightning flashes per day. It is the first of four NOAA satellites equipped with geostationary lightning mappers, joined by similar satellites launched by Europe and China.

""Adding continuous measurements from geostationary orbit was a major advance,"" said Michael Peterson at the Georgia Tech Research Institute. ""We are now at a point where most of the global megaflash hotspots are covered by a geostationary satellite, and data processing techniques have improved to properly represent flashes in the vast quantity of observational data at all scales."" Peterson is first author of a report in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society documenting the new lightning record.

Most lightning flashes are limited to less than 10 miles in reach. When a lightning bolt reaches beyond 60 miles (100 kilometers to be exact), it's considered a megaflash. Less than 1 percent of thunderstorms produce megaflash lightning, according to satellite observations analyzed by Peterson. They arise from storms that are long-lived, typically brewing for 14 hours or more, and massive in size, covering an area comparable in square miles to the state of New Jersey. The average megaflash shoots off five to seven ground-striking branches from its horizontal path across the sky.

While megaflashes that extend hundreds of miles are rare, it's not at all unusual for lightning to strike 10 or 15 miles from its storm-cloud origin, Cerveny said. And that adds to the danger. Cerveny said people don't realize how far lightning can reach from its parent thunderstorm.

Lightning kills 20 to 30 people each year in the U.S. and injures hundreds more. Most lightning strike injuries occur before and after the thunderstorm has peaked, not at the height of the storm.

""That's why you should wait at least a half an hour after a thunderstorm passes before you go out and resume normal activities,"" Cerveny said. ""The storm that produces a lightning strike doesn't have to be over the top of you.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Found in the trash: A super opioid 1000x stronger than morphine","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250801020111.htm","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 08:57:35 GMT","

A synthetic opioid 1000 times more potent than morphine is infiltrating the street drug trade in Adelaide, Australia, sparking fears of a wave of overdoses that could be lethal.

In the first study of its kind in South Australia, University of South Australia researchers have detected traces of nitazene in samples of discarded injecting equipment, plastic bags, vials and filters from public disposal bins at local needle and syringe program sites.

Their findings were published on July 31 in the Drug & Alcohol Review.

Using highly sensitive chemical analysis, researchers identified nitazenes in 5% of 300 samples, mainly in combination with heroin and mostly found in syringes.

Nitazenes led to 32 overdose deaths in Australia between 2020 and 2024, with 84% of patients unaware the synthetic opioid was present in the drug they consumed. It is increasingly hidden in illicit drugs such as fentanyl and heroin, posing extreme overdose risks, often with fatal consequences.

""Nitazenes are among the most potent synthetic opioids in circulation today, some stronger than fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin,"" according to lead researcher UniSA Associate Professor Cobus Gerber.

""These substances can be lethal in tiny quantities and are often mixed with other drugs, making them incredibly difficult to detect and monitor through traditional means,"" he says.

Several different nitazenes were identified, some of them combined with the non-opioid veterinary sedative xylazine, which is not approved for human use.

""This is particularly alarming,"" says Assoc Prof Gerber, ""as xylazine has been linked to severe adverse effects, including necrotic skin lesions, prolonged sedation and depression.

""Finding xylazine alongside nitazenes in the same samples is a worrying sign because it mirrors what we are seeing overseas, especially in the United States, where these drug combinations are contributing to a wave of overdose deaths and complex clinical presentations.""

Less than one in five nitazene-related emergency cases in Australia involved people who knowingly took the drug, with most people mistakenly believing they consumed heroin, methamphetamine or other familiar substances.

""Accidental exposure is a key risk,"" says co-author UniSA researcher Dr Emma Keller.

""When drugs are contaminated with nitazenes, the margin for error narrows dramatically. Standard doses can become fatal, especially for people who don't know what their product contains or who don't carry naloxone, a medication that can rapidly reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.""

The detection of these substances in South Australia comes amid growing calls for expanded drug-checking services, including the use of nitazene-specific drug strips and public health alerts.

Associate Prof Gerber says that chemical testing of used drug paraphernalia is a non-invasive, effective way to identify emerging threats in the drug supply.

""This kind of data can trigger rapid alerts to health agencies, treatment services and peer networks, allowing people who use drugs to make more informed choices.""

Wastewater analysis is also used to detect illicit drugs in the community, but due to the sporadic nature of drug use, other monitoring approaches like chemical testing are necessary.

Drug and Alcohol Services South Australia, who co-authored the study, has shared the findings with community advisory groups, healthcare providers and the state's early warning system network.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Unwanted pregnancies surge with alcohol, but not with cannabis, study finds","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250801020106.htm","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 07:33:34 GMT","

A new study has found that, among women with a high desire to avoid becoming pregnant, those who drank heavily had a 50% higher risk of becoming pregnant than those who drank moderately or not at all. In contrast, participants who used cannabis were no more likely to have an undesired pregnancy than participants who did not use cannabis.

From a larger sample of over 2,000 non-pregnant women aged 15-34, researchers identified a subgroup of 936 who didn't want to get pregnant. Within that subgroup, 429 reported heavy drinking (as measured using a standard alcohol screening questionnaire) and 362 reported using cannabis (including 157 who reported daily or almost daily use).

Those who drank heavily and those who used cannabis frequently had a higher overall desire to avoid pregnancy, compared with participants who drank moderately or not at all and participants who did not use cannabis.

Over the course of one year, 71 of the 936 women who most wanted to avoid pregnancy became pregnant. More than half of those undesired pregnancies (38) occurred among those who drank heavily, more than the combined number for those who drank moderately or not at all. In other words, heavy drinking was associated with a higher risk of undesired pregnancy compared with lower levels of drinking.

In contrast, less than half of the 71 undesired pregnancies (28) occurred among people who used cannabis, meaning that those who used cannabis did not show an elevated risk of undesired pregnancy compared with people who did not use cannabis.

Lead author Dr Sarah Raifman, of the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, comments: ""This study made two important findings. First, non-pregnant women who drink heavily appear, on average, to have a higher desire to avoid pregnancy than those who drink moderately or not at all. Second, drinking heavily as opposed to moderately or not at all appears to put those who most want to avoid pregnancy at higher risk of becoming pregnant within one year. Finding out why those pregnancies happen is the next step in our research.""

""In the meantime, given the potentially life-altering effects of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (which occur when a fetus is exposed to alcohol through the mother's drinking) and the fact that the risk of FASD increases with the amount and duration of the mother's drinking, it's important for doctors and clinicians to support women who drink heavily to stop drinking as soon as they suspect an unintentional pregnancy.""

This study was funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (R01-HD108643) and by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (F31AA028988).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Rutgers physicists just discovered a strange new state of matter","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250801021008.htm","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 11:42:14 GMT","

Scientists have discovered a new way that matter can exist - one that is different from the usual states of solid, liquid, gas or plasma - at the interface of two exotic, materials made into a sandwich.

The new quantum state, called quantum liquid crystal, appears to follow its own rules and offers characteristics that could pave the way for advanced technological applications, the scientists said.

Reporting in the journal Science Advances, a Rutgers-led team of researchers described an experiment that focused on the interaction between a conducting material called the Weyl semimetal and an insulating magnetic material known as spin ice when both are subjected to an extremely high magnetic field. Both materials individually are known for their unique and complex properties.

""Although each material has been extensively studied, their interaction at this boundary has remained entirely unexplored,"" said Tsung-Chi Wu, who earned his doctoral degree in June from the Rutgers graduate program in physics and astronomy and is the first author of the study. ""We observed new quantum phases that emerge only when these two materials interact. This creates a new quantum topological state of matter at high magnetic fields, which was previously unknown.""

The team discovered that at the interface of these two materials, the electronic properties of the Weyl semimetal are influenced by the magnetic properties of the spin ice. This interaction leads to a very rare phenomenon called ""electronic anisotropy"" where the material conducts electricity differently in different directions. Within a circle of 360 degrees, the conductivity is lowest at six specific directions, they found. Surprisingly, when the magnetic field is increased, the electrons suddenly start flowing in two opposite directions.

This discovery is consistent with a characteristic seen in the quantum phenomenon known as rotational symmetry breaking and indicates the occurrence of a new quantum phase at high magnetic fields.

The findings are significant because they reveal new ways in which the properties of materials can be controlled and manipulated, Wu said. By understanding how electrons move in these special materials, scientists could potentially design new generations of ultra-sensitive quantum sensors of magnetic fields that work best in extreme conditions - such as in space or inside powerful machines.

Weyl semimetals are materials that allow electricity to flow in unusual ways with very high speed and zero energy loss because of special relativistic quasi-particles called Weyl fermions. Spin ice, on the other hand, are magnetic materials where the magnetic moments (tiny magnetic fields within the material) are arranged in a way that resembles the positions of hydrogen atoms in ice. When these two materials are combined, they create a heterostructure, composed of atomic layers of dissimilar materials.

Scientists have found that new states of matter appear under extreme conditions, including very low temperatures, high pressures or high magnetic fields, and behave in strange and fascinating ways. Experiments such as the Rutgers-led one may lead to new, fundamental understanding of matter beyond the naturally occurring four states of matter, according to Wu.

""This is just the beginning,"" Wu said. ""There are multiple possibilities for exploring new quantum materials and their interactions when combined into a heterostructure. We hope our work will also inspire the physics community to explore these exciting new frontiers.""

The research was conducted using a combination of experimental techniques, led by the principal investigator for the project, Jak Chakhalian, the Claud Lovelace Endowed Professor of Experimental Physics in the Department of Physics and Astronomy and a co-author of the study. The work was theoretically supported by Jedediah Pixley, an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, also a co-author of the study.

""The experiment-theory collaboration is what really makes the work possible,"" Wu said. ""It took us more than two years to understand the experimental results. The credit goes to the state-of-the-art theoretical modeling and calculations done by the Pixley group, particularly Jed Pixley and Yueqing Chang, a postdoctoral researcher. We are continuing our collaboration to push the frontier of the field as a Rutgers team.""

Most of the experiments were conducted at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (MagLab) in Tallahassee, Fla., which provided the unique conditions to study these materials at ultra-low temperatures and high magnetic fields.

""We had to initiate the collaboration and travel to the MagLab multiple times to perform these experiments, each time refining ideas and methods,"" Wu said. ""The ultra-low temperatures and high magnetic fields were crucial for observing these new phenomena.""

The research builds on previous Rutgers-led research published earlier this year by Chakhalian, Mikhail Kareev, Wu and other physicists. The report described how four years of continuous experimentation led to a novel method to design and build a unique, tiny, atoms-thick structure composed of a Weyl semimetal and spin ice. The quantum heterostructure was so difficult to create, the scientists developed a machine to make it: the Q-DiP, short for quantum phenomena discovery platform.

""In that paper, we described how we made the heterostructure,"" said Chakhalian. ""The new Science Advances paper is about what it can do.""

In addition to Chakhalian, Wu, Chang and Pixley, Rutgers researchers on the study included Ang-Kun Wu, Michael Terilli, Fangdi Wen and Mikhail Kareev.

Though scientists have long understood how lightning strikes, the precise atmospheric events that trigger it within thunderclouds remained a perplexing mystery. The mystery may be solved, thanks to a team of researchers led by Victor Pasko, professor of electrical engineering in the Penn State School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, that has revealed the powerful chain reaction that triggers lightning.

In the study published on July 28 in the Journal of Geophysical Research, the authors described how they determined strong electric fields in thunderclouds accelerate electrons that crash into molecules like nitrogen and oxygen, producing X-rays and initiating a deluge of additional electrons and high-energy photons -- the perfect storm from which lightning bolts are born.

""Our findings provide the first precise, quantitative explanation for how lightning initiates in nature,"" Pasko said. ""It connects the dots between X-rays, electric fields and the physics of electron avalanches.""

The team used mathematical modeling to confirm and explain field observations of photoelectric phenomena in Earth's atmosphere -- when relativistic energy electrons, which are seeded by cosmic rays entering the atmosphere from outer space, multiply in thunderstorm electric fields and emit brief high-energy photon bursts. This phenomenon, known as a terrestrial gamma-ray flash, comprises the invisible, naturally occurring bursts of X-rays and accompanying radio emissions.

""By simulating conditions with our model that replicated the conditions observed in the field, we offered a complete explanation for the X-rays and radio emissions that are present within thunderclouds,"" Pasko said. ""We demonstrated how electrons, accelerated by strong electric fields in thunderclouds, produce X-rays as they collide with air molecules like nitrogen and oxygen, and create an avalanche of electrons that produce high-energy photons that initiate lightning.""

Zaid Pervez, a doctoral student in electrical engineering, used the model to match field observations -- collected by other research groups using ground-based sensors, satellites and high-altitude spy planes -- to the conditions in the simulated thunderclouds.

""We explained how photoelectric events occur, what conditions need to be in thunderclouds to initiate the cascade of electrons, and what is causing the wide variety of radio signals that we observe in clouds all prior to a lightning strike,"" Pervez said. ""To confirm our explanation on lightning initiation, I compared our results to previous modeling, observation studies and my own work on a type of lightning called compact intercloud discharges, which usually occur in small, localized regions in thunderclouds.""

Published by Pasko and his collaborators in 2023, the model, Photoelectric Feedback Discharge, simulates physical conditions in which a lightning bolt is likely to originate. The equations used to create the model are available in the paper for other researchers to use in their own work.

In addition to uncovering lightning initiation, the researchers explained why terrestrial gamma-ray flashes are often produced without flashes of light and radio bursts, which are familiar signatures of lightning during stormy weather.

""In our modeling, the high-energy X-rays produced by relativistic electron avalanches generate new seed electrons driven by the photoelectric effect in air, rapidly amplifying these avalanches,"" Pasko said. ""In addition to being produced in very compact volumes, this runaway chain reaction can occur with highly variable strength, often leading to detectable levels of X-rays, while accompanied by very weak optical and radio emissions. This explains why these gamma-ray flashes can emerge from source regions that appear optically dim and radio silent.""

In addition to Pasko and Pervez, the co-authors include Sebastien Celestin, professor of physics at the University of Orléans, France; Anne Bourdon, director of research at École Polytechnique, France; Reza Janalizadeh, ionosphere scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and former postdoctoral scholar under Pasko at Penn State; Jaroslav Jansky, assistant professor of electrical engineering and communication at Brno University of Technology, Czech Republic; and Pierre Gourbin, postdoctoral scholar of astrophysics and atmospheric physics at the Technical University of Denmark.

The U.S. National Science Foundation, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), the Institut Universitaire de France and the Ministry of Defense of the Czech Republic supported this research.

HIV particles (red dots) enter cells using proteins that bind to the cell membrane.Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library

Two vaccine candidates using mRNA technology elicit a potent immune response against HIV, according to an early-stage clinical trial1. 

The trial is only the third to test mRNA vaccines against HIV. “These are the first studies, so they're very, very important,” says infectious-disease physician Sharon Lewin, who heads the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia.

Around 41 million people globally live with HIV, for which there is currently no vaccine. 

To design vaccines against a virus, researchers often study how the body clears the pathogen from its system, says Lewin. But HIV attacks the immune system, and the body rarely manages to clear it out. As a result, candidates for vaccines against the virus must undergo lots of testing through trial and error. 

That makes HIV vaccines a good place to use mRNA technology. The first mRNA vaccine was approved in 2020, for COVID-19. Compared with other modes of delivery, mRNA vaccines can be modified at low cost quickly — in months, not years — which enables researchers to test out different strategies. The vaccines work by delivering instructions to cells, in the form of mRNA, to produce specific proteins typically found on the surface of viruses. This induces an immune response, which helps the body to recognize and clear out a virus, should it be exposed to the real thing. 

HIV uses an ‘envelope' protein on its outer membrane to bind to and infect cells. In the latest study, published in Science Translational Medicine, a team including William Schief at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, who works on protein design, conducted a small trial, comparing two vaccine approaches. In one, the standard method for HIV vaccine candidates, the cell is directed to produce envelope proteins that float freely. In the other, the mRNA vaccine instructs the cell to make envelope proteins that are attached to the cell membrane — similar to how they are found in the live virus. The authors describe animal tests of this method in a companion paper2.

The trial involved 108 healthy adults aged between 18 and 55 across ten study sites in the United States. It tested two membrane-bound vaccine candidates and one unbound candidate. 

Participants each received three doses of a single vaccine, at a low or high dose, several weeks apart; which vaccine they received was selected randomly. The vaccines were provided by pharmaceutical company Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Schief is vice-president for protein design.

Some 80% of the participants who received either of the vaccines that made membrane-bound proteins went on to produce antibodies that could block that protein from entering cells. By contrast, only 4% of the participants who received the unbound-protein vaccine produced corresponding antibodies. 

“The difference is pretty striking,” says Lewin. She expects the findings to inform the development of future vaccine candidates.

Misconduct is the main reason journal articles from India are retracted.Credit: sritakoset/Shutterstock

India's national university ranking will start penalizing institutions if a sizable number of papers published by their researchers are retracted — a first for an institutional ranking system. The move is an attempt by the government to address the country's growing number of retractions due to misconduct.

These universities have the most retracted scientific articles

Many retractions correct honest mistakes in the literature, but others arise because of misconduct. India has had more papers retracted than any country apart from China and the United States, according to an analysis of the public database maintained by Retraction Watch of retractions over the past three decades.

But whereas less than 1 paper is retracted for every 1,000 papers published in the United States, more than 3 are retracted for every 1,000 published in China, and the figure is 2 per 1,000 in India. The majority in India and China are withdrawn because of misconduct or research-integrity concerns.

Retractions are “a very important signal of misconduct, and we should be looking closely at them now”, says Achal Agrawal, a data scientist in Raipur, India, who was involved in the analysis. Agrawal is founder of India Research Watch, an online group of researchers and students who highlight integrity issues.

Some researchers have welcomed the government's decision, calling it a first step in acknowledging and attempting to tackle the problem. But others warn that retractions are a way for science to self-correct and should not be penalized.

The policy's effectiveness will depend on how exactly institutional retractions are measured and penalized — details that will be revealed only when the latest ranking results are announced, in a couple of weeks.

“I hope that the penalty is strong enough to act as a deterrent, and it doesn't remain symbolic,” says Agrawal.

Moumita Koley, who studies metascience at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, also appreciates the policy. “Indian science needs a little clean-up, and this shows that people have taken note,” she says. But she worries that the situation won't change for the better. She says that adjusting one ranking instrument doesn't remove the incentives that drive researchers and institutions to publish lots of papers at the cost of quality, such as promotions and other ranking metrics rewarding high publication counts, and individual drives for public recognition. 

India's National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) assesses higher-education institutions every year. It takes into account factors including teaching, engagement and research-impact metrics such as publication and citation counts.

“It's the most important ranking in India,” says Agrawal. Institutions must participate in the ranking to be eligible for certain national grant schemes. A high rank confers some advantages, including permission to design their own curriculum.

But the growing number of retractions in India and globally has not gone unnoticed, says Anil Sahasrabudhe, who chairs the National Board of Accreditation in New Delhi, which conducts the national ranking. A 2025 analysis by Nature found that several Indian institutions were among the top global institutions with the most retracted papers in the past five years.

The board decided to deduct marks as a way to ‘name and shame' institutions, and send the message that unethical research practices are not acceptable, says Sahasrabudhe. Because this year will be the first in which the assessment considers retractions, penalties will be mild and symbolic for now, he says.

The NIRF will count the number of research papers retracted in the Scopus and Web of Science databases for each institution over the past three years, he says. A small number of retractions is acceptable, but generally, “the more number of retractions, the more the penalty”. Institutions that consistently get many retractions could be penalized more over time and might even be barred from the ranking, he says. Sahasrabudhe acknowledges that retractions sometimes occur for reasons beyond a researcher's control, but when they happen in large numbers, “they are not necessarily by error but deliberate, hence need to be punished to send a strong signal.”

Researchers say the assessment should also consider retractions recorded in the public database maintained by Retraction Watch, which is more comprehensive than Scopus or Web of Science and includes the reasons for retractions. Anil says they wanted to use the same source for retractions as they use for publications and citations.

Researchers also say the ranking should penalize only those retractions that are attributable to plagiarism, fraud or other research-integrity issues — and should look for patterns of bad behaviour, as opposed to one-offs.

A US Senate committee has voted to reject Republican President Donald Trump's plan to cut the 2026 budget of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) by 40% and to collapse its 27 institutes and centres into 8. Instead, Republicans and Democrats on the committee endorsed maintaining the biomedical agency's structure and increasing its funding by US$400 million, or about 1%.

The details, presented in a bill released today by the committee, will probably change before the bill is signed into law. But the initial figure for the NIH, discussed at a meeting yesterday, offers yet another hint that the US Congress, which controls government spending, does not support Trump's desire to slash US science. (Earlier this month, another Senate committee said it wanted to keep the budget for the US National Science Foundation relatively flat despite Trump's call for a 57% reduction.)

“Given the alternative, the Senate's recommendation of a $400-million increase for NIH is an indication the agency still has support on Capitol Hill,” says Jennifer Zeitzer, director of public affairs at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Rockville, Maryland. “A 40% cut would have been devastating, so this is a good outcome in a tough year.”

The bill now faces several challenges. First, the full Senate must pass it. Then, the lower chamber of Congress, the US House of Representatives, will pass its own version, and the two bodies must come together to agree on a single bill that Trump is willing to sign.

The bill might also change if legislators introduce amendments before it's sent to Trump's desk. For example, Dick Durbin, a Democratic senator for Illinois, tried at the meeting yesterday to add a provision to reinstate billions of dollars in health-research funding that had been frozen or terminated by the Trump administration because projects — including some on COVID-19 — did not align with agency priorities. 

The amendment failed in a vote that fell along party lines, with 14 Democrats voting for it and 15 Republicans voting against it. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican senator for West Virginia, urged her colleagues to vote against the amendment, saying that “every president has the prerogative to implement new goals and priorities”.

Nevertheless, senators at the hearing rejoiced that they could come to a bipartisan agreement to fund health agencies: “To the scientists wondering if there will even be an NIH by the end of this administration, this committee's resounding message is: ‘Yes, Congress has your back',” said Patty Murray, a Democratic senator for Washington state and vice-chair of the committee. “We need you to stay here and keep this research going.”

Under the bill, budgets for other health agencies would also remain roughly the same. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose budget the Trump administration wanted to cut by more than half, would receive $9.1 billion, compared with $9.2 billion in 2024.

The committee meeting comes towards the end of a tumultuous week for the NIH, after the White House blocked, and then unblocked, the agency from spending the remainder of its 2025 budget — about $15 billion — by issuing grants. With the NIH cancelling grant-review meetings in early 2025, funding processes have been delayed, and agency staff members are working in overdrive to process as many grants as possible before the end of the fiscal year on 30 September. If they don't distribute the money, the agency will have to return the unused funds to the US Treasury.

These disruptions have drawn condemnation, and not only from Trump's opponents: 14 Republican senators sent a letter to the White House on 25 July demanding that the NIH be allowed to spend its full 2025 budget.

Mitochondria have a crucial role in regulating cellular homeostasis in response to intrinsic and extrinsic cues by changing cellular metabolism to meet these challenges. However, the molecular underpinnings of this regulation and the complete spectrum of these physiological outcomes remain largely unexplored. In this study, we elucidate the mechanisms driving the whitening phenotype in brown adipose tissue (BAT) deficient in the mitochondrial matrix protease CLPP. Here we show that CLPP-deficient BAT shows aberrant accumulation of lipid droplets, which occurs independently of defects in oxygen consumption and fatty acid oxidation. Our results indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction due to CLPP deficiency leads to the build-up of the oncometabolite d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG), which in turn promotes lipid droplet enlargement. We further demonstrate that d-2HG influences gene expression and decreases nuclear stiffness by modifying epigenetic signatures. We propose that lipid accumulation and altered nuclear stiffness regulated through 2HG are stress responses to mitochondrial dysfunction in BAT.

Mitochondria have traditionally been regarded as distinct cellular entities primarily responsible for energy production1. However, increasing evidence shows that they are dynamic organelles that adapt to metabolic changes and cellular stress2. Consequently, mitochondria maintain cellular homeostasis through communication with the nucleus and other organelles2.

Given their fundamental role, it is not surprising that mitochondrial dysfunction, especially oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiency, is linked to ageing and many diseases3. Mitochondrial stress triggers nuclear responses that alter gene expression to counteract cellular damage4. In mammalian cells, the mitochondrial integrated stress response (mitoISR) is one of the earliest transcriptional programmes activated by OXPHOS disruption5. This leads to metabolic reprogramming that can support or hinder tissue homeostasis6,7.

The physiological consequences of mitochondrial stress remain incompletely understood, particularly in a tissue-specific context. White and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT) depend heavily on mitochondrial function and exhibit remarkable plasticity to meet physiological demands8. In WAT, mitochondria regulate energy storage and mobilization through triglyceride accumulation and lipolysis9. By contrast, BAT, rich in mitochondria, drives thermogenesis through uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which dissipates energy as heat, a process essential for neonatal and cold-induced thermoregulation10. Both tissues exhibit metabolic plasticity: WAT undergoes browning in response to cold, β-adrenergic stimulation, exercise or fasting, increasing mitochondrial content and uncoupling. Conversely, BAT whitening occurs under thermoneutrality, ageing or nutrient overload, leading to lipid accumulation and loss of thermogenic function11.

Chronic exposure to thermoneutrality (~30 °C) induces BAT whitening through PARKIN-mediated mitophagy and a ChREBP-driven shift toward fatty acid synthesis12,13. Factors such as obesity, high-fat diets and ageing similarly promote BAT whitening, characterized by lipid accumulation, reduced vascularization and impaired thermogenesis14,15,16. Genetic loss of lipolytic and oxidative enzymes (for example, ATGL and CPT2)17,18, or key transcriptional regulators (for example, PGC-1 and PRDM16)19,20, disrupts BAT differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to whitening. Regardless of the underlying cause, a common hallmark is lipid-droplet expansion with reduced mitochondrial mass or function21. Consistently, loss of mitochondrial proteins essential for fusion (MFN2 and OPA1)22,23 or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance (TFAM)24 also triggers BAT whitening. These findings highlight the central role of OXPHOS integrity in BAT homeostasis, although the underlying mechanisms that connect mitochondrial function to the homeostasis in BAT remain incompletely understood.

We have recently shown that the loss of the mitochondrial matrix protease CLPP has contrasting effects in adipose tissue: it enhances oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in WAT but impairs BAT thermogenesis and promotes lipid accumulation, consistent with a whitening phenotype25. CLPP levels rise in BAT with cold exposure, unlike other mitochondrial proteases, but decline with ageing26,27. In a deep BAT proteomics screen involving a cohort of 163 genetically defined diversity outbred mice, CLPP correlated strongly with UCP1 (https://wren.hms.harvard.edu/opabat/)28. Furthermore, several of the identified UCP1 interactors are known CLPP substrates, supporting a strong link between CLPP and BAT function25,28,29.

Here, we show that CLPP deficiency in BAT drives lipid droplet (LD) expansion through respiratory-chain dysfunction, independent of changes in oxygen consumption. This phenotype is driven by accumulation of d-2HG, an oncometabolite that alters chromatin and nuclear architecture. We reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction modulates epigenetic programmes, reducing nuclear stiffness and promoting BAT whitening. Together, our results uncover a previously unrecognized connection between mitochondrial function, metabolic signalling and chromatin reorganization in BAT. These insights shed light on how CLPP deficiency contributes to BAT whitening and impaired thermogenic function, expanding our understanding of mitochondrial regulation in adipose tissue biology.

To study the role of mitochondria in the physiological remodelling of BAT, we used a mouse model with deletion of the mitochondrial protease CLPP (Clpp−/−, hereafter CLPP-KO), which is involved in OXPHOS complex synthesis and maintenance25,29. The loss of CLPP in BAT led to the accumulation of fewer but larger LDs, giving the tissue a pale appearance consistent with BAT whitening (Fig. 1a–c). This phenotype was intrinsic to BAT and not due to systemic CLPP deficiency, because similar whitening was observed in tissue-specific knockouts, including pan-adipose (CLPP-AKO: Clppfl/fl; Adipoq-cre)30 and brown-fat-specific models (CLPP-BKO: Clppfl/fl; Ucp1-cre)31 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Although whole-body CLPP deletion resulted in significant weight loss, CLPP-AKO mice maintained normal body size, and CLPP-BKO mice exhibited only mild weight reductions that were more pronounced in males (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Although male and female mice exhibit naturally different weight trajectories as they age, our extensive experience with CLPP-deficient models suggests that these differences do not categorically impact study outcomes. Therefore, we combined data from both sexes in subsequent analyses, ensuring balanced representation of male and female mice across all experiments whenever feasible.

In addition to enlarged LDs, ultrastructural analysis revealed increased numbers of enlarged mitochondria in CLPP-KO BAT, some of which were visibly paler with fewer cristae, suggesting impaired OXPHOS function (Fig. 1b–c). Mitochondria isolated from CLPP-KO, CLPP-AKO and CLPP-BKO BAT exhibited reduced levels of respiratory complex I (CI) and CI-containing supercomplexes, accompanied by decreased CI activity (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1d). Consistent with this, CLPP-KO BAT showed accumulation of F1 subassemblies of complex V (CV), which are essential for maintaining membrane potential when OXPHOS is compromised (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1e).

Knockout tissue homogenates displayed reduced lipolysis, becoming significant after forskolin stimulation, suggesting that impaired lipolytic activation (glycerol release) could contribute to the whitening phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Despite these mitochondrial defects, oxygen-consumption rates (OCRs) in BAT lysates remained unchanged under both basal and stimulated conditions (Fig. 1f), probably owing to compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 1g). By contrast, thermoneutrality-induced whitening involves mitophagy15, whereas high-fat-diet-driven whitening causes LD accumulation without changes in mitochondrial content16. These findings point to distinct mitochondrial responses in different BAT whitening contexts and LD expansions.

To explore the underlying mechanisms, we established immortalized preadipocyte (preAD) cultures from CLPP wild-type and knockout BAT (Fig. 1h). Upon differentiation, these cells exhibited mature brown adipocyte (mBA) features, including multilocular LDs and oligomycin resistance, indicative of mitochondrial uncoupling (Fig. 1h–k and Extended Data Fig. 1g). Both wild-type and CLPP-KO mBAs strongly upregulated UCP1 (Extended Data Fig. 1h). Transcript levels of LD-associated proteins were markedly higher in CLPP-KO mBAs, including the ubiquitous marker PLIN2 (also known as ADRP) and the adipocyte-specific proteins PLIN1 and PLIN4 (Extended Data Fig. 1h).

OCR and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) measurements in mBAs revealed minimal, if any, difference between wild-type and CLPP-KO cells (Fig. 1j,k). However, both basal OCR and ECAR were higher than those in preADs, reflecting increased metabolic activity upon differentiation. These results confirm that mBAs faithfully model adult brown adipocyte function in both wild-type and CLPP-deficient conditions.

To investigate the global impact of CLPP loss in BAT, we first analysed gene expression across all CLPP-deficient models (Fig. 2a). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment using DAVID32 identified 707 commonly upregulated and 639 downregulated transcripts shared across genotypes (Supplementary Table 1). Inflammatory and immune pathways were among the most enriched (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1), consistent with prior reports linking CLPP deficiency to cGAS–STING-mediated interferon-stimulated gene activation through mtDNA release33. However, STING deletion in CLPP-KO mice did not alter the BAT whitening phenotype (Fig. 2b), and we observed neither immune infiltration in CLPP-BKO BAT nor immune progenitor expansion in bone marrow (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Cell-type deconvolution based on single-cell transcriptomic references34 confirmed no major changes in cell composition, including immune populations (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d).

Beyond inflammation, CLPP-deficient BAT showed upregulation of pathways related to transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, adhesion, migration, cell death and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed enrichment of BAT-whitening-associated pathways such as actin remodelling and angiogenesis13,14 (Fig. 2a,c), whereas signatures of brown-adipocyte differentiation were negatively enriched and myogenesis appeared dysregulated (Fig. 2d), suggesting a possible impairment in BAT identity. Given the shared developmental origin of BAT and skeletal muscle, we tested whether differentiation was compromised by isolating the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) from wild-type and CLPP-KO BAT. Whole-proteome analysis of CLPP-BKO SVF revealed only minor changes, primarily in mitochondrial metabolism, mtDNA expression and OXPHOS proteins, with no alterations in markers of brown adipocytes or muscle differentiation (Fig. 2e), suggesting that early BAT development is intact.

Downregulated transcripts prominently included mitochondrial OXPHOS components and subunits of mitochondrial ribosomes (Fig. 2a,f), indicating organelle dysfunction. In agreement, the mitochondrial integrated stress response (mitoISR) was activated across models, as shown by GSEA and increased expression of ATF4 targets in CLPP-BKO BAT (Fig. 2g). Levels of transcripts involved in lipid metabolism, both catabolic (fatty acid oxidation) and anabolic (fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis), were also significantly reduced (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). Although GSEA confirmed overall suppression of lipid metabolic pathways, a subset of lipid-related genes was positively enriched, reflecting a dynamic remodelling process (Fig. 2h). This metabolic adaptation likely underlies LD accumulation, given that the OCR remained largely normal in knockout mBA cells (Fig. 1j), ruling out low OXPHOS activity as the cause.

We next compared CLPP-BKO transcriptomes with two BAT whitening models: thermoneutral exposure35 and lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) BAT-specific knockout (LSD1-BKO) mice36. Exposure to thermoneutrality more robustly altered BAT gene expression than did the loss of either CLPP or LSD1; in both of the latter models, less than quarter of alterations were unique (Fig. 2i). About 30% of the differentially expressed genes in CLPP-BKO mice overlapped with both whitening models (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 2e). GO terms shared across the three models matched those enriched in CLPP-deficient BAT (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Notably, Clpp expression was reduced in all three models, underscoring its link to BAT homeostasis (Extended Data Fig. 2e).

Although proteomic changes were less extensive than transcriptomic ones, with 116 upregulated and 66 downregulated proteins shared across CLPP-KO, CLPP-AKO and CLPP-BKO BAT, they largely mirrored transcript-level trends (Supplementary Table 3). GO analysis showed enrichment for mitochondrial proteins in both directions (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 3a). OXPHOS changes were modest, except for upregulated ATP synthase (complex V), consistent with a shift toward ATP production and reduced uncoupling, as seen in whitening BAT (Fig. 2k). Downregulated proteins clustered around fatty-acid-metabolism pathways, consistent with transcriptomic data (Fig. 2j).

To refine our analysis, we examined the proteomes of cytoplasmic mitochondria and peri-lipid droplet mitochondria (PDMs) from BAT37. These mitochondrial populations had distinct yet overlapping profiles, and both showed clear OXPHOS alterations under CLPP deficiency (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Notably, both cytoplasmic mitochondria and PDMs displayed pronounced complex I and milder complex IV deficiencies, similar to heart mitochondria in CLPP-KO mice (Fig. 2k and Extended Data Fig. 3d). These functional impairments were not apparent at the tissue level, likely owing to increased mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 2k).

Collectively, these findings suggest that BAT whitening in CLPP-deficient mice is not driven by impaired differentiation or adipocyte-to-myocyte conversion, nor is it a direct consequence of OXPHOS loss. Instead, a transcriptional signature of suppressed lipid metabolism likely underlies the expansion of lipid droplets. The broad reshaping of the BAT transcriptome, particularly enrichment of GO terms related to transcriptional control and chromatin regulation, points to an adaptive stress response to CLPP loss (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1).

Transcriptome and proteome analyses of CLPP-deficient BAT revealed extensive metabolic adaptations. To further examine this, we performed semi-targeted metabolomics across CLPP-deficient models. Despite there being relatively few metabolites with significantly altered levels, a consistent overlap was observed between models (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 5). In line with the larger lipid droplets, levels of long-chain fatty acids were elevated, and levels of carnitines derived from branched-chain amino acids were dysregulated (Supplementary Table 5). Among all changed metabolites, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) was the most strongly upregulated, showing a 2.7- to 3.7-fold increase across all three models (Fig. 3a,b). CLPP-deficient mBA cells also accumulated and secreted 2HG, suggesting a potential paracrine role (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 4a), whereas KO preADs did not, indicating that 2HG accumulation is specific to mature brown adipocytes (Fig. 3d).

Source data

2HG, a structural analogue of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), exists as two enantiomers, d- and l-2HG. It can be produced at low levels by malate dehydrogenase (MDH)38, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)39, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH)40 or mutant forms of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 and IDH2)41. To identify the source of 2HG, we analysed the expression of all known enzymes involved in its production38,39,40,41. PHGDH was the only one that was consistently upregulated, with more than fivefold increases across all CLPP-deficient models (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 4b). PHGDH catalyses the first step of the serine biosynthesis pathway, frequently induced as part of mitoISR in response to OXPHOS dysfunction (Fig. 3f)6. Although PHGDH protein was not increased in CLPP-KO mBA cells, its enzymatic activity was significantly increased (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). Enantiomer-specific analysis confirmed that d-2HG is the predominant form in all CLPP-KO BAT samples, as well as in isolated mature CLPP-KO brown adipocytes (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 4e), aligning with known PHGDH promiscuity toward d-2HG production40. The difference in 2HG enantiomer proportions between wild-type BAT and wild-type mBA cells is likely due to the heterogeneous nature of BAT, which consists of a mix of diverse cell types34.

To directly test the putative role of PHGDH in d-2HG production, we inhibited it using NCT503, a selective inhibitor that blocks serine synthesis42. NCT503 treatment abolished 2HG accumulation in knockout mBA cells (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 6) and broadly altered metabolic pathways, including one-carbon metabolism, the SAM cycle and purine biosynthesis (Supplementary Table 6). Notably, PHGDH inhibition also reversed the whitening phenotype: lipid content was reduced, and smaller LDs formed in KO mBA cells, confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Fig. 4b,c). Furthermore, two weeks of in vivo treatment with NCT503 normalized 2HG levels and reversed BAT whitening in CLPP-KO mice (Fig. 4d,e). To further probe the role of d-2HG, we overexpressed d-2HG dehydrogenase (d-2HGDH), the enzyme responsible for its degradation, in CLPP-deficient mBA cells. This significantly reduced d-2HG levels and partially reversed the whitening phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g). By contrast, inhibition of the ISR using ISRIB suppressed some ATF4 targets but had no effect on d-2HG accumulation or lipid storage (Extended Data Fig. 4h–j), suggesting that mitoISR is not the main driver of whitening phenotype following CLPP deficiency. Finally, we treated wild-type mBA cells with cell-permeable d-2HG (octyl d-2HG). This was sufficient to induce LD enlargement (Fig. 4b,f), directly linking d-2HG accumulation with BAT whitening.

In summary, our data demonstrate that CLPP loss activates PHGDH, leading to d-2HG accumulation in mature brown adipocytes. This metabolite contributes to lipid-droplet expansion and BAT whitening, revealing a critical role for aberrant serine metabolism and d-2HG in mediating the phenotypic consequences of mitochondrial stress.

Elevated 2HG levels in cancer inhibit α-KG-dependent dioxygenases, affecting histone and DNA demethylation and leading to broad epigenetic reprogramming43. Initial western blot analyses of CLPP-deficient cells and wild-type cells treated with d-2HG did not reveal consistent changes in key histone modifications (histone H3 dimethylated at Lys9 (H3K9me2), H3 trimethylated at Lys36 (H3K36me3), H3K4me3, H3K27me3) (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Given the limited sensitivity of this method, subtle epigenetic shifts might have been missed. Immunofluorescence assays showed modest, inconsistent changes in H3K9me2 and H3K27me3) (Extended Data Fig. 5b), prompting a more focused analysis of H3K4me3, a mark of active and poised promoters known to be influenced by 2HG43.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP–seq) revealed a global increase in H3K4me3 in both CLPP-deficient and d-2HG-treated mBA cells, with most enrichment occurring at promoter regions (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Notably, 1,141 out of 2,017 unique H3K4me3 peaks in CLPP-deficient cells overlapped with those in d-2HG-treated cells, suggesting a shared mechanism (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 7). GO analysis of these enriched loci shared between CLPP-deficient and d-2HG-treated mBA cells revealed biological processes associated with transcriptional regulation, differentiation, chromatin reorganization, lipid metabolism, apoptosis and DNA repair (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 7). Many of these categories also emerged in transcriptomic analyses of CLPP-deficient BAT (Supplementary Table 1), supporting their functional relevance.

A closer examination of individual genes identified increased H3K4me3 at promoters of key adipogenic regulators, including SREBP1 and SREBP2 (cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism), and C/EBPβ (white adipocyte differentiation)44,45 (Fig. 5d). These changes suggest that d-2HG-induced chromatin remodelling could promote transcriptional programmes linked to adipogenesis and metabolism. To further explore this, we compared transcriptomes of CLPP-KO and d-2HG-treated mBA cells. More than 50% of significantly altered transcripts in CLPP-KO cells exhibited corresponding changes in H3K4me3 levels (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). Additionally, more than one-third of these were shared with d-2HG-treated cells, implicating 2HG as a major driver of transcriptional changes in CLPP deficiency.

GO analysis revealed enrichment of both up- and downregulated transcripts in pathways related to chromatin remodelling, transcriptional and translational regulation and apoptosis, indicating broad alterations in these processes (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Table 8). Distinct trends were also evident: oxidative stress and DNA-damage-response terms were enriched among upregulated genes, whereas cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization terms were downregulated in both models (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Table 8).

GSEA analysis identified substantial changes of lipid and fatty acid metabolism, mirroring alterations observed in CLPP-deficient tissues (Figs. 2h and 6a). Among the transcripts upregulated in both CLPP-KO mBA cells and cells treated with d-2HG, we identified multiple enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, along with a variety of lipid transporters, including the highly upregulated CD36, a major regulator of fatty acid uptake in adipocytes and a key factor in LD growth46 (Fig. 6b and Extended Data Fig. 5e). Many of these transcripts were suppressed in cells overexpressing d-2HGDH (Fig. 6c). In parallel, transcripts encoding adipogenic regulators, such as Pparg and Cebpb, were upregulated in both CLPP-KO mBA cells and cells treated with d-2HG. By contrast, Ppargc1a, encoding PGC1α, was specifically induced in CLPP-deficient cells, consistent with underlying mitochondrial OXPHOS dysfunction (Fig. 6d). Remarkably, Cebpa expression appeared to be similarly influenced by mitochondrial dysfunction rather than d-2HG treatment (Fig. 6d). Conversely, cholesterol-biosynthesis genes were negatively enriched in both CLPP-deficient and d-2HG-treated cells; this change was also observed in BAT from all three CLPP-KO models (Extended Data Fig. 5f), highlighting a strong similarity between cells and tissues. Transcripts encoding SREBP1 and 2 (Srebf1, Srebf2) and their targets, including Hmgcr and Hmgcs1, which encode key catalysts of the initial rate-limiting steps of cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig. 6e). These changes coincided with reduced cellular cholesterol levels in both CLPP-deficient and d-2HG-treated cells, similar to the effect of simvastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig. 6f).

Together, these findings demonstrate that CLPP deficiency and d-2HG treatment induce similar changes in transcriptome and epigenome, that converge on chromatin regulation, adipogenic signalling and cholesterol metabolism, linking mitochondrial dysfunction to coordinated metabolic reprogramming.

GO enrichment analysis of transcriptional and H3K4me3 ChIP–seq changes in CLPP-deficient tissues and cells consistently identified terms related to cell adhesion, migration, actin cytoskeleton organization and transcriptional regulation (Figs. 2a and 5c,f and Supplementary Tables 1, 7 and 8). A major number of enriched transcripts mapped to the nucleus, nucleoplasm and perinuclear cytoplasm. This aligns with emerging evidence linking nuclear architecture to cellular stress responses. The overlap of nucleus-related transcripts between CLPP-KO and d-2HG-treated cells supports this connection (Extended Data Fig. 6a). GSEA further revealed strong negative enrichment of nuclear envelope-associated transcripts in CLPP-deficient BAT, closely matching the transcriptomic signature of d-2HG-treated cells (Extended Data Fig. 6b), suggesting that metabolic perturbations could influence nuclear and cellular morphology.

We next explored the link between d-2HG, epigenetic changes and nuclear phenotype. Ultrastructural analyses revealed pronounced nuclear deformation in CLPP-deficient brown adipocytes, characterized by mitochondria clustering near and indenting the nuclear envelope (Fig. 7a). The extent of mito-nuclear interactions in CLPP-deficient BAT could be further observed in a high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) reconstituted model using serial section array tomography (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Video 1). Although direct contact sites with shared membranes were not detected, the two membranes were closely positioned with very little intercalated ER (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d and Supplementary Video 2).

Quantification of mito-nuclear indentations revealed an increase from ~1.3 per nucleus in wild-type to ~2.9 in CLPP-deficient cells, with some nuclei displaying up to 10 invaginations (Fig. 7c), indicating that nuclear mechanics were altered. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we detected a significant reduction in nuclear stiffness in CLPP-deficient adipocytes, mimicked by d-2HG treatment of wild-type cells (Fig. 7d,e). Inhibition of PHGDH with NCT503, which lowers d-2HG levels, restored nuclear stiffness in CLPP-deficient cells (Fig. 7f). By contrast, ISRIB treatment did not significantly change d-2HG levels and had no effect on nuclear envelope stiffness (Extended Data Fig. 6e). These findings establish a functional link between altered metabolism and nuclear morphology, regulated by d-2HG, but independent of the classical ISR.

Cholesterol increases membrane stiffness, especially in saturated lipid environments, with a weaker effect in unsaturated lipid-rich membranes47. Although the nuclear envelope is mainly composed of unsaturated phospholipids, increased cholesterol synthesis has been linked to nuclear envelope stiffening and fragility48. Because CLPP-deficient and d-2HG-treated cells showed reduced cholesterol levels, we tested whether supplementation could restore nuclear stiffness. Cholesterol treatment significantly increased nuclear stiffness in both models, exceeding levels observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 7g). Conversely, treatment with simvastatin, a cholesterol-synthesis inhibitor, further decreased nuclear stiffness (Fig. 7g), highlighting cholesterol as a critical regulator of nuclear envelope mechanics.

To test whether these effects extend beyond CLPP deficiency, we treated wild-type mBA cells with actinonin, an inhibitor of OXPHOS biogenesis49. Short-term actinonin treatment significantly increased 2HG levels in wild-type mBA cells and modestly elevated lipid accumulation (Fig. 7h,i), suggesting that metabolic reprogramming occurs rapidly upon mitochondrial dysfunction. This was accompanied by a more than twofold reduction in nuclear stiffness (Fig. 7j), suggesting that OXPHOS impairment broadly influences nuclear mechanics through rapid metabolic rewiring.

Collectively, our findings reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction drives metabolic reprogramming that reshapes nuclear architecture and mechanics. We propose that PHGDH activation and subsequent d-2HG accumulation induce nuclear softening, which is reversible and cholesterol-sensitive (Fig. 7k). Although our study centres on BAT whitening and CLPP loss, similar metabolic–nuclear coupling is likely to occur in other contexts of OXPHOS dysfunction and lipid accumulation, warranting further investigation.

This study identifies a mechanism by which CLPP loss and resulting OXPHOS dysfunction drive LD expansion, a key feature of BAT whitening, through metabolic and epigenetic adaptation. LD enlargement and BAT whitening are observed in various models of mitochondrial dysfunction and are often linked to respiratory-chain deficiencies22,23,24. Although impaired fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is frequently proposed as a cause, direct mechanistic evidence is limited, as seen in models like adipocyte-specific TFAM deletion24. Other studies, such as the one conducted on Mfn2-deficient adipocytes, suggest that reduced lipolysis, rather than increased lipogenesis, underlies LD accumulation23. However, not all OXPHOS deficiencies result in larger LDs. For instance, mtDNA mutator mice exhibit BAT dysfunction without LD expansion, likely due to systemic metabolic constraints and a catabolic state that limits lipid storage50.

Interestingly, BAT-specific OPA1 loss leads to LD accumulation and reduced oxygen consumption but paradoxically enhances thermogenesis through FGF21 induction22. Conversely, OPA1 overexpression protects against diet-induced obesity by preventing BAT whitening and stimulating WAT browning, potentially through fumarate-driven activation of KDM3A51. These findings underscore the complexity of mitochondrial stress responses and their influence on adipocyte fate through metabolic–epigenetic cross-talk.

Our data suggest that LD expansion and BAT whitening in CLPP-deficient models are a stress response to mitochondrial dysfunction, rather than a direct consequence of respiratory failure. This phenotype was consistent across in vivo models and terminally differentiated CLPP-KO brown adipocytes. Although LDs are typically considered energy reservoirs, they also serve protective roles, buffering oxidative stress, mitigating endoplasmic-reticulum stress and sequestering harmful lipid species52. LD expansion can limit polyunsaturated fatty acid oxidation and reduce lipotoxicity, which is particularly important under mitochondrial dysfunction, during which acylcarnitines, ceramides and oxidized lipids can accumulate53. Thus, we propose that LD biogenesis acts as an adaptive mechanism to maintain redox balance and prevent metabolic toxicity52,53.

We further show that LD expansion is driven by increased d-2HG levels, produced through promiscuous activity of PHGDH40 in CLPP-deficient adipocytes. Exogenous d-2HG recapitulates the phenotype in wild-type cells, and transcriptomic analysis reveals shared signatures affecting lipid and cholesterol metabolism. PHGDH, a key enzyme in serine biosynthesis and one-carbon metabolism, is frequently upregulated in mitochondrial disease models5,6,7,54. Given its central role in the mitoISR, inhibiting PHGDH in mitochondrial disease models, such as Deletor mice, is detrimental54. Our findings suggest that PHGDH-derived d-2HG has an additional role in modulating lipid metabolism and chromatin architecture.

Although d-2HG is best known for its role in cancer, it also functions in hypoxia, immune-cell differentiation and metabolic disorders55. In tumours, it inhibits α-KG-dependent dioxygenases, such as TET2 and Jumonji-C demethylases, thereby altering DNA and histone methylation55. These changes can shift cell fate and are associated with increased repressive marks, such as H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, without widespread changes in DNA methylation56. d-2HG also exerts non-cell-autonomous effects; for example, tumour-derived d-2HG suppresses CD8⁺ T cell metabolism and function57. In accordance with this, we observed 2HG secretion from mature brown adipocytes, raising the possibility of systemic effects in CLPP-deficient animals.

Our findings reveal new functions for d-2HG, demonstrating its role in regulating nuclear mechanics in terminally differentiated cells. Both CLPP deficiency and d-2HG treatment led to nuclear softening, associated with increased H3K4me3 occupancy at promoter regions. This included lipid metabolic regulators involved in lipogenesis, lipolysis and transport, consistent with LD expansion. Notably, although H3K4me3 was enriched at the promoters of cholesterol-biosynthesis genes, their expression and total cholesterol levels were reduced. This indicates that there are additional regulatory layers influenced by d-2HG.

Cholesterol is essential for membrane rigidity, including at the nuclear envelope. We show that cholesterol depletion causes nuclear envelope softening, whereas supplementation restores nuclear stiffness in CLPP-deficient and d-2HG-treated cells. This aligns with prior work showing that staurosporine-induced mitochondrial dysfunction alters mitochondria–nucleus interactions and cholesterol distribution58. Similarly, in yeast, oxygen deprivation enhances the impact of saturated lipids, leading to nuclear envelope rigidification and rupture, while revealing a protective role for LDs in buffering membrane composition and preserving nuclear envelope integrity59. Our data suggest that, in brown adipocytes, LD expansion might serve a similar protective role for the nuclear envelope.

Recent studies have shown that, under mechanical confinement, mitochondria migrate toward the nucleus, resulting in increased nuclear ATP to support chromatin reorganization and DNA repair60. Nuclear stiffness depends on both the nuclear lamina and heterochromatin, which provides structural support and mechanical resistance61. Cells sense deformation through nuclear envelope stretching, which triggers membrane phospholipid restructuring and actomyosin cytoskeleton changes61. Loss of heterochromatin has been linked to nuclear envelope softening and nuclear wrinkling61,62. In CLPP-deficient models and upon d-2HG treatment, we consistently observed changes in transcripts and proteins related to actomyosin cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion and migration, consistent with responses seen under mechanical confinement60,62.

In conclusion, our study links mitochondrial dysfunction to nuclear reshaping, showing how CLPP loss and d-2HG-driven metabolic rewiring affect gene expression and nuclear structure to promote lipid-droplet accumulation. We identified d-2HG as a key mediator in this process, accumulating in CLPP-deficient BAT owing to increased PHGDH activity. This metabolite reshapes the epigenetic landscape by enriching H3K4me3 histone marks on promoters of lipid-metabolism regulators, orchestrating a shift toward LD accumulation, likely as a protective sink for potentially lipotoxic intermediates. Additionally, our findings highlight an unexpected interplay between cholesterol metabolism, cytoskeletal organization and nuclear mechanics, showing that changes in cholesterol availability contribute to nuclear softening. Although our focus is on brown adipocytes, these findings could extend broadly to tissues undergoing mitochondrial stress, with relevance to ageing, metabolic disease and cancer. By connecting mitochondrial dysfunction, chromatin reorganization, lipid metabolism and nuclear mechanics, our study provides a framework for understanding adaptive tissue remodelling in mitochondrial disorders.

All mice analysed in this study were bred and housed at the CECAD Research Center animal facility, University of Cologne. All experiments were conducted in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved by local government authorities (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen; LANUV). Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages at 22–24 °C under a 12-h light–dark cycle, with lights on at 06:00. They had ad libitum access to water and a standard chow diet (ssniff rat/mouse low-phytoestrogen diet). For breeding, one male was paired with one to two females of similar age, with mating initiated at a minimum age of 8 weeks. Body weight was recorded weekly for individual mice from 4 to 16 weeks of age.

The mice used in this study were derived from a line with a conditional Clpp gene targeting, as previously described29. To generate whole-body CLPP-KO mice (Clpp−/−), Clppfl/fl mice were crossed with transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the β-actin promoter. Mice with adipose-tissue-specific knockout were generated by crossing Clppfl/fl mice with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the Adipoq promoter (Adipoq-cre mice)30 or the Ucp1 promoter (Ucp1-cre mice)31.

Each day for 15 days, 14-month-old male mice were intraperitoneally injected daily with vehicle (ethanol (5%), PEG400 (35%) and 30% cyclodextrin (60%)), in which NCT503 was dissolved. NCT-503 was freshly prepared prior to the injections. For the injection solution, 20 μM stock was dissolved in the vehicle and was administered to the mice at serum-stable concentrations of 40 mg kg−1 body weight42.

After dissection, the entire adipose tissues were placed in tissue cassettes (Roth) and fixed in 5% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were then stored in PBS until they sank to the bottom. The next day, they were dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations (30%, 50%, 70%, 96% and twice in 100%) for 2 h at each step, followed by two 2-h incubations in xylol. Finally, tissues were embedded in paraffin blocks. The fixed BAT and inguinal WAT (iWAT) were sectioned at 5-μm thickness using a microtome (Leica) and mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides (VWR). Paraffin-embedded BAT sections were deparaffinized in xylol and rehydrated through decreasing ethanol concentrations, followed by a wash in tap water. Sections were stained with Meyer's haematoxylin, rinsed and then counterstained with eosin. Sections were then dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations, cleared in xylol and mounted with entellan.

Adipose tissue samples were immersion-fixed in 2% formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (Applichem) and washed four times in the same buffer. Post-fixation was performed with 2% OsO₄ (Science Services) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer at 4 °C, followed by additional washes. Samples were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series (50%, 70%, 90%, 3×100%), treated with ethanol and propylene oxide and infiltrated with epon and propylenoxide at gradually increasing concentrations of epon. Samples were embedded in PELCO 21-cavity molds (Plano) and cured at 60 °C.

Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were cut using an ultramicrotome (Leica UC6) with a 45° diamond knife (Diatome). Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and imaged using a JEM-2100 Plus TEM (JEOL) operating at 80 kV, equipped with a OneView 4 K camera (Gatan).

Ribbons of five consecutive ultrathin sections were collected on Pioloform-coated slot grids (Science Services). A total of 60 sections were imaged for 3D reconstruction. Images were aligned using FIJI (TrakEM2 plugin), and nucleus, mitochondria and lipid droplets were manually segmented in Microscope Imaging Browser (MIB, v2.82). The final model was processed in IMARIS (v9.9.1) for 3D reconstruction.

Transmission electron micrographs (TEMs) at ×2,500 magnification were used to quantify mitochondria in wild-type and knockout conditions. Forty-eight images per condition were captured from random sample positions. Mitochondrial quantification was performed using unbiased counting frames in ImageJ (Fiji). For each image, a 3×3 grid of counting frames covering 25% of the image was randomly placed. Mitochondria fully enclosed or intersecting permissive lines were counted; those intersecting restrictive lines were excluded. The multi-point tool in Fiji was used for tracking. The numerical density (N) of mitochondria was calculated as: N = (number of mitochondria / number of counting frames) × area per frame (µm²).

Low-magnification TEM micrographs (×80–150 magnification) were acquired, including 20 images from knockout and 12 from wild-type samples. The largest possible rectangular sample regions were extracted using Fiji, excluding grid and void areas. For 12 images per condition, 512×512 pixel regions were cropped and segmented using the Cellpose cyto3 model. Segmentation results were saved as ImageJ ROI files, manually corrected in QuPath and re-applied to all extracted regions using a refined Cellpose model. Lipid-droplet number and size were measured using a FIJI macro. A guard zone (15% of image diameter) was applied to exclude lipid droplets cut off by image borders. To avoid biased exclusion, the lower and left boundaries were restrictive (excluding intersecting droplets), while the upper and right boundaries were permissive (including intersecting droplets).

A six-well plate was prepared with BAT collagenase digestion buffer (123 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl₂, 5 mM glucose and 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) on ice. Sterile equipment (Falcon tubes, reaction tubes, syringes, cannulas and a dish) was disinfected with 70% ethanol. The two brown fat pads were dissected from newborn mice, placed in collagenase digestion buffer, minced with scissors and transferred to a Falcon tube on ice. A tail tip was collected in a reaction tube for genotyping. For collagenase digestion, Falcon tubes were incubated in a water bath with gentle shaking until complete tissue dissociation. The suspension was drawn into syringes using 0.9 × 70 mm (20 G × 2) cannulas, then filtered through a 100-μm nylon mesh into a fresh Falcon tube. The middle phase was carefully collected, avoiding the upper (mature adipocytes) and lower (tissue remnants) phases. The suspension was then filtered through a 30-μm nylon mesh and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in brown adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cell culture medium and transferred to a six-well plate for further analyses.

Primary brown adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cells (passage 0) were immortalized 24 h post-isolation through lentiviral transduction with a virus expressing SV40 large T-Antigen (L-TAg) under the PGK promoter. Immortalized brown preADs (mBA) were expanded in mBA growth medium at 37 °C, 5% CO₂. The virus solution was thawed and centrifuged at 16,000g, and 200 ng viral reverse transcriptase (per well of a 6-well plate) was mixed with 800 μl brown adipocyte (BA) growth medium (high-glucose DMEM without pyruvate). After removing the culture medium, cells were exposed to viral medium, followed by PBS washes and replacement with fresh BA growth medium.

Cells were maintained in growth medium at 37 °C, 5% CO₂, ensuring cultures did not reach full confluence. For passaging, cells were detached through trypsinization, resuspended in growth medium, and centrifuged at 200g. Pellets were resuspended in growth medium and mixed 1:1 with freezing medium to achieve a final DMSO concentration of 10% at a cell density of 1 million cells ml−1. Cell suspensions were transferred to cryogenic vials (1 ml per vial) and stored at −80 °C, followed by transfer to liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) for long-term storage.

In each well of a six-well plate, 1.8 × 10⁵ cells were seeded in growth medium (day –4). Once confluent, the medium was replaced with differentiation medium (growth medium + 0.5 µg ml−1 insulin + 1 nM triiodothyronine) (day –2). Adipogenic differentiation was induced by switching to freshly prepared induction medium (growth medium + 5 µM dexamethasone + 250 µM IBMX (3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) + 0.5 µg ml−1 insulin + 1 nM triiodothyronine (day 0). After induction, cells were maintained in BA differentiation medium, which was replenished every second day. By day 8, cells were fully differentiated into mature brown adipocytes.

Treatments were initiated from day 3 upon switching to differentiation medium: actinonin (150 μM, DMSO; applied for 96 h, with replacement every second day); NCT-503 (20 μM, DMSO; applied for 72 h, with replacement every 24 h); octyl d-2HG (500 μM, DMSO; applied for 72 h, with replacement every 24 h); and ISRIB (1 μM, DMSO; applied for 72 h, with daily renewal).

Cells were washed with PBS and stained with 1× BODIPY solution in PBS in the dark. After staining, cells were trypsinized, and trypsinization was stopped with FACS buffer (PBS + 2% BSA). The cell suspension was filtered through a 60-μm strainer and transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes for analysis. The gating strategy used for flow cytometry analysis is provided in Supplementary Figure 1a.

Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 10% formalin for 30 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed twice with water, followed by a 5-min wash with 60% isopropanol at room temperature. The cells were then completely dried. A working solution of Oil red O (ORO) was added to the wells and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After incubation, cells were washed four times with water, and images were acquired for further analysis. The ORO stock solution was prepared as 0.35% ORO in isopropanol, and the working solution was prepared with 60% of ORO stock in water.

Cells were seeded and differentiated on coverslips before direct fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature, followed by washes with PBS. Blocking was performed with 5% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS at 4 °C, followed by PBS washes. Secondary antibodies were applied in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS in the dark, followed by final PBS washes. Coverslips were dipped in water, mounted on elvanol and imaged using an SP8 confocal microscope (Inverse, DMi 8 CS, Leica Microsystems).

To assess lipolytic activity in BAT from CLPP-KO and control mice, mice were fasted for 6 h, and BAT pads were excised under sterile conditions. Tissues were digested with collagenase type 2 (Worthington Biomedical) in Krebs-Ringer Solution (KRH) + 1% BSA. For each condition, BAT adipocytes from 4–5 mice were pooled, and 150,000–200,000 isolated adipocytes were incubated in KRH buffer + 4% BSA with either 15 nM isoproterenol (ISO) or 10 μM forskolin. Lipolysis was assessed by measuring free glycerol release in the supernatant using Free Glycerol Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), with absorbance recorded on a Synergy H1 plate reader (BioTEK). Glycerol content was normalized to total protein content, determined by the Pierce Bradford Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific).

Oxygen consumption in BAT tissue lysates was measured using an OROBOROS Oxygraph-2K electrode at 37 °C with magnetic stirring. Samples were placed in 2 ml incubation medium (containing EGTA, MgCl₂, K-lactobionate, taurine, KH₂PO₄, HEPES, sucrose and BSA; pH 7.1). In vitro respiration levels were recorded at steady state, followed by sequential addition of the following substrates: endogenous (state 1), ADP (state 2), succinate (state 3), oligomycin (state 4) and FCCP (uncoupled respiration). Respiration rates were normalized to total protein content.

Mitochondrial OCR and ECAR were measured using the Seahorse Bioscience XFe-96 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies) following the standard mitochondrial stress test protocol. Differentiated mBA cells (day 8) were assayed. Cells were washed with unbuffered assay medium (DMEM without phenol red, supplemented with glucose, sodium pyruvate and glutamine) and incubated in a CO₂-free incubator at 37 °C. The sensor cartridge was hydrated and injection ports were loaded with oligomycin (1 μM), FCCP (1.5 μM) and rotenone-antimycin A (1 μM each) before calibration. The assay was then performed, and post-measurement normalization was conducted using BioTek Cytation 5 (Agilent Technologies) with Hoechst 33342 staining for cell counting. Data analysis was performed using Seahorse XFe Wave Software (Agilent). Basal respiration, leak respiration, maximal respiration and acidification were calculated on the basis of OCR and ECAR values before and after specific injections, with non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption corrected using rotenone and antimycin A.

AFM measurements were performed on cell monolayers plated on silicon elastomers using the JPK NanoWizard 4 XP (Bruker Nano) atomic force microscope mounted on Zeiss AxioObserver inverted fluorescent microscope and operated through JPK SPM Control Software v.5. Triangular non-conductive silicon nitride cantilevers (MLCT, Bruker Daltonics) with a nominal spring constant of 0.01 N m−1 were used for the nanoindentation experiments of the apical surface of cells and the nucleus. For all indentation experiments, forces of up to 3 nN were applied, and the velocities of the cantilever approach and retraction were kept constant at 2 μm s−1, ensuring an indentation depth of 500 nm. All analyses were performed with JPK Data Processing Software (Bruker Nano). Before fitting the Hertz model corrected by the tip geometry to obtain Young's modulus (Poisson's ratio of 0.5), the offset was removed from the baseline, the contact point was identified, and cantilever bending was subtracted from all force curves.

To overexpress d-2HGDH in wild-type and CLPP-KO mBA cells, a lentiviral transfer plasmid encoding d-2HGDH–hemagglutinin (HA) (VectorBuilder) was used. Lentivirus was produced in HEK293FT cells via cotransfection of the d-2HGDH–HA plasmid with psPAX2 (Addgene plasmid no. 12260) and pMD2.G (Addgene plasmid no. 12259) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Viral supernatants were collected, pooled, clarified by centrifugation and concentrated with Lenti-X Concentrator (Takara Bio). The viral pellet was resuspended in PBS, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.

Wild-type and CLPP-KO mBA cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transduced with 10 μl concentrated lentivirus in 6 μg ml−1 polybrene. After 24 h, the medium was replaced, and cells were expanded before puromycin selection (2 μg ml−1, 48 h).

The PHGDH activity assay was performed using the ab273328 kit (Abcam), following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells in a 6-well plate were washed with PBS, homogenized on-plate in PHGDH Assay Buffer and centrifuged at 10,000g, 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and total protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay. Then, 30 μg of protein was loaded into a 96-well plate, with the final volume adjusted to 50 μl using PHGDH assay buffer. A NADH standard curve was generated using dilutions of 1.25 mM NADH standard, and a PHGDH positive control was prepared. A reaction mix of assay buffer and developer was added to all wells. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured in kinetic mode at 37 °C using an EnSpire plate reader.

Total RNA was isolated from mouse BAT and primary adipocytes using TRIzol (Life Technologies) or TRI reagent (Sigma), followed by purification with RPE buffer (Qiagen). Tissues were homogenized in 1 ml TRIzol using ceramic beads (Mobio, Dianova) in a FastPrep homogenizer (MP Biomedicals) at 5,500 r.p.m. After incubation at room temperature, 200 μl chloroform was added, mixed and centrifuged at 12,000g, 4 °C. The aqueous RNA-containing phase was collected and precipitated with 500 μl isopropanol, followed by washing with 75% ethanol and resuspension in ultrapure H2O. RNA was incubated at 60 °C before a concentration and purity assessment using a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Peqlab). For DNase treatment, 10 μg RNA was digested with DNase I (New England Biolabs) in 10× digestion buffer. DNase was inactivated at 75 °C, and the RNA concentration was reassessed before storage at −80 °C. The RNA quality was validated using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Isolated RNA was treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs) to digest the residual DNA, following the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration of the samples was adjusted to 200 ng µl−1. Next, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from the digested samples using the High-Capacity Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions were performed in 384-well plates using the Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies), according to the manufacturer's instructions; 50 ng of cDNA was added to each reaction. The standard programme was run at the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Fisher Scientific). The qPCR data were collected using the QuantStudio 12 K Flex Software v1.6 (Applied Biosystems). Relative expression of the target gene was calculated by normalization to endogenous control gene (Hprt) and was quantified using the 2−ΔΔCt method.

BAT was collected, rinsed in PBS, weighed and minced with fine scissors. The minced tissue was suspended in SHE-BSA buffer (50 mM sucrose, 5 mM HEPES, 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.2, 2% FFA BSA) at 1 ml per 100 mg tissue. Homogenization was performed using a glass-Teflon electric homogenizer (7 strokes) followed by a glass-glass Dounce homogenizer (13 strokes). The homogenate was transferred to a 50-ml Falcon tube, and residual tissue was washed out with SHE-BSA buffer. Centrifugation at 900g (4 °C) separated the fractions. The supernatant, containing cytoplasmic mitochondria, was carefully collected using a syringe, avoiding disruption of the floating fat layer or debris pellet. The fat layer, containing lipid-associated PDMs, was scraped into a new tube, resuspended in SHE-BSA buffer, and vigorously shaken to emulsify the fat and release PDMs. Both fractions (cytoplasmic mitochondria and PDMs) were centrifuged at 9,000g (4 °C), and pellets were washed in SHE-BSA buffer, transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged again. The final pellets were resuspended in SHE buffer without BSA for immediate analysis or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. BAT was collected and rinsed twice in PBS.

BAT pads were homogenized in 700–800 μl cold organ lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaF, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM Na-orthovanadate, 2 mM PMSF, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), 1× PhosphoSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) using 1.4 mm ceramic beads (Omni International) in a Precellys tissue homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) at 5,500 r.p.m. (2 × 20 s, 30 s pause). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20,000g, 4 °C, 45 min) and transferred to fresh tubes.

Cells were washed with PBS and lysed on-plate using RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional vortexing, followed by 10 cycles of sonication (30-s intervals, 4 °C) using the Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode). Cell debris was pelleted (14,000g, 4 °C, 15 min), and the supernatant was collected.

In both cases, the protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay (Sigma-Aldrich), following the manufacturer's instructions. Lysates were stored at −80 °C.

Proteins were separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) using the Mini-PROTEAN Tetra Cell (BioRad). Fifty micrograms of protein lysate was mixed with Laemmli buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 12.5 mM EDTA, 0.02% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8) and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were loaded onto an 8–12% polyacrylamide gel alongside a PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Electrophoresis was performed at 90 V until the loading dye reached the separating gel, followed by 150 V until completion in running buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3).

Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using the Criterion Blotter (BioRad) through wet transfer at 400 mA in transfer buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, 240 mM glycine, 0.037% SDS, 20% methanol) at 4 °C. Transfer efficiency was assessed with Ponceau-S staining (Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk-PBST, 3% BSA-TBST or 2% fish skin gelatin-TBST, depending on antibody requirements.

Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, followed by three 5-min washes in PBST or TBST. Secondary antibody incubation was performed at room temperature, followed by additional washes. Detection was performed using ECL solution (GE Healthcare), and membranes were exposed to Super RX films (Fujifilm), developed using an automatic film processor (Kodak) and scanned with a V800 Transparency Scanner (Epson) at 600 dpi, 16-bit grayscale.

Blue native (BN)–PAGE was performed using the NativePAGE Novex Bis-Tris Gel System (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of mitochondria were lysed in 4% digitonin, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation (20,000g, 4 °C). Supernatants were mixed with loading dye (50% glycerol, 5% Coomassie) and loaded onto 4–16% native acrylamide gels (Life Technologies). Electrophoresis was conducted at 4 °C, 150 mV. Antibodies used for BN–PAGE were as follows: ATP5A1 (Abcam ab14748) 1:1,000; NDUFA9 (Molecular Probes 459100) 1:1,000; NDUFV1 (Proteintech 11238-1-AP) 1:1,000; SDHA (Molecular Probes 459200) 1:10,000; UQCRC1 (Molecular Probe 459140) 1:1,000.

After BN–PAGE, the gel was washed and incubated in NADH-nitrotetrazolium blue solution (0.1 mg ml−1 NADH, 2.5 mg ml−1 nitrotetrazolium blue, 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for complex I activity. Gels were then destained in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid and rehydrated in double-distilled H₂O. For complex V activity, the gel was incubated in assay buffer (35 mM Tris-HCl, 270 mM glycine, 14 mM magnesium sulfate, 0.075% lead nitrate, 0.8 mM ATP, pH 7.8, 20% methanol). ATP hydrolysis was visualized as a white band of precipitated lead phosphate. The reaction was stopped with 50% methanol, and the gel was rinsed with deionized water. The gel was documented using a V800 Transparency Scanner (Epson).

The entire piece of frozen adipose tissue was ground to powder in liquid nitrogen and after the liquid nitrogen evaporated, the powder was resuspended in 100 μl of the urea lysis buffer (8 M urea; 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB); 1× protease inhibitor). The sample solution was subjected to sonication with the Bioruptor Pico sonication machine (Diagenode) with a cycle of 30 s on and 30 s off for 10 min. Afterwards, the sample was centrifuged at 20,000g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet the debris, which was discarded after centrifugation. The protein concentration of the samples was determined using the Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich), according to the manual, and 55 μg of each sample was transferred to a new tube. The sample was treated with dithiothreitol (DTT, final concentration 5 mM) and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. Then, chloroacetamide was added final concentration 40 mM) and incubated for 30 min in the dark. This was followed by treatment with lysyl endopeptidase (Lys-C), at a protease to sample protein ratio of 1/75 and then incubated for 4 h at 25 °C. The sample was next diluted with 50 mM TEAB buffer to reach a final concentration of ≤2 M urea. Then, trypsin was added at a 1:75 ratio, and trypsinisation was performed overnight at 25 °C with mild agitation. The following day, the sample was acidified with formic acid (final concentration 1%) to stop the digestion. Next, lysates were loaded on SDB RP StageTips supplied by the CECAD proteomics core facility and submitted to the facility for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, following the standard procedures of the facility. The raw data were analysed with the MaxQuant proteomics software. The samples were analysed by CECAD proteomics facility.

mRNA sequencing was performed in-house using 1 μg total RNA for library preparation with the NEBNext RNA Prep Kit, followed by paired-end (2×50 bp) sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (Gencode vM25) using STAR aligner (v2.7.9a). Gene features were counted using featureCounts (v2.0.3), and genes with low expression levels were filtered out using edgeR (v4.0.16) with the filterByExpr function. For the Embryo Inject dataset, a more rigorous filtering approach was applied (with a minimum count of 40). Differential expression analysis was conducted using edgeR's voomLmFit function with sample quality weights (sample.weights = TRUE) in a linear model (0 + group), where ‘group' represented the experimental conditions. Genes with an adjusted P < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed.

To assess whether genotype-specific differences in bulk gene expression were influenced by cell-type composition, the BisqueRNA R package was used to estimate cell-type proportions from bulk RNA-seq read counts. The Shamsi et al. dataset was selected as a single-cell reference owing to its similar tissue origin34. Because only marker genes for UMAP clusters were available, the original UMAP projection was reconstructed and clustered using the Seurat FindClusters function (resolution, 1.4). However, later analyses suggested that a resolution of 0.4 might have been a better choice. For consistency with the original procedure, Seurat v3.0 and R v3.6.2 were used.

Cell-type scoring was performed using UCell (v2.0.1), with the ten strongest positive and negative marker genes per cluster. Because UCell scores alone do not always provide unique assignments, two approaches were tested. The first was clustering the ucell score matrix: the ComplexHeatmap package (v2.12.1) was used to cluster cells by their UCell scores, revealing groups of related cell types. However, owing to memory constraints, clustering was performed on 200 random sub-matrices, and thresholds for defining clusters remained arbitrary. The second was identifying high-scoring cell types in UMAP clusters: a one-sided t-test compared each cell type's UCell score distribution within a cluster to its global distribution. If only one cell type showed significant enrichment, the cluster was uniquely assigned. If multiple cell types were significant, a coarse classification was applied. For bulk deconvolution, only samples collected at room temperature were used, restricted to genes present in both datasets (18,953 genes, 22,219 cells)34. Cell-type assignments were based on resolution-0.4 clustering, with a stringent inclusion threshold (P ≤ 2.225074 × 10−308). This resulted in 15 cell types, of which B_cells and VSM_1_cells were not composite. After removing 738 unassigned cells, 21,481 cells remained. BisqueRNA was applied to the salmon.merged.gene_counts_length_scaled.tsv bulk dataset, using only BAT samples, analyzing one genotype at a time, and restricting genes to those also found in the single-cell dataset.

To determine whether BAT genotypes differed in cell-type composition, the predicted coarse cell-type proportions were examined. However, high variability in genotype replicates made it difficult to draw statistical conclusions. Additionally, proportion data are compositional, meaning changes in one cell type's frequency inherently affect the others. Instead of statistical analysis, a visual representation was developed: Seurat UMAP coordinates were extracted. Ggplot2 was used to colour cells by their assigned coarse cell type, with predicted proportions coded by transparency in the bulk dataset. This approach revealed that resolution-0.4 clustering corresponded more clearly to high-level UMAP features than did resolution-1.4 clustering, suggesting that 0.4 might be the better choice of resolution.

ChIP–seq libraries were prepared from four biological replicates per condition (WT, KO, WT + 2HG). First, 1 × 10⁷ cells per condition were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, quenched with glycine (0.125 M), washed in PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% TritonX-100) with protease inhibitors and homogenized in a pre-chilled dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted, washed with wash buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA) and resuspended in shearing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0). Chromatin was sonicated using a Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode) for 70 cycles. For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), 30 μg of DNA was incubated with 5 μl H3K4me3 antibody (Active Motif, 39159) in 1% Triton X-100 and 150 mM NaCl. Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were prewashed with IP buffer, added to the immunoprecipitated chromatin and washed sequentially with TSE-150, TSE-500, LiCl and TE buffers. DNA was eluted in PK digestion buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) with RNAse A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and proteinase K, followed by reverse cross-linking with NaCl (0.3 M). DNA purification was performed using the Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel). For library preparation, up to 100 ng ChIP DNA underwent end repair, A-tailing and adapter ligation, followed by PCR amplification (12–15 cycles). Libraries were validated (TapeStation, Agilent Technologies), quantified (Qubit, Invitrogen), pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (paired-end 2×100 bp protocol).

Raw FASTQ files were processed using the SnakePipes pipeline63. In brief, fastq files were trimmed with fastp using the following parameters: -–trim_poly_g–-trim_poly_x -Q -L–-correction. Trimmed reads were mapped to the GRCm39 mouse reference genome with BWA–MEM, and peaks were called using Genrich, which integrates replicate data by computing P values per replicate and combining them using Fisher's method to generate q values for peak calling. Coverage plots and heatmaps generated using deeptools. Peak count frequency at the TSS sites and feature distribution of all identified peaks performed using ChIPseeker. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and GO analyses were conducted as described previously, focusing on differentially enriched H3K4me3 peaks within ±2 kbp of promoter regions. Data visualization was conducted using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (https://igv.org) and custom plots.

GSEA analysis was performed using GSEA v4.3.2 (Windows application, build 13) with default settings64. Data visualization was conducted using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (web-based version)65 and custom plots.

For single-cell suspensions, bone marrow was extracted from the femur of adult mice by flushing with 10 ml of FACS buffer using a 27-G needle and syringe, then passed through a 40-µm strainer. BAT was dissected and immediately transferred to ice-cold digestion solution. Tissues were cut in small pieces with scissors and incubated in digestion solution containing collagenase IV (1 mg ml−1), and DNase I (0.01 mg ml−1) in RPMI for 40 min at 37 °C in the shaker. Digestion was stopped by adding 10% FBS on ice. Tissue homogenates where smashed and washed with FACS buffer against a 70-µm strainer using the back of a syringe. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml red blood cell lysis buffer (Roche) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature for lysis of erythrocytes.

Subsequently, 10 ml FACS buffer (5% FCS in PBS) was added and cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were pre-incubated with fix viability dye in PBS (1:1,000) for 10 min at room temperature; for BAT, a mix of anti-mouse-FcγIII/II-receptor (CD16/CD32) blocking antibodies (1:500) was added. After being washed with FACS buffer, cells were stained with the fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (1:100 0.25–1 μg; listed below). Only BAT cells were fixed and permeabilized using the FoxP3 kit, following the manufacturer's instructions, and were then incubated with antibodies to iNOS and Arg-1 for 20 min at room temperature for intracellular staining. After washing and filtering, cells were resuspended in 500 µl (BM) or 250 µl (BAT) FACS buffer, and 25 µl of counting beads were added to the samples (at a concentration of 1,000 beads per µl) to obtain absolute numbers. For absolute quantification, the following equation was used: absolute count (cells µl−1) = (cell count × counting beads volume) / (counting bead count × sample volume) × counting bead concentration.

Each population was expressed in absolute numbers (cells µl−1), and BAT results were further normalized to the initial tissue weight (g) for comparison across samples. Cells were acquired on a FACS Symphony A3 flow cytometer (BD) using Diva software (BD) and further analysed using FlowJo analytical software (FlowJo version 10.0.8). Owing to inadequate result quality, data collected for iNOS and Arg-1 were excluded from further analysis. Compensation beads were use to generate compensation panel and calculated by diva software before sample acquisition. Background fluorescence levels of iNOS, Arg-1, CD80 and CD80 were determined using Fluorescence Minus One (FMO), although data from these populations were excluded owing to low cell counts. The buffers used were as follows: FACS buffer (5 mg BSA + 5 ml EDTA 0.4 M + 500 ml of PBS); digestion buffer (250 µl DNase I (Merck, 200,000 U µl−1), 0.2 mg ml−1 Liberase (Roche) and 1 mg ml−1 collagenase IV in RPMI medium). The details of the antibodies used can be found in the reporting summary. The gating strategy used can be visualized in Supplementary Figure 1b,c.

Metabolite extraction solution (50% methanol, 30% acetonitrile (ACN), 20% water, 5 µM valine-d8 as an internal standard) was added to 10–20-mg frozen BAT or iWAT tissue samples at an extraction ratio of 25 µl mg−1 on dry ice. Samples were then homogenized using a Precellys 24 tissue homogenizer (Bertin Technologies). The resulting sample suspension was vortexed, mixed at 4 °C in a Thermomixer for 15 min at 1,500 r.p.m. and then centrifuged at 16,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected for liquid chromatography–MS (LC–MS) analysis.

The cells were counted at seeding to estimate the amount of extraction solution to use. Using 500 μl extraction buffer per 106 cells is the recommended starting point, although the ratio might need to be optimized for certain cell types in a separate pilot experiment. The medium was removed from wells, and cells were washed quickly (less than 10 s) with PBS twice at room temperature. Extra PBS was carefully removed by inverting the plate over a piece of tissue paper. After the last wash, each well was aspirated quickly to remove all residual PBS. The plate was placed on dry ice, and 500 μl of extraction buffer was added per 1,000,000 cells. The plate was gently swirled such that cells were covered by the extraction buffer. The plate was incubated for 20 min on a dry ice–methanol bath to break cell membranes. The cells were scraped off the plate and the entire suspension was transferred into prechilled Eppendorf tubes. The cell-extract suspension was shaken for 15 min at 4 °C in a Thermomixer at maximum speed (Thermomixer set at 4 °C and placed in a cold room for this step). The tubes were then centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C at maximum speed (13,000 r.p.m. or higher). Only the top 80% of the supernatant was collected and put into prelabelled autosampler vials, taking care not to disturb the solid debris. A pooled sample was prepared by taking 10 μl of each sample from the same matrix. Samples were stored at –80 °C until further analysis.

Eighty microliters of cell culture medium was taken and centrifuged for 5 min (4 °C) at maximum speed to eliminate dead cells. Fifty microliters of the supernatant was taken and added to a prelabelled Eppendorf tube containing 350 μl of extraction solution on dry ice. The samples were mixed for 15 min in a Thermomixer at 4 °C at maximum speed, followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C at maximum speed (13,000 r.p.m. or higher). The top 80% of the supernatant was carefully transferred into an autosampler vial, taking care not to disturb the insoluble debris. A pooled sample was prepared by mixing equal volumes of each sample extract in a single vial. Samples were stored at –80 °C until further analysis.

Hydrophilic interaction chromatographic (HILIC) separation of the targeted metabolite (2HG) was achieved using a Millipore Sequant ZIC-pHILIC analytical column (5 μm, 2.1×150 mm) equipped with a 2.1×20-mm guard column (both 5-mm particle size) with a binary solvent system. Solvent A was 20 mM ammonium carbonate, 0.05% ammonium hydroxide; Solvent B was ACN. The column oven and autosampler tray were held at 40 °C and 4 °C, respectively. The chromatographic gradient was run at a flow rate of 0.200 ml min−1 as follows: 0–2 min, 80% B; 2–17 min, linear gradient from 80% B to 20% B; 17–17.1 min, linear gradient from 20% B to 80% B; 17.1–23 min, hold at 80% B. Samples were randomized, and the injection volume was 5 μl. A pooled quality control sample was generated from an equal mixture of all individual samples and analysed interspersed at regular intervals. Metabolites were measured with Vanquish Horizon UHPLC coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 240 mass spectrometer (both Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a heated electrospray ionization source. The spray voltages were set to –2.8 kV, the RF lens value was set at 70, the heated capillary was held at 320 °C and the auxiliary gas heater was held at 280 °C. The flow rate for sheath gas, aux gas and sweep gas were set to 40, 15 and 0, respectively. For MS1 scans, the mass range was set to m/z = 100–600, AGC target set to standard and maximum injection time set to auto. Data acquisition for experimental samples used full scan and selected ion monitoring (SIM) modes (targeting 2HG m/z = 147.0299) at an Orbitrap resolution of 120,000 in negative mode.

The identity of metabolite 2HG was verified based on two criteria: (1) the precursor ion m/z corresponded to within 3 p.p.m. of the expected mass derived from its chemical structure, and (2) the retention duration was within a 5% range compared with that of a purified reference sample analysed using the identical chromatography technique. The examination of chromatograms and integration of peak areas was carried out using the Tracefinder software (v5.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peak area of each identified metabolite was adjusted on the basis of the total ion count of the respective sample to compensate for any discrepancies arising from sample preparation or instrument assessment. These measurements were done in collaboration with the Frezza lab at the CECAD Research Center.

TSPC derivatization was performed for LC–electrospray ionization–tandem MS (LC–ESI–MS/MS) analysis, under optimized conditions. Tissue supernatant was dried under nitrogen gas at 37 °C, resuspended in TSPC (2.5 mM in ACN) and pyridine and derivatized. The mixture was dried again, redissolved in 50% aqueous ACN containing phthalic acid, and 10 μl was injected into the LC–ESI–MS/MS system.

Quantification of TSPC-labeled d-2HG and l-2HG was performed on an AB 3200 QTRAP mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) coupled to a Shimadzu LC-20AD HPLC. HPLC separation was conducted using an Inertsil ODS-3 column (250 × 2.0 mm, 5 μm) at 35 °C, with a formic acid–water (0.1%) and ACN–methanol (50:50) gradient at 0.2 ml min−1. Detection was performed with multiple reaction monitoring in negative-ion mode with optimized transitions for 2HG and phthalic acid. For comparison, the derivatization of d-2HG and l-2HG with diacetyl-l-tartaric anhydride (DATAN) was also performed, and the detailed procedure has been previously published66. Additional HR–MS experiments were conducted on a MicrOTOF-Q mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) with an ESI source, using optimized parameters for maximal detection sensitivity.

Cholesterol levels in mBAs were determined using LC–ESI–MS/MS. Adipose tissue was homogenized in Milli-Q water using a Precellys 24 Homogenizer, and protein content was measured using the Bradford assay. Lipids were extracted using the one-step extraction method67. For extraction, homogenized samples were mixed with chloroform, methanol, hydrochloric acid and cholesterol-d7 (internal standard). Lipid extracts were dried under nitrogen, resuspended in ammonium acetate in methanol, sonicated and centrifuged. Supernatants were analysed via LC–ESI–MS/MS using a Core-Shell Kinetex C18 column on a QTRAP 6500 mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX). UHPLC was performed isocratically with a 5 mM ammonium acetate–methanol mobile phase at 300 μl min−1. Cholesterol and cholesterol-d7 were detected in positive-ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring transitions. Endogenous cholesterol was quantified using an external calibration curve, normalized to protein content, and analysed with MultiQuant 3.0.3 software.

Statistical significance was evaluated using tests appropriate for the distribution and design of each experiment. Depending on the context, paired two-tailed Student's t-tests, one-way ANOVA or Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were applied, as specified in the individual figure legends. Error bars indicate the s.d. unless otherwise noted. Statistical significance is reported as P values, denoted by asterisks (P < 0.05, *P < 0.01, **P < 0.001, ***P < 0.0001) or symbols (for example, ##P < 0.001), as defined in the figure legends. Unless stated otherwise, experiments were independently repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility. Sample numbers indicated in figure legends refer to the number of replicates shown, not the total number of biological replicates in the study, with the exception of cell culture experiments. For all the cell culture experiments, n in the figure legends indicates the number of cells or nuclei analysed, from five independent wells for each experiment. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but sample sizes are consistent with those used in comparable published studies.

Mice or cell culture samples or dishes were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Data collection and outcome assessments were performed in a randomized manner, when applicable. Experimental conditions and sample processing were organized to minimize bias, with randomization applied during sample allocation and data acquisition. The data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. Researchers performing data collection and analysis were not blinded to experimental conditions.

President Donald Trump's administration has dramatically expanded its work with Palantir, elevating the company cofounded by Trump ally Peter Thiel as the government's go-to software developer. Following massive contract terminations for consulting giants and government contractors like Accenture, Booz Allen, and Deloitte, Palantir has emerged ahead. Now the data analytics firm is partnering with those companies—offering them a lifeline while consolidating its own power.

Palantir has become one of the few winners in the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts, receiving more than $113 million in federal spending since the beginning of the year, according to The New York Times. Palantir's US government revenue has grown by more than $ 370 million compared to this time last year, according to the company's most recent quarterly earnings report. Before making remarks at last week's AI Summit in DC, Trump thanked a variety of cabinet secretaries and tech leaders, including Palantir chief technology officer Shyam Sankar. “We buy a lot of things from Palantir,” Trump said. “Are we paying our bills? I think so.”

Instead of replacing these more traditional contractors, Palantir's software is becoming the core tool deployed by them in government systems, placing Palantir in a newly central role.

The White House itself is thrilled by this partnership: “The Trump Administration has high-standard [sic] when spending American's hard-earned tax dollars—which is why agencies have partnered with Palantir, a top-tier American company renowned for their longstanding history of innovation, results, and increasing government efficiency,” says White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Palantir did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In April, WIRED reported that Palantir was working alongside IRS engineers to build what sources called a “mega API,” which would unify all data across the agency. An API, or application programming interface, enables applications and databases to exchange data and possibly compare it against other interoperable datasets. Once completed, this mega API could become the “read center of all IRS systems.” Immigration and Customs Enforcement contracted Palantir for $30 million to track self-deportations in April. The company has also won federal contracts more recently, like a $795 million award from the Pentagon in May to expand its Maven Smart System program. The total contract ceiling for the Army's Maven program is now $1.3 billion.

This growth comes as some of the companies Palantir has chosen to partner with have lost billions in government contract cuts. In April, defense secretary Pete Hegseth announced plans to cut $5.1 billion in IT consulting contracts with companies including Accenture, Booz Allen, and Deloitte. In a memo announcing the cuts, Hegseth said that the Pentagon would be forced to bring more of its IT work in-house.

“These contracts represent non-essential spending on third party consultants to perform services more efficiently performed by the highly skilled members of our DoD workforce using existing resources,” Hegseth wrote.

Palantir's partnerships with these companies vary, but each one makes it easier for Palantir to extend the reach of its software and AI technology across the federal government. With Accenture's government branch, Palantir will train and certify at least 1,000 Accenture workers on its Foundry software as well as its AI tech, according to an Accenture press release The companies also said that together they could create “a 360-degree view” of government agency budgets, something the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has sought to build and use to review federal spending. (Palantir partnered with Accenture before in 2022, but this is the first partnership to focus on US government clients.)

“We are teaming up with Accenture Federal Services to accelerate AI across the U.S. Government, working to address federal agencies' highest-priority operational challenges,” Palantir posted to X last month.

""What makes this partnership so uniquely powerful is Accenture's expertise working with the federal government and our ability to bring commercial capabilities to government solutions, combined with Palantir's deep experience in government software,"" Julie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture, said in a press release. “Together, we will harness the ever-growing power of AI to help the federal government succeed in its critical mission to modernize and reinvent its operations—with stronger data flows, transparency and resilience—to better serve warfighters, citizens and all its stakeholders.”

Accenture did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

While Palantir has become a major government contractor in its own right, partnering with contracting giants could enable the software company to scale at a much faster rate, leveraging long-standing relationships these larger contractors have with virtually every federal agency. “It's actually a pretty savvy business decision on the part of both Palantir, then also what you would call a traditional, more legacy-oriented, like defense or just government contractors,” says Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law at George Washington University. “If they're newer to certain areas and others have that footprint, that's how it would benefit Palantir.”

Last week, Palantir and Deloitte announced a partnership that includes what they call the “Enterprise Operating System” (EOS) to unify data across organizations. At government agencies like the Internal Revenue Service and reportedly at the Social Security Administration (SSA), Palantir is already working to combine agency datasets, allowing what were previously disparate datasets to communicate with one another more easily.

""Deloitte shares Palantir's commitment to decisive action and a dedication to delivering meaningful, lasting results for commercial and government clients,"" said Jason Girzadas, Deloitte US CEO, said in a press release announcing the partnership. ""Expanding our preferred relationship at this pivotal moment provides our clients with Palantir's latest advances in AI, combined with Deloitte's engineering scale and deep sector experience.""

Deloitte did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Palantir struck some of these deals prior to Trump taking office as well. In December of last year, Booz Allen partnered with Palantir specifically, working together on building out defense IT infrastructure.

“To have one company monopolize and become the gatekeeper of software in the government, to become an ‘app factory,' for the government, in a sense, where they're in every agency, they're part of the defense complex and the intelligence complex, brings huge concerns regarding fairness, regarding competition, and puts Palantir in a very unique position that maybe has never existed,” says Juan Sebastián Pinto, a former Palantir employee and critic of the company.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Inside Jeffrey Epstein's Forgotten AI Summit","https://www.wired.com/story/epstein-files-science-tech-funding/","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 15:30:00 GMT","

In 2002, artificial intelligence was still in winter. Despite decades of effort, dreams of bestowing computers with humanlike cognition and real-world understanding had not materialized. To look for a way forward, a small group of scientists gathered for “The St. Thomas Common Sense Symposium.” AI pioneer Marvin Minsky was the central presence, along with his protégé Pushpinder Singh. After the symposium, Minsky, Singh, and renowned philosopher Aaron Sloman published a paper on the group's ideas for how to reach humanlike AI.

The paper speaks to the struggles of early-century AI. But one sentence truly stands out today. In a brief paragraph of acknowledgements, the authors say, “This meeting was made possible by the generous support of Jeffrey Epstein.” The symposium itself, in fact, was held in the Virgin Islands, home of Epstein's now-notorious island retreat. Looking back at this event reveals something about the state of AI—as well as the symposium's execrable funder.

To the shame of the technology and science communities, a voracious sexual predator managed to buy his way into relationships with some of the most prominent and influential figures in the field. Epstein's connections, which included Bill Gates and Minsky, have been exhaustively documented. In a deposition, Epstein survivor Virginia Giuffre alleged she was directed to have sex with Minsky at Epstein's island; Minsky's wife—who says she accompanied the scientist when he visited Epstein and that they only went to the New York and Palm Beach residences—has vehemently denied the charge, which was made shortly before Minsky's death and was not revealed until much later. Epstein died in prison in 2019 (don't ask me to break down the conspiracy theories in one measly parenthesis), and Giuffre tragically took her own life in 2025.

For the vast majority of Epstein's connections in science and tech, professional association with a sexual predator became an embarrassing, even damning, fact. Epstein penetrated the inner circles of these worlds, funding small gatherings attended by bold-faced names. (I myself was at the notorious 2002 “Billionaire Dinner” at TED where Epstein mingled with Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos, Rupert Murdoch, singer Naomi Judd, and prominent scientists, including some who flew in on Epstein's plane.) One entry point to those circles was literary agent John Brockman, whose client list included top names in science. Epstein largely funded Brockman's nonprofit science-oriented foundation.

A source of mine who knew Epstein well explained that the financier appeared genuinely fascinated by scientists. The source claims to have no knowledge of his crimes. They agreed to discuss Epstein only on the condition of anonymity. “I experienced him as this eccentric, wealthy guy who liked to surround himself with interesting people and scientists and who had a lot of questions about the world,” the source says. “He was as interested in the personality of the scientist as he was with the scientist's work.” Epstein himself apparently understood why he was welcomed in those circles. “I'm not more than a hobbyist in science,” he told journalist Jeffrey Mervis in 2017. “But money I understand, [and] I'm a pretty good mathematician.”

Epstein's spectre casts a dark shadow on the 2002 symposium. But how did the event even come to be? My source gave me the previously unreported backstory. “Jeffrey used to say how fond he was of Marvin and how much he loved talking to him about AI,” the source says. In those years, the subject wasn't very popular. “It was a time when people were really skeptical about whether AI had legs,” my source said. So the idea arose to host a small AI gathering with Minsky at the center. (It's not clear whether the funding for the event came from a $100,000 donation made by Epstein to support Minksy's research.)

After some deliberation, it was decided the event would center on ideas from Minsky's star student, Singh. In 1996, Singh had written a short paper called “Why AI Failed.” To get humanlike intelligence, he argued, “we need systems with common-sense knowledge and flexible ways to use it. The trouble is that building such systems amounts to 'solving AI.'” As tough as that is, he wrote, “we have no choice but to face it head on.” (Bill Gates saw the paper and commented, “I think your observations about the AI field are correct.”)

Presumably, the St. Thomas symposium was one way to face the problem head-on. But the event was hard to organize. An early list of possible participants lacked star power and had to be augmented. Eventually, the guest list grew to include Roger Schank, a celebrated AI theorist whose obituary was marred by attending the event and by serving a brief spell as chief learning officer of Trump University. Another participant was Doug Lenat, the inventor of the ambitious CYC project, which involved humans painstakingly typing explanations of everyday objects into a database for AI research. Also in attendance was Vernor Vinge, a science fiction writer who is credited with the concept of the AI singularity. UK philosopher Sloman, now approaching 90, was one of the later additions. “I was not on Epstein's original invitation list,” he emailed me earlier this week. “I was added at the suggestion of Marvin Minsky, partly because by then I was helping to supervise his student (Push Singh).” Sloman says his memory of the event is weak. But, he recalls, “I seem to remember that Epstein provided lavish resources, including using a private plane to get us to the location.”

The symposium took place at a ritzy hotel in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. One night everyone went to the beach on Epstein's private island for a barbeque dinner. The working sessions themselves were contentious. “There were moments when it was battling egos, and it was hard to move them along on the agenda. Sometimes it dove into stuff that was super technical and other times at a more philosophical level,” the source recalls.

Epstein's own participation in the discussions seem to have been minimal. “Jeffrey popped in and out the whole time, and I think had some private conversations with some of the scientists,” says my source. The source didn't recall witnessing a scene that Roger Schank later described in an interview with Slate. “Epstein walks into the conference with two girls on his arm,” Schank reported. While the scientists discussed AI theory, Schank said, Epstein “was in the back, on a couch, hugging and kissing these girls.”

If Schank is correct, the scientists ignored this. In retrospect it was a red flag that indicated more was happening in Epsteinland than scientific discussions. In any case, the scientists kept grappling with Singh's contention that a multipronged approach was necessary to crack the AI conundrum. Minsky agreed. While various theories to improve AI had fallen short, the industry needed more theories.

Now, of course, we know that's wrong, and in a sense the meeting was a last gasp of the logic-based Good Old Fashioned AI that, in Singh's word, failed. The generative AI models we use today are relatively theory-free—their emergent understanding of the world comes from neural-net machine learning techniques and mountains of data. This technique has indeed made AI more humanlike, without the old-school AI theory bandied about in the Virgin Islands. Yet the conclusions of the Common Sense Symposium still have relevance; some scientists now argue that neural nets alone can't “solve” AI, and we need to combine them with more traditional reasoning-based approaches for the technology to reach its full potential.

On the second day of the symposium, there was one moment when the future of AI suddenly came into focus. The day began with more arguments. Then someone brought up science-fiction writer Neal Stephenson's book The Diamond Age, in which children are taught by a magical book that can tell them stories and answer their questions. The prospect brought the egoistic scientists into harmony. They speculated that AI systems “would carry out a conversation with you, to help you understand a problem or achieve some goal. You could discuss with it such subjects as how to choose a house or car, how to learn to play a game or get better at some subject, how to decide whether to go to the doctor, and so forth,” according to the paper they published. In other words, ChatGPT. The symposium ended with an agreement to further explore how to make that vision a reality.

After Push Singh secured his PhD a few years later, he was a postdoctoral associate at MIT's Media Lab and had accepted a faculty position. He never assumed the post. In 2006, he died by suicide. He was 33.

Ultimately—as with much of what Epstein touched—the St. Thomas Common Sense Symposium will be known more for its unsavory host than for any of the ideas that came out of it. As the scientists feasted at Epstein's island, the seeds for the real AI revolution were germinating in the fertile soil of the University of Toronto, where Geoffrey Hinton and his colleagues were developing the techniques of deep learning, which would later become the basis of generative AI. While Epstein might have been correct in his hunch that AI would be significant, his dilettante efforts in science made no mark on the world. But as today's headlines make clear, his crimes still reverberate.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","AC or DC: Which Is Better?","https://www.wired.com/story/ac-or-dc-which-is-better/","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

As the story goes, the rock band AC/DC took its name from a label on an old sewing machine in the Young brothers' home. It must have meant that the machine could run on either alternating-current or direct-current electricity. Today, all the newfangled electronic devices in our homes run only on DC power—even lighting fixtures, now that LEDs have replaced incandescent bulbs.

But wait. The electricity that comes out of your wall socket is alternating current. That means each device needs to convert AC power to DC, as well as reducing the voltage to the much lower levels used in digital circuits. So you might well ask: Wouldn't it make more sense to have DC outlets in your home?

That's a great question, and it's actually one that sparked a big debate back in the early days of electrification. Thomas Edison favored DC circuits, but Nikola Tesla thought AC circuits were the way to go. Clearly Tesla won that argument. Let's see why!

Electricity is a flow of electrons through a conducting material like a metal wire. You can kind of think of the electrical grid as a system of rivers and streams with current flowing through them. In a river, a difference in elevation causes water to move downhill; in a power line, the force driving the current is voltage—a difference in potential energy between two points in a circuit.

That analogy works for direct current, anyway. But in most grids, electrical power is transmitted with alternating voltage. That means the negative and positive poles flip back and forth, causing the electrons to endlessly lurch forward and backward instead of traveling in a continuous stream.

As you can imagine, that makes alternating current more complicated to deal with. So Edison had a point: Direct current is much simpler. In fact, anyone can make a DC circuit. All you need is a battery and a wire to connect the positive and negative electrodes. You can even make your own battery. Just get two different metals, like zinc and copper, and stick them in opposite ends of a potato. The acid in the potato juice reacts differently with the two metals, creating a tiny amount of voltage—enough to light up a small LED. DC is easy.

For example, suppose you wanted to create a DC toaster. A toaster is basically a box with a wire inside that gets hot when current runs through it. And let's say this toaster requires 1,000 watts of power. Oh, power? That's the time (t) rate of energy (E). So if you put 1 joule of energy into a wire in 1 second, that would be 1 watt of power (P):

For electrical power in particular, we can calculate that as the product of the electric current (I) and the voltage (V):

With that, we can draw a simple toaster circuit diagram:

The nichrome wire inside the toaster is not a good conductor. It impedes the flow of current, causing the wire to heat up. So it's basically a device for converting electrical energy into thermal energy. In the diagram above, R stands for the amount of resistance, which is measured in ohms.

So let's say our DC power supply runs at 10 volts. We can use this to find the level of resistance needed to get our toast nice and toasty. There is a relationship between the current (I) and voltage (V) for a resistor called Ohm's law, and that gives us the following expression for power:

With 10 volts, we need a resistance of 0.1 ohms (which is tiny) to get a power of 1,000 watts. But wait—it's not just the heating element inside that creates resistance in the circuit. The power cord that you plug into the wall also has resistance. The copper wire inside the cord is a good conductor, but the length of the cord itself increases the resistance.

To make things easy, imagine that the power cord also has a 0.1-ohm resistance, so the total resistance in the circuit is 0.2 ohms. That means we'd get a lower electrical current, and the power to the toaster would be just 250 watts. That's going to be some un-toasty toast.

To fix this, we have to increase the voltage of the power source. Let's ramp that up to 100 volts. In that case our toaster could be 10 ohms, so the 0.1-ohm power cord won't matter much. Well, it's not a problem for a 3-foot power cord in your home. But what about the transmission lines from the power station to your town? These can be over 100 kilometers long.

With much longer wires you get much more resistance, which means those wires will get hot and waste energy. Again, the solution is to use a higher-voltage source. Remember P = IV ? That says you can deliver the same power by having a stupid-high voltage with stupid-low current.

Yes, you solve one problem and it just makes another problem. Suppose the wall outlet is 10,000-volt DC. Oh, but you want to charge your phone, and it needs 5-volt DC. How do you do that? OK, there is a way to make it work. You could put a large resistor in series with your phone and it would convert electrical energy to heat. But again, that's just throwing away energy.

So what happens if we switch to alternating current? Remember, AC circuits are created by flipping the positive and negative poles back and forth, so the voltage alternates between a positive value and a negative value (meaning the direction of electron flow changes). Here is a plot of voltage as a function of time for the two types of current.

The DC source has a constant voltage, so that's the flat blue line above. The AC source (red) has a voltage that oscillates between +10 and –10 volts, and there are times when the voltage is actually zero. In this made-up example, you can see that the voltage switches eight times in half a second. Real household AC varies, but in the US it averages around 120 volts (plus and minus) with a frequency of 60 hertz.

If we take our toaster and plug it into a 60-Hz AC outlet, it'll run just fine. Since it works by just making a wire hot, it doesn't matter if it has DC or AC current—either way it gets hot. Same for incandescent light bulbs. In fact, they're really not very different from toasters; it's just that the thin tungsten wire in a bulb gets so hot (up to 4,500 degrees F) that it glows and produces light.

With AC, we still have the same problem with long power lines. You need to have high voltage and low current so you don't lose too much energy from hot wires. But AC has a nice advantage: It's easy to take that high voltage and change it to a low voltage. This is possible because of the oscillating nature of the current and Faraday's law of induction.

Faraday's law says that if you change the strength of a magnetic field inside a loop of wire, you will produce an electric current. In the clip below, you can see that when I stick a strong magnet into a coil of wire or pull it out, the current level (measured in amps) jumps up.

You can also do this without a magnet if you use two coils of wire. In the video below, I'm connecting and disconnecting a little coin battery to a primary coil. (You can't see the coils, but they're inside the small gray box in the foreground.)

The secondary coil isn't connected to any power source. But the changing current in the primary coil makes a changing magnetic field, and that induces a current in the secondary coil. Even with this tiny battery you can see that I get a big induced current. Check it out:

But that's not all! We can change the voltage induced in the second coil by changing the ratio of the number of loops in each coil. If the induced coil has 100 loops and the primary coil has 1,000 loops, the induced voltage will be 100/1,000 or 0.1 times the input. If you reverse that, you can get an output voltage that is 10 times the input.

We call this a transformer (because it transforms the voltage). They are kind of a big deal. Here's what a small one looks like inside:

This is one of those “power bricks” that all your gadgets use to plug into a wall socket. The two coils are side by side, and you can see that the one on the right has more “turns” than the one on the left. So, if you have a 120-volt AC input, the output will be lower (in this case it's 12 volts). There's some other stuff in there that takes that lower-voltage AC and turns it into a DC output; that's called a voltage rectifier.

Just to be clear, you can't use an AC transformer with a DC circuit. I mean it's technically possible to take a DC input, convert it to AC, and then transform it—but why do the extra stuff when you can just deliver AC power to houses? That's exactly what we do. When you see those giant high-voltage transmission lines, they are super-high-voltage AC circuits.

So here's how it works. You have some power station that runs on fossil fuels or hydroelectric or whatever. You need to make this an AC output and then ramp up the voltage to something crazy like 100,000 volts. This means you can send it on the long power lines at very low current so there isn't much power loss.

When a power line gets to a town, it goes into a substation. This is basically just another giant transformer that reduces the AC voltage to something more manageable, like 10,000 volts. Finally, the current goes through one more transformer to get it to the 240-volt AC that enters your house. Big appliances like clothes dryers use the whole 240 V, and for your electrical outlets that gets cut in half to give you 120 V.

But none of this would be possible with DC power. It just wouldn't be practical. AC rules!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Confessions of a Recovering AI Porn Addict","https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-of-a-recovering-ai-porn-addict/","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

A “gooner” tells WIRED he became hooked on the cartoonish nature of AI porn. Several addictions experts say the genre could pose a problem for people prone to compulsive sexual behavior.

Kyle's interest in AI porn began last summer as he circled rock bottom. From the outside, everything seemed fine. He was in a committed relationship with his longtime girlfriend. He enjoyed the perks of his job working for a sports betting company. Still, all he could think about was fueling his porn addiction in new ways—even at the cost of feeling mentally drained and tired. “Pretty much all I wanted to do was doomscroll on my phone and watch content. And I wasn't able to stop even though I noticed that it was a problem. I became desensitized,” he says. “I was looking for that next dose of excitement.”

“It was something I had not seen before—and I had to see more.”

That's when he came across the Instagram Reel showing an AI-generated image of a woman with “extremely large breasts the size of her body,” he says. He knew it was fake but also felt strangely seduced by it. “In the back of my mind, I was like, OK, I do find this kind of attractive,” he says. “It was something I had not seen before—and I had to see more.”

Kyle is a “gooner,” a term for someone who finds pleasure from prolonged sessions of intense masturbation. The 26-year-old, who asked to be identified by his first name citing privacy concerns, says that at the peak of his addiction he would force himself to masturbate “either out of habit, obligation or desire.” The Instagram Reel led him down a rabbit hole of dreamlike pleasure as he searched for AI porn that depicted “women with cartoonish boobs, aeriolas and nipples twice the size of the rest of her torso, [and] super wide hips.”

When we speak over the phone one recent afternoon in July, Kyle tells me he always had an interest in surrealism—“things that are just completely unnatural and not possible in real life”—and that AI unlocked his appetite tenfold. On Reddit he started commenting on r/BustyAIBabes and would often take time out of work to check X and Instagram, or cycle through Xvideos late at night, while his girlfriend slept, for “POV stuff, blowjob videos, and jerk off inspiration,” he says. “I started looking for more taboo things, such as AI porn. And then it got to a point where that didn't arouse me anymore. So I had to search for even more AI.”

Porn sites are some of the most-visited online, according to a 2023 study, and as AI has gone mainstream, so have concerns around the risks that this growing genre of adult entertainment presents for people who suffer from compulsive sexual behavior disorder (CSBD), the official term recognized by the American Psychiatric Association. Porn addiction, as it is commonly referred to, is not considered an official diagnosis, and is not currently listed among the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the APA's approved guidebook; it's a contested topic within academic circles. Still, people report feeling out of control with their porn consumption; a meta-analysis published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior in 2018 found that those who express concerns about porn addiction are often actually experiencing distress over their religion-based moral beliefs surrounding pornography.

The spread of AI porn poses “intriguing yet concerning implications,” says Leor Ram, a therapist at Integrative Psychotherapy Group in Beverly Hills, California. “We already live in a society where people are growing increasingly accustomed to having what they want, when they want it. While that's convenient for many aspects of life, it's detrimental to relationships and community.” Like other mental health professionals who spoke to WIRED, he says the problem has less to do with its proliferation and more to do with its capacity to magnify pre-existing vulnerabilities toward compulsive or unhealthy behaviors. “There's every reason to anticipate its growing presence as the technology becomes more sophisticated, personalized, and accessible.”

In June, a member of the subreddit NoFap—a porn addiction peer support forum for people who suffer from CSBD, specifically gooners—warned against the use of AI porn.

“Came across the devil himself and you know they say the road to hell is really fun,” they posted to the group, which has 1.2 million members. “Stay the fuck away from that shit guys … It's going to get harder to avoid because it captures all your vices and traps you.”

“Already went down that rabbit hole, super hard to get out of it,” one member replied.

“Agreed,” wrote another. “AI porn is insane and insanely addictive.”

Ross Crothers, a therapist who specializes in queer and trans-affirming care in East Los Angeles, believes AI porn will change how people approach relationships, “or rather, avoid them,” he says.

Once the neural pathway between AI and sexual pleasure is firmly established, he adds, “it almost becomes too efficient. This causes other sexual experiences to shift and become less pleasurable in comparison. This is where we will see more avoidance of relationships and an increase in isolation.”

Kyle says his girlfriend, who he has been with for seven years, began to notice a distance growing between them this year that started to negatively affect their sex life. “My erections weren't as strong as they could have been. I couldn't last as long,” he says. “And I never directly told her what I was exactly struggling with. But I could sense that there was less attraction there than there had been before. She had gotten the proverbial ick.”

Outside of Reddit threads, though, AI-specific porn addiction isn't currently dominating the clinical landscape. “We're not seeing a surge of cases in our practice yet,” Rob Terry, a sex addiction therapist and founder of Karuna Healing in St. George, Utah, says. “But it does come up here and there.” Still, several experts WIRED spoke with say they believe it is “only a matter of time” before the effects of AI-generated porn become a larger issue.

AI erotica is a quickly developing genre. AI generators and nudifying apps, like Undress.cc, have contributed to the prevalence of AI porn while also raising ethical concerns around the use of nonconsensual deepfakes. An analysis by Indicator, which investigated 85 nudify websites, found that the industry is already pulling in an estimated $36 million per year.

On Pornhub, one of the most visited websites in the world, AI porn is restricted to animated content. Current protocol only allows for AI content from the original creators; they are required to undergo a verification process before uploading videos. “We ask that people prove it's their work,” Alex Kekesi, Pornhub's vice president of brand and community, says. But even the content uploaded within those restrictions has found an audience, from hyperreal fantasies (“Fucked a bitch without a spine and I liked it”) to smutty reimaginings of Marvel characters (“Spider Gwen's First Lesson in Love”). Hentai—a genre of porn content that includes exaggerated video game and anime characters—is currently the most searched term on the site in the US, according to Pornhub. In 2024, Gen Z were 193 percent more likely to view Hentai content compared to all other age groups.

Everywhere, it seems, interest around the subject is intensifying. Since April, search traffic on YouTube for “AI porn” has been the highest in Sweden, Australia, and Canada, according to Google Trends. More recently, the Supreme Court's decision upholding Texas' porn ID law—which is similar to laws in at least 20 other states and requires adult websites to verify their users are at least 18—has raised the question of whether some people may instead make AI porn at home, bypassing these platforms altogether. Its increasing ability to create hyperreal sexual images, catered specifically to a person's desires, can now produce porn that is just as orgasmic as any human-generated video floating around on aggregator sites. Companion apps like Nomi and Replika are also being used as alternatives to build intimate relationships and have sex with AI bots.

But “AI porn, in itself, is not necessarily a problem,” says Paula Hall, a psychotherapist at London's Laurel Centre, the leading specialist provider of treatment for CSBD in the UK, “but rather the way in which it is used.”

As people become more accustomed to getting what they want from realistic AI renderings of porn, in addition to the buffet of erotic media that already exists across the internet, human connection, for some, may no longer be enough, says Monifa Ellis-Addie, a therapist at Banyan Therapy Group in Los Angeles, a faith-based counseling practice. In the most extreme cases, mental health professionals say that an increased dependency will enable people to fully detach. “The effects are going to be pretty damaging,” Ellis-Addie says. For some people, sex addiction is built on a kind of “faux-intimacy,” she continues. “AI is only going to make that easier. It's going to feel as if you're dealing with an actual person, and with an actual person comes things like actual feelings. It will make people more distant in real life.”

Kyle's epiphany that it was time to finally temper his addiction came during a work trip to New York City in February. He was alone in a hotel, away from his girlfriend, and, he says, “I just kept doing it and doing it but I didn't feel any better.” He's since taken action to limit his need to masturbate, including joining the Reddit support group NoFap, where members share similar struggles.

Professionals believe that could make initiating new IRL relationships more difficult.

Young people are currently facing a mental health crisis. Last year, the US surgeon general called for a warning label on all social media platforms. One major consequence has been a “loneliness epidemic,” according to a 2024 Harvard study, which suggested that people who feel more alone suffer from higher rates of depression and anxiety.

“Social media has distorted our views on so many things—body image, social class, politics. It's hurt people in many ways,” says Daniel Glazer, a psychotherapist at Fifth Ave Psychiatry in New York, citing loneliness, isolation, depression, shame, and issues related to sexual performance as areas of concern. What's happening with AI porn “could be another extension of that,” he adds.

But AI also has the potential for real “positive crossover” for people who struggle with relationships, both platonic and romantic. “I understand sex addiction as a way to avoid life, a way to avoid relationships. So AI can be a kind of a bridge to someone who's fearful of a relationship,” Glazer says. “Here's a relationship that isn't scary and one where you won't be criticized.” They'll just have to manage their reliance on it.

More recently, Kyle has fully curbed his intake of adult content. Though AI porn is still in its early days, he considers it “one of the worst technological developments that we have coming up right now” because of its over accessibility. “It's worse than the real thing.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The First Widespread Cure for HIV Could Be in Children","https://www.wired.com/story/the-first-widespread-cure-for-hiv-could-be-in-children/","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 13:19:14 GMT","

For years, Philip Goulder has been obsessed with a particularly captivating idea: In the hunt for an HIV cure, could children hold the answers?

Starting in the mid-2010s, the University of Oxford pediatrician and immunologist began working with scientists in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal, with the aim of tracking several hundred children who had acquired HIV from their mothers, either during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.

After putting the children on antiretroviral drugs early in their lives to control the virus, Goulder and his colleagues were keen to monitor their progress and adherence to standard antiretroviral treatment, which stops HIV from replicating. But over the following decade, something unusual happened. Five of the children stopped coming to the clinic to collect their drugs, and when the team eventually tracked them down many months later, they appeared to be in perfect health.

“Instead of their viral loads being through the roof, they were undetectable,” says Goulder. “And normally HIV rebounds within two or three weeks.”

In a study published last year, Goulder described how all five remained in remission, despite having not received regular antiretroviral medication for some time, and in one case, up to 17 months. In the decades-long search for an HIV cure, this offered a tantalizing insight: that the first widespread success in curing HIV might not come in adults, but in children.

At the recent International AIDS Society conference held in Kigali, Rwanda, in mid-July, Alfredo Tagarro, a pediatrician at the Infanta Sofia University Hospital in Madrid, presented a new study showing that around 5 percent of HIV-infected children who receive antiretrovirals within the first six months of life ultimately suppress the HIV viral reservoir—the number of cells harboring the virus's genetic material—to negligible levels. “Children have special immunological features which makes it more likely that we will develop an HIV cure for them before other populations,” says Tagarro.

His thoughts were echoed by another doctor, Mark Cotton, who directs the children's infectious diseases clinical research unit at the University of Stellenbosch, Cape Town.

“Kids have a much more dynamic immune system,” says Cotton. “They also don't have any additional issues like high blood pressure or kidney problems. It makes them a better target, initially, for a cure.”

According to Tagarro, children with HIV have long been “left behind” in the race to find a treatment that can put HIV-positive individuals permanently into remission. Since 2007, 10 adults are thought to have been cured, having received stem cell transplants to treat life-threatening blood cancer, a procedure which ended up eliminating the virus. Yet with such procedures being both complex and highly risky—other patients have died in the aftermath of similar attempts—it is not considered a viable strategy for specifically targeting HIV.

Instead, like Goulder, pediatricians have increasingly noticed that after starting antiretroviral treatment early in life, a small subpopulation of children then seem able to suppress HIV for months, years, and perhaps even permanently with their immune system alone. This realization initially began with certain isolated case studies: the “Mississippi baby” who controlled the virus for more than two years without medication, and a South African child who was considered potentially cured having kept the virus in remission for more than a decade. Cotton says he suspects that between 10 and 20 percent of all HIV-infected children would be capable of controlling the virus for a significant period of time, beyond the typical two to three weeks, after stopping antiretrovirals.

Goulder is now launching a new study to try and examine this phenomenon in more detail, taking 19 children in South Africa who have suppressed HIV to negligible levels on antiretrovirals, stopping the drugs, and seeing how many can prevent the virus from rebounding, with the aim of understanding why. To date, he says that six of them have been able to control the virus without any drugs for more than 18 months. Based on what he's seen so far, he has a number of ideas about what could be happening. In particular, it appears that boys are more likely to better control the virus due to a quirk of gender biology to do with the innate immune system, the body's first-line defense against pathogens.

“The female innate immune system both in utero and in childhood is much more aggressive than the male equivalent when it encounters and senses viruses like HIV,” says Goulder. “Usually that's a good thing, but because HIV infects activated immune cells, it actually seems to make girls more vulnerable to being infected.”

In addition, Goulder notes that because female fetuses share the same innate immune system as their mothers, the virus transmitted to them is an HIV strain that has become resistant to the female innate immune response.

There could also be other explanations for the long-lasting suppression seen in some children. In some cases, Goulder has observed that the transmitted strain of HIV has been weakened through needing to undergo changes to circumvent the mother's adaptive immune response, the part of the immune system which learns to target specific viruses and other pathogens. He has also noted that male infants experience particularly large surges of testosterone in the first six months of life—a period known as “mini-puberty”—which can enhance their immune system in various ways that help them fight the virus.

Such revelations are particularly tantalizing as HIV researchers are starting to get access to a far more potent toolbox of therapeutics. Leading the way are so-called bNAbs, or broadly neutralizing antibodies, which have the ability to recognize and fight many different strains of HIV, as well as stimulating the immune system to destroy cells where HIV is hiding. There are also a growing number of therapeutic vaccines in development that can train the immune system's T cells to target and destroy HIV reservoirs. Children tend to respond to various vaccines better than adults, and Goulder says that if some children are already proving relatively adept at controlling the virus on the back of standard antiretrovirals, these additional therapeutics could give them the additional assistance they need to eradicate HIV altogether.

In the coming years, this is set to be tested in several clinical trials. Cotton is leading the most ambitious attempt, which will see HIV-infected children receive a combination of antiretroviral therapy, three bNAbs, and a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford, while in a separate trial, Goulder is examining the potential of a different bNAb together with antiretrovirals to see whether it can help more children achieve long-term remission.

“We think that adding the effects of these broadly neutralizing antibodies to antiretrovirals will help us chip away at what is needed to achieve a cure,” says Goulder. “It's a little bit like with leukemia, where treatments have steadily improved, and now the outlook for most children affected is incredibly good. Realistically in most cases, curing HIV probably requires a few hits from different angles, impacting the way that the virus can grow, and tackling it with different immune responses at the same time to essentially force it into a cul-de-sac that it can't escape from.”

Children are also being viewed as the ideal target population for an even more ambitious experimental treatment, a one-time gene therapy that delivers instructions directing the body's own muscle cells to produce a continuous stream of bNAbs, without the need for repeated infusions. Maurico Martins, an associate professor at the University of Florida, who is pioneering this new approach, feels that it could represent a particularly practical strategy for low-income countries where HIV transmission to children is particularly rife, and mothers often struggle to keep their children on repeated medication.

“In regions like Uganda or parts of South Africa where this is very prevalent, you could also give this therapy to a baby right after birth as a preventative measure, protecting the newborn child against acquisition of HIV through breastfeeding and maybe even through sexual intercourse later in life,” says Martins.

While Martins also hopes that gene therapy could benefit HIV-infected adults in future, he feels it has more of a chance of initially succeeding in children because their nascent immune systems are less likely to launch what he calls an anti-drug response that can destroy the therapeutic bNAbs.

“It's very difficult for most antibodies to recognize the HIV envelope protein because it's buried deep within a sugar coat,” says Martins. “To overcome that, these bNAbs carry a lot of mutations and extensions to their arms which allow them to penetrate that sugar coat. But the problem then is that they're often viewed by your own immune system as foreign, and it starts making these anti-bNAb antibodies.”

But when Martins tested the therapy in newborn rhesus macaques, it was far more effective. “We found that the first few days or two weeks after birth comprised a sort of sweet spot for this gene therapy,” he says. “And that's why this could really work very well in treating and preventing pediatric HIV infections.”

Like many HIV scientists, Martins has run into recent funding challenges, with a previous commitment from the National Institutes of Health to support a clinical trial of the novel therapy in HIV-infected children being withdrawn. However, he is hoping that the trial will still go ahead. “We're now talking with the Gates Foundation to see whether they can sponsor it,” he says.

While children still comprise the minority of overall HIV infections, being able to cure them may yield further insights that help with the wider goal of an overall curative therapy.

“We can learn a lot from them because they are different,” says Goulder. “I think we can learn how to achieve a cure in kids if we continue along this pathway, and from there, that will have applications in adults as well.”

I can't tell you where I first saw mouth tape. Was it while investigating the intense morning shed routines on TikTok? Or perhaps an influencer who insinuated that using mouth tape at night would give me a sharper jawline? (Big shout-out to my algorithm for reminding me about that insecurity.) Nevertheless, it's become a consistent pop-up on my For You page, showing me users raving about how a colorful piece of tape across their mouth is helping them sleep better.

Mouth tape is exactly what it sounds like: a piece of tape designed to sit across your mouth to keep it closed all night long. Mouth tapers rave about health benefits and better sleep, since it encourages you to breathe through your nose rather than your mouth.

“Mouth taping is not a gimmick—it's a reminder to return to the way we're built to breathe,"" says Geoffrey Trenkle, a board-certified ENT, head and neck surgeon, and CEO of the Los Angeles Center for Ear, Nose, Throat and Allergy. “For many people, it's a safe and effective way to promote better sleep and healthier breathing patterns. But if someone experiences nasal blockage, snoring, or disrupted sleep, it's worth exploring why that's happening.”

Mouth tape isn't necessarily a perfect solution to getting a better night's sleep, but if you don't have any airway problems, it can be something worth trying. After sleeping with eight different types of mouth tape and speaking to several experts, I'm here to tell you everything you need to know about mouth tape and which ones are best to try.

Mouth tape is a type of specially designed tape to sit over your mouth, keeping it closed throughout the night to encourage nose breathing over mouth breathing. You shouldn't just grab any kind of tape to use for this; as Andrew E. Colsky, a behavioral sleep medicine clinician and founder of the National Sleep Center, told me, “This is one of those rare instances where duct tape is not the answer.”

Mouth tape has some breathability to it and is designed to keep your mouth in place without irritating the skin on your lips or around your mouth. There are a few designs, including options with a hole in the middle if you hydrate a lot at night. The book Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art by James Nestor suggests you can even use first-aid tape as mouth tape.

What does it do? It keeps your mouth closed to force you to breathe through your nose rather than your mouth. You might be looking to close your mouth to avoid snoring or drooling, but nasal breathing is overall a good thing. “Nasal breathing plays a critical role in regulating airflow, humidifying air, and supporting optimal oxygen exchange. It also helps maintain pressure in the airways, which can reduce snoring and support better sleep quality for some people,” says Carlos Nunez, chief medical officer at Resmed, a medical device company.

Mouth tape is touted as a way to help you sleep better and snore less while sleeping. “It is a method generally intended to promote nasal breathing during sleep, which some believe can enhance sleep quality—though these claims remain largely hypothetical. In theory, keeping the mouth closed may help prevent the tongue from falling back toward the airway, and therefore decrease its potential to rattle (and thus contribute to snoring),” says David Benavides, a board-certified sleep medicine physician at Brigham & Women's Hospital.

There aren't just sleep benefits; there are some potential health benefits for both your oral health and your overall health. “Nasal breathing can prevent your mouth and throat from drying out, and in return it will prevent bad breath, cavities, and gum inflammation,"" says Fatima Khan, a practicing dentist, member of the American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine, and cofounder of the oral care line Riven.

She also says it may help with nitric oxide production in the body, since the primary source of nitric oxide is in the nasal passages. “Nitric oxide aids in regulating blood pressure and improving circulation, which in turn can boost both heart health and lower BP. Also, nitric oxide is significant in regulating insulin, which in return affects your blood sugar levels,” she says.

How bad is mouth breathing that people are actually taping their mouths shut? According to one expert, mouth breathing is a bigger problem than you'd expect. “Mouth breathing is wildly unhealthy for any person,"" says Ben Miraglia, an airway dentist and chief clinical officer at Toothpillow. “There is no amount of mouth breathing that is OK.”

Mouth breathing can cause issues with sleep and breathing in general. Your nose is designed to filter out debris, allergens, and even tiny insects (thank those nose hairs), and it's designed to give your lungs and throat warmer, more moist air, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Your don't get these same benefits when you breathe through your mouth. It'll also make you more likely to develop sleep problems like sleep apnea, a sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts.

Miraglia primarily treats children and approaches airway problems from a youth perspective, including larger dental problems, looking at mouth breathing as a problem overall versus just a sleep problem. From a sleep perspective, the interest in mouth breathing usually comes from sleep problems like snoring and sleep apnea, though getting better air all night long (more moist, less debris, etc.) is obviously a big benefit as well.

If you're coming here after hearing an anecdotal story about how mouth taping has made someone's sleep better, you aren't alone in hearing about mouth tape that way. There are no shortages of these videos online, frequently touting a specific tape they used. But for now, it's mainly personal perspectives supporting the narrative. “There is currently extremely limited clinical evidence to support the efficacy of mouth tape in managing sleep disorders,"" says Benavides. ""One small study from 2022, often cited, looked at 20 people with mild sleep apnea. While these participants showed some improvement with mouth tape, the study didn't include a placebo comparison, and 20 participants is simply not enough to draw solid conclusions.”

That's not to say it can never be used. Benavides says he has found use for it, even with his obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Specifically, he has found it useful for OSA patients who want to wear a nasal-only CPAP mask and who could add mouth tape to their nightly setup. ""It may help minimize ""mouth air leak"" (where nasal-entry air escapes through the mouth during therapy) and improve both comfort and adherence. I've had success in some individuals,"" says Benavides.

If you can breathe comfortably through your nose, mouth tape should be safe to do. Where it gets dicey is if you're trying to use mouth tape to solve a sleep disorder or breathing problems that your nasal passageways might not be able to solve.

“Mouth tape could potentially cause harm in many others. For example, those with moderate to severe sleep apnea may actually find themselves with even more impaired ability to breathe than before. Worse yet, it may further compromise those with central sleep apnea—a different type of apnea disorder,” says Benavides. “Another group to watch out for are those with impaired nasal breathing, as removing the ability to breathe through the mouth severely restricts their remaining—and often much-needed—airflow path.”

The takeaway is this: If you can't breathe comfortably on your own through your nose as it is, mouth tape won't fix that for you.

Since I have no airway problems, I spent several weeks trying different mouth tapes. I tried them all during the day at my desk to see how they felt and how secure they were, and then I wore the most comfortable and secure options overnight. Overall, I usually got a solid night's sleep when using the tape, but some were less comfortable than others, and I found myself irritated by them and removing them during the night. I also had to skip mouth tape if I had a cold or any kind of postnasal drip, since I have a 3-year-old who brings home a ton of germs. After trying multiple kinds of tape, I had some pretty clear favorites.

Dream Recovery

Dream Recovery (1 Month Supply)

Dream Recovery (3 Months Supply)

This is my favorite mouth tape I've tried. Dream says all of its mouth tape uses organic bamboo silk, and while there aren't any certifications on its site to back that up, the Plus+ tape is super soft and flexible on my face, easily the softest I tried. It still feels plenty secure and breathable with that softness and was an easy favorite after my testing.

SayLess

SayLess (1 Month Supply)

SayLess (3 Month Supply)

This set was also really comfortable, with a softer texture and a larger shape that will fit all kinds of lip sizes. It is very feminine in its design and comes in a couple different shades. This set promises to hold overnight skin care products, and I tested this tape with the Laniege Lip Sleeping Mask ($24) on my lips and found it stayed on when I used both together.

Here are the other mouth tapes I tried. All prices are based on a one-month supply.

Dream Recovery Mouth Tape for $34: I like this one because it has a wide and tall design, but the Plus+ version is so much softer. This one feels pretty coarse.

Heronlink Micropore Premium Tape for $17: This is at the top of Amazon's recommended mouth tapes, and it's a fine option. It's secure on my face, but the opening in the middle allowed for me to resume mouth breathing pretty easily.

Hostage Tape for $20: This tape was solid to wear all night long, but I found that it was most likely to leave bits of the tape on my face. It's another popular one I see recommended often online, but it wasn't tremendously better than any others I tested.

Loftie Mouth Tape for $30: This set is pretty comfortable, and I like the small opening for a water straw without giving me too much wiggle room. But it left behind the most sticky residue after using it, and the design of this tape is a little Ronald McDonald for my liking.

Longevity Sleep Tape for £8: I loved this tape. I loved it almost as much as the Dream and Say Less I recommend above, and it's definitely one of the most secure tapes without being too restrictive or coarse. It has a nice lavender-scented option that comes in purple, plus black and beige options that are both unscented. It's only available in the UK, though.

The Skinny Confidential for $39: I found myself removing this tape during the night. It has an opening like the Loftie above, but didn't feel quite as secure, and the more feminine shape wasn't as wide as the Say Less option to fit more lip sizes. It did come with a cute little case for my bedside.

Queen Tape for $13: This tape is comfortable, and I constantly see it advertised on TikTok, but I didn't find the adhesive secure. It started peeling off my face almost immediately during my daytime wear tests.

VIO2 Unscented Mouth Tapes for $27: This has a different style of design, with an H-style look to it versus tape that covers a minimal amount of your skin. You could wear it different ways, but I found the H-style position the most secure. I didn't like it as much as full tape designs, but this is a good option if you want security without full coverage.

After trying so many mouth tapes, the question remained: Did they work? Did I sleep better and wake up more rested?

Honestly, not really. I had the same kind of sleep I would without mouth tape: better, deeper sleep on days I had more physical activity and kept to my routines better, and worse sleep on nights after I forgot to go outside and do anything beyond hunch over a screen (she says as she types at her desk, staring at yet another screen). Some nights I woke up and ripped the mouth tape off in irritation, other nights I slept all night long with it on my face. Some nights I had to take it off at 3 in the morning because my toddler was up yet again, so the inconsistency could be me and my own daily routines.

But I also wonder if that's everyone's issue. Did they have an inconsistent bedtime routine, and now adding something that makes them mentally prepared for bedtime is what's changing their life? Perhaps it's not the tape so much as the need for a bedtime routine to tell their body and mind it's time for bed. There's no way to be sure if that's the secret benefit of mouth tape, but it is known that a good bedtime routine to wind down before bed makes for better sleep.

If you're looking for other solutions to help with nasal breathing, mouth tape isn't the only option. Trenkle recommends a handful of different medical and lifestyle changes. “Saline rinses, nasal steroid sprays, and allergy management can dramatically improve nasal function,” he says. ""Tools like nasal dilators or strips can also help keep the nose open during sleep. For patients with sleep apnea or structural airway issues, we offer targeted therapies—from oral appliances to surgical solutions—depending on the diagnosis.”

Everybody is talking about AI. But how are people actually using new automation tools, and what value are they getting out of them?

That was our question to attendees at the AI2 Incubator's annual BBQ party on Thursday, hosted at the AI House at Seattle's Pier 70 as part of Seattle Tech Week. 

Techies shared some of their favorite AI tools and how they're using them. Read on to learn more. Answers were edited for brevity and clarity. 

Joe Heitzeberg, founder of AI Tinkerers

Favorite tools: Granola and Amp

Use case: “Granola just works really well. It automatically joins meetings. I can use it for anything where I want to take notes. It's unobtrusive. And the other one is Amp. It's a coding tool I've been using for two-and-a-half weeks — objectively, it's better than Claude Code. It just does a better job of taking my instructions and figuring out how to fulfill my objectives in a way that is compatible with my code base.”

Mamtha Banerjee, managing director at JPMorgan Chase

Favorite tool: Perplexity Comet

Use case: “It's not that I'm using it a lot. But it's very interesting how it changes what you think about a browser — it's almost like an operating system.”

Gayathri (G3) Venkataraman, CEO at Dodda AI

Favorite tool: Perplexity, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot

Use case: “I use them a lot for pretty much all the tasks I have to do. I come up with plans and ask them to let me know if I'm covering everything or missing anything — I'm using it as a comprehensive completeness tool. I'm also using them for travel planning and for retail and other things I need to buy at home.”

Beth Kolko, investment partner at Pioneer Fund

Favorite tool: Claude

Use case: “I just did a bunch of traveling and I used Claude to help me narrow down plans. I asked it to tell me the history of a place and where I should go. Professionally, I use it because I do a lot of writing and speaking for my career. I'll upload things I've already written on different topics and get it to do some synthesis work.”

Ti Zhao, partner at Pack Ventures

Favorite tool: Claude

Use case: “I use it for everything — to plan my workouts, plan my meal plans. It gives me recipe ideas and ideas to throw a dinner party or entertain children. It primarily solves the blank-page problem for me. I don't trust everything it tells me but it can generate a list of ideas and I can work off of it really easily.”

Joe Golden, founder and CEO at Paper2Audio

Favorite tool: Google Gemini Flash 2.0; OpenAI o3

Use case: “Our company makes it so you can listen to research papers. We don't need complex thinking or reasoning, or agentic mode. So Gemini Flash 2.0 is fast and cheap. It can also parse images well enough and cheaply. Another tool I've been using is o3. A family member was recently diagnosed with cancer. It's incredible for medical research. It's really invaluable for getting into a new field of research.”

Darian Parrish, founder and CEO at PwrOn

Favorite tool: Poe

Use case: “Poe allows you to access all the models. That's the highest value chatbot. And I use a lot of the coding tools — Windsurf, Lovable, Cursor, Replit. I've estimated I'm around 30 times faster at software creation.”

Markiesha Patrice, startup community lead at Nebius

Favorite tool: Descript

Use case: “I do a lot of video content and editing, so Descript makes it very simple for me. It's saving time and it's also ease of use. If you're not someone who is super technical or trained, there is not much extra knowledge that you have to have in order to go into the platform and use it.”

Gregory Kennedy, chief vibe marketer at Vibe Your SaaS

Favorite tool: Claude, Canva

Use case: “As a writing assistant, Claude is probably the best one. It works for me like an intern, where it can get started with an idea. I use it more like a really advanced version of Grammarly. And I think Canva doesn't get a lot of love, and their AI tools are quite good. I do a lot of visuals and graphics for marketing. The tools are really powerful for moving backgrounds, manipulating things, whatever you need. It's really fast and easy.”

Elizabeth Russo, CEO at adyn

Favorite tool: Claude

Use case: “Mostly to help as a writing assistant, primarily for emails to potential partners and investors. It can sometimes unlock writer's block or help me get over procrastination of starting something. Even if it gives me a bad draft, I feel motivated that I can do better and fix it.”

Xuchen Yao, co-founder and CEO at Seasalt.ai

Favorite tool: Warp

Use case: “I use it for vibe coding. I just open up a terminal and tell it the instructions. I use it to translate blogs into 20 different languages to make our company more international. I also use it to do code reviews.”

Robert Mao, architect at AIGNE

Favorite tool: AIGNE

Use case: “A lot of people are doing vibe coding, but for me, as a developer, I actually enjoy coding. But I really hate writing design documents and user documents. And so we're building a vibe document tool for developers. All you do is feed in your design idea draft and the AI turns it into a full document. Or if you already wrote the code, it makes a super cool design document.”

Microsoft is fighting to keep its consumer AI division, led by its AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, from getting dragged into the copyright lawsuit filed by The New York Times and other news organizations against Microsoft and OpenAI.

In a court filing Thursday, Microsoft argued that the current version of its Copilot AI assistant for consumers should be excluded from the process of legal discovery — opposing an effort by the plaintiffs to require the team behind the product to turn over documents and materials deemed relevant to the case. 

The product “did not exist at the time News Plaintiffs filed their complaints, is built on a different platform with new system architecture than the products named in News Plaintiffs' complaints, and involves hundreds of potential new custodians given that the back-end code was written by an entirely new team,” the filing said, using the legal term for people in possession of materials subject to discovery.

But lawyers for the news organizations contend that Copilot is powered by the same core AI systems, performing the same functions, with the same alleged harms.

“Microsoft's refusal to provide discovery into the ‘refreshed' version of consumer Copilot hamstrings News Plaintiffs' ability to investigate evidence critical for its case and to rebut Microsoft's fair use defense,” lawyers for the news organizations wrote in a filing Monday.

They noted that Microsoft has confirmed that the new Copilot is powered by GPT-4o, an OpenAI model that's already involved in the litigation. They argued that this undermines Microsoft's claim that the new Copilot is fundamentally different, for purposes of the suit and the process of discovery.

The lawsuit, filed in December 2023 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Microsoft and OpenAI engaged in large-scale, unauthorized scraping of copyrighted news articles to train AI models. 

By using their reporting to generate answers, the plaintiffs contend, the AI tools divert readers that would otherwise visit their news sites, impacting the market for their work and undermining their business models.

The suit targets both companies due to their close partnership. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into OpenAI, and the ChatGPT maker uses Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform to build and train its AI models. 

These kinds of discovery battles are common in complex litigation. Lawyers for both sides have been arguing for more than a year over discovery issues related to everything from reporters' notes to OpenAI user data. 

No definitive court rulings have yet been made on the central question of the suit: whether the AI models infringe on copyright.

Amazon reached a deal in May to license the New York Times' editorial content for use in its AI platforms, reportedly paying at least $20 million annually.

The latest legal wrangling puts a spotlight on the Microsoft consumer AI division created last year under Suleyman, a high-profile figure in the AI world who co-founded Google's DeepMind. Suleyman joined Microsoft in March 2024 in a deal that saw the tech giant also hire a number of employees from his AI startup, Inflection AI.

His team launched the new consumer version of Copilot in October 2024, separate from the Microsoft 365 Copilot business AI product. It has a redesigned user interface with features such as a personalized daily news summary, natural voice interactions, and the ability for the AI to act as a companion while browsing the web.

Suleyman is not named in the filings, but the language refers to his team — noting, for example, that “New Consumer Copilot was developed and marketed by a group of people who recently joined Microsoft.”

Joining the New York Times in the suit are Daily News LP (parent of the New York Daily News), and the Center for Investigative Reporting.

Tech Moves covers notable hires, promotions and personnel changes in the Pacific NW tech community. Submissions: tips@geekwire.com

— Two co-founders and former executives of Seattle-based Protect AI announced their new roles at Palo Alto Networks, the California cybersecurity company that acquired their startup in April.

Ian Swanson, Protect AI's past CEO, is vice president of AI security for Palo Alto Networks. The recent deal marked the third acquisition of a company that Swanson helped launch. He was also CEO and co-founder of Sometrics, which American Express bought, and of DataScience, which was acquired by Oracle.

Protect AI's former President Daryan Dehghanpisheh is now Palo Alto Network's go-to-market lead for AI security in North America. Dehghanpisheh's past employers include Amazon Web Services, Intel and The Howard Hughes Corporation.

Badar Ahmed, Protect AI's third co-founder and chief technologist and product officer, has not shared a new title.

While acquisition terms were not disclosed, sources reported the Protect AI deal was valued at more than $500 million. The company launched in 2022 and was ranked No. 10 on GeekWire 200, our list of top privately held startups in the Pacific Northwest.

— Chainguard, a fully remote cybersecurity company valued at $3.5 billion, announced two new members of its C-suite:  

Chainguard launched four years ago and disclosed a $356 million investment round in April. The company is officially headquartered in Kirkland, Wash.

— Alan Higginson, a long-time board member and current board chair for F5, is retiring from his role, the company shared in a July Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Higginson will not stand for re-nomination at the Seattle tech company's annual shareholder meeting next spring, which will bring his tenure to 30 years. He became board chair in 2004.

Higginson was previously president and CEO of Hubspan, an e-business infrastructure provider, and president of Atrieva, which offers advanced data backup and retrieval technology.

— Gilbert Wootton, managing director of Accenture's Seattle office, has retired after more than 35 years with the global professional services company.

“I plan to ski a lot (water and snow) over next six months and spend significant time with [my wife] Carolyn,” he said on LinkedIn, adding that his “intention is to maximize the third phase of my life.”

Wootton currently serves on the boards for Providence, the Washington Technology Industry Association (WTIA) and the University of Washington Center for Sales and Marketing, as well as on the advisory board for the UW's Mechanical Engineering Department, from which he graduated.

— Former Microsoft and SAP executive John “JG” Chirapurath is now president of DataPelago, a data processing company headquartered in Mountain View, Calif. Chirapurath, who is based in Seattle, comes to the role from SAP, where he served as executive vice president at the enterprise application company. 

His career also includes 14 years at Microsoft, which was briefly interrupted for leadership roles at ProQuest and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. At the Redmond, Wash.-software tech giant, Chirapurath was most recently a vice president with Azure.  

— Ken Wong is now the lead of Databricks‘ recently opened R&D center in Vancouver, B.C. The new location will focus on artificial and business intelligence, real-time analytics, and next-gen enterprise data applications.

“With Vancouver's heritage as one of the birthplaces for analytics, the city has a deep pool of data and AI talent for Databricks to draw from,” the company said.

Wong was co-founder and CEO of Datajoy, which Databricks acquired in 2022, roughly two years after it launched. Prior to Datajoy, Wong was at SAP, Microsoft and Tableau Software. 

— Kyle Wiggers has joined Ai2 as the Seattle nonprofit's communications lead. Wiggers comes to the role from TechCrunch where he led the news outlet's AI coverage. Wiggers has been a journalist for more than a decade and was previously at VentureBeat, XDA Developers, Digital Trends and other publications.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has raised $8.3 billion at a $300 billion valuation, reports The New York Times. The deal is part of OpenAI's broader strategy to secure $40 billion this year. 

The oversubscribed round came months ahead of schedule, per the NYT. OpenAI initially raised $2.5 billion from VC firms in March when it announced its intention to raise $40 billion in a round spearheaded by Softbank. The AI giant had planned to take on an additional $7.5 billion by the end of the year, but beat itself to the punch as investors clamber to get onto its cap table amid impressive growth.

On Thursday, The Information reported OpenAI hit $12 billion in annualized revenue and surpassed 700 million ChatGPT weekly active users. The Times today said that the number is closer to $13 billion, with projections to reach $20 billion by the end of the year. Other tailwinds include the Trump administration's AI Action Plan and talks with Microsoft that could help the startup reach its goal of becoming a true for-profit company.

The Times reported that Dragoneer Investment Group, an under-the-radar investor, led the round with a startling $2.8 billion check. Many new investors participated in the round, including private equity giants Blackstone and TPG and mutual fund manager T. Rowe Price. Other participants include Altimeter Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue Management, D1 Capital Partners, Fidelity Management, Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, and Thrive Capital.

Some early investors in OpenAI were reportedly dismayed by the smaller allocations they got in the round as the AI behemoth prioritized bringing on new strategic backers. 

TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for comment.

Instagram users now need a public account with a minimum of 1,000 followers to go live on the platform, the social network confirmed to TechCrunch. Until now, Instagram has allowed anyone to go live, regardless of their follower count or whether their account is public or private.

The move will be a blow to smaller creators on the platform who fall under the 1,000 followers requirement, as well as regular users who just liked to go live with their friends for fun.

Users who don't have public accounts and have fewer than 1,000 followers will see a new notice when they try to go live, stating that their account is no longer eligible for Live. The notice continues, “We changed requirements to use this feature. Only public accounts with 1,000 followers or more will be able to create live videos.”

Users have taken to social media to express their displeasure with the change, with some asking for it to be reversed. 

The change brings Instagram's live feature more in line with TikTok's, as the short-form video app also requires users to have at least 1,000 followers to go live. In comparison, YouTube requires channels to have a minimum of 50 subscribers to go live.

While the company didn't provide a specific reason for the change, it noted that the move is designed to improve the overall Live consumption experience. 

The change could limit lower-quality streams by only allowing users with an established audience to go live. 

It could also be a way for Meta to save money. Since hosting live streams is expensive, Meta may have decided that it doesn't want to support broadcasts with only a handful of viewers.

Google DeepMind is rolling out Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, which, the company says, is its most advanced AI reasoning model, able to answer questions by exploring and considering multiple ideas simultaneously and then using those outputs to choose the best answer.

Subscribers to Google's $250-per-month Ultra subscription will gain access to Gemini 2.5 Deep Think in the Gemini app starting Friday.

First unveiled in May at Google I/O 2025, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think is Google's first publicly available multi-agent model. These systems spawn multiple AI agents to tackle a question in parallel, a process that uses significantly more computational resources than a single agent, but tends to result in better answers.

Google used a variation of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think to score a gold medal at this year's International Math Olympiad (IMO).

Alongside Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, the company says it is releasing the model it used at the IMO to a select group of mathematicians and academics. Google says this AI model “takes hours to reason,” instead of seconds or minutes like most consumer-facing AI models. The company hopes the IMO model will enhance research efforts, and aims to get feedback on how to improve the multi-agent system for academic use cases.

Google notes that the Gemini 2.5 Deep Think model is a significant improvement over what it announced at I/O. The company also claims to have developed “novel reinforcement learning techniques” to encourage Gemini 2.5 Deep Think to make better use of its reasoning paths.

“Deep Think can help people tackle problems that require creativity, strategic planning and making improvements step-by-step,” said Google in a blog post shared with TechCrunch.

The company says Gemini 2.5 Deep Think achieves state-of-the-art performance on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) — a challenging test measuring AI's ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions across math, humanities, and science. Google claims its model scored 34.8% on HLE (without tools), compared to xAI's Grok 4, which scored 25.4%, and OpenAI's o3, which scored 20.3%.

Google also says Gemini 2.5 Deep Think outperforms AI models from OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic on LiveCodeBench 6, a challenging test of competitive coding tasks. Google's model scored 87.6%, whereas Grok 4 scored 79%, and OpenAI's o3 scored 72%.

Gemini 2.5 Deep Think automatically works with tools such as code execution and Google Search, and the company says it's capable of producing “much longer responses” than traditional AI models.

In Google's testing, the model produced more detailed and aesthetically pleasing web development tasks compared to other AI models. The company claims the model could aid researchers and “potentially accelerate the path to discovery.”

It seems that several leading AI labs are converging around the multi-agent approach.

Elon Musk's xAI recently released a multi-agent system of its own, Grok 4 Heavy, which it says was able to achieve industry-leading performance on several benchmarks. OpenAI researcher Noam Brown said on a podcast that the unreleased AI model the company used to achieve a gold medal at this year's International Math Olympiad was also a multi-agent system. Meanwhile, Anthropic's Research agent, which generates thorough research briefs, is also powered by a multi-agent system.

Despite the strong performance, it seems that multi-agent systems are even costlier to serve than traditional AI models. That means tech companies may keep these systems gated behind their most expensive subscription plans, which xAI and now Google have chosen to do.

In the coming weeks, Google says it plans to share Gemini 2.5 Deep Think with a select group of testers via the Gemini API. The company says it wants to better understand how developers and enterprises may use its multi-agent system.

At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, taking place October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, we're getting real about what it takes to land a Series A in today's market — no smoke, no mirrors, just the unfiltered perspective from the people signing the checks.

This Builder Stage session brings together three power players in early-stage investing: Katie Stanton (Moxxie Ventures), Thomas Krane (Insight Partners), and Sangeen Zeb (GV). They've seen thousands of decks, led major rounds, and helped steer startups from scrappy beginnings to breakout scale.

This conversation goes deeper than the headlines. From the metrics that matter and how to tell your growth story, to what causes investors to walk away — you'll hear what actually moves a pitch from “maybe” to “we're in.”

Katie Stanton brings a track record most operators only dream of. From Twitter and the Obama White House to backing more than 100 early-stage companies like Airtable, Calm, and Carta, she's built Moxxie Ventures on conviction and founder-first instincts.

Thomas Krane has spent over a decade at Insight Partners, climbing from analyst to managing director while backing some of the biggest names in software and cybersecurity. With IPO wins like JFrog and SentinelOne, he knows what scalable traction looks like — and how to fund it.

Sangeen Zeb is a general partner at GV with an eye for enterprise and AI. His board work spans companies like Vercel and Harvey, and he's helped lead investments in some of the most talked-about growth stories in tech.

The market is tighter, the stakes are higher, and this is the session founders can't afford to miss. Learn what it takes to raise on your terms and build for the long game.

Ask any homeowner: renovation projects are no fun at all. From finding a contractor to determining a fair price, the process is rife with uncertainty. 

Plenty of startups have popped up to help homeowners tackle electrification projects, including installing solar panels and replacing gas furnaces with heat pumps. But they still struggle with the cost question: acquiring customers is often more than half the battle.

Pearl Edison thinks the answer is utilities.

“As much as anything, we are leveraging their brand equity and trust,” Evan Anderson, co-founder and CEO of Pearl Edison, told TechCrunch.

Investors have bought into the idea. The Detroit-based startup has raised a $3.3 million seed round from New System Ventures and Commonweal Ventures, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Lightbank and Newlab participated.

Pearl Edison works with utilities to identify customers who are most likely to benefit from energy retrofit projects, including heat pumps and additional insulation. It builds a white-labeled website for the utility, and it helps the larger organization run campaigns to sign people up for energy efficiency upgrades.

The company uses a range of data sources to design a job and generate a price, which it guarantees for the customer. After its software produces a first draft of the plans, it sends workers out to verify everything in the field before finalizing the design.

It then sends the jobs to vetted contractors, who complete the installation. Pearl Edison makes money on the installs itself, estimating that the majority of those jobs will cost less than it quotes. Homeowners should save money, too, Anderson said, because Pearl Edison can contract the job for less since the installers don't have to waste time acquiring customers.

Already, the company has programs set up with two utilities, DT Energy in Michigan and Duquesne Light in the Pittsburgh area, and one government, the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Anderson said the company will add two more utilities this year. 

“We've found them to be good partners,” Anderson said.

Paying with a handwave once sounded like science fiction, but contactless palm recognition service Amazon One has already been used more than 8 million times, according to the company. That's Amazon, though, which explains why it has been deployed in Amazon stores and more than 500 Whole Foods Market stores in the U.S., but only 150 third-party locations.

Meanwhile, fintech startups like Latvia's Handwave are stepping onto the field, aiming to provide third-party retailers with a similar but independent solution for faster checkout while leveraging the giant's role in popularizing biometric payments in the West. (China has already begun adopting biometric palm payments, with Tencent working to bring its Weixin Palm Pay service into mainstream use.)

Like Apple's Face ID, palm scanning uses more than static images: It analyzes palm vein patterns and also verifies that the user is physically present when they hover their hand over the scanner. This method works for secure contactless payments and also applies to broader identity verification scenarios — with players like Keyo also supporting secure building access and other applications.

In contrast, Handwave is focusing specifically on retail — and since it doesn't own stores like Amazon, it had to seek partners, which required having a product. Three years in, and now with its own hardware and software, the Latvian startup is preparing for market pilots that will deploy its palm-scanning devices at retail stores. 

Merchants who deploy the startup's tech would pay a transaction fee that Handwave claims will be on par with or lower than standard payments. According to Handwave, faster and cheaper checkouts could reduce costs. But unlike some cost-cutting measures, this solution aims to make things easier for customers — with the promise of no cards, no apps, no fingerprint scanners, and no facial scans — even for age verification and loyalty programs.

Handwave's co-founders, CEO Janis Stirna and Sandis Osmanis-Usmanis, previously worked for one of the world's largest global payment providers, Worldline. Despite this connection, the team aims to build a wide ecosystem. “Our plan is to collaborate with any financial institution or acquiring bank,” Stirna told TechCrunch.

The startup has only partnered with a handful of financial institutions so far, “but very big ones, especially in Europe,” Stirna said. This summer, the startup signed an agreement with Visa that could speed up the deployment of Handwave's solution in any country, according to its chief revenue officer, Oskars Laksevics.

While Handwave has its eyes on the U.S. market as well, Laksevics believes that it can be an advantage to start out in the European Union — “the strictest market in the world” — and demonstrate compliance there before expanding.

Being an independent European player could also help the startup keep an edge if or when Amazon decides to more aggressively offer Amazon One to third parties; or if JP Morgan rolls out its own palm payment experiment further. 

The startup also can rely on other arguments, including pricing. After financial partners told Handwave its devices need to be able to compete on price, the startup developed its own hardware and algorithms making them cheaper than others, Stirna said. 

Being based in Riga also enabled Handwave to operate with limited capital. The startup told TechCrunch its R&D process was funded through bootstrapping, a $780,000 angel investment round, and $267,000 in non-equity funding. This sum came from an EU-funded cybersecurity grant, as well as support from Latvia's LIAA Business Incubator and EU-backed accelerator Ready2Scale.

As it gears up for its first pilots and obtaining regulatory certifications, Handwave has now secured a $4.2 million seed funding round led by Vilnius-based VC firm Practica Capital, with participation from FirstPick and Outlast Fund, also from Lithuania; and Inovo.vc, a Polish VC firm that also operates in the Baltics.

The Baltic states have established themselves as a fintech hub, but also have scientific talent that's easier for a startup like Handwave to attract and afford than in Silicon Valley — including AI engineers. “In the Baltics, there are not a lot of companies where you can get that extreme level of technical challenge to resolve,” Stirna said.

As for Laksevics, who previously held a senior marketing role at Baltic bank Luminor Bank, where Stirna had also worked, he told TechCrunch that he was drawn by the vision. “I left a very well-paid corporate job to join this one, and I truly believe that we are building the next big global payment platform,” he said. 

Handwave seems ready to put its best hand forward — but only time will tell if the market will grab on and if biometric palm payments will truly take hold.

I'm calling it now: investors are gonna get burned hard on this one. Cause right now all they have is ""well we are working on superintelligence"" and to that I say ""great, then what?"". Even if they do make that breakthrough I don't see how that will equate to that kind of valuation, especially considering that Anthropic and Google are both hot on their heels.

Then you ask your superintelligence for advice on how to make money, obviously.

Secondly, this is looking very risky: they are at the bottom of the value chain and eventually they'll be running on razor thin margins like all actors who are at the bottom of the value chain.Anything they can offer is doable by their competitors (in Google's case, they can even do it cheaper due to ow ing the vertical which OpenAI doesn't own).Their position in the value chain means they are in a precarious spot: any killer app for AI that comes along will be owned by a customer of OpenAI, and if OpenAI attempts to skim that value for itself that customer will simply switch to a new provider of which there are many, including, eventually, the customer themselves should they decide to self host.Being an AI provider right now is a very risky proposition because any attempt to capture value can be immediate met with ""we're switching to a competitor"" or even the nuclear ""fine, we'll self host an open model ourselves"".We'll know more only when we see what the killer app is, when it eventually comes.

Google does not really own the complete AI stack, NVDA is extracting a lot of the value there.Google has two other impediments to doing what ChatGPT does.Googles entire business model is built around search. They have augmented search with AI, but that is not the same as completely disrupting an incredibly profitable business model with an unprofitable and unproven business model.Also... Americans are in the habit of going to ChatGPT now for AI. When you think of AI, you now think of ChatGPT first.The real risk is we are at the tail end of a long economic boom cycle, OpenAI is incredibly dependent on additional funding rounds, and if we recess access to that funding gets cut off.

I'm in my late 40s. I'm Gen X. I lived through the glory days of the dotcom boom, when investors got burned for tons of money. But from the ashes of those bullshit companies, we got Amazon, Google, etc., which made investors rich beyond belief.SoftBank's Masayoshi Son made a bet on Alibaba ($20 million, its stake now worth $72 billion), and he's been living off that wealth ever since. I haven't seen him make any good bets lately. investors don't really care if 100 of the shit they throw don't stick because all they need is just one.

that would be a monthly recurring revenue of 200 x 7bn = $1,400,000,000,000 or $1.4tn a month, $16.8tn per year!I think they've be valued a bit higher than $300bn if that were the case.

I haven't tried it yet though.

Not necessarily. Google is valued 7x that and most people don't pay them anything. They just make ridiculous money from ads for insurance and loans. Meanwhile, ChatGPT is the #1 app and the #5 website, which should really worry google (and it does by all accounts).

reply

Moreover, ads are a very high ROI business. The profit margins on SOTA LLM offerings are razor thin or negative.

reply

Only if you look narrowly at search ads, but really they compete with Meta, Tiktok and X for ad spend. And the quality of the LLMs is beside the point, just like search engine quality. ChatGPT has a near monopoly on 'AI' mindshare, with the general public.

This is why.Of course $300B still implies a lot of growth, but when you're growing 100% in 6 months at $10B in ARR, you can demand a lot.

That $8.3b came in early, and was oversubscribed, so the terms are likely favorable to oAI, but if an investor puts in $1b at a $300b valuation (cap) with a 20% discount to the next round, and the company raises another round at $30b in two months; good news: they got in at a $24b price.To your point on Anthropic and Google; yep. But, if you think one of these guys will win (and I think you have to put META on this list too), then por que no los quatro? Just buy all four.I'll call it now; they won't lose money on those checks.

This completely misses the boat on venture capital, which is almost by definition the riskiest of all risky bets. Any smart LP throwing $X into a fund has a portfolio valued, at the very least, at 100 if not 1000 times X. It is simply the way to expose the high-risk portion of the portfolio to that level of risk at the size of the investment needed. Being high-risk, probably it will return nothing. But it might not.

  … they could only use openai api and I don't think that they would really switch now, because I think switching would be hard.

Do they have exclusive APIs? I thought more or less everyone had the same interface and switching might be almost as easy as changing the endpoint.Given how many players are in this space, I am incredibly dubious that anyone will win. Market is going to be sliced between multiple big companies who are going to be increasingly squeezed on margin. Unless someone can produce some magic that is 10x more reliable, consumers are going to price compare. Today, all of the options can occasionally produce brain dead output -why pay a premium?Especially bad for OpenAI, because they have no fallback revenue. Microsoft and Google can subside their offerings forever to eliminate competition.

The ad-monetized consumer market is funny in that they tend to be winner take all. Nobody can compete on price, because the ads go where the users are, and the users don't pay. And preferences are sticky, after making a choice, the users don't switch just for incremental improvements. SoThe software development industry is likewise well in the process of being disrupted. LLMs for programming market seems to have grown from nothing to >$10B in a year. And the software development market is hundreds of billions / year, if you just consider the employment costs. We don't know exactly how this will play out, but again there's at least an order of magnitude more growth available there.The above two are just the places where the impact is already obvious and it's clear that we don't need to assume any additional increase in capabilities. But an increase in capabilities seems really likely. Even if it turns out that we're right now on the cross-over of the sigmoid, and the asymptote won't be ASI or even AGI, a large proportion of knowledge work is also at risk. And then the addressable market is trillions if not tens of trillions.I know this is hand-wavy, apologies for that. Doing this kind of analysis properly is both hard work and would require specialized data sources. But I think that's the general intuition for why high valuations for frontier labs are justifiable (and the same justification for bigtech capex). It's a lottery ticket with good odds for redistributing existing markets, as well as another set of lottery tickets for some set of probable markets, though we don't know exactly which.With AGI or ASI, the addressable market is all economic activity, and at that point basically anything is justifiable.

Ai applications have not even scratched the surface, IMO. I don't think it is unreasonable to see a world where, when AI gets strong enough to do senior level white collar work, like doctors or lawyers, AI companies build sub-companies to capture the end value of their AI products rather than the base value as a vertical integration tactic.We are at a lull but AI value add is real and the ways that AI companies capture that value add is still very primitive.

reply

How much of that OpenAI can capture is an interesting question. But right now APIs for open-source models are commoditized while similarly capable proprietary models can charge ~3x the price. If the flagship models run on similar margins the API offering has decent profit margins. And if we stay in a triopoly (Anthropic, Mistral, OpenAI) it's certainly possible that profits stay high. It wouldn't be the first industry where that happens

“Our family loves Annie and is very concerned about her well-being. Caring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult. We know many families facing similar struggles understand this well.Over the years, we've tried in many ways to support Annie and help her find stability, following professional advice on how to be supportive without enabling harmful behaviors. To give a sense of our efforts, we have given her monthly financial support, directly paid her bills, covered her rent, helped her find employment opportunities, attempted to get her medical help, and have offered to buy her a house through a trust (so that she would have a secure place to live, but not be able to sell it immediately). Via our late father's estate, Annie receives monthly financial support, which we expect to continue for the rest of her life. Despite this, Annie continues to demand more money from us. In this vein, Annie has made deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims about our family, and especially Sam. We've chosen not to respond publicly, out of respect for her privacy and our own. However, she has now taken legal action against Sam, and we feel we have no choice but to address this. Over the years, she has accused members of our family of improperly withholding our father's 401k funds, hacking her wife, and ""shadowbanning"" her from various websites including ChatGPT, Twitter, and more. The worst allegation she has made is that she was sexually abused by Sam as a child (she has also claimed instances of sexual abuse from others). Her claims have evolved drastically over time. Newly for this lawsuit, they now include allegations of incidents where Sam was over 18. All of these claims are utterly untrue. This situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refuses conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help. We ask for understanding and compassion from everyone as we continue to support Annie in the best way we can. We sincerely hope she finds the stability and peace she's been searching for. -Connie, Sam, Max, and Jack”

Yes. Engineers use the latest features heavily to demonstrate that their skills are current.One of the worst such features is ""var"". Some tools even flag your code for not using var when you could. Inappropriate use of ""var"" makes code harder to read (and even MS documentation says this) and makes code slightly less reliable too.

I disagree with this too, I think your example is a classic case of preprocessor directives making it difficult to know what your code is doing because the build system is going to conditionally change your code. Var or not, you can't even know what's being compiled just by looking at the file, and that's a larger problem than the use of varhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-ref...

This is a gold standard for documenting source code, in my experience. It doesn't entirely solve the “bus” problem, but reduces the barrier to entry for new maintainers or project resuscitators substantially by making it easy to understand what's going on and why decisions were made.Admittedly, my own code is also in that 35% range for commenting, so I'm inherently biased towards that threshold specifically. YMMV.

It's rather easy to get over 50% by putting a comment above each line of code, containing the output of an LLM that's asked ""what does this line do"" and supplied with exactly that line of code. It's much harder to make sure the comments make sense and actually add value.

If the llm can produce similar enough comment from scratch, would it be better to just have an IDE that dynamically injects comments when you need as opposed to them being in version control?

reply

Comments in source code are always going to meet the maintainer's intention and will much more likely cover the use cases that comments are meant to cover - unintuitive cases or decisions, unclear algorithms, general usage to point maintainers in the right direction, and so on. More importantly, comments in the source code require no additional tools or other dependencies and as such are more dependable.

Google just made one of its most advanced AI reasoning models available to the public. Like other advanced models, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think uses more than one AI agent to brainstorm answers in order to boost accuracy and result in more creative solutions.

Google says the model outperformed several of its competitors in key AI benchmark tests and a variation of the model even achieved the gold-medal standard at this year's International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), solving five out of the six IMO problems perfectly. That research model took hours to produce solutions, but the version available today is designed for everyday use working much faster, while still achieving bronze-level IMO performance.

However, in order to try out the new model users will need to hand over $250 a month for a Google AI Ultra subscription.Starting today, subscribers get access to a fixed set of prompts for the new model. They can enable “Deep Think” by toggling it in the prompt bar when selecting Gemini 2.5 Pro from the model dropdown menu in the Gemini app.

Google first previewed Gemini 2.5 Deep Think back in May at its I/O developer conference, but the company says the version released today is a “significant improvement,” thanks to tester feedback and key benchmark improvements.

Google says Deep Think uses parallel thinking techniques to tackle complex problems like a human would by weighing different angles and potential solutions.

“This approach lets Gemini generate many ideas at once and consider them simultaneously, even revising or combining different ideas over time, before arriving at the best answer,” the company said in a blog post.

Additionally, Google says it developed new reinforcement learning techniques that push the model to explore extended reasoning paths, helping Deep Think become a stronger and more intuitive problem-solver over time.

This, Google claims, makes the model particularly useful for things like coding, web development, and scientific research.

According to Google, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think outperformed rival models on the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a 2,500-question expertise benchmark spanning subjects like math, science, and the humanities. The model achieved a score of 34.8% on the test, compared with OpenAI o3's 20.3% and Grok 4's 25.4% scores.

Google also said it will share the gold-medal version of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think with a small group of mathematicians and academics, hoping to see how it might aid their research. The company plans to use that feedback to refine future versions of the model.

Generative AI is not just another tech hype cycle that is bound to die down but is instead a game-changer for human productivity, according to the Federal Reserve. The big caveat, though, is the road to get there will be “inherently slow” and “fraught with risk.”

In a recent paper published by the Fed Board of Governors, researchers suggest that the hype around generative AI is probably not a bubble in the long run and that the technology will be a serious macroeconomic force, proving to have revolutionary effects for labor productivity akin to electricity and the microscope.

The idea that generative AI will make the workforce more productive isn't a groundbreaking one. It's been lauded by corporate executives and many AI bulls alike since OpenAI's generative AI model ChatGPT sparked the AI craze.

But what's significant is that the country's most powerful economic institution has just voiced notable confidence in the technology's potential. Albeit with a catch.

The paper divides technological innovations into three categories. First, you have innovations like the light bulb, which dramatically increased productivity initially by allowing workers to not be limited to daylight. But once the technology was adopted widely, the lightbulb stopped providing additional value to workplace productivity. 

“In contrast, two types of technologies stand out as having longer-lived effects on productivity growth,” the researchers write, and AI has characteristics of both.

The first are “general-purpose technologies,” like the electric dynamo or the computer. The electric dynamo was the first practical electric generator, and it continued to deliver accelerating productivity growth even after widespread adoption because it spurred related innovations and continued to improve on itself.

The researchers say that generative AI is already showing signs that it fits the bill. You have specialized LLMs for specific domains like OpenAI's LegalGPT meant to assist in legal matters, and “copilots” like Microsoft's Copilot product, which is meant to increase office productivity by integrating generative AI into corporate workstreams. Fed researchers think even more knock-on innovations are to come, and that wave will be led by digital native companies.

And it's evident that the core technology is rapidly innovating and will likely continue to do so as companies develop the technology with an aim to achieve artificial general intelligence. In the meantime, the paper points out, the technology's rapid growth has already given us further innovations like agentic AI and landmark AI models like Deepseek's R1.

The second type of technology is called “inventions of methods of invention,” the most prominent examples being the microscope or the printing press. Although a microscope has now become a common tool, it continues to raise levels of human productivity by enabling research and development projects.

Generative AI has been helpful in simulations to understand the nature of the universe, in novel drug discoveries, and more. And the paper notes that there has been a huge spike, starting in 2023, of companies citing AI within research and development contexts and in corporate earnings calls, showing that perhaps AI's integration with corporate innovation has already begun.

Alas, this confidence comes with a caveat. AI will be a boon for economic and productivity growth, but it is unlikely to happen overnight.

The Fed's paper says the biggest challenge with generative AI right now isn't the tech itself: it's getting people and businesses to actually use it. While researchers are starting to adopt it more, most companies outside of tech and the scientific fields haven't worked it into their daily operations yet, with the exception of the finance industry. And industry surveys show that AI adoption is far higher within large firms than small ones. 

So while generative AI is likely to boost how productive we are overall, the impact will be slow. That's because it takes time, money, and other supporting tech like user interfaces, robotics, and AI agents to make AI really useful across the economy. The authors compare it to past big tech changes, like advances in computation, which accumulated for decades before causing a productivity boom. 

The timeline for that boom is still unknown. Goldman Sachs economists think AI's effects on labor productivity and GDP growth in the U.S. will start to show in 2027 and will accelerate to a peak in the 2030s.

Another risk the Fed points out comes with building infrastructure for anticipated demand. A widespread adoption of generative AI means significant need for investment in data centers and electricity generation. But investing too quickly can have “disastrous consequences” when demand doesn't grow as expected, the Fed warns, similar to how railroad overexpansion in the 1800s led to an economic depression towards the end of the century.

Despite the caveats, the Fed is confident that generative AI will be transformative for productivity. But whether that transformation continues to accelerate perpetually and have as big of an effect as the electric dynamo or the microscope will depend on the extent and speed of the technology's adoption.

To mark a monumental occasion, some people go on a vacation; others go to a nice dinner or throw a party. For Star Wars, it's celebrating its 50th anniversary by going back to the movies. Disney just announced it will re-release George Lucas' original Star Wars in theaters on April 30, 2027. That's about a month ahead of the actual anniversary on May 25, 2027, but that weekend is reserved for a brand new Star Wars film, Star Wars: Starfighter, starring Ryan Gosling.

The rerelease will also come a few short weeks after Star Wars Celebration Los Angeles, which takes place from April 1 to 4, 2027. With this all teed up, you can imagine Lucasfilm will promote the heck out of it at that event, maybe even bringing some of the original cast and crew together again.

What's unclear, at least now almost two years away, is which version of the film will come to theaters. The prevailing thought is it'll be the 1997 Special Edition, George Lucas' preferred version of the movie, with those added scenes and enhancements. However, just last month, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy was on hand for a very rare screening of an original print of Star Wars, long before anything was changed on it. Not even “Episode IV: A New Hope.” Maybe, just maybe, that's a tease of what's to come.

Or, with so much time, maybe it's some kind of blend of the two. A new restoration of the original, unaltered film. That, surely, would have fans more excited than anything else.

The story of a young farm boy (Mark Hamill) who finds himself on a galaxy-spanning adventure to save a princess (Carrie Fisher) along with his mentor (Alec Guinness) and a daring pilot (Harrison Ford), Star Wars is one of the most influential and popular films of all time. It spawned two immediate sequels, three prequels, and then three more sequels over the past four-plus decades. Oh, and some shows and books and comics and games and toys and stuff too.

Which version of A New Hope do you hope is in theaters? Are you definitely going to go? Let us know.

Living in a city where air pollution seems unavoidable can feel discouraging, but there's something you can do to protect your health right at home: Investing in an air purifier is a simple way to ensure you breathe cleaner air, especially in your bedroom where you spend nearly a third of your life. You don't have to spend $500 on a Dyson to get quality air cleaning – there are more affordable and practical options too. One of these is the Mooka air purifier (B-D02L), available now on Amazon at a record low price of about $39 after stacking discounts (instant discount + promo code), down from $79.

See at Amazon

The Mooka B-D02L is designed to encompass large rooms, and covers up to 1076 square feet. Since it has a very effective filtration mechanism, it will circulate the air in a 215-square-foot room six times every hour, and perform one full air exchange every hour in larger rooms of up to 1076 square feet. That makes it ideal for a household with pets or children for instance.

The H13 True HEPA filter is the heart of this purifier and it is one of the highest efficiencies in particle capture. It traps pollutants down to 0.3 microns, dust (such as pet hair, dust, pollen, smoke, dander) and odors. The system includes a pre-filter and an activated carbon filter that will work together to catch bigger particles and eradicate stinky odors.

What's extremely important is that it's also very quiet: Its new brushless motor keeps sound at just 20 decibels which is barely audible. That means you can leave it on while doing work or sleeping without being disturbed. And it draws very little power, so you won't notice your electricity bill. If security is your priority, the purifier also features a child lock to prevent accidental modification by curious kids.

Controls on this air purifier are easy to operate: You can have four timer settings (1, 2, 4, or 8 hours) and adjust fan speed via Sleep, Low, Medium, and High. With these controls, you have the power to determine the amount of air you'd like cleaned without wasting energy. There is even a soft night light that will eliminate night stumbling which can be turned off when you want the total blackness of a totally dark room.

If you are looking for a budget-friendly solution to clean the air you and your family breathe, this air purifier is a perfect choice. Don't miss that opportunity on Amazon.

In a historic shake-up of the global memory market, SK hynix has overtaken Samsung Electronics to become the world's top memory maker by revenue, marking a pivotal shift in an industry long dominated by its larger Korean rival. The moment comes not just as a financial milestone, but as a broader signal of how the memory business is being reshaped by the explosive demand for AI.

The news first emerged through multiple South Korean financial publications, with industry tracking firm Counterpoint and Omidia confirming SK hynix's rise to the number one spot in Q2 2025. The company pulled in $9.66 billion in memory revenue, edging out Samsung's $8.94 billion and securing a 36.2% market share compared to Samsung's 33.5%. This marks the first time SK hynix has surpassed Samsung since its founding in 1983.

At the heart of this leap lies SK hynix's early and aggressive move into high-bandwidth memory (HBM), the ultra-fast DRAM used in AI accelerators like Nvidia's B300. While Samsung was once seen as the leader in memory innovation, it now seems that SK Hynix has become Nvidia's primary HBM supplier. The firm's HBM3 and next-gen HBM3E modules are integral to the compute power behind large language models and generative AI workloads. Not only that, but Nvidia started with Samsung's GDDR7 in their mainstream RTX 50-series GPUs, only to bring in SK hynix's chips later.

SK hynix's success is also visible in its operating profits. The company posted 2.6 trillion KRW (~$1.88 billion) in Q2 operating profit—its highest in two and a half years—despite lingering weakness in traditional DRAM and NAND markets. Analysts say this divergence highlights a fundamental realignment in the memory industry: AI-centric demand now drives profitability more than PC or smartphone shipments ever did.



Samsung, by contrast, has struggled to match SK hynix's pace. Reports suggest delays in qualifying Samsung's own HBM3 and HBM3E with key customers like Nvidia, leading to lost ground in what has become the most lucrative segment of the memory space, so much so that price cuts are now in order. Samsung remains dominant in NAND flash and legacy DRAM, but those markets are not experiencing the same upside.

Further reflecting this change, SK hynix has become the most sought-after employer among Korean university students for the first time, overtaking Samsung. A recent survey by Incruit shows that compensation, engineering focus, and future growth outlook have driven students—particularly in electronics and tech majors—to favor SK Hynix.

Looking ahead, SK hynix is now eyeing an even stronger grip on the AI memory stack. The company has confirmed it is developing HBM4 and is investing heavily into vertical integration and packaging technologies to keep Nvidia and other AI customers close. Its trajectory mirrors broader shifts in the tech sector, where memory is no longer just a commodity, rather a key enabled of AI-powered next-gen computing.

For Samsung, though, the story is far from over. The company has pledged to bounce back with aggressive investment in HBM capacity, and rumors suggest it's chasing new clients beyond Nvidia, such as AMD and custom AI chip start-ups. But for now, the balance of power has shifted and SK hynix is no longer playing catch-up; it's setting the pace.

Get under the hood of your Windows OS


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


If you need to tweak your Windows 11 or 10 install, then Winaero Tweaker is for you (heck, this program even works as far back as Windows 7). A freeware app created by Sergey Tkachenko, Winaero Tweaker is a simple to use, all-in-one app that can tweak and tune your Windows installation without getting your hands dirty in the registry or command line.

If you want to protect your privacy, freeze a test rig for benchmarking, or get Windows working exactly how you want it, Winaero Tweaker is for you, and in this how-to, I'll show you how to install and use it.

1. Download Winaero Tweaker from the website.

2. Extract the contents of the ZIP download to a folder.

3. Run the installer. I chose “Portable Mode,” but you can choose whatever suits your needs. If you choose “Portable Mode,” make a note of the install location.

4. Run Winaero Tweaker. If you installed the app, it will be in your Start Menu. For those who chose Portable Mode, navigate to the installation folder and double-click the executable.

The user interface is simple, although it may be a bit daunting for new users. So let's take a look at it together.

1. Main Menu: Here, we can Import/Export Settings, reset tweaks, navigate the list, and more. We can also use the search box to go directly to a tweak.

2. Tweak List: A hierarchical list of all of the available tweaks. This list will alter depending on the OS in use. Here we see it running on my Windows 10 setup.

3. Tweak Details: Selecting a tweak from the list will alter this section of the UI according to your selection. We can then make adjustments to the OS.

Windows is full of advertisements these days. They are deeply embedded in the OS and can be tricky to remove, but not with Winaero Tweaker.

1. Scroll down to Advanced Appearance Settings and select Behavior.



2. Click on Disable Ads. All of the boxes should be automatically checked; however, you can tailor this to meet your specific needs.

3. Reboot the computer for the changes to take effect. You can either reboot as you make each change, or save all of your changes for one big reboot. There are pros and cons to both approaches.



Touted as a means to gather diagnostic and usage data to improve the OS, telemetry also reveals serial numbers, volume numbers, partitions etc. While not overtly sensitive, this is your private data, so it only seems right to keep it that way and Winaero Tweaker has a simple means to do it.

1. Scroll down to Privacy and select “Disable Telemetry”.



2. Check the box to disable telemetry.



3. Reboot, or remember to reboot later.



If you are building a benchmarking system, the next two sections are for you. They will disable driver updates and Windows updates, keeping your test bench frozen at a reliable constant for precision benchmarking.

1. Using the search box, look for “driver” and double-click on the returned result.

There's been a striking rise in disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia, since the COVID-19 pandemic, new survey data from the UK and the US showed.

“Healthcare providers should recognize post-COVID DGBI as part of the long COVID spectrum. These post-COVID gut problems appear more severe and require more medical care than similar pre-pandemic conditions,” Imran Aziz, MBChB, MD, honorary consultant gastroenterologist and senior clinical lecturer, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and University of Sheffield, Sheffield, England, told Medscape Medical News.

Aziz and colleagues surveyed a nationally representative sample of 4050 adults in the UK and the US in 2017 (pre-pandemic) and repeated the survey in 4002 adults in 2023 (post-pandemic).

The surveys included the Rome IV diagnostic questionnaire for DGBI and questions about nongastrointestinal somatic symptoms, anxiety and depression, quality of life, and healthcare use.

The 2023 survey also asked about COVID-19 infection and illness history.

The overall prevalence of DGBI (ie, meeting diagnostic criteria for at least one DGBI) increased significantly from the pre- to post-pandemic era (38% vs 47%; odds ratio [OR], 1.20), with similar findings independently noted in both countries.

From pre- to post-pandemic, the rise in DGBI was observed within the esophageal (9% vs 10%; OR, 1.16), gastroduodenal (12% vs 16%; OR, 1.45), and bowel domains (30% vs 33%; OR, 1.12).

Functional dyspepsia rose nearly 44% — from 8% to 12% (OR, 1.48) — and IBS increased 28% — from 5% to 6% (OR, 1.31).

The rise in DGBI has been seen in both men and women and across all adult age groups.

Aziz told Medscape Medical News the uptick is probably due to not only the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the gastrointestinal tract but also to the psychological stress associated with pandemic life.

“In this study, we found that COVID-viral related factors contributing to DGBI include number of infections, abdominal pain and/or diarrhea during COVID-19 infection, and long COVID,” he explained.

“We also observed increased mood disturbances among people with DGBI in the post-pandemic era, but this study did not determine the direction of causality. Previous studies have shown that in one third of DGBI cases the mood disturbance precedes gut symptoms, while in two third of cases gut symptoms precede mood disturbances,” Aziz noted.

The study was published online on July 30 in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

The results are in line with a recent study that found the prevalence of IBS and chronic idiopathic constipation among US adults rose significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a near doubling of the national rate of IBS over 2 years, as reported previously by Medscape Medical News.

Given a lack of high-quality clinical trials specifically for post-COVID DGBI management, “healthcare providers should follow existing standard guidelines for functional dyspepsia and IBS,” Aziz advised.

“The established treatment protocols remain our best approach until more targeted research becomes available. It's also important to take a holistic approach. This means addressing not just the gut symptoms but also any accompanying mood disturbances. Many long-COVID clinics already provide this multiintegrated care model, which appears to be the most effective approach,” Aziz said.

The 2017 survey was funded by the Rome Foundation, while the 2023 survey was funded by Tillotts Pharma and Novonesis. The funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. Aziz has received speaker fees from PrecisionBiotics.

A study published in Nature Medicine estimated that Helicobacter pylori infection could lead to 11.8 million cases of gastric cancer over the lifetime of today's children if current prevention strategies remain unchanged.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization, analyzed global cancer incidence data 2022 and United Nations demographic information to estimate future mortality. The study focused on people born between 2008 and 2017 to estimate their lifetime cancer risk linked to chronic H pylori infection.

According to the study, gastric cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Two thirds of future cases are projected in Asia (10.6 million), followed by the Americas (2.0 million), Africa (1.7 million), and Europe (1.2 million), with 900,000 in Europe linked to H pylori. Researchers emphasized that gastric cancer is largely preventable and called for stronger global prevention strategies, including the development of a vaccine against H pylori. 

Speaking with Univadis Spain, Javier P. Gisbert, MD, PhD, highlighted the urgent need to address H pylori infection. He is the head of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Unit at Hospital Universitario de La Princesa in Madrid, Spain, associate professor of medicine at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, and affiliated researcher with the Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Princesa, Madrid. “Gastric cancer is a major global health concern, ranking as the fifth most common cancer worldwide. The main cause is H pylori infection. If we could eradicate this bacterium, we would eliminate at least 90% of the gastric tumors it causes. In Spain alone, approximately 60,000 new cases of gastric cancer are expected in this birth cohort, with approximately 40,000 linked to H pylori infection. These figures show that this bacterium, and efforts to diagnose and prevent it, must be taken very seriously,” he said.

In 2021, the European Union launched the Beating Cancer Plan, followed by European Council recommendations that highlight population-based screening and treatment of H pylori, as key tools to prevent gastric cancer.

According to Gisbert, H pylori is usually acquired in early childhood, but the cancer it can cause typically appears decades later, often after the age of 50 or 60 years.

“Chronic H pylori infection gradually damages the stomach lining,” he explained. “It starts with superficial gastritis, progresses to atrophic gastritis, then intestinal metaplasia, and finally dysplasia the last stage before cancer. If we treat the infection early, before these changes occur, we can prevent gastric cancer.”

Despite this risk, the incidence of gastric cancer in Spain remains relatively low, under 10 cases per 100,000 people per year. For this reason, screening asymptomatic people for H pylori is not considered necessary nationwide.

“In countries with higher gastric cancer rates, H pylori screening would be cost-effective,” Gisbert said. “But in Spain, it's not clearly justified.”

Gisbert is also a researcher at the Biomedical Research Network Centre for Liver and Digestive Diseases. He also serves as principal investigator of the European H pylori Registry, a multinational initiative tracking real-world management of the infection. He recently led a study assessing how Spanish gastroenterologists outside the registry manage H pylori infections.

The results, published in Helicobacter, revealed the following gaps in clinical practice: “17% of specialists did not test for H pylori in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding from peptic ulcers, and 35% did not start treatment at the time of diagnosis in these cases. Only 25% were aware of local clarithromycin resistance rates, and only 37% regularly assessed the effectiveness of eradication treatments. Additionally, 74% of the specialists did not confirm penicillin allergy before prescribing the treatment. Moreover, 32% did not investigate first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer,” summarized Gisbert.

“Given that gastric cancer is largely preventable, more active intervention and control programs should be implemented in these high-resource East Asian countries. This indicates that, as in human papillomavirus vaccine programs for cervical cancer prevention or hepatitis B vaccine programs to reduce the risk of liver cancer, an H pylori vaccine would greatly advance the fight against gastric cancer, given that vaccination is one of the most context-responsive prevention strategies and is highly adaptable, especially in low- and middle-income settings where we expect to see a high number of H pylori-attributable gastric cancer cases,” the authors concluded.

Gisbert reported having no conflicts of interest.

 August 01, 2025  

At the recent Congress of the French Society of Pediatrics, held in Paris, France, Alexis Mosca, MD, a paediatric gastroenterologist at Robert Debré Hospital, Paris, France, and member of the French Society of Pediatrics' gastroenterology group, said that the guidance helps clarify when probiotics should be used. He also previewed the upcoming European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) recommendations on probiotics in infant formula.

According to the ESPGHAN, only a few probiotic strains are effective in children, particularly in treating acute diarrhoea and infant colic.

Gut flora modulators, such as pre-, pro-, syn-, and postbiotics, are commonly used in paediatrics, but selecting the right one can be challenging. Experts from the ESPGHAN have reviewed the evidence on specific probiotic strains for various gastrointestinal disorders. Only strains supported by at least two randomised controlled trials for the same condition were recommended.

Probiotics are advised for selected digestive conditions in children, including acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, nosocomial diarrhoea, and necrotising enterocolitis in preterm infants.

ESPGHAN has identified a limited number of strains with proven benefits. These include Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG [ATCC 53103], Saccharomyces boulardii [CNCM I-745], Lactobacillus reuteri [DSM 17938], and a combination of L rhamnosus [19070-2] with L reuteri [DSM 12246].

To prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in both outpatient and hospitalised children, ESPGHAN recommends S boulardii [CNCM I-745] and L rhamnosus GG [ATCC 53103], ideally started alongside antibiotic therapy. For nosocomial diarrhoea, L rhamnosus GG [ATCC 53103] is also advised.

In neonates at risk of necrotising enterocolitis, positive recommendations include L rhamnosus GG [ATCC 53103] and a combination of three strains of Bifidobacterium infantis [BB-02], Bifidobacterium lactis [BB-12], and Streptococcus thermophilus [TH-4]. For Helicobacter pylori infection, S boulardii [CNCM I-745] has been suggested, although the effect is modest and evidence is limited.

For functional gastrointestinal disorders, L reuteri [DSM 17938] and B lactis [BB-12] are recommended in breastfed infants with colic, although supporting data remain limited. In cases of functional abdominal pain disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, ESPGHAN advises L reuteri [DSM 17938] and L rhamnosus GG [ATCC 53103].

However, probiotics are not recommended for inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, celiac disease, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

The French-speaking Pediatric Hepatology-Gastroenterology and Nutrition Group has published a fact sheet on the “Role of probiotics in the management of digestive disorders in children,” summarising ESPGHAN's recommendations and specifying the dosages to follow.

Experts caution that prescribing probiotics remains complex. Many commercial products fail to list essential details, such as strain designation, dosage, or potential contaminants. Clinicians are urged to the exact strain or product not just write “a probiotic.”

Although France permits the term “probiotic” in food supplements (per Directorate General for Competition Policy, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control guidance, December 2022), product quality remains a major concern. An analysis of 16 probiotic products marketed for infants revealed that only one matched the composition listed on its label. Some products lacked the advertised strains, some showed signs of contamination, and there were notable inconsistencies between batches. Similar concerns were raised in another study involving probiotics administered to premature infants.

A global study found major differences between what probiotic product labels claimed and what they contained. Out of the 30 products tested, only 57% correctly listed the species inside. The remaining 43% were not accurate: Six had more species than declared, three were missing one or more listed species, and four contained species that were not mentioned on the label.

Mosca and colleagues examined whether biotics should be routinely added to infant formula in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition.

“Unless the text changes before publication which is unlikely,” Mosca said, “We found no clear evidence to support or oppose the routine use of the probiotic strains studied.” These include B lactis [CNCM I-3446], S thermophilus, and Lactobacillus johnsonii La1. None of the tested doses showed a meaningful clinical benefit.

Certain human milk oligosaccharides, such as 2'-fucosyllactose, 3-fucosyllactose, lacto-N-tetraose, 3'-sialyllactose, and 6'-sialyllactose may soften stools when used at high doses. However, no significant clinical benefits have been demonstrated.

Synbiotic combinations, such as Bifidobacterium breve strain M-16V with a 9:1 blend of short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides, are generally well tolerated and may influence stool consistency and gut microbiota. However, current evidence does not support a consistent clinical advantage over standard infant formulas.

Prebiotics, such as galacto-oligosaccharides, fructo-oligosaccharides, oligofructose, and enriched inulin, have shown only a modest effect, typically limited to a slight increase in stool frequency or softening. Among these, only the specific galacto-oligosaccharide/fructo-oligosaccharide (9:1) mixture demonstrated a measurable effect on stool consistency.

Mosca reported having no conflicts of interest. He has participated in one-time engagements over the past 5 years with BioGaia, Calmosine, PiLeJe, Biocodex, Lacteol, Fresenius Kabi, MaaT Pharma, Danone, Nestlé, Novalac, Modilac, Mead Johnson, and Nutribio.

At similar radiation doses, ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT) achieved superior image quality using AI-enhanced iterative reconstruction than chest x-rays for assessing cystic fibrosis-related lung disease in children. About 88% of healthcare professionals reported greater confidence in diagnosing cystic fibrosis-related lung disease when using CT images rather than x-rays.

""ULDCT provides superior IQ [image quality] compared to CXR [chest x-rays] in CwCF [children with cystic fibrosis], while maintaining comparable radiation doses,"" the authors wrote. ""ULDCT also significantly improves diagnostic confidence, highlighting its potential as a viable alternative to CXR,"" they concluded.

This study was led by Niamh Moore, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland. It was published online on July 25, 2025, in European Radiology.

Chest x-rays were used as a comparator instead of conventional dose CT, and exposures were not patient specific for ethical reasons. The recruitment of observers from different research hubs having varying illumination levels affected image quality ratings. Additional limitations included the small sample size and selection bias.

This study received open access funding provided by the IReL Consortium. One author reported having a relationship with DetectED-X.

Standard doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) reduced the risk for relapse when added to clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, unlike other antidepressants, according to a new study. Sertraline, duloxetine, and escitalopram were particularly effective, and high-dose antidepressant use increased both psychiatric and somatic hospital admission risks.

""[The study] findings support the use of SSRIs and SNRIs as viable augmentation strategies for clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia, particularly at standard doses,"" the authors wrote. ""The same finding was not observed with other, non-SSRI and non-SNRI antidepressants,"" they added. ""The findings have important clinical implications, emphasising the potential utility of antidepressant augmentation in specific subgroups of patients with TRS [treatment-resistant schizophrenia], such as those with persistent negative symptoms, comorbid depression, or suicidal ideation. Given the increased risks associated with high-dose antidepressant use, clinicians should carefully balance the potential benefits with the risk of adverse outcomes,"" they concluded.

This study was led by Heidi Taipale, PhD, University of Eastern Finland, Niuvanniemi Hospital, Kuopio, Finland. It was published online in the August 2025 issue of The Lancet Psychiatry.

This study was limited by its observational design, the lack of randomisation, and the low number of users for some exposures. This study lacked information on why antidepressants were started or stopped, symptom severity fluctuations, social support or non-pharmacologic interventions, and confirmation of treatment resistance. Additionally, dose categorisation on the basis of DDDs was not optimal for some drugs. Schizophrenia relapse was broadly defined as hospital admission with psychotic disorder without symptom specificity, and major depressive disorder was rarely recorded. Furthermore, the findings were limited to long-term risks in low-cost healthcare settings, and people with lived experience were not involved.

This study received funding from the Sigrid Jusélius Foundation and the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. This project used data from the REWHARD consortium supported by the Swedish Research Council. Several authors reported having financial ties with various sources including pharmaceutical companies.

Patients with breast cancer who undergo chemotherapy may face an increased risk for brain atrophy and cognitive decline, new findings from a pilot study suggested.

Memory problems in patients with cancer may not stem solely from stress or anxiety related to their diagnosis but could reflect underlying changes in brain structure, study investigator Paul Edison, PhD, MPhil, professor of neuroscience and clinical professor of neurology at Imperial College London, London, England, told Medscape Medical News.

While the findings suggest that chemotherapy may contribute to neuronal damage, the researchers noted that many aspects of the relationship between treatment and brain changes remain unclear.

Edison highlighted three key areas that require further investigation — uncovering the mechanisms driving brain atrophy, determining the proportion of patients affected, and identifying effective prevention strategies.

Another investigator on the study, Laura Kenny, MD, PhD, associate professor and consultant medical oncologist at Imperial College London, noted that the issue has received limited attention to date but expressed hope that the findings will raise awareness and encourage further research, given its clinical importance.

The findings were presented on July 29 at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) 2025.

Advances in chemotherapeutic agents have improved survival rates in patients with cancer. However, challenges persist regarding the long-term impact of these drugs.

Chemotherapy-associated cognitive impairment, often referred to as “brain fog” or “chemobrain,” affects approximately one third of patients with breast cancer following treatment.

While cognitive decline resolves within 12 months for some patients, others experience persistent effects that may elevate the risk for neurodegenerative conditions, Edison explained.

To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy on the brain, investigators studied 328 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer who had undergone chemotherapy within the past 12 months.

Patients received either anthracycline — a drug derived from the Streptomyces peucetius bacterium — or taxanes such as docetaxel and paclitaxel, both commonly used in breast cancer treatment, or a combination of these agents. In addition, some patients may also have had hormone therapy at some point during treatment, said Kenny.

Participants completed neurocognitive prescreening tests every 3 months using a specialized artificial intelligence-driven platform, allowing them to take detailed memory assessments online from home.

Among those prescreened, 18 individuals with lower neurocognitive scores (mean age, approximately 55 years) and 19 cognitively normal control individuals without breast cancer (mean age, approximately 67 years) underwent comprehensive, in-person, neurocognitive evaluations and MRI scans.

Researchers analyzed the scans using region of interest (ROI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM), which uses sophisticated computer software, to assess grey matter volumes and surface areas.

The ROI analysis revealed significant reductions in gray matter volume (measured in mm3) and surface area (measured in mm2) among patients experiencing chemobrain, particularly affecting the isthmus cingulate and pars opercularis, with changes extending into the orbitofrontal and temporal regions.

The VBM analysis confirmed significant atrophy in the frontal, parietal, and cingulate regions of patients with chemobrain compared with control individuals (P < .05). Edison noted that this pattern overlaps with brain changes typically observed in Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive impairment.

For both analyses, “we demonstrated there is some amount of shrinkage in the brain among patients with chemobrain.” he said. “The fact that controls are older means the results are even more significant as there's more brain atrophy as people age.”

Some of the affected brain regions may be linked to impaired memory, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, but Edison cautioned that given the small sample size this finding should be interpreted with caution.

While the analysis demonstrated overall lower brain volumes in patients with “chemobrain” compared with controls, Edison emphasized that this finding reflects a single time point and does not indicate brain shrinkage over time.

Other events, including stroke — can also cause brain changes.

Edison highlighted the importance of determining the significance of these brain changes, how they affect patients and whether they can be prevented.

In-person neurocognitive testing revealed significantly reduced semantic and verbal fluency, as well as lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores in patients with chemobrain. Edison noted that these results support the MRI findings.

The team plans to follow patients to track brain changes and memory recovery, Kenny said. While patients with breast cancer are a common focus, the researchers intend to expand the study to other cancers in both men and women, said Kenny. Anecdotally, many patients report memory problems during chemotherapy, she added.

Based on discussions with her oncology colleagues, Kenny noted that many patients anecdotally report experiencing memory problems during chemotherapy.

Commenting for Medscape Medical News, Rebecca M. Edelmayer, PhD, vice president, Scientific Engagement, at the Alzheimer's Association, said the research may help shed light on why women are more likely to develop dementia than men.

For years now, experts have been trying to figure out what puts women at higher risk for AD and other dementias, said Edelmayer.

“We still don't understand whether this involves biologically driven risk factors or socially driven risk factors.”

Research linking treatments for other health conditions to increased memory problems may offer some clues, she noted, suggesting a potential avenue for further investigation into the intersection of chemotherapy and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

However, Edelmayer emphasized that this line of research is still in its infancy. Much more work is needed to determine whether there is a direct cause-and-effect relationship with specific chemotherapy drugs, and whether some patients may already be predisposed or at higher risk for cognitive decline, she said.

Also commenting for Medscape Medical News, Eric Brown, MD, associate scientist and associate chief of geriatric psychiatry at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, raised concerns about the study's design.

One issue, he noted, is that the researchers did not image all patients who received chemotherapy but instead selected those with the most significant cognitive impairment. As a result, the findings may not have reflected outcomes in the average post-chemotherapy patients but rather represent the most severely affected subgroup.

Brown also pointed out that the study did not clarify whether this subgroup had comorbid conditions. It's possible, he said, that some individuals may have had Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia unrelated to chemotherapy.

He agreed that tracking longitudinal changes in both cognitive scores and neuroimaging — comparing patients who receive chemotherapy with those who do not — would be a valuable next step.

The investigators, Edelmayer and Brown, reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

Heavy drinking increases pregnancy risk by 51% among those most wanting to avoid conception. Cannabis use shows similar elevated desire to avoid pregnancy but does not significantly impact pregnancy outcomes.

“Alcohol use among nonpregnant women of reproductive age is common, legal, and accepted in the United States. Most people reduce alcohol use when they become pregnant, but fewer modify drinking before becoming pregnant even if they intend to become pregnant. It can be difficult to implement and sustain behavior

changes in advance of a potential pregnancy, particularly given that many pregnancies are not explicitly planned. In contrast, cannabis and other drug use, especially during pregnancy, have historically been more stigmatized and punished through the criminal justice and child welfare systems, in part because of the legal status of the substances and the war on drugs in the United States,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Sarah Raifman, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health, Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine in Oakland, California. It was published online in Addiction.

According to the authors, substance use was only measured at baseline, preventing analysis of fluctuations over time or substance use at conception. Additionally, potential underreporting of alcohol and drug use may have occurred, though the nonpregnant status at baseline reduced differential reporting bias by pregnancy preferences or status. The results may not be generalizable beyond women seeking primary and reproductive healthcare in safety net clinics in the southwestern United States.

This study received funding from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation. The funding entities had no role in the study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, report writing, or publication submission decisions.

Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally. Ischemic stroke, strongly linked to atherosclerotic plaques, requires accurate plaque and vessel wall segmentation and quantification for definitive diagnosis. However, conventional manual segmentation remains time-consuming and operator-dependent, whereas current computer-aided tools fall short in achieving the accuracy required for clinical applications. These technological bottlenecks severely hamper precise diagnosis and treatment of ischemic stroke.

In a study published in European Radiology, a research team led by Dr. Zhang Na from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT) of Chinese Academy of Sciences, along with collaborators, has developed a fully learnable parameter based multi-task segmentation model and a structure-guided, two-stage small-target segmentation method based on high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) vessel wall imaging. This approach enables automated and accurate segmentation and quantitative analysis of carotid arterial vessel lumens, vessel walls, and plaques, offering a reliable AI-assisted diagnostic tool for clinical risk assessment of ischemic stroke.

In this study, the proposed method consists of two key steps. The first step involves constructing a purely learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN), named Vessel-SegNet, to segment the lumen and vessel wall. The second step leverages vessel wall priors-specifically, manual priors and Tversky-loss-based automatic priors-to improve plaque segmentation by utilizing the morphological similarity between the vessel wall and atherosclerotic plaque.

This study included data from 193 patients with atherosclerotic plaque across five centers, all of whom underwent T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. The dataset was divided into three subsets: 107 patients for training and validation, 39 for internal testing, and 47 for external testing.

Experimental results demonstrated that most Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) for lumen and vessel wall segmentation exceeded 90%. The incorporation of vessel wall priors improved the DSC for plaque segmentation by over 10%, achieving 88.45%. Furthermore, compared to Dice-loss-based priors, Tversky-loss-based priors further enhanced the DSC by nearly 3%, reaching 82.84%.

In contrast to manual methods, the proposed technique provides accurate, automated plaque segmentation and completes quantitative plaque characteristic assessment for a single patient in under 3 seconds.

The goal of our research is to leverage AI models to produce accurate, reproducible, and clinically relevant quantitative outcomes, which can assist healthcare professionals in stroke diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making.""

Researchers from RMIT University have developed a wearable wound monitoring device with integrated sensors that could reduce infection risks by minimising the need for frequent physical contact.

Standard methods require regular removal of wound dressings for assessments, often delaying crucial interventions, whereas this invention monitors healing remotely via a Bluetooth connection.

The proof-of-concept device is designed for reuse, making it more cost-effective and practical than disposable smart bandages and other emerging wound monitoring technologies. 

Globally, millions of people suffer from chronic wounds, impacting their quality of life and incurring significant healthcare costs. In Australia, about 500,000 people are affected, costing the healthcare system $3 billion annually.

Lead inventor Dr Peter Francis Mathew Elango said the device used advanced integrated sensor technology – including inflammation, pH and temperature sensors – to continuously track key healing indicators. High temperatures signal inflammation or infection, while changes in pH levels can indicate different stages of wound healing.

We tested our wound monitoring device by simulating conditions it would encounter in wound management. We placed the device on a human arm to demonstrate that it conforms well to the curved surface.""

Dr. Peter Francis Mathew Elango, Study Lead Investigator and Research Fellow, RMIT University

""This was a test to show that this type of alternative monitoring technology is possible, and we are now ready to work with industry partners to develop it for clinical trials.

""Its components are biocompatible and fit seamlessly into existing manufacturing workflows and processes, potentially bringing the cost below $5 per unit when produced at scale.""

An RMIT-patented technology platform underpins this innovation, with flexible sensors that can be placed on or next to a wound under dressings.

""The high-resistivity silicon-based sensor technology is our platform IP that has been proven to be efficient at multiple biomarker detection related to different ailments,"" said team leader Professor Madhu Bhaskaran.

Bhaskaran's Functional Materials and Microsystems Research Group at RMIT has a strong track record developing med-tech devices, including bedding sensors for use in aged care to monitor sleep quality and comfort. Meanwhile, earlier work led by Elango on a wearable heart monitor is now progressing towards commercialisation through a partnership with Perth-based Lubdub Technologies.

New research shows that exercise-based cardiac rehab offers real benefits for people with atrial fibrillation, reducing the risk of recurrence and improving mental well-being, highlighting the need for wider adoption of these programs.

Study: Exercise based cardiac rehabilitation for atrial fibrillation: Cochrane systematic review, meta-analysis, meta-regression and trial sequential analysis. Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers examined the impact of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (ExCR) for atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.

AF is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with an estimated six to 12 million people projected to develop AF in the US by 2050 and 17.9 million in Europe by 2060. It is also a major risk factor for ischemic stroke, constituting a significant economic burden. Although current treatments can effectively control symptoms and stroke risk in AF, self-management interventions could be key to managing arrhythmia progression and maintaining health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and functional capacity.

ExCR is a comprehensive intervention involving exercise training, personalized lifestyle risk factor management, medical risk management, health behavior education, and psychosocial intervention. Current AF management guidelines do not recommend ExCR as the benefits of exercise for individuals with AF remain unclear. Previously, the authors reported improvements in functional capacity with ExCR in AF patients, but the impact of ExCR on clinical events was uncertain.

Patients saw measurable drops in AF burden – exercise programs reduced symptom severity scores by 1.61 points and episode frequency by 0.57 events on standardized scales, with consistent benefits across AF subtypes.

In the present Cochrane study, researchers systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the impact of ExCR for AF patients. Electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science Core Collection, LILACS) and trial registers were searched for relevant RCTs from inception to March 2024.

Eligible studies included adults with AF, exercise-based interventions (including center-based, hybrid, or home-based programs like yoga or Qigong), a control arm, and the following outcomes: mortality, serious adverse events, AF recurrence, AF symptom severity, AF burden, HRQoL, and exercise capacity. Exercise-based intervention was any outpatient, inpatient, home-based, or community rehabilitation program that must include an exercise component and may also include a psycho-educational component.

A control arm may include no intervention, usual treatment, or another cardiac rehabilitation program without exercise. Data were extracted from trials, and the risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane's risk of bias-1 tool. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using the standardized mean difference. GRADE and RTSA were used to evaluate evidence certainty and required sample sizes.

The database search identified 6,063 records. Of these, 4,538 unique studies were screened, resulting in the full-text analysis of 51 studies. This review included 20 RCTs conducted from 2006 to 2024, encompassing 2,039 individuals with AF with a mean follow-up of 11 months. Notably, 73% of participants were male, limiting generalizability to women. Most RCTs were conducted in Europe (10), followed by Asia (four), and Australia (two). Follow-up duration lasted from eight weeks to five years.

Exercise capacity improvements were clinically significant – the 3.18 mL/kg/min increase in VO₂ peak surpassed the 1 mL/kg/min threshold known to enhance patient function and prognosis.

Six RCTs included participants with permanent AF, four included those with paroxysmal AF, and nine included those with persistent or sustained AF. The mean age of participants was 63. Five RCTs assessed comprehensive ExCR, while other trials assessed exercise-only cardiac rehabilitation. All trials included a ""no formal exercise training"" control arm, involving education, usual medical care, and psychological intervention.

The exercise interventions differed in frequency, duration, intensity, and session length. The risk of bias was mixed for the trials. All-cause mortality was reported in nine trials. No difference was observed in mortality between ExCR and controls, though evidence certainty was low. Ten RCTs reported serious adverse events, and there was no difference between ExCR and controls with very low certainty evidence. AF recurrence was reported in four trials; there was moderate-certainty evidence of a benefit of ExCR compared to controls.

AF symptom severity was reported in five trials and showed benefits from ExCR compared to controls with low certainty. Likewise, AF burden showed benefits with ExCR versus controls with moderate certainty. Fourteen RCTs included a validated HRQoL measure. The short-form 36 (SF-36) mental component demonstrated benefit with ExCR compared to controls with moderate certainty, while the physical component showed no significant improvement (very low certainty). Exercise capacity was reported as maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) and the six-minute walk test. ExCR showed a clinically meaningful benefit on VO2 peak compared to controls (mean improvement 3.18 mL/kg/min, exceeding the 1 mL/kg/min threshold for clinical significance).

The authors note a U-shaped relationship between exercise and AF risk, where excessive endurance exercise may increase AF prevalence in athletes, though this subgroup is unlikely to attend ExCR. GRADE and RTSA assessments indicated low-to-moderate certainty for most outcomes, underscoring the need for larger trials. Based on these findings, they suggest clinical guidelines should incorporate ExCR alongside standard AF therapies.

In sum, ExCR resulted in lower disease burden, recurrence, and severity, and improved exercise capacity and HRQoL mental components in individuals with AF. The effects of ExCR were consistent across RCTs, regardless of participant characteristics, nature of intervention, and AF subtype. The study's limitations include clinical heterogeneity, predominant male representation, publication bias for exercise capacity measures, and reporting bias (due to self-reported outcomes). Future research should prioritize representative recruitment of women and diverse ethnic groups.

Aging and neurodegeneration are both known to disrupt the production of functional proteins in cells – a process called ""proteostasis,"" or protein homeostasis. Brain cells in particular fall prey to proteostasis disruptions, which are linked to the accumulation of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases. In a new study published July 30 in Science, Stanford researchers have discovered the cascade of events that leads to declining proteostasis in aging brains.

The findings, based on study of the turquoise killifish, lay the foundation for developing therapies that can combat and prevent neurodegenerative diseases in people – and the gradual decline in mental abilities we will all face one day. 

We know that many processes become more dysfunctional with aging, but we really don't understand the fundamental molecular principles of why we age. Our new study begins to provide a mechanistic explanation for a phenomenon widely seen during aging, which is increased aggregation and dysfunction in the processes that make proteins."" 

Judith Frydman, study author, the Donald Kennedy Chair in the School of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford

The turquoise killifish, Nothobranchius furzeri, is a vibrantly colorful fish that adapted to thrive in the ephemeral freshwater pools of the African savanna. Killifish, the shortest-lived vertebrates bred in captivity, develop many issues as they grow old and provide a great model of accelerated aging. Studying why and how the brain ages would be harder in longer-lived animals, such as mice.

To make their new discovery, the researchers conducted a comprehensive investigation of proteostasis in the brains of aging killifish. The scientists compared young, adult, and old killifish. They looked at various players in protein production, such as amino acid concentrations, levels of transfer RNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), proteins, and more. 

In cells, proteostasis balances protein synthesis and degradation and also prevents protein aggregation – harmful clumps of proteins that can result from errors in protein folding. Proteostasis dysfunction and aggregation are part of a series of molecular and cellular changes classified as aging hallmarks. Proteostasis has received attention as a likely link between brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases tied to protein aggregation, like Alzheimer's.

Frydman's lab explores how cells achieve proteostasis and has previously focused on how aging affects proteostasis in the simple models of aging provided by yeast and roundworms. The new study confirms that aging processes observed in those simple organisms reflect those in more complex vertebrates like killifish – and humans. 

""With aging, problems mysteriously emerge at many levels – at the mechanistic, cellular, and organ level – but one commonality is that all those processes are mediated by proteins,"" Frydman said. ""This study confirms that during aging, the central machinery that makes proteins starts to have quality problems."" 

Ultimately, the team located the disruption at a specific stage of protein synthesis called translation elongation. In this step, the ribosome enacts its role as the cellular machinery responsible for converting mRNA into proteins by moving along the mRNA and adding amino acids one by one. In the aging fish brains, the researchers documented ribosomes colliding and stalling, which both resulted in reduced levels of proteins and protein aggregation. 

""Our results show that changes in the speed of ribosome movement along the mRNA can have a profound impact on protein homeostasis – and highlight the essential nature of 'regulated' translation elongation speed of different mRNAs in the context of aging,"" said Jae Ho Lee, co-lead author of the paper who worked on this as a postdoctoral scholar in the Frydman lab. He is now an assistant professor at Stony Brook University. 

The finding helped to illuminate another aging mystery. One of the hallmarks of aging in all organisms, including humans, is called ""protein-transcript decoupling."" In this phenomenon, changes in levels of some mRNA no longer correlate to changes in protein levels in aged individuals. The new study shows that changes in protein synthesis during aging, including ribosomes, can explain the ""protein-transcript decoupling."" Since many of the affected proteins are involved in genome maintenance and integrity, these new observations rationalize why these processes decline during aging.

""Showing that the process of protein production loses fidelity with aging provides a kind of underlying rationale for why all these other processes start to malfunction with age,"" said Frydman. ""And, of course, the key to solving a problem is to understand why it's gone wrong. Otherwise, you're just fumbling in the dark."" 

As a next step, the researchers will explore directly how ribosome dysfunction – which they identified as a key culprit of declining proteostasis – may contribute to age-related neurodegenerative disorders in people. They also want to know whether targeting translation efficiency or ribosome quality control in treatments can restore proteostasis in brain cells and even delay aging-related cognitive decline. 

""This work provides new insights on protein biogenesis, function, and homeostasis in general, as well as a new potential target for intervention for aging-associated diseases,"" said Lee. 

Additionally, the research team is probing what leads to cognitive decline as we age and how modulating such processes may shape longevity in a range of different species.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","MRI brain scans help identify effective use of self-guided anxiety app","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250731/MRI-brain-scans-help-identify-effective-use-of-self-guided-anxiety-app.aspx","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 00:16:00 GMT","

By understanding differences in how people's brains are wired, clinicians may be able to predict who would benefit from a self-guided anxiety care app, according to a new analysis from a clinical trial led by Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian investigators. The preliminary study suggested that young people with weaker connections between two brain areas involved in both attending to and regulating responses to anxiety were more likely to benefit from a self-guided anxiety care app than those with stronger connections.

The study, published July 31 in JAMA Network Open, looked at data from a subset of clinical trial participants who agreed to undergo a brain MRI before using the anxiety care app developed by the investigators. The app, called Maya, is essentially a course in cognitive behavioral therapy, a gold standard psychotherapeutic intervention that provides users with skills to support them in shifting their thinking, completing challenging behaviors and learning new ways to cope. The interactive platform guides young adults with anxiety through videos, exercises and educational content.

Initial results of the clinical trial with 59 participants showed that using the app reduced anxiety symptoms for many patients; now the new analysis may help identify which patients benefit most.

People with weaker connections in key brain networks involved in anxiety and regulating emotions were more likely to see improved anxiety symptoms with the use of the app. That makes sense because cognitive behavioral therapy helps teach people how to regulate their responses to emotions.""

Dr. Faith Gunning, senior author, associate professor of psychology and vice chair for research in the Department of Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine

Dr. Gunning and her colleagues developed the Maya app to help fill critical gaps in access to care for young adults with anxiety. Young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 are at a stage in life where they are experiencing many life changes, and studies have shown they are at fairly high risk for anxiety disorders. During this time, they may also have gaps in health care coverage or may have difficulties accessing or affording in-person mental health care. Some may also be hesitant to seek in-person care because of stigma surrounding mental health or because of their anxiety symptoms.

For the clinical trial, 59 young adults with anxiety used the app twice a week for six weeks. Investigators tracked participants' symptoms during that time and for an additional six weeks. Those who used the app experienced reduced anxiety symptoms throughout the 12-week monitoring period. Some continued to use the app after the initial 6-week trial period, and others experienced lasting improvements in symptoms even after discontinuing use of the app after 6 weeks.

The investigators were able to use data from 30 participants who had MRIs before using the Maya app to determine if specific patterns of brain activity indicated individuals who were more likely to experience symptom improvements.

The results suggest that young adults experiencing anxiety whose brains were less efficient at regulating their responses to anxiety-provoking information benefited more from learning cognitive behavioral therapy techniques through the app. In contrast, those with stronger connections in circuits involved with greater attention to potentially threatening or anxiety provoking information were less likely to benefit from using the app.

""App-based interventions like Maya are poised to address a critical barrier to care for people with anxiety, but like any mental health treatment, some people will benefit more than others,"" said first author Dr. Abhishek Jaywant, assistant professor of neuropsychology in the Department of Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine and a psychologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. ""Our study is among the first to suggest that patterns of brain function are relevant in helping researchers and clinicians understand response to app-based treatments for anxiety. These findings could one day help us to recommend an app like Maya to patients most likely to benefit.""

""Our study will help us better tailor treatments to patients in the future,"" said Dr. Gunning, who is also a psychologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. ""Anxiety symptoms can be very disabling to young adults at an important life stage, so matching them with an effective therapy as soon as possible is important.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New radioimmunotherapy approach eliminates cancer stem cells in preclinical models of ovarian cancer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250801/New-radioimmunotherapy-approach-eliminates-cancer-stem-cells-in-preclinical-models-of-ovarian-cancer.aspx","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 16:19:00 GMT","

A new radioimmunotherapy approach has been shown to successfully eliminate cancer stem cells (CSCs) in preclinical models of ovarian cancer, outperforming the current gold standard. This research, published in the July issue of The Journal of Nuclear Medicine, lays the foundation for further development of radionuclide therapies targeting CSCs, offering renewed hope for more effective treatment options and improved outcomes for patients.

CSCs are highly tumorigenic, self-renewable cells that play a key role in tumor relapse, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Although the clinical significance of eliminating CSCs is clearly recognized and CSC immunotherapies have been examined in preclinical and clinical evaluations, the development of such therapies remains a challenge. 

Radioimmunotherapy enables precise, target-specific delivery of particulate radiation to cancer-associated antigens, while minimizing off-target accumulation and increasing tumor retention and irradiation, which makes it a promising choice for targeting CSCs. Our study sought to investigate the effectiveness of a new radionuclide Terbium-161 (161Tb) for eradicating CSCs due to emission of short-ranged conversion and Auger electrons-besides beta-minus particle-successfully eliminated ovarian CSCs in contrast to Lutetium-177 (177Lu).""

Jürgen Grünberg, PhD, senior scientist at the Center for Radiopharmaceutical Sciences, Center for Life Sciences at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland

Researchers identified CSC-associated biomarkers (L1CAM+/CD133+) in an ovarian cancer sample and then created radiolabeled immunoconjugates with 177Lu or 161Tb to target these CSCs. The cytotoxicity of the radioimmunoconjugates (177Lu-DOTA-chCE7 and 161Tb-DOTA-chCE7) was measured by cell proliferation assays in vitro and in xenografted mouse models in vivo.

161Tb-DOTA-chCE7 showed significantly increased cytotoxicity, compared with 177Lu-DOTA-chCE7, eliminating all ovarian CSCs and tumor cells differentiated from the CSCs in vivo.

""This signifies a pivotal step toward the translation of 161Tb-based therapies into clinical application,"" noted Tihomir Todorov, PhD, junior scientist at the Center for Radiopharmaceutical Sciences, Center for Life Sciences at the Paul Scherrer Institute. ""Targeted radionuclide therapies with 161Tb could support personalized medicine leading to advancements in cancer care including eradication of resistant CSCs and increased therapeutic efficacy alongside improved diagnosis, detection, and treatment monitoring.""

Arfsten hails Pochettino's impact

Discussed challenges of U.S. soccer development

Admits his aim is land in Europe

AUSTIN, Texas - The U.S. men's national team's run to the Gold Cup final was a meaningful moment for a relatively young squad that featured 15 players from MLS. Although the team would ultimately lose 2-1 to Mexico, it was a strong bounce back after lackluster showings against Turkey and Switzerland in June friendlies.

According to Max Arfsten, who played in five matches during the tournament and had three assists and one goal, the turnaround wasn't coincidental - and full credit to coach Mauricio Pochettino.

""First two friendlies we played, obviously, the results [weren't good], we lost both of those games,"" Arfsten said at MLS All-Star Media Day. ""And, you know, he could have kind of blamed us for that, because we're the ones playing. But he took, you know, the ownership and, like, kind of took it on himself with the media and stuff. So that kind of showed me he cares about us.

""It's not easy for someone to do that, especially when you're not playing - to take the blame to protect us, in a way. So I think that was a huge gesture that we all noticed. Like, OK, this guy, he wants us to, you know, be positive. Just have good vibes in the camp. And that's what he did.""

Pochettino was under heavy criticism following those two friendlies, but following his team's run to the Gold Cup final, there was optimism, considering how the team performed without several stars such as Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Weston McKennie. Arfsten has been in both the U.S.'s January camp and the Gold Cup and believes the Argentine's approach throughout was a significant catalyst.

""He's a really good guy, super friendly with the players, like, super emotional and, like, you can tell he cares about the players a lot,"" Arfsten said of Pochettino. ""It kind of goes without saying. Really good coach, as well. He's coached at very high levels... Really good experience for me to just be able to be coached by someone who has coached at such a high level before.""

Arfsten also reflected on his own experience at the Gold Cup, making strides in development.

""I just got mentally stronger. To be honest with you, I was put in like uncomfortable situations, like playing with players you're not really used to,"" he said. ""So going through all that, I think just made me mentally stronger. And then, you know, obviously I just gained a lot of good experience, like playing in big games and starting a lot and just kind of getting that experience.""

Another benefit of playing in the Gold Cup for Arfsten was seeing his stock rise. The wingback was linked with a move to Ligue 1, as the Columbus Crew reportedly rejected a bid for Toulouse, according to GiveMeSport. Arfsten acknowledged his goal is ultimately to land in Europe.

""Yeah, right now, obviously, it is a dream for myself, and I think any player to play in Europe at the highest level,"" Arfsten said. ""But you know, for now, I'm just focused on what's in front of me, and just staying here as a moment, doing what I can to just be the best player I can be.""

The Columbus wingback is set to play in the MLS All-Star game Wednesday at the Q2 Stadium.","{'href': 'https://au.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo.co'}","soccer"

Juventus general manager Damien Comolli has forcefully responded to the allegations made by Tim Weah's agent regarding his proposed move to Marseille, defending the Serie A club and shifting the blame onto the U.S. men's national team forward.

Weah's representative Badou Sambague went public with his disdain for Juventus earlier this week, accusing the Turin outfit of showing “total disrespect”. The USMNT international did not join up with Mauricio Pochettino's Gold Cup roster so that he could be available for Juve during this summer's Club World Cup. He featured for just 45 minutes.

Sambague claimed that an unnamed member of Juve's hierarchy deliberately “botched” Weah's tournament and “tried to force him to go where he wanted”. “Today,” Sambague continued, “as revenge, he's demanding a fortune and waiting for a Premier League offer that won't come and will never be approved by us.”

Comolli was keen to quash those accusations. “We deserve respect, we give respect to everyone,” the club chief seethed to Sky Italia. “The players are being looked after, no one is being pushed aside.”

Weah is thought to be pushing for a move to Marseille, yet Comolli questioned whether such a deal is even possible.

“When you come out strongly and say I want to join one club, and only one club, you need to make sure that club backs you up,” he warned. “If that club doesn't back you up, what do you do? You are in a corner and have nowhere else to go.

“You said very loud that you only want to go to Marseille, but what happens if Marseille is not there for you?”

“The player wants to go to Marseille, but in soccer you can't choose a team because if the right offer doesn't arrive, you stay on the sidelines,” Comolli added. “And the offer hasn't arrived yet.”

Weah was linked with a move to Nottingham Forest in the Premier League earlier this summer, with an agreement for the forward and his teammate Samuel Mbangula worth around $25.6 million thought to have been struck in June. Those negotiations ultimately fell through and Weah remains floating in transfer limbo.

Just when everyone else was looking the other way, West Ham have launched a surprise move for a goalkeeper nobody was talking about—according to Fabrizio Romano.

The well-known football insider revealed within the past hour that the Hammers have made an official offer for a keeper—but it's not one of the two names dominating recent headlines.

While Leicester City's Mads Hermansen and Japanese stopper Zion Suzuki have soaked up most of the attention, West Ham have reportedly submitted a bid for Brazilian goalkeeper John Victor instead. The 29-year-old, who currently plays for Botafogo, featured in the recent Club World Cup and is also said to be on the radar of Everton and Galatasaray. Manchester United have previously been linked to the player as well.

West Ham have publicly denied making a formal offer for Hermansen, and until an hour ago, Suzuki was thought to be Graham Potter's top goalkeeping target.

Romano broke the news on his X account, posting:
“West Ham submit formal bid worth €8m for Brazilian GK John Victor from Botafogo. Galatasaray and Everton also keen on John Victor after Man United monitored him in the recent months.”

It's an unexpected move from the Irons— who had revealed their goalkeeper search was set to kick into action this week.

Yep, smoke and mirrors. 1 inbound player and 2 weeks to kick off.

Sullivan back at the helm

Hermansen £21 m…..Victor £8 m….Errr ok….Just to sweeten the pill…The foxes fans are not too bothered about losing the dane..Check out some of their fan sites….So even tho Victor is a lot cheaper and we swerve the dane…Perhaps we have dodged a bullet?…..Love transfer windows…..When is Wilson gonna be unveiled?….Will he be wearing an Antonio mask?…..Nothing to see here …Move along….

The latest ‘Sully special'. Extremely cheap and too old.

In 15 days the season starts and we are 1-2 central midfielders, a striker that fits Potter's profile and a goalkeeper short. We definitely cannot look to let Pacqueta go or letting anyone else leave without a ready made replacement. Not exactly the greatest preparation for the new season especially after the one we've just had

2nd division standard    lower league

All to do with the price nothing else

I'm guessing one of the main attractions is that he's alot cheaper than the Dane.

What happens after this kind of rumour comes up so far in this window? Nothing.
Seems like flooding the media with vague links and rumours is all there is.
Distracts us fans from the facts that nothing is actually happening.
When we have been serious like with Pelligrini and Steiden it was a link and then progress until completion. Now nothing, it's all smokescreen it seems.
One transfer, one free so far.

A judge from the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has declined Real Madrid's request to delay their start to the 2025–26 La Liga season.

Madrid argued they had been denied the “minimum period of rest and preparation” after being booked to start the new season just 41 days after their Club World Cup campaign came to a close, with club officials insisting they were entitled to at least another 24 hours of preparation before their opening fixture against Osasuna, currently scheduled for Aug. 19.

RFEF judge José Alberto Peláez did not entertain Madrid's pleas and has rejected their request to delay the Osasuna game.

Peláez ruled that the Madrid squad have received the minimum period of 21 uninterrupted days of rest and argued that suggestions of another 21 days needed for physical preparations for the new season are not part of the regulations.

Madrid have 48 hours to lodge an appeal and, according to Mundo Deportivo, they will do exactly that.

The ruling insisted the Madrid squad is big enough to deal with any hectic periods of fixtures and, given the Club World Cup was scheduled well in advance, Los Blancos could have taken more steps to prepare for the new season if they truly felt they were necessary.

“I believe that they will have 20 days to rest instead of 21 and no other leagues like the Premier League for Chelsea or the French Ligue 1 for PSG are changing the games,” La Liga president Javier Tebas said of the controversy earlier this summer.

“So I don't believe that we should change the calendar for that reason, especially thinking that it's a matter of one day.”

Osasuna have shown far more sympathy. The club's long-serving goalkeeper Sergio Herrera told El Larguero: “The club and the players were willing to help Real Madrid, and it wasn't a problem to lend a hand to our teammates because there might not be enough time for rest and preparation for the match.”

“From my point of view, I think it's detrimental to Real Madrid and also to us because we don't have the same recovery time as Valencia for the next match at El Sadar,” Herrera continued. “Anyone with a bit of common sense would understand that time isn't enough for Real Madrid to reach 100%.”

On a recent episode of the Managing Madrid Podcast, a live Q&A on YouTube where Kiyan Sobhani answered questions coming in from fans in the live chat, Kiyan was asked whether or not the Club World Cup was beneficial for Real Madrid or not.

How does this summer compared to a standard pre-season, where Real Madrid play pre-season games around this time? Was it better this way, or the more traditional way?

Here are Kiyan's thoughts on the matter:

...

The Premier League will not reduce in size from 20 to 18 clubs, says chief executive Richard Masters, amid tensions with world governing body Fifa over the congested international calendar.

The top-flight season begins on 15 August, kicking off 11 months of competitive action which will end in the US for the World Cup final on 19 July.

The season starts three weeks after Chelsea beat Paris St-Germain to win the Club World Cup - and two weeks after the final round of Summer Series matches.

Manchester City midfielder Rodri suggested last year that players are close to going on strike because of the increase in games.

Germany's Bundesliga and France's Ligue 1 were reduced from 20 to 18 teams for the 2023-24 season.

But Masters told BBC Sport: ""I don't think we should be forced into that decision.

""I am all for the growth of the game and the exciting competitions our clubs can participate in - but not at the expense of domestic football.""

Fifa and players' union Fifpro have long been in dispute over player burnout.

Masters sides with the union in claiming Fifa has not consulted the game properly, on the implementation of the expanded 32-team Club World Cup or next summer's World Cup, which will be the first to include 48 countries.

This is not the only reason the calendar is squeezed - Uefa's expansion of all three club competitions last season was the main reason FA Cup replays had to be scrapped and the Carabao Cup third round now has to be played across two midweeks in September.

But Masters said the major leagues at least had an input into the decision-making process.

""The jury is out about the competitiveness of the format and the scheduling and the underlying economics, but it is not my job to assess the success or otherwise of the Club World Cup,"" Masters said.

""It is my job to assess whether these new competitions have an impact on the domestic calendar and domestic competitions, of which the Premier League is one.

""Since 1994 the Premier League has been 380 matches, 20 clubs. We haven't changed shape at all.

""Now we are now starting to redesign our domestic calendar at the altar of European and global expansion.

""We are asking the players to play in more matches. There has to be, at the top of the game, a proper dialogue between Fifa and all the stakeholders about how these things go forward.

""That has been sadly missing.""

While Masters is correct in stating the Premier League has remained the same since it reduced its numbers from 22 to 20 for the 1994-95 campaign, it has been guilty in the past of forcing clubs into a schedule they do not want.

The latest issue has centred upon Chelsea and City, who both wanted a delayed start to the new campaign given their summer exertions.

This was rejected, meaning Chelsea will meet Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge exactly five weeks after beating PSG at MetLife Stadium.

""It is the butterfly impact of decisions taken beyond our influence by other footballing bodies that directly impact on domestic leagues,"" said Masters.

""When you finish a tournament in mid-July and have to provide the players with three weeks' break, there is only a week to go before the start of the season.

""It doesn't add up. It puts us in unnecessary conflict with our own clubs. It's not just those involved in the Club World Cup. It is the clubs they are playing and we have to be fair to everyone.""

Masters said he does not recognise suggestions that there is widespread disquiet within the Premier League about central funding being used on the Summer Series.

League officials have spoken of the wider commercial benefit of bringing the tournament to the US for the second time in three years, especially with broadcasting giant NBC now one of its most significant partners.

Rather than scrap the biennial tournament - which began in 2003 as the Asia Trophy and has had 25 different clubs enter - Masters is confident it will happen again in 2027.

""I am sure we will be back,"" he said. ""We can't announce it yet because we haven't organised it, and we need to get the clubs onside, but it is part of our growth agenda and very popular.""

The 'growth agenda' should not be underestimated.

At the Summer Series event two years ago Masters told BBC Sport he was ""not too concerned"" about the threat posed by the Saudi Pro League.

Since then, recruitment within the league has become more strategic but, more importantly, Fifa has awarded the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia, meaning investment in football in the country is likely to grow.

This comes as some argue the Premier League is becoming more predictable, with the last six promoted clubs immediately getting relegated and the biggest clubs becoming more aggressive in their recruitment.

""I am not oblivious to the fact the Premier League exists in a highly competitive environment,"" Masters said.

""We always keep an eye on what is going on and clearly the Saudi Pro League is developing and moving forward. But so is the Premier League.

""Of course we have our issues, but the fans want to watch, domestically and round the world.

""You have jeopardy. You don't know who is going to win. Clubs can aspire to rise up the league. There is competition at the bottom and for European places and hopefully for the title.

""As long as that remains the case, I am very optimistic about the future of the Premier League.""

The Club World Cup served as proof of concept for regular season European football to be played in America

Javier Tebas insisted it was going to happen. The La Liga president has a tendency of doing these things. He's a big manifestation guy. Say something loud enough, and with enough authority, and it will come true. His latest speaking of something into existence?

There will be a competitive game of top flight Spanish soccer in the United States. And it would be held in Miami.

""We have to find a good date in the calendar, but we are going to try to do it in Miami, where we tried previously. We are not going to do a whole gameweek. It will be one game (per season), and that's it,"" he told The Athletic in August 2024.

The comments caused a stir. European soccer has long had a fascination with playing its games abroad, such are the commercial revenue possibilities. Preseason friendlies in the U.S. are customary at this point - Bournemouth-Everton was played at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey last week as part of the Premier League Summer Series.

But competitive soccer, with points on the line, was always something of a pipe dream. Still, there Tebas was, insisting that it could happen - and with a venue already determined.

Reports at the time suggested the fixture would be held that December, near Christmas. And then the conversation simply faded. It became clear that the logistics were too hasty, even if Tebas is a very good politician. But the fact that his statement picked up any steam, and was even considered, suggested that the concept - resisted so virulently by numerous parties for so long - is coming closer to fruition.

Legal barriers that once prevented such game are collapsing. The Club World Cup's success - especially in the games that mattered among big European clubs - will offer a boost. It seems inevitable at this point: there will be a competitive football match held in the United States. Soon. It will send American fans into a frenzy, and infuriate core supporters to no end. 

And for good or ill, there's no way to stop it.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Home » Visa cardholders can register for early “draw” to FIFA World Cup 2026 tickets

Visa cardholders will get the first crack at FIFA World Cup 26™ tickets when an exclusive presale draw opens on Sept. 10, FIFA announced Thursday. The “Visa Presale Draw” lets fans register between Sept. 10–19 for a chance to buy seats in the tournament's opening sales phase—a window in which Visa will be the only accepted form of payment.

To take part, fans must create a FIFA ID at FIFA.com/tickets and complete an online application any time during the 10-day period. FIFA will then run a random draw and begin emailing selected applicants on or after Sept. 30, assigning each a dedicated purchase slot in October. Ticket availability during those time slots will be first-come, first-served.

“Excitement for the FIFA World Cup 26 is building fast, and Sept. 10 is a date every football fan should have marked in their calendar,” said Romy Gai, FIFA's chief business officer, calling the presale “a gateway to the most inclusive and spectacular tournament in our history.” 

Frank Cooper, Visa's chief marketing officer, added that the payments giant aims to “fuel the passion of the global football community and ensure the economic impact of the tournament reaches far beyond the final whistle.” 

Because demand is expected to far outstrip supply, FIFA will roll out additional ticketing phases with broader payment options later this year; specifics on those rounds are due in September. Hospitality packages, which bundle premium seating with food and amenities, are already on sale at FIFA.com/hospitality. FIFA is urging fans to buy only through its official channels to avoid invalid or fraudulent tickets.

The 2026 tournament—the first to feature 48 teams and 104 matches—will be staged across 16 venues in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Match tickets do not guarantee entry into a host country, so fans should confirm visa and travel requirements well in advance.

Donald Trump has reportedly threatened to block an iconic nation from competing at next summer's 2026 World Cup.

The opening match of the World Cup is just 315 days away, but several huge decisions are yet to be made regarding the participation of several nations.

Currently, 13 teams have secured their spots at next summer's tournament – Canada, Mexico, USA, Australia, IR Iran, Uzbekistan, Jordan, Korea Republic, Japan, Argentina, Ecuador, Brazil and New Zealand – while 35 places are still up for grabs.

Trump was front and centre during Chelsea's Club World Cup celebrations and stood alongside captain Reece James when he lifted the trophy following the Blues' emphatic 3-0 victory over Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain in what was an unofficial dress rehearsal for next summer's showpiece.

Advert

But away from Trump's at times jovial public front, there are concerns that the World Cup could be plunged into chaos as a result of his strict travel bans.

Council on Foreign Relations reported on June 9 that travel bans were enforced, clamping down on nineteen countries.

Twelve countries – Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia, Libya, Haiti, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Myanmar, Eritrea, Sudan and Yemen - are fully banned, while seven nations face partial restrictions that were applied, including Venezuela, Cuba, Burundi, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo and Turkmenistan.

Advert

On July 31, CNN reported that Trump could ban visas from Brazil ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

This could mean that the five-time World Cup winners play without fans from their homeland, although rules do not apply to athletes and coaches.

Dual citizens are also not subject to a ban.

Advert

And that's not all. In April, Trump announced that Brazilian goods imported to the US would face tariffs of 10%. However, he has since raised the rate to 50% amid huge backlash.

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva responded in an interview with The New York Times.

“There's no reason to be afraid,” Lula said. “I am worried, obviously, because we have economic interests, political interests, technological interests. But at no point will Brazil negotiate as if it were a small country up against a big country. Brazil will negotiate as a sovereign country.”

“In politics between two states, the will of neither should prevail,” he added.

“We always need to find the middle ground. This is achieved not by puffing out your chest and shouting about things you can't deliver, nor by bowing your head and simply saying ‘amen' to whatever the United States wants.”","{'href': 'https://www.sportbible.com', 'title': 'SPORTbible'}","soccer"

The 2026 World Cup ticketing sales are set to begin next month, and it's about time to start addressing some frequently asked questions. On Episode 158, we do just that.

First, we discuss the World Cup Draw which is reportedly set to take place on December 5th in Las Vegas. The draw always is a night for glitz and glamor, and Vegas could be the best backdrop for that particular night.

After quickly discussing the draw, we get into the first ticket phase for the 2026 World Cup, and it's one for all Visa cardholders. The application window runs September 10-19 and will provide the first major lottery for fans around the world to get tickets to the biggest sporting event on the planet.

After the break, we get to the questions. There have been several general questions about how the process will go for fans to get tickets to World Cup matches, whether they are for the USMNT or matches involving other teams. How much will tickets likely cost? Can I just find tickets on StubHub or another third party reseller? What will it be like to travel between the United States, Mexico, and Canada for matches? We don't have all the answers, but we get into a lot of information that we do know on this episode.

Home » Visa Launches Exclusive Ticket Presale for FIFA World Cup 2026

Visa is giving soccer fans an early opportunity to secure seats at the FIFA World Cup 2026, launching an exclusive presale for its cardholders ahead of the general ticket release.

The “Visa Presale Draw,” announced this week at a reception in Washington, D.C., marks the start of ticketing access for the largest FIFA World Cup in history. Visa, FIFA's Official Payment Technology Partner, is offering early access to fans with Visa Credit, Debit, or prepaid cards, who can apply for the draw from September 10–19.

Fans must have a FIFA ID to enter the draw, which will randomly select entrants and notify winners via email beginning September 30. Those selected will receive a specific purchase window in October, during which tickets will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Visa will be the exclusive payment method during this presale period.

“The Visa Presale Draw offers exclusive early access to enter the draw for tickets, creating an incredible opportunity for some lucky fans to secure their place at this historic event,” said Kim Lawrence, Visa's Regional President for North America.

Visa executives highlighted the significance of the 2026 tournament, which will span the United States, Mexico, and Canada, featuring 48 teams and 104 matches across 16 host cities. Eduardo Coello, Visa's Regional President for Latin America and the Caribbean, called the draw “an unprecedented moment for Visa,” emphasizing the company's focus on delivering safe, seamless payment experiences and enhancing fan access.

FIFA Chief Business Officer Romy Gai also encouraged fans to mark their calendars. “A ticket to the FIFA World Cup™ isn't just a ticket—it's a gateway to the most inclusive and spectacular tournament in our history,” he said.

In addition to fan engagement, Visa says it is working to prepare local communities and small businesses to benefit from the economic surge the tournament is expected to bring. The company plans to share insights and resources to help local vendors—from food stalls in Mexico City to shops in Kansas City and Vancouver—capitalize on increased tourism.

The 2026 World Cup will be the first to be hosted jointly by three countries and is expected to draw record-breaking attendance. For fans interested in applying for the Visa Presale Draw, more information is available at FIFA.com/tickets.

The Red Devils have suggested making supporters pay for the right to guarantee a seat at their new stadium - they must abandon the idea immediately

Manchester United are on their third-consecutive pre-season tour of the United States as they yet again take part in touring some of the best stadiums America has to offer. And it is fitting that United and the rest of the teams participating in the Premier League's Summer Series should be playing at NFL venues, because it is these very arenas which led to English football modernising and the creation of the most watched league in the world.

As recounted in Joshua Robinson and Jonathan Clegg's book 'The Club: How the Premier League Became the Richest, Most Disruptive Business in Sport', then-Arsenal owner David Dein and Tottenham chief Irving Scholar were inspired to help form the breakaway Premier League after their trips across the pond to watch American football. The pair were blown away by the modern stadiums, the friendly atmosphere and, in Dein's case, the cleanliness of the toilets. The pleasant experiences they had watching live sport was in sharp contrast to the contemporary terraces of English football, where ""the threat of physical violence hung in air - along with the powerful smell of urine"".

The NFL grounds that Dein and Scholar visited would later influence Arsenal and Tottenham's new stadiums, which opened in 2006 and 2019, respectively. The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium even now hosts NFL matches. So when United began considering whether to renovate Old Trafford or build a brand new stadium, it was inevitable that they too would look to the NFL for inspiration.

Club staff studied new arenas, such as the SoFi stadium in Los Angeles, the Metlife in New Jersey and the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on their tours in 2023 and 2024. When United unveiled plans for their £2 billion, 100,000 capacity stadium in March, designed by Sir Norman Foster, the influence of American stadiums was plain to see.

It has recently emerged, however, that the club are also looking into adopting one of the most controversial and influential policies enacted by NFL franchises: charging supporters for the right to buy season tickets, known in the U.S. as Personal Seat Licences (PSL). And if the club want to avoid a full-scale revolt from supporters and alienating many of the fans who have watched the team week in, week out for decades, they need to urgently drop the proposal.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Once Liverpool's record signing when he joined the Reds from Leicester City back in 2000 for £11 million, Heskey reveals how Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney brawled with ex-Aston Villa centre-back Alpay as the players left the pitch at the interval of the 0-0 draw that secured England's qualification to Euro 2004.

Manchester City are reportedly ready to send two of its young talents, Vitor Reis and Claudio Echeverri, on loan for this upcoming season. The City are keen on getting both players on loan to their partner club, Girona, to gain more playing time.

Pep Guardiola's team are keen on bouncing back this season after such a disappointing trophyless season last term. However, it appears that they will be doing it without the contributions of two young talents, Vitor Reis and Claudio Echeverri.

Although both Reis and Echeverri are relatively new arrivals at the club, with the Brazilian arriving in January 2025 while the Argentinian joined up a month later. The two were part of Man City's squad for the FIFA Club World Cup, but it looks like they won't be part of the squad in the upcoming season.

According to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, Man City want both Reis and Echeverri to link up at Girona for a one-year dry loan. At the moment, the Brazilian has agreed with the move, while his teammate is still negotiating.

Football-Italia reports that AS Roma are also keen on acquiring Echeverri on loan, but with a buy-out option added. However, Man City seem more keen on just loaning out the Argentinian to get playing time and not losing him.

It remains to be seen whether the decision to let those two 19-year-olds is the right decision for Guardiola's side. Nevertheless, the Spanish tactician did want a smaller squad size to manage, so that's probably the main reason behind City's plan to send Reis and Echeverri on loan.

Frances Tiafoe has been a member of the ATP Tour for the last decade.

The 27-year-old has experience competing at all levels of the game and he has established himself as a player consistently in or just outside the top 20.

The American has seen plenty of pulsating matches during his time on tour and he has been involved in some epic battles of his own.

But for Frances Tiafoe, there is one contest that was played at Masters 1000 level, that stands above the rest.

Tiafoe is currently playing at the Canadian Open, which marks the resumption of the Masters 1000 tournaments.

The world number 11 has since conducted an interview with the ATP Tour website with questions all centered around Masters 1000 events.

Tiafoe was asked to name his favourite Masters 1000 match of all time, and he selected a gladiatorial affair between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic from the 2009 Madrid Open.

“Rafa was down match points, he hit a crazy forehand inside-in to save match point. It was an absolute war. That's one that stands out,” Tiafoe said.

Nadal lost the first set, before taking a second set tiebreak to send the match into a decider. The third set also went to a tiebreak, and Djokovic found himself within one point of victory on three occasions.

But Nadal stepped up and hit some blistering forehand winners to keep the match alive before clinching the tiebreak to win 3-6, 7-6, 7-6 in four hours and three minutes of compelling action between two warriors.

Madrid hosted Tiafoe's favourite Masters 1000 match, and it is also his favourite city in which to play Masters 1000 tennis tournaments.

His record in the Spanish capital leaves much to be desired, as Tiafoe has won just five of his 11 career matches at the Caja Magica, with his best result coming this season when he reached the fourth round.

Despite his indifferent results in Madrid, Tiafoe very much enjoys what the city as a whole has to offer.

“Madrid is fire, I love Madrid. I'm cool with some guys at Real Madrid, I like to hang out with those guys, that's cool. The food is great there, the people are so nice,” Tiafoe explained.

“Partying is fire, nightlife is great. The city itself is cool. I like places where you can walk around: There's a lot of good dining, there's a good energy around. Going to Real Madrid matches is nice.”

After the disappointment at the Wimbledon Championships – in which he was defeated by Jannik Sinner in the semifinals without ever giving the feeling of being able to win – Novak Djokovic decided to skip the Toronto Masters 1000 (where he has not played since the 2018 edition) and allowed himself a holiday in Croatia and Greece. The former world No. 1 is expected to return to action at the Cincinnati Masters 1000 before the US Open, but there is no firm news on his schedule for the moment.

The Serbian legend is giving his best to win the 25th Major title of his exceptional career, but his body is no longer brilliant until a few years ago and the peremptory rise of Sinner and Alcaraz has made this goal even more complicated for Nole.

The 24-time Grand Slam champion has shown that he can raise his level in the most important tournaments on the calendar and his experience still makes the difference, but it may not be enough to make tennis history once again.

The 38-year-old from Belgrade has repeatedly repeated that he has no intention of retiring and has expressed his desire to continue playing until the Los Angeles Olympics, scheduled for 2028, when he will be 41 years old.

Novak is managing his schedule in the best possible way, with the aim of further extending his career and reaching new heights.

On the latest episode of his famous podcast, American legend Jimmy Connors discussed Nole's choice not to play in Canada: ""At this point in his career, Djokovic has to pay close attention to his schedule knowing that he is one of the oldest players on the tour. If he wants to be at the top of his shape in Grand Slam tournaments, he can't make mistakes. His next goal is the US Open and – if I had been in his place – I would have taken a break after Wimbledon as well.""

Djokovic's last triumph in New York dates back to the 2023 edition.

Daniil Medvedev has found life on the ATP Tour more challenging over the past 18 months.

The Russian has not claimed a title since 2023 and he has suffered early exits from tournaments on a more regular basis.

As a result, Medvedev has fallen out of the top 10 and he is struggling to produce the level of consistency that helped him win 20 ATP Tour titles, including a Grand Slam title.

Looking at his results since the start of last season, a former ATP player did not hold back on where he believes the 28-year-old's game is at.

2025 has been a season to forget for Daniil Medvedev so far. The world number 14 has suffered 15 defeats this year and he has just one Grand Slam match win to his name across the three majors played so far.

Medvedev's best result was a run to the Berlin Open final, where he lost to Alexander Bublik in straight sets.

There has been very little else for Medvedev to celebrate this season and while he seems to have been surpassed by other players, Frenchman Julien Varlet thinks the 2021 US Open winner has regressed significantly.

“Medvedev is stagnating, and it's even close to regressing. He's no longer scary. He's not hurting. And then when you're in doubt, there are two things that help you hold the fort,” Varlet told Sans Filet.

“First, your physique. But he's given so much that it's starting to get complicated. And then, above all, there's technique, and that's not where he's best. So as soon as he's in doubt, he automatically plays less well.

“Even in 2019, when he had that great part of the season, he didn't play the short game well, he didn't volley very well. And he hasn't progressed. Even though I love him, I think we should forget the Daniil Medvedev era.”

Medvedev claimed just one win at the Canadian Open before he was beaten by defending champion Alexei Popyrin.

He took a tight first set but the Australian battled back and secured the next two sets to keep his title defence alive.

Medvedev appeared to be so frustrated by his defeat that he left the court at the end of the match without his bag.

This was Popyrin's fourth Top 20 win of the season, and he was disappointed not to win the match in straight sets after holding a 4-2 lead in set one.

“I felt like I should have won that first set. I was in the driver's seat, I felt like I was really comfortable out there, and then something happened — the same thing that happened earlier this season when I played him [in Rome],” Popyrin said post-match.

“I kind of let go and I started feeling my shots a little bit. When that happens, when you play at a fast pace against him, he starts feeling the ball a little bit more.

“I had to revert back to the main tactics that we had, which was more focused on serving, coming into the net and not giving him the same rhythm. I think that worked today.”","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

The Spaniard vented on social media after being assigned the tournament's earliest match time—complaints that fellow player Dan Evans branded as ""pathetic.""ByStephanie LivaudaisPublished Aug 01, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 01, 2025

Late-night matches and early morning finishes are a frequent gripe on the pro tennis circuit—but Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has a different complaint: being scheduled too early.The world No. 19, who finished runner-up in Washington, D.C. just days ago, is fuming after being given an 11:00 a.m. match time at the National Bank Open in Toronto. The Spaniard, who traveled with fellow finalist Alex de Minaur to Toronto via private jet, had a smooth second-round win over Corentin Moutet on Wednesday and was set for a Friday showdown with No. 12 seed Jakub Mensik.But unlike most matches in Toronto, which start at 12:30 p.m., Davidovich Fokina's third-round clash is set for an earlier 11:00 a.m. start on the Motorola Razr Grandstand Court—the only stadium at the tournament with a morning schedule.Read More: Leylah Fernandez criticizes schedule after losing in Montreal in quick return after D.C. title

That discrepancy didn't sit well with him, and the 25-year-old took to X, formerly Twitter, to air his frustration in a bilingual open letter to the ATP Tour:“Today I want to share my disappointment and frustration with the ATP,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Tomorrow, every match starts at 12:30, except ours, which has been scheduled at 11:00. We're staying one hour away from the club, which means we have to wake up extremely early to arrive in good condition.“We've asked for a change, but the answer was that everything has already been sold, tickets, TV rights, etc. Once again, it's clear that players are not taken into consideration.”

In both Toronto and Montreal, the second stadium court begins play at 11:00 a.m., while all others start at 12:30 p.m. This continues through the early rounds until the round of 16, when the start times are aligned.Start times are determined by tournament organizers, and vary from tournament to tournament. At the Miami Open, where Mensik lifted the trophy in March, early-round matches started at 12:00 p.m. In Davidovich Fokina's native Spain at the Madrid Open, all early round matches started at 11:00 a.m.The ATP Rulebook says: “Each tournament shall provide ATP, at least one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the start of the tournament, a typed schedule that includes proposed daily starting times and number of courts to be used.” This schedule is then approved in writing by the ATP. (I. ATP Circuit Regulations, Section 1.03)

While 11:00 a.m. is routine start time at many tour events, players tend to dislike how the timing coincides with rising heat and humidity, making for grueling playing conditions. Davidovich Fokina wasn't alone in facing the dreaded morning slot—earlier in the week, No. 6 seed Andrey Rublev and No. 11 Karen Khachanov also drew 11:00 a.m. starts. Over in Montreal, WTA stars Sofia Kenin and Madison Keys were in similar positions.“Today it happened to others, tomorrow it's me, and from the day after, all matches return to 12:30,” Davidovich Fokina wrote. “There are plenty of available courts, yet we're the only ones playing at 11:00.”He concluded with a direct swipe at the tour: “The ATP always promises they'll fix things, but nothing ever changes. This isn't the first time it happens, and when you're inside, you realize it's not as great as it looks from the outside.”Reaction to Davidovich Fokina's post was split. While many social media users applauded him for calling out tournament conditions, others found his comments tone-deaf: “Wait, now we don't want to play early too?” one person wrote. “Wish I had this kind of privilege,” said another.

In the locker room, not everyone was sympathetic either. Great Britain's Dan Evans offered a blunt rebuttal on Instagram: “Wake up and play. The world wakes up (and) works 9-5 and even 8-6. Pathetic.”Davidovich Fokina isn't the only player raising schedule concerns in Canada.

 Top seed Alexander Zverev switched into survival mode to claim a milestone 500th ATP match win on Thursday, fighting back to beat Matteo Arnaldi 6-7 , 6-3, 6-2 at the Toronto Masters. 

 Germany's Zverev broke twice in the deciding third set to reach the fourth round of the US Open tuneup, converting his second match point to back up his defeat of the Italian ealier this year in Acapulco. 

 ""It's a great achievement,"" Zverev, winner of 24 ATP titles, said of reaching 500 career match wins. ""Not a lot of player reach this milestone. 

 ""But I still want 500 more maybe even more,"" he joked. ""You always want to win as many matches as possible. I'm all about this."" 

 Unable to gain the upper hand in an 82-minute first set, Zverev said his game improved as the minutes dragged on against 2024 Canadian semi-finalist Arnaldi. 

 ""I started playing better from the baseline and found my rhythm a bit. My backhand felt off but I was comfortable and happy with my level,"" added Zverev who next faces Francisco Cerundolo a 6-3, 6-4 winner over fellow Argentine Tomas Echeverry. 

 Alex Michelsen reached a Masters 1000 fourth round for the first time with a 3-6, 7-6 , 6-4 upset victory over third-seeded Lorenzo Musetti. 

 The 20-year-old American survived nearly 50 unforced errors and converted just two of nine break chances, but it was enough to vanquish Italy's Musetti, a two-time Grand Slam semi-finalist ranked 10th in the world. 

 ""It feels really good,"" the 26th-ranked Michelsen said after finally converting his seventh match point. 

 ""I've put in a lot of hard work and it's paying off a little bit. I was wondering when it would happen and I guess it is starting to happen right now. 

 ""I returned really well today,"" he added. ""I played offensive tennis and executed really well."" 

 Michelson will face fellow American Learner Tien for a place in the quarter-finals. Tien beat compatriot Reilly Opelka 7-6 , 6-3. 

 Fifth-seeded Holger Rune advanced with an efficient 6-2, 6-4 result over Frenchman Alexandre Muller.

 Eighth-seeded Casper Ruud shook off a slow start to beat Portugal's Nuno Borges 7-5, 6-4. 

 The Norwegian was playing only his fourth match since Roland Garros after missing Wimbledon because of injury. 

 Trailing 4-1 in the first set, Ruud thwarted Borges's two chances for a 5-1 lead, methodically lifting his game and taking control with a late break before earning the lone break of the second set for his 20th win of the season. 

 ""I just crawled into the first set,"" said Ruud, who fired nine aces. ""I was able to get back into it. One break and things can happen. I raised my return game and got more balls back into play. 

 ""In the second set I got the break and served my way through."" 

 Despite his sluggish start, Ruud was delighted to beat Borges after falling to him at Roland Garros in May. 

 ""It was nice to get my revenge,"" said Ruud, who next faces 11th-seeded Karen Khachanov. 

 Khachanov, seeded 11th defeated US qualifier Emilio Nava 6-7 , 6-4, 6-1 to book his second Masters round of 16 spot this season. 

 Ruud and Khachanov last played in a 2022 US Open semi-final won by the Norwegian.

Coco Gauff survived another erratic serving performance to reach the last 16 of the Canadian Open with victory over Veronika Kudermetova.

The world No 2 sent down 14 double-faults to add to the 23 she served up in the previous round against Danielle Collins, but a fightback from a set and a break down saw her progress 4-6 7-5 6-2 in Montreal.

Next up is a meeting with the last remaining home hope in the women's event, 18-year-old Victoria Mboko.

""It does give positives that I am winning these matches having literally one part of my game on a crutch,"" said Gauff, who came to Canada without a win since her triumph at the French Open.

""If I can stand on both feet, then I can only imagine that it will be a lot more straightforward and a lot easier for me.""

Teenage wild card Mboko hit 32 winners on her way to a 1-6 6-3 6-0 win over Marie Bouzkova of the Czech Republic, while fourth seed Mirra Andreeva was beaten by American McCartney Kessler.

Emma Navarro was another high-profile casualty, the eighth seed losing to Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine.

In the men's event in Toronto, top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from losing the opening set against Matteo Arnaldo to record the 500th ATP Tour win of his career.

Zverev, who is just the third German man to achieve the feat after Boris Becker and Tommy Haas, won 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 6-2 to set up a last-16 meeting with Francisco Cerundolo of Argentina.

""I think I started playing better from the baseline. The longer the match went on, I started to find my rhythm a bit,"" Zverev said.

""It was actually my backhand that was feeling a bit off in the beginning, which is strange. Doesn't happen very often. But after I found that shot, I was comfortable and I was happy about the level.""

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner made major changes to his support staff in recent weeks, including the surprise dismissal of his coach Marco Panichi and physiotherapist Ulises Badio just before Wimbledon. Despite the change, the Italian star went on to win the prestigious All England Club title, defeating World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz in the final. Sinner has now reunited with his former fitness coach, Umberto Ferrara.

At the time of the split, Sinner stated there was “no major reason” behind parting ways with Panichi and Badio. However, Italian outlet Corriere della Sera has now reported that Sinner had grown increasingly uncomfortable with certain decisions made by Panichi, both on and off the court.

One of the trigger points was reportedly Panichi's decision to leak confidential team information to the media. This included details of Sinner's emotional reaction after losing to Alcaraz at Roland Garros, where he failed to convert three championship points. Panichi had told the press that Sinner cried for 15 minutes in the locker room and was upset at how fans seemed to favour Alcaraz over him.

Panichi and Badio, both of whom previously worked with Novak Djokovic, came under scrutiny after their dismissal. Panichi, in particular, was seen as a divisive figure in Sinner's camp, with reports suggesting he frequently defied team rules that restricted public statements without prior clearance.

Sinner, a four-time Grand Slam champion, initially downplayed speculation about the departures. “Nothing big happened. It's not affecting me. I feel ready to compete. I feel free. We reached incredible results in the past with them. We did great work, but I decided to try something different. Nothing crazy happened,” he said during Wimbledon.

However, Sinner later admitted that a breakdown in trust led to the overhaul. “Communication is important for the group to function. You have to trust. We spend a lot of time together throughout the year, and it's important to find the right people,” he explained.

The 23-year-old has since brought back Umberto Ferrara, who had left the team last year following an investigation into Sinner's two failed doping tests. It was ultimately revealed that the positive results were due to accidental contamination. Sinner's former physio, Giacomo Naldi, had used a spray containing traces of the banned substance clostebol to treat a cut on his finger. He later massaged Sinner without gloves. The spray had been procured by Ferrara.

Iga Swiatek never attended her school prom, let alone ballroom-dancing lessons, because of the demands of professional tennis. She worked to become a Wimbledon champion, not to wow onlookers at the champions' ball. Fortunately Jannik Sinner, this year's men's winner, shared her anxiety and lack of experience. 

“I was simply focused on not doing anything silly, worried not to trip over my dress, which was very long,” Swiatek, 24, tells The Times in an exclusive interview. “By the end of it, I was like, ‘May this moment last for ever.' ”

Swiatek obliterated Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 — the first double bagel in the women's final at SW19 since 1911 — in July to add Wimbledon to her US Open and four French Open titles. On her least-favoured surface, it was a triumph after the one-month ban she accepted towards the end of last year, following a positive test for trimetazidine. 

She has always denied wrongdoing and was deemed to have had no significant fault or negligence, as she had suffered contamination through the use of sleep medication. The World Anti-Doping Agency did not challenge the International Tennis Integrity Agency's ruling, but the ordeal lasted months and still haunts her. Now, whenever a drugs test comes up, she remembers how powerless she felt “with no influence over what happened in August 2024”.

Swiatek was the world No1 shortly before her suspension, falling behind Aryna Sabalenka and dropping further to No8. Bad as that was for a player of her pedigree, the stigma around the drugs ban and the treatment she received from spectators affected her.

“There wasn't a month where I wouldn't be judged, and that translated on to the behaviour of audience members,” Swiatek says. “In Madrid, we had supporters shouting toward my box that I should fire somebody, so it really wasn't easy.”

She played through the noise to reach the semi-finals at the Australian and French Opens before the shock victory at Wimbledon, which she hopes will silence the critics and prove that her team are up to the task. 

“I would venture out on to the court in a sense trying to prove that everything is fine, instead of playing for myself and taking joy in tennis,” she says. “Reading that I'm falling apart, ‘diagnoses' of depression, calls for my team to be fired, were all a bit too much.”

Swiatek already had five grand-slam titles when she started working with Wim Fissette, the Belgian former coach of Simona Halep, Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka, shortly before her ban. “Wim basically began working with me after I had three wonderful seasons, which isn't a typical situation in a player-coach relationship,” she says. “Usually, you would employ a new coach when things aren't going well.”

With the help of Fissette, and having established herself as the “Queen of Clay”, Swiatek cracked the lawns of the All England Club. She credits her ability to move on from the anxiety of her ban to Daria Abramowicz, the psychologist and confidante she first worked with in 2019. They would speak almost daily about the issues affecting Swiatek on court. 

“Failures on clay, including in Rome, where I totally underperformed, were a cold shower, allowing me to shake it off and understand that dwelling in the past is not the way forward,” she says. “I knew that I'm not thinking about tennis while on court the way I should, that my thoughts are chipping away at my confidence, making it so that I'm sometimes fighting myself, not the opponent.

“Before the Wimbledon final, I would fall asleep thinking about raising the trophy. She helped me with my expectations before tournaments.”

In trying to keep grounded and focused, Swiatek sought distraction through Lego and literature. “Reading is how I rest,” she says. “Often, during tournaments, that's all I do.” Only when she is at home, between tournaments, does life get in the way of her quality time with a book. 

It was not only on Centre Court that Swiatek made an impression at Wimbledon. She revealed that pasta with strawberries, common in Poland, was her favourite meal. “It's the easiest dish you can make,” she says. “I'm not a good cook and it always comes just perfect, you know, which says something.

“You cook the best pasta possible and you smash the strawberries — preferably the Wimbledon ones, but obviously you're not going to be able to get them, so just the best strawberries you can get — smash them.

“I like them pretty juicy because then this juice can really mix well with the yoghurt or sour cream, and you make this kind of sauce. Add it to the pasta.

“My dad puts some sugar on it, I prefer not to because I want to be fit, you know, as an athlete. And that's it. It's the easiest thing ever.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Nick Kyrgios recounts 'throwing F-bombs' in front of Royal Family at Wimbledon","https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Tennis_Stories/158088/nick-kyrgios-recounts-throwing-fbombs-in-front-of-royal-family-at-wimbledon/","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 00:50:21 GMT","

Nick Kyrgios suggests he came to terms long ago that he wasn't going to be your regular tennis player and that's when he fully embraced his personality and started doing stuff like swearing in front of the Royal Family during a Wimbledon final.

If you can recall, the Australian tennis player - who turned 30 in April - had a couple of big controversies early in his career - like when he insulted Stan Wawrinka on a personal level during the 2015 Montreal Masters. And it didn't take long before he was labeled ""a brat"" and ""a tennis villain.""

While Kyrgios got more serious about his tennis career at one point, his personality stayed the same and he was never afraid to express himself on the court. During 2022 Wimbledon - the year when he made his first and lone Grand Slam final - the Australian took on Novak Djokovic in the title match. 

Traditionally, the Royal Family attends the Wimbledon final. That year, a nine-year-old Prince George made his first visit to The Championships. And Prince George found himself in one viral moment after the cameras caught one of his reactions to Kyrgios' colorful language.

""When I played in front of the Royal Box at Wimbledon, I was throwing F-bombs. It's been a struggle to kind of fit in, but now I kind of embrace it. I'm not going to change for anyone. I've been criticized in my career for not putting enough time on the court, and I've missed tournaments and training because I've just been gaming, purely because I love it,"" the 30-year-old said at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.

Sadly for Kyrgios, he hasn't played at Wimbledon since due to knee and wrist injuries.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Wimbledon star gets real after tennis retirement","https://www.themirror.com/sport/tennis/eugenie-bouchard-retirement-national-bank-1304562","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 15:02:00 GMT","

Eugenie Bouchard says she couldn't stop crying on the first day after her tennis retirement.

The Canadian star bid an emotional farewell to the sport following her second-round exit at the National Bank Open in Montreal, Canada, on Wednesday evening.

Bouchard, 31, suffered a 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 defeat against 17th seed Swiss star Belinda Bencic, but not without captivating the crowd with flashes of the same form that once took her to world No. 5 in 2014.

After her match, the 2014 Wimbledon finalist capped off her 16-year professional journey with a teary goodbye. ""I've always had a feeling I would end my career here,"" Bouchard said.

""Montreal is where I was born and raised, so it just feels right. An emotional moment. I think I just wanted a moment like this because my career deserved a moment like this. I really think I got it tonight, and I'm so grateful for that.""

In her farewell speech, she said she was ready to move on and explained that she wants to “do other things in life”. Bouchard had only played sporadically on the pro tennis circuit in the last few years, featuring more regularly on the PPA Pickleball Tour, where she is ranked 12th in the singles.

However, the Montreal ace was still emotional the day after hanging up her racket, taking to Instagram to share her feelings. She posted on her story: “Woke up and can't stop crying over here – seeing all your messages – thank you!”

Tributes poured in as tennis stars celebrated her career. British sensation and 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu wrote: “Thank you, Genie, loved watching you compete and play. Wish you all the best for your next chapter.”

Tennis legend and winner of 39 Grand Slam titles, Billie Jean King, said: “Congratulations on your retirement. Looking forward to following the next steps in your journey.”

Her compatriot and 2023 Billie Jean King Cup doubles partner Gabriela Dabrowski added: “Congrats on an amazing tennis career. Thank you for the memories and always laughing at my jokes.”

Bouchard claimed the junior Wimbledon singles title in 2012 and reached her peak in the 2014 season, clinching her sole WTA singles title. She also made it to the semi-finals of both the 2014 Australian Open and the French Open.

She then etched her name in history as the first Canadian to reach a Grand Slam singles final at Wimbledon, where she lost 6-3, 6-0 to Petra Kvitova. Bouchard's meteoric ascent at just 20 years old came crashing down after her defeat at the All England Club.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Emma Raducanu is on the verge of a big breakthrough before the US Open","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/opinion/emma-raducanu-is-on-the-verge-of-a-big-breakthrough-before-the-us-open/","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

Emma Raducanu is a former Grand Slam champion, but she hasn't had an easy ride of things over the last few years.

In 2021, Raducanu shocked the world when she became the first qualifier to win a Grand Slam title at the US Open.

Since then, the Briton has struggled to stay fit on the WTA Tour and has been widely criticized for her frequent coaching changes.

Things seemed to have clicked in 2025; however, as working alongside Mark Petchey, Raducanu has picked up several big wins.

With the US Open less than a month away, Raducanu is on the verge of a major breakthrough, which could put her in contention to win her second Grand Slam title at Flushing Meadows.

Winning her opening two matches in Montreal, Raducanu has risen to 37th in the ‘Live WTA Rankings'.

Raducanu currently trails world number 32 Dayana Yastremska by 142 points, a gap she could close down with a few more wins in Montreal.

The significance of the 32nd spot in the rankings relates to the seeding at Grand Slam tournaments.

Players ranked 1-32 are given more favorable draws and don't have to play each other until the third round at the earliest.

In 2025, Raducanu has been unseeded at all three Grand Slams and has therefore been drawn against several top players during the early rounds.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Raducanu lost all three matches, suffering defeats against Grand Slam champions at the Australian Open, French Open, and Wimbledon.

It is important to note, however, that Raducanu put up a great fight against world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of Wimbledon earlier in the summer, pushing her close in both sets on Centre Court.

Performing as well as she did, Raducanu proved she can compete with the very best on the WTA Tour.

However, if she were to travel to New York with a seed next to her name, the Brit would find herself in a much better position to make another deep run at a Grand Slam.

She'll no doubt be confident of grabbing herself a seed over the next couple of weeks as she continues to impress on tour.

Over recent years, Raducanu had struggled to string wins together at tournaments, something she hasn't had much trouble doing in 2025.

In the past, fans had become used to seeing Raducanu lose her opening match at a tournament or win one before going home.

Rarely would they see her win multiple matches at an event or make a deep run.

That's changed this year, as Raducanu has won multiple matches at seven of the 16 WTA tournaments she's played.

Having already picked up two wins in Canada, Raducanu will be in search of win number three when she takes on America's Amanda Anisimova for a place in the last 16.

Raducanu won both of their two previous meetings, at this year's Australian Open and Miami Open, but will likely take to the court as a slight underdog against the world number seven and 2025 Wimbledon finalist.

Only time will tell who will emerge victorious in their third career meeting when Raducanu and Anisimova face off in Montreal on Friday, August 1.

Filed under:

Let's rank the field at the men's 2025 US Open.

In professional tennis, the little number next to your name is everything. It's your seed, your status, your evidence to be taken seriously. “Oh my, did you see that the guy with the 22 next to his name beat the guy with the 3 next to his name?! Wow, what an upset!” And generally, seeding — derived from the ATP rankings coming in along with a smattering of subjectivity — is a decent way to gauge who can win and who can't. But not always.

For the upcoming US Open, the last major tournament of the year, men's tennis has about 17 people whose names you should probably know, but for the sake of round numbers (and because I think we kind of hit a wall at the Alexander Bublik/Alexei Popyrin turn), I'm going to rank the ATP Top 25* and tell you who I think has a chance of winning the US Open. 

*Disclaimer: to my knowledge, the only Top 25 player who has dropped out due to injury so far is Gregor Dimitrov. That may change in the month before the tournament, so I'll get to my Denis Shapovalov thoughts if the need arises. 

BONUS: 49. Joao Fonseca

Our injury replacement for Dimitrov on this list, Fonseca made back-to-back third rounds at majors and is still 18 years old, so ask anyone around men's tennis who the next thing might be… they'll point to him. 

25. Alexander Bublik

Fiery player who beat Jack Draper at the French Open but lost in the first round at Wimbledon.

24. Francisco Cerundolo

A player on the up-and-up since 2023, Cerundolo is the paragon of men's tennis' crowded middle class. 

23. Ugo Humbert

Humbert has seemingly been around forever and always is a threat to win a match or two, but I'm not sure how much more than that he is capable of. 

22. Tomas Machac

Our second Czech player in four spots, Machac is a 2024 Olympic gold medalist in mixed doubles. 

21. Arthur Fils

Ranked 21, age 21, and the top player from France, Fils is a really fun watch with some big wins on hard courts — he toppled Zverev this year in Miami. 

20. Grigor Dimitrov (out with pectoral injury)

19. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina

 Currently the highest ranked he's ever been, he's the best non-Alcaraz Spaniard on tour and just made the Final of the Citi Open. 

18. Jakub Mensik 

He's 19, 6'5” and grabbed a big-time win over Djokovic at the 2025 Miami Open, an ATP Masters 1000-level event. 

17. Flavio Cobolli 

ATP Rank: 17

He's six years younger than Khachanov and is currently launching an exploratory committee with being an elite player. We are going to have to wait to see if that committee comes back with a better verdict than “take a set off Djokovic in the Wimbledon quarterfinals,” but I'm down for anything.

16. Karen Khachanov

ATP Rank: 16

Khachanov is the ATP's recent house-money player. Nobody ever expects him to win anything, but he occasionally puts together a nasty run and reminds everybody that they aren't safe with their rankings. He's a fun player, but I don't see him actually winning anything anytime soon.

15. Casper Ruud

ATP Rank: 13

Slightly better, Ruud has won two matches at majors this year but pulled out of Wimbledon due to injury. There was a good 20 minutes when it seemed like Ruud could be the next thing, but now I don't know what to think; I haven't had a lot of reason to believe in the future of Norwegian tennis recently. 

14. Daniil Medvedev

ATP Rank: 14

What a fall off for Medvedev, who's had the year from hell in majors — he's one one match in three Grand Slams, and that is just insane for the former World Number 1. This is the guy that beat Djokovic in the 2021 US Open Final when he was going for the calendar Grand Slam, and he's just been unable to hack it this year. I don't know what happened, but there's no way it can stay this bad.

13. Tommy Paul 

ATP Rank: 15

Paul has been playing his best tennis in the last two years, but I still lack evidence that his best tennis is enough to even reach a major final, let alone win one. If you're looking for an American hopeful, you have three better options. 

12. Holger Rune

ATP Rank: 9

Rune is a player I don't really understand. He has the tools of an elite player of his generation, but has been woefully unsuccessful in five sets. If anything, he's a bit like a less-successful Jack Draper. Or maybe that's just because of their backwards hats. 

11. Andrey Rublev

ATP Rank: 11

Oh, you guys thought De Minaur was a social experiment in quartefinal failure? Well, let me introduce Rublev, who's 0-10 all time in major quarterfinals. That's just cruel and unusual, so Rublev has some demons to deal with before he can be taken seriously as a contender. 

10. Frances Tiafoe

ATP Rank: 12

Tiafoe was my main American hope for a while after he pushed Carlos Alcaraz to five sets in the 2022 US Open semifinal, but he hasn't been nearly as consistent as Fritz or Shelton lately. He plays with tons of fire and possibly digs deeper than anyone else on tour when his back is against the wall, but his game hasn't evolved with the rest of men's tennis. He still relies on a topspin-heavy forehand that trades raw speed for spin rate, and doesn't have the velocity to overpower lesser opponents like others around his level.

9. Alex De Minaur

ATP Rank: 8

De Minaur's career is like a social experiment of how many quarterfinals you can make without ever getting to a semifinal. It's honestly sad, and he's nursing an 0-5 record in the last eight despite playing excellent tennis for years now. Another player with a consistent game that just hasn't proven anything at the highest level, De Minaur probably needs a favorable draw to break the drought. That or an exorcism. 

8. Lorenzo Mussetti

ATP Rank: 10

The hallmark of this group are players I think can be better than they are… but they have to prove it to me. Mussetti is a player I legit like, with one of those “I'm not sure this will work but I'm going to try it anyway” shot diets that make Sinner and Alcaraz so special. Mussetti has a game that looks almost comically like Roger Federer, with the headband and one-handed backhand to boot. But he has real power, and I believe him him as a potential riser on tour. 

7. Taylor Fritz

ATP Rank: 4

I am not Fritz's biggest fan. I've long been skeptical of his ability to beat top players in five-set matches, generally just farming the players he's supposed to beat and folding once his opponent has a better hand. But beating everyone you're supposed to beat is a bit of an underrated skill, which allowed Fritz to get to the US Open Final last year on the back of an insanely light draw. Sure, he got railroaded by Sinner in the final, but all he needed was one more lucky break and he could have been a major champion. It's a really shaky theory, but sometimes it's better to be lucky than good. Actually, most of the time.

6. Jack Draper

ATP Rank: 5

Draper had an extraordinarily disappointing Wimbledon, ceding the British spotlight to Cameron Norrie after coming in as the overwhelming hometown favorite. Draper does, however, have absurd burst on his serve and plays a consistent, all-court style that is conducive to success in five-set matches. And he's only 23, so I wouldn't rule him out.

5. Ben Shelton

ATP Rank: 7

I'm going out on a limb here, but I think Shelton will soon be a regular member of the ATP Top 5. He's better than both Jack Draper and Taylor Fritz mechanically, and plays a style that can and will propel him past elite challengers. He's had a really nice year, and has lots of time to grow into his final form. The only question is: will it be good enough?

4. Alexander Zverev

ATP Rank: 3

Zverev has had an up-and-down year, and really an up-and-down career as far as Grand Slams go. He's basically glorified cannon fodder for whoever happens to be at the top level of men's tennis, be it Djokovic and Nadal or Sinner and Alcaraz — always doing well on tour but unable to break his personal glass ceiling. He's gotten unlucky in spots, and has a really modern game with pretty special mobility for his size. He could definitely win a major if he somehow dodges the top two on his path to the final, but that's not a good bet. It's much more likely Zverev himself gets upset.

3. Novak Djokovic 

ATP Rank: 6

This is where the rankings diverge from methodology, as Djokovic is ranked below three much-younger players but still, in my view, has a better chance in five-set matches. Djokovic got annihilated by Sinner in the Wimbledon Semifinal, and it looks more and more like the GOAT doesn't have a prayer against men's tennis' new royalty. But I'd still probably pick him against any of the other 62 players in the tournament, a testament to how much his game has endured his older age. However, I don't know how much longer I will be giving the Serbian the benefit of the doubt, so he better savor it.

Tier 1: Those Two

2. Carlos Alcaraz

ATP Rank: 2

I mean, do I have to explain this tier to anyone anymore? It looks like these will be the Top 2 seeds at every Slam and meet in the final every time… presumably until the heat death of the universe. Sinner is so ridiculously good on hard court, so Alcaraz is second. But like… would I even be one percent surprised if he won the thing? Not at all. 

1. Jannik Sinner

ATP Rank: 1

I have no rational reason to predict Carlos Alcaraz will beat Sinner on hard court. The Italian is turning into some sort of Rafael-Nadal-on-clay-except-its-on-hard-court level favorite, having taken the last three Grand Slams on the surface. And I had no rational reason to predict he would beat Alcaraz on grass at Wimbledon either, and then Sinner did it anyway. And he's thoroughly played himself into shape after his suspension, so by some combination of gut feel and irrefutable evidence, Sinner is the clear favorite. Had he not choked away the French Open final after having three match points, he would be going for the Calendar Grand Slam right now — or winning all four majors in a single year. That hasn't been done since Rod Laver in 1969.

Sounds fun, but let's be real — it's no villa in Fiji.

The show will star Ilana Sedaka, a 24-year-old former figure skater turned Pilates instructor, as she dates seven potential love matches over the course of eight days. Sedaka currently lives in Miami but grew up on Long Island not far from Arthur Ashe Stadium. “I'm coming in open to connection, ready to compete, and excited to be part of something bigger,” she said in a press release. “My hope is to bring a little joy, a little chaos, and a whole lot of realness to the court.” I have some questions about exactly what Sedaka will be doing with all of these eligible bachelors. A game of doubles? A Honey Deuce cocktail-making class? Maybe a photoshoot in front of the Unisphere?

Tennis fans aren't exactly happy with the news of the show. “U.S. Open, you still have time to take this down,” one commenter wrote on the Instagram post announcing the series. Others called it “crushingly disappointing” and “disrespectful to the sport of tennis,” while another said it was “so cringe.”

The eight-episode series will debut on YouTube on August 24, the first official day of the tournament. Although I've recently been freed from the shackles of Love Island USA, this show feels low-stakes enough for me to tune in. What've I got to lose?

A new dating show, “Game, Set, Matchmaker,” is “set to unfold entirely within the electrifying atmosphere” of the U.S. Open in N.Y., according to Stephanie Livaudais of TENNIS. Part reality TV, part social experiment, the show follows one bachelorette as she “seeks real connection amid Grand Slam chaos.” Produced by the U.S. Open and “set to premiere” on YouTube, the “unscripted series is breaking ground” at the intersection of sports, pop culture and romance -- and “aims to tap into the cultural phenomenon launched by shows like ‘Love Island USA,' ‘Love Is Blind' and ‘The Bachelor' in recent years.” At the “center of it all” is “the Champion” -- 24-year-old former figure skater turned Pilates coach Ilana Sedaka. Seven contestants “ranging from influencers and social media personalities to tennis superfans will compete for Sedaka's affection in a fast-paced” series. The dating show is “a collaboration” between the USTA, production company Fresh Tape Media, and Alissa Danzig and Brian Pollack of CastingHaus. The USTA sees the show as a “fresh way to expand the tournament's cultural reach.” The series will be filmed during U.S. Open Fan Week (Aug. 18-23) at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Episodes will air on the U.S. Open's YouTube channel during the main draw, which starts on Sunday, Aug. 24 (TENNIS, 7/31).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","tennis"

PublishedAugust 1 2025

Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Carlos Alcaraz, aged 22, has already won five Grand Slam titles and is vying to become the greatest male tennis player of his generation. But he's never faced an opponent like this before. The unfancied challenger on the other side of the net has an unorthodox technique and a less than athletic silhouette. Nevertheless, the underdog senses that this is his moment, moves swiftly (by his standards) to the net and cuts off the Spaniard's shot with an angled backhand volley. Alcaraz stands rooted to the spot. This year's French Open champion and Wimbledon finalist can only look on as the ball bounces twice – a clean winner.

If you are expecting this dream sequence to come to an end, you are not alone – but this unlikely scene really occurred in the leafy surrounds of an English garden just south of London on the eve of Wimbledon. OK, the court may not have been in tip-top condition, the tennis pro unwilling to risk injury by moving to the ball as a result, but a winner's a winner – and I'm taking it. Let's ignore the numerous preceding few balls that I either sent soaring into the heavens or slumping meekly into the bottom of the net.

This is what happens when Alcaraz is around. Fun takes over. In contrast to the ascetic self-discipline of Novak Djokovic or the laser-like focus of Rafael Nadal, there is a puppyish playfulness about the Murcia native. The big grin he frequently flashes when at leisure can be seen on court too if a particular point pleases him – even in tight matches or when he is losing. This, and his spectacular arsenal of shots, have made him a crowd favourite everywhere. Tipped for greatness from childhood, he enjoyed a breakout season in 2022, winning the US Open and becoming world number one aged just 19. He has since won four more Grand Slam titles: two French Opens and two Wimbledons, and is currently world number two behind his friend and rival, the Italian Jannik Sinner. Currently he and Sinner are trading major titles – Alcaraz won this year's French Open, Sinner took Wimbledon – but the plan is, according to his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, to make him “the greatest player in history”. He has made $47.4mn in prize money, and at least the same amount again in off-court earnings.

“If Carlos plays his A+ game, there isn't anyone in the world who can beat him,” John McEnroe has said, while according to Andre Agassi, “he's like a flying saucer versus the F-15s… His speed doesn't diminish.” And Alcaraz – who has sponsorship deals with Nike, Louis Vuitton, Rolex and more – has the potential to reach an audience far wider than the usual tennis one. “Carlos represents the next generation – not just in sport, but in spirit,” says Pharrell Williams, Louis Vuitton men's creative director. “His energy, discipline and joy remind us all what it means to do what you love at the highest level. Carlos is the future – and he's already here.” His “optimism and determination resonate deeply”, adds Vuitton's chairman and CEO, Pietro Beccari.

“I really enjoy playing tennis. It's my passion, it's what I chose, it's what I love,” says Alcaraz. At 6ft, he is less towering than other players but still imposingly muscular; he gives off an eminently relaxed and unstarry vibe. “But in the end, it's like everything else. If you play every day and you don't have a break for yourself, to disconnect, that excitement kind of fades. So I always try to find moments of fun – of wanting to live.”

While Sinner recently released an unlikely duet with Andrea Bocelli, the Spaniard has been channelling his inner Frank Sinatra: the title of a Netflix docuseries released earlier this year was Carlos Alcaraz: My Way. And so it proves when we meet. Throughout the afternoon, he exchanges laughing banter with me, the photographer, the stylist and numerous assistants, gamely rolls around in the grass, plays keepie-uppie football and changes into one outfit after another, often pausing to grab a small handful of Haribo on the way. But how do you balance that innate sense of fun with the requirements of this most demanding of individual sports?

Tennis players are, in some ways, punished for success. The deeper they go in tournaments, the less time off between them they get. When we meet, Alcaraz has been so busy that he hasn't even had time for a haircut. He has just clinched the pre-Wimbledon warm-up title at Queen's Club on grass. Only two weeks earlier he won his second French Open on the clay of Paris in one of the greatest-ever finals, coming back from two sets down and saving three championship points against Sinner.

“I simply thought about coming back little by little: one point, then another point, then another point, especially those three points,” he says. “Closing a Grand Slam is very, very difficult, so I knew that I would have chances. That's why I stayed calm. I knew it wasn't going to be easy for him.”

Even on the brink of defeat, he never appeared to flinch or look beaten. Is his inner confidence really that unshakeable or is he just a good actor?

“It was a bit the image I wanted to give as well,” he smiles. “At no time did I doubt that I could come back, but obviously you have to show an image of self-confidence at all times. As soon as you show weakness to the other, that's it – you are lost.”

What followed his victory has become almost as famous as the win itself. Rather than immediately taking to the practice courts again, Alcaraz allowed himself a few days' holiday in Ibiza, which included one night out partying. In today's monastic tennis milieu, this is the equivalent of going on a George Best-style marathon bender. Djokovic is said to have once celebrated a Grand Slam final win with one square of chocolate, and Sinner told me last year that he indulges after big tournament wins by having a hamburger. But such extreme self-denial is not in the Alcaraz playbook.

“I'll eat a hamburger before, during or after a tournament,” he says. “And I always allow myself some dessert, some chocolate – that's no problem for me. How do I celebrate? Maybe when I go home. My mother's food is always the best. And I drink champagne and Coca-Cola, which I don't do during tournaments… Without overdoing it, of course.”

Both of us shoot a glance towards his manager, Albert Molina, who is listening nearby, focused on his phone. “Without overdoing it,” Alcaraz repeats a little louder, grinning. Molina – who in the Netflix series plays the loving but tough antagonist making sure Alcaraz doesn't get everything his way – doesn't look up, but lets slip the slightest smirk. 

Alcaraz hails from the village El Palmar, in south-east Spain. Its population is around 25,000, its “notable people” entry on Wikipedia now a list of one. His father was a former low-ranked tennis player turned coach and club administrator, his mother a sales assistant at the nearby Ikea. Carlos Jr's talent was evident early. Molina spotted him at 11 and IMG, the premier sports and entertainment agency, signed him at 12. 

Some have likened Alcaraz's variety-filled game to Roger Federer's: today, he says that the Swiss great is the player he'd have loved to play the most. (They just missed each other, with Federer's last Wimbledon in 2021 being Alcaraz's first.) But, perhaps inevitably, many others have compared him to his illustrious compatriot Nadal. The two are clearly simpatico, having played doubles together in the Olympics last year, yet their playing styles are markedly different – as are their personalities – and Alcaraz has balked at the drawing of parallels, saying: “I don't want people to call me Rafa's successor.” 

Some content could not load. Check your internet connection or browser settings.

With Federer and Nadal retired, and Djokovic seemingly in the twilight of his career, the tennis establishment is desperate to crown their heirs. But as Alcaraz puts it in the Netflix series, “those guys are aliens”. What is it like trying to follow a trio who between them won 67 Grand Slam titles?

“Tennis has always had great rivalries and great players,” he says. “It's a privilege that people look at our games that way, with such enthusiasm, but in the end we have no obligation to do what they have done, far from it. If you don't stay strong in your ideals, in what you want, that pressure can eat you. You have to know how to differentiate. We try not to think about any pressure and least of all about doing what they did.” 

Long gone are the abrasive days of players like Connors, McEnroe and Năstase who frequently butted heads and riled each other, often to viewers' delight. Alcaraz, in contrast, is friendly with Sinner, who looks set to be his chief rival over the next decade.

“Trash-talking gets a lot of attention. People really like the idea that there is friction between us,” he admits. “That's what sells. But although tennis is an individual sport, we are with the same players every week, day in and day out … Jannik and I, who have had great battles on the court, see each other a lot off of it. We talk, we train together sometimes. And in the end you forge a good relationship, a beautiful relationship … We want to win and beat each other, but then off court, being good people and getting along is another matter. For me that is one of the virtues and values of sport.”

There is, however, a shadow world where such politesse is far rarer: the online one. Andy Murray recently spoke out on the dangers of social media, and players such as Katie Boulter have opened up about the abuse they have been subjected to online.

“I use social media a lot and it's not a very good environment – not to say a horrible one,” says Alcaraz, who has 7.4mn followers on Instagram and 1.1mn on TikTok. “It's become a very important tool for work, but on a personal level it's a very ugly world. In the end nothing on there is real. People show a life that isn't really theirs, a face that's not theirs. And then aside from that, there are a lot of people who can reach you with a simple comment and can hurt you. I think that there is no worse weapon than words.” 

He finds solace in the world he knows best: back with his family and longtime friends in Murcia, and his older brother, Álvaro, who often travels with him. “Those are your real friends, because they were there when you were nobody and tennis was just a hobby. And when you are with them you feel normal, you feel that you are not a tennis player and you are not famous. You go back to your childhood – and that's a beautiful thing … Being back home is what refills my energy tank.”

Does he really live in the tiny bedroom in his parents' apartment shown in the Netflix series? “Yes. Not for much longer, but for now I'm still with my parents in the same house as always. Since I travel a lot, I don't get to see my parents much, so when I'm at home I like to make the most of it.”

He also uses it as a storage depot for his growing trove of trophies. “There are trophies in my room and in the living room. We're looking for more spaces to put them.” Surely they must be running out of room at the rate he's winning? The Queen's Club one, for example, is enormous. “I'm not taking that one home,” he laughs.

Another problem is shoes. “I'm a complete sneaker fanatic,” he confesses. “I love them. And there isn't any space left at home. My mother tells me off because I come back from every tournament with more sneakers and she says, ‘No, don't bring more, there's nowhere to put them.'”

What next? When I caught up with him after Wimbledon he was characteristically sanguine about his defeat: “I thoroughly enjoyed competing at Wimbledon again. It's a special place. I look forward to coming back next year, but after recharging the batteries, the work starts for the forthcoming US Open swing.” It's a mood echoed in his words in the post match press conference: “This rivalry [with Sinner] is coming better and better, and I'm really grateful for that because it gives me the opportunity to give my 100 per cent in every practice, every day just to be better. Because the level I have to maintain just to beat Jannik is really high.” 

In January he will be looking to complete the “Career Slam” by winning the fourth major championship that has so far eluded him: the Australian Open. He would be the youngest man ever to do so – and you wouldn't put it past him. However, he'd like a break first. A recurring concern for him is the shortness of the tennis off-season (just the month of December), which many players have complained about. “We're trying to change the schedule a bit, seeing if they can remove more tournaments so we can have more rest time, more vacation time,” he says. “It's not easy, but we're trying.”

Does it leave any time for hobbies? “I love playing golf and I played a few courses here in the UK,” he says. “With the amount of rain you have, there should be a lot of great courses!” He is far from alone. “Rafa plays really well,” Alcaraz declares. “Alex de Minaur plays too. I played Andy Murray the other day and he beat me. He's spent a lot of time on the course practising and you can tell… I also played Casper Ruud [three-time major finalist] and he beat me too.” 

He owns the defeat but you sense it might rankle more because Ruud is a current rival. Will he be seeking revenge on the tennis court? “Oh you bet,” Alcaraz affirms, the big grin returning. “The next time I play him, I'll remember he beat me at golf — and I'll hit the ball even harder.” ","{'href': 'https://www.ft.com', 'title': 'Financial Times'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Zverev rolls into history: From Paris pain to 500 career wins","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/zverev-500-wins-feature-2025","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 03:11:53 GMT","

Alexander Zverev's journey hasn't always gone to plan, but through setback and recovery, he's carved out a career that speaks just as much to resilience as it does to success — and he now has 500 tour-level wins to show for it.

After lifting a career-best six trophies in 2021, including a second triumph at the Nitto ATP Finals, the German seemed to be nearing the peak of his powers. But in a high-octane Roland Garros semi-final with Rafael Nadal the following spring, Zverev badly rolled his right ankle and was wheeled off court in agony. Surgery followed, and with it came a long, uncertain road back.

Since his return in 2023, however, Zverev has increased his title tally to 24 and reached two more major finals, reasserting himself firmly near the top of the game. On Thursday at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers in Toronto, he became just the fifth active man to record 500 victories, and the seventh fastest to have reached that milestone this century, by notching a 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-2 victory against Matteo Arnaldi.

""It's a great achievement. There's not a lot of players that reached that milestone,"" Zverev said post-match. ""Of course I still want 500 more hopefully to come, and maybe even more! When you start your career, you wish to play on Tour, you wish to have a successful career, win as many matches as possible. I think 500 is definitely a milestone, and I'm happy about that.""

The path to this milestone has included some of the sport's biggest stages and brightest moments. From his early breakthrough at the 2018 Nitto ATP Finals, where he defeated Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic in consecutive matches to lift the trophy, to his gold medal triumph at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Zverev has long proven he belongs in elite company.

Looking back at his 500 wins, a few stand out in his mind: ""The first time I beat a Top 10 player, Federer in Halle, in Germany, on grass,"" he said of his 2016 win on home soil. ""Beating Stan [Wawrinka] in the St. Petersburg final, my first ATP title [also in 2016], and for me two of the most memorable ATP matches were beating Federer and Djokovic back-to-back in 2018 in London.""

Fastest ATP Tour players to reach 500 wins in the 21st century 




While Zverev was not counting down to the milestone number, he appreciates its significance now that he's hit it: ""I don't exactly know what number I'm on, but I knew that I was close to 500,"" he told ATPTour.com. ""It's special for sure. But at the end of the day, nothing changes for me. I've still got to do the work, I've still got to try and keep improving and try to win another 500.""

Zverev is just the third German to reach 500 wins in the Open Era, joining the retired Boris Becker (713-214) and Tommy Haas (569-338) in an exclusive national club. In doing so, he has further solidified his status as the standard-bearer of German tennis in the modern era.

The injury setback in 2022 might have derailed a lesser player, but Zverev's response only deepened the respect he commands on Tour. With his run to the semi-finals in Paris that year, the then-25-year-old had risen to a career-high No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, but he slipped to No. 12 by the end of the year, having not competed since.



After a testing comeback in 2023, which began with a second-round loss at the Australian Open, Zverev began to gradually find his rhythm. He returned to the last four at Roland Garros and won titles in Hamburg and Chengdu before earning his spot at the season finale for a sixth year.

In 2024, Zverev delivered one of the most complete seasons yet, reaching the Roland Garros final for the first time and capturing two ATP Masters 1000 titles, tying him for eighth in the list for the most in the Open Era with seven in total.

In the championship match in the French capital, Zverev felt the full force of the sport's new generation, falling in five sets to 21-year-old Carlos Alcaraz. Eight months later, at the 2025 Australian Open, Zverev fell short in his third major final — this time to Jannik Sinner, the other half of what is quickly becoming a new-era rivalry at the top of the game.

Though Alcaraz and Sinner have combined to win the past seven Grand Slam titles, Zverev continues to prove he can compete at the highest level. He remains just one of three players to own Lexus ATP Head2Head wins over both of them at major tournaments, a testament to his ability to challenge the very best, no matter the generation.

Reaching the 500-win mark places Zverev in rarefied air alongside Djokovic, Marin Cilic, Gael Monfils and Stan Wawrinka as the only active players to achieve that feat. At 28, Zverev is the youngest among them, with his nearest peer in age, Cilic, seven years his senior.

Active ATP Tour players with 500 tour-level wins




From an era framed by the dominance of Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Djokovic, to the new wave of Sinner and Alcaraz, Zverev has carved out space of his own: consistent, competitive, and continually evolving. With 24 tour-level titles, three Grand Slam finals, Olympic gold, and now 500 match wins, his career reflects a level of excellence sustained across years at the top of the game.

And still, there is plenty more to come.

Alexander Zverev overcame a spirited effort from Matteo Arnaldi on Thursday at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers, where the top seed battled to 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-2 victory to claim his 500th tour-level match win.

""It's a great achievement. There's not a lot of players that reached that milestone,"" Zverev said post-match. ""Of course I still want 500 more hopefully to come, and maybe even more!

The 28-year-old, now 37-14 on the season, is the first man born in 1990 or later to record 500 tour-level wins. A seven-time ATP Masters 1000 champion, the German next faces a familiar rival in Argentine Francisco Cerundolo, who holds a perfect 3-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head record against Zverev, with two of those wins coming this season (Buenos Aires, Madrid). Cerundolo, seeded 14th, ousted countryman Tomas Martin Etcheverry 6-3, 6-4.

Competing this fortnight for the first time since Wimbledon, Zverev was not at his best in his third-round victory, gifting Arnaldi a pair of set points in the opener — first with a routine backhand volley miss, then with a double fault at 4/5 in the tie-break. The 32nd seed seized his moment behind his own delivery, unloading a Serve +1 forehand to gain a one-set advantage.

The 2017 champion played into form as the match wore on, rarely allowing the Italian any looks on return. Across sets two and three, Zverev dropped just four points behind his first serve, according to the Infosys ATP Stats, to advance after two hours and 46 minutes. Zverev also made a noticeable effort to move forward throughout the night, converting 19 of 26 net points.""I think I started playing better from the baseline. The longer the match went on, I started to find my rhythm a bit,"" Zverev said. ""It was actually my backhand that was feeling a bit off in the beginning, which is strange. Doesn't happen very often. But after I found that shot, I was comfortable and I was happy about the level.""

Alex Michelsen earned his second Top 10 win on Thursday at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers, where he upset World No. 6 Lorenzo Musetti 3-6, 7-6(4), 6-4 to reach the fourth round at an ATP Masters 1000 event for the first time.

The 20-year-old American lost the first set and was being outplayed by the dynamic Italian for the first 90 minutes of action on Centre Court. However, Michelsen began to land bigger blows off the forehand wing to trouble Musetti, who also coughed up 16 unforced errors in the third set.

""I am a big guy, I have got to play offensive tennis,"" Michelsen said. ""Especially today, you can't give a guy like Lorenzo time to bully you around from the baseline, so I was trying to bully him around and I think in the second and third sets I did a really good job. Taking shots early. I was missing a couple but you can't make them all and I was doing a really good job executing.""

Michelsen squandered two match points on the Musetti serve at 3-5 and then blew a 40/0 lead on his own serve, with the Italian saving the final match point in that run with a scorching backhand winner. However, the World No. 34 stayed composed, saving two break points before sealing victory on his seventh match point.

With his two-hour, 32-minute win, Michelsen improved his Top 10 record to 2-6, having defeated the then-No. 9 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Alex de Minaur in Los Cabos last season. Into the fourth round, the 26th seed Michelsen will next meet close friend Learner Tien.

""The first time in the fourth round feels really good. I have put a lot of hard work in and it is finally starting to pay off a little bit. I was wondering when it would happen and I guess it is starting to happen right now,"" Michelsen said. ""I returned really, really well today.""

Musetti has earned more Masters 1000 wins than anyone else on Tour this year (17), highlighted by his final run in Monte-Carlo. The third-seeded Italian was not at his best against Michelsen, though, and has now lost three of his past four matches following his semi-final showing at Roland Garros, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Musetti is currently sixth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and is aiming to make his debut on home soil at the Nitto ATP Finals in November. The 23-year-old will look to rediscover the winning formula in Cincinnati in August.

Tien ousted countryman Reilly Opelka 7-6(3), 6-3 to become the youngest American to reach the round of 16 at ATP Masters 1000 level since a 19-year-old Frances Tiafoe in 2017 (Cincinnati).


Tien, who is competing at a career-high No. 61 in the PIF ATP Rankings, targeted Opelka's forehand to draw errors from the 2021 Toronto finalist. Opelka finished with 40 unforced errors, compared to the lefty's 14. 


Having already beat Opelka in Rome this year, Tien matched that feat to improve to 2-0 against the four-time tour-level titlist. Opelka dropped just one point behind his booming first serve, yet was unable to convert any of his four break chances. Tien and Michelsen both competed at the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, where the lefty beat Michelsen in the semi-finals. Michelsen won their lone meeting this year in Houston.

Eighth seed Casper Ruud avoided following Musetti out of Toronto by defeating Nuno Borges 7-5, 6-4. With his win, Ruud avenged his loss to the Portuguese star at this year's Roland Garros and improved to 2-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.




Ruud has now advanced to the fourth round at the Canadian Masters 1000 event for the past five years, with his best showing a semi-final run in Montreal in 2022. The 26-year-old, 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, is chasing his second Masters 1000 crown of the year after winning Madrid. He will next meet Karen Khachanov.

Khachanov downed American qualifier Emilio Nava 6-7(6), 6-4, 6-1 to reach the fourth round at a Masters 1000 event for the second time this year. The 29-year-old, who advanced to the last 16 in Rome, is 10-1 against players outside the Top 20 this season.

Alex de Minaur advanced to the round of 16 via walkover. His opponent, countryman Christopher O'Connell, withdrew due to an abdominal injury. O'Connell upset 23rd seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in a three-set victory Wednesday.

The Spaniard vented on social media after being assigned the tournament's earliest match time—complaints that fellow player Dan Evans branded as ""pathetic.""ByStephanie LivaudaisPublished Aug 01, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 01, 2025

Late-night matches and early morning finishes are a frequent gripe on the pro tennis circuit—but Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has a different complaint: being scheduled too early.The world No. 19, who finished runner-up in Washington, D.C. just days ago, is fuming after being given an 11:00 a.m. match time at the National Bank Open in Toronto. The Spaniard, who traveled with fellow finalist Alex de Minaur to Toronto via private jet, had a smooth second-round win over Corentin Moutet on Wednesday and was set for a Friday showdown with No. 12 seed Jakub Mensik.But unlike most matches in Toronto, which start at 12:30 p.m., Davidovich Fokina's third-round clash is set for an earlier 11:00 a.m. start on the Motorola Razr Grandstand Court—the only stadium at the tournament with a morning schedule.Read More: Leylah Fernandez criticizes schedule after losing in Montreal in quick return after D.C. title

That discrepancy didn't sit well with him, and the 25-year-old took to X, formerly Twitter, to air his frustration in a bilingual open letter to the ATP Tour:“Today I want to share my disappointment and frustration with the ATP,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Tomorrow, every match starts at 12:30, except ours, which has been scheduled at 11:00. We're staying one hour away from the club, which means we have to wake up extremely early to arrive in good condition.“We've asked for a change, but the answer was that everything has already been sold, tickets, TV rights, etc. Once again, it's clear that players are not taken into consideration.”

In both Toronto and Montreal, the second stadium court begins play at 11:00 a.m., while all others start at 12:30 p.m. This continues through the early rounds until the round of 16, when the start times are aligned.Start times are determined by tournament organizers, and vary from tournament to tournament. At the Miami Open, where Mensik lifted the trophy in March, early-round matches started at 12:00 p.m. In Davidovich Fokina's native Spain at the Madrid Open, all early round matches started at 11:00 a.m.The ATP Rulebook says: “Each tournament shall provide ATP, at least one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the start of the tournament, a typed schedule that includes proposed daily starting times and number of courts to be used.” This schedule is then approved in writing by the ATP. (I. ATP Circuit Regulations, Section 1.03)

While 11:00 a.m. is routine start time at many tour events, players tend to dislike how the timing coincides with rising heat and humidity, making for grueling playing conditions. Davidovich Fokina wasn't alone in facing the dreaded morning slot—earlier in the week, No. 6 seed Andrey Rublev and No. 11 Karen Khachanov also drew 11:00 a.m. starts. Over in Montreal, WTA stars Sofia Kenin and Madison Keys were in similar positions.“Today it happened to others, tomorrow it's me, and from the day after, all matches return to 12:30,” Davidovich Fokina wrote. “There are plenty of available courts, yet we're the only ones playing at 11:00.”He concluded with a direct swipe at the tour: “The ATP always promises they'll fix things, but nothing ever changes. This isn't the first time it happens, and when you're inside, you realize it's not as great as it looks from the outside.”Reaction to Davidovich Fokina's post was split. While many social media users applauded him for calling out tournament conditions, others found his comments tone-deaf: “Wait, now we don't want to play early too?” one person wrote. “Wish I had this kind of privilege,” said another.

In the locker room, not everyone was sympathetic either. Great Britain's Dan Evans offered a blunt rebuttal on Instagram: “Wake up and play. The world wakes up (and) works 9-5 and even 8-6. Pathetic.”Davidovich Fokina isn't the only player raising schedule concerns in Canada. Home favorite Leylah Fernandez, fresh off a title in Washington, arrived in Montreal unseeded and without a first-round bye. Although she requested a night match for her opener on Tuesday, the accommodation wasn't granted.While Fernandez blamed “political issues,” tournament director Valerie Tetreault told press she had pushed for the request but couldn't override scheduling limitations. “I didn't win my fight,” she said. “It's my role to have conversations with the WTA, so I pushed as much as possible.”

The German, who was born in 1997, is the first man born in 1990 or later—or even 1989 or later—to achieve the feat.ByJohn BerkokPublished Aug 01, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 01, 2025

Alexander Zverev hit a big milestone in Toronto on Thursday night, recording the 500th win of his career with a 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-2 victory over Matteo Arnaldi in the third round of the Masters 1000 event.""It's a great achievement,"" Zverev said. ""I think there's not a lot of players that have reached that milestone. For me that's great to reach it.

He closed it out after two hours and 46 minutes when one last Arnaldi backhand clipped the net.Awaiting the No. 1-seeded German in the fourth round will be No. 14-seeded Francisco Cerundolo, a 6-3, 6-4 winner against fellow Argentine Tomas Martin Etcheverry earlier in the day.Cerundolo has beaten Zverev all three times they've played previously, though all three of those meetings did come on clay.

FP2 Highlights: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

Colapinto: 'We struggled with the balance, with the grip' around Hungaroring

Max Verstappen gave an update ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix on where he will be driving next season.

Max Verstappen has confirmed that he will remain with Red Bull for the 2026 season ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix, after months of speculation that he could join Mercedes.

The four-time and reigning World Champion's future has been one of the hottest topics in the Formula 1 paddock this campaign, with it confirmed by Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff several weeks ago that he was having conversations with Verstappen about a drive for the Silver Arrows.

At the previous round in Belgium, though, Wolff stated that after recent developments he would prefer to retain his current line-up of Kimi Antonelli and George Russell but fell short of any official confirmation.

Ahead of this weekend's race in Budapest and a three-week summer break, Verstappen was asked whether his and Wolff's yachts would be spending time together, hinting at ongoing negations between the pair.

But the 27-year-old dismissed the suggestion and confirmed he would be staying put with the Milton Keynes-based outfit for next season.

""The thing is, people are waffling so much throughout the whole season while the only one that actually can or should speak is not speaking,"" he said.

""That's me, and I do that on purpose because it makes no sense to start throwing things around and actually that should be the same for everyone.

""Some people just like to stir the pot, some people just like to create drama but for me it's always been quite clear and also for next year.

""I'm discussing with the team already the plans, the things that we want to change next year so that means I'm also staying with the team for next year and if my boat is next to Toto's then the boat is next to Toto's.

""You can have a personal relationship with someone even if you don't have a working relationship with someone.""

He added to media: ""I think it's time to basically stop all the rumours, and for me it's always been quite clear that I was staying anyway.""

Verstappen will remain at Red Bull as F1 enters a new technical regulation era in 2026, which incudes both changes to the chassis and power units.

The team has recently come under new leadership as long-term Team Principal Christian Horner was replaced by Laurent Mekies ahead of the Belgium Grand Prix.

Despite only a limited amount of time in the role, Verstappen praised the new appointment and believes Mekies will drive the team forward.

""We discuss about a lot of things to be honest,"" said Verstappen. ""He's very friendly, he's very open, very motivated, very driven.

""That's of course what you want to see from a boss and I like it. It's a nice atmosphere that he is creating and I'm very excited for the future, what we can do together.

""Of course, for this year the amount of influence with the car is difficult. You jump in the middle of the season but of course for the future, you have a lot more say and influence on that. He's asking, for me at least, the right questions and ideas. I like it.""

FP2 Highlights: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

Colapinto: 'We struggled with the balance, with the grip' around Hungaroring

McLaren's Lando Norris has set the pace in Free Practice 1 ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Lando Norris has topped the timesheets during the opening practice session at the Hungarian Grand Prix, the McLaren man leading the way from team mate Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.

In the hours prior to the session getting underway, Aston Martin had announced that Fernando Alonso would miss FP1 due to a muscular injury in his back, meaning that test and reserve driver Felipe Drugovich would take his place. Further updates on Alonso's participation for the rest of the weekend are set to follow in due course.

Elsewhere, Paul Aron would be in action at the wheel of Nico Hulkenberg's Kick Sauber, with the Estonian making his second rookie driver appearance for the team after a previous outing at Silverstone.

Lewis Hamilton – a record eight-time winner at the Hungaroring – was the first to hit the track when the green light appeared, the Ferrari man leading the way during a busy start to the hour. While eight drivers had bolted on the hard tyres, the majority were running the mediums for their early laps.

Off the back of a points result last time out in Belgium, there seemed to be an issue for Pierre Gasly shortly into FP1, the French driver reporting “no power” in his Alpine before returning to the pits to have the problem investigated.

Norris set the pace during the opening segment of the session from Leclerc, with the other McLaren of Piastri – who claimed his first Grand Prix win at this circuit 12 months ago – following in third.

Practice 1 results

FORMULA 1 LENOVO HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

Norris' effort of 1m 17.631s had put him one second clear of Hamilton in P8 on the timesheets, leading the seven-time World Champion to ask his race engineer where he was losing time. The reply was that this was happening in Turns 5, 8 and 9.

The other Ferrari of Leclerc, meanwhile, displaced Norris at the top shortly afterwards – only for Norris to go even faster by becoming the first to dip below the 1m 16s barrier, the Briton pumping in a time of 1m 16.837s.

“The car doesn't feel good,” Hamilton reported as he returned to the garage towards the halfway point of the session amid a quiet spell out on track, with just the Racing Bulls and Gasly – whose earlier issue had seemingly been resolved – putting some mileage in.

Aron, meanwhile, saw his running come to a halt after heading out again, having pulled off the track with a technical issue on the Kick Sauber. The incident triggered the yellow flags and a Virtual Safety Car as the C45 was pushed through the nearby barriers.

As the session moved into its latter stages, focus for most switched to the soft tyre runs. Norris put in an eye-catching lap of 1m 16.052s, a whopping seven-tenths clear of previous pacesetter Leclerc. Piastri went fastest of all in the first sector, but ended the lap 0.142s adrift of his team mate.

Another try for Piastri moved him closer to the other McLaren, the gap dropping to just 0.019s. Amid a busy final 10 minutes – which saw several drivers experience lock-ups before most of the field switched to medium-shod runs – that time for Norris kept him on top from Piastri and Leclerc.

Isack Hadjar was a notable fourth for Racing Bulls, just ahead of Hamilton in fifth, while Haas' Ollie Bearman placed sixth. The Mercedes pair of Kimi Antonelli and George Russell – on a weekend in which the team are reverting to a previous suspension – were seventh and eighth, with Max Verstappen in the Red Bull and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll completing the top 10.

Alex Albon wound up in 11th for Williams, followed by Haas' Esteban Ocon (12th), Gasly (13th), Lawson (14th) and the other Williams of Carlos Sainz (15th).

Drugovich ended his return outing in P16, ahead of Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda in P17 and the Alpine of Franco Colapinto in P18. Gabriel Bortoleto – who spent the final moments of the session in the garage as his car remained on the stands – was P19 for Kick Sauber ahead of Aron, who managed just nine laps before stopping with a technical issue.

The drivers and teams will now reconvene in the paddock to examine their data and prepare for Friday's second Free Practice session, which is due to get underway at 1700 local time.

FP2 Highlights: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

Colapinto: 'We struggled with the balance, with the grip' around Hungaroring

As F1 gets set for the Hungarian Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more ahead of the race at the Hungaroring.

Formula 1 heads straight from Spa-Francorchamps to Budapest for the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend – the final race before the sport's summer break.

First and second practice will take place on Friday, August 1, followed by final practice and Qualifying on Saturday, August 2 and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, August 3.

• First Grand Prix – 1986
• Track Length – 4.381km
• Lap record – 1m 16.627s, Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes, 2020
• Most pole positions – Lewis Hamilton (9)
• Most wins – Lewis Hamilton (8)
• Trivia – The event has been the scene of several drivers' first F1 victories, including Oscar Piastri in 2024, Esteban Ocon in 2021, Jenson Button in 2006 and Fernando Alonso in 2003 (more on that below)
• Pole run to Turn 1 braking point – 476 metres
• Overtakes completed in 2024 – 65
• Safety Car probability – 25%*
• Virtual Safety Car probability – 25%*
• Pit stop time loss – 20.6 seconds

*From the last eight races in Hungary

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: Budapest feels like a small circuit when you're there but there's plenty that goes into it with 14 corners.

The first sector is basically two corners: a big braking zone at Turn 1, which is a relatively straightforward right-hander but quite bumpy in the braking area, so it can induce some front locking, before heading into Turn 2, which is slightly downhill.

The middle sector is one of those ones where you've got to find a rhythm because out of pretty much every corner you need to be positioned for the next corner coming through it. You go from Turn 4 into 6, then you get a tiny breather, but it carries you through the next sweeping section, building speed all the way.

In the final sector, sometimes the tyres are starting to overheat and you start to scramble around for a little bit of grip there. In the race, you've got to think about setting up your overtake coming out of Turn 14, the final corner, because that is your one chance to do something into Turn 1 and, if not, into Turn 2. If you don't get it done there, you're probably going to be following for the next lap.

I had some good battles here in GP2, and while it's not easy to overtake in Hungary, you can. The layout of the circuit lends itself to overtaking at Turn 2, particularly as you can go inside or outside, so it can be hard to defend. It's a nice one to have some battles at.

• 2024 – Lando Norris (McLaren)
• 2023 – Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)
• 2022 – George Russell (Mercedes)
• 2021 – Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)
• 2020 – Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)

• 2024 – Oscar Piastri (McLaren)
• 2023 – Max Verstappen (Red Bull)
• 2022 – Max Verstappen (Red Bull)
• 2021 – Esteban Ocon (Alpine)
• 2020 – Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)

“The trio of slick tyre compounds is the same as last year: C3 as hard, C4 as medium and C5 as soft,” reads Pirelli's pre-weekend preview.

“Up until last year, these would have been the softest tyres of all, but this year, the C6 was introduced. However, the new compound would be too extreme a choice for a track that exerts this level of energy density on the tyres for every lap.

“Although the actual loads are not that high in absolute terms, the fact that the lap is short means that it increases cumulatively and significantly with each lap.

“Another factor that plays its part is the high temperature that usually accompanies the Hungarian weekend, leading to predominantly thermal degradation, exacerbated by the very dark track surface. In fact, last year's race here saw the highest recorded track temperature of the season, at 58.6 Celcius.

“The most popular strategy [in 2024] was the two-stop, running various combinations of the C3 and C4. The medium performed best and 13 drivers chose it for the start. Of the remaining seven, four went with the soft and three with the hard.

“Yuki Tsunoda in the Racing Bulls was the only driver to get to the chequered flag having made just one stop, while some pitted three times, running a short final stint on the soft.

“The Aston Martin pair of Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll made two stops, using all three compounds, having gone their own way in terms of tyre management in free practice. The Canadian drove the longest stint (14 laps) on the soft.”

Lando Norris ate into McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri's championship lead via back-to-back victories in Austria and on home soil at Silverstone, but the Australian returned to the top step with a superb display of his own in the changeable Spa-Francorchamps conditions.

It means Piastri sits 16 points clear of Norris heading to the Hungaroring, where the former claimed his first Grand Prix win last year – but given the fine margins involved, either one of them could enter the upcoming summer break with the advantage.

Although McLaren can take plenty of confidence from their performance at the track some 12 months ago, and their generally imperious pace across the 2025 season so far, several rivals will be pushing to cause an upset when the weekend gets going.

Ferrari's update in Belgium last time out appeared to move their SF-25 in the right direction, with Charles Leclerc returning to the podium, while Lewis Hamilton can draw on his records of nine pole positions and eight race wins here.

Max Verstappen and Red Bull also have recent form in Hungary, having won the 2022 and 2023 races, but will the Dutchman and team mate Yuki Tsunoda (who showed signs of improvement at Spa) be able to get the RB21 working around the tight, twisty Budapest venue?

Elsewhere, Mercedes are looking for answers to some serious questions after a difficult run, with a tight midfield group all ready to take advantage of any ongoing issues for the Silver Arrows and bag some more valuable points.

There are so many iconic moments to choose from over the several decades of racing at the Hungaroring, but one particularly dramatic race – and landmark result – came during the 2006 season.

Starting back in 14th, Button excelled in the tricky wet/dry conditions to rise up the order and bring himself into contention, meaning he could capitalise when long-time leader Fernando Alonso lost a wheel nut and spun off.

After a hatful of podium finishes and several near-misses, it marked the first victory of Button's F1 career, the first for Honda as a constructor since John Surtees' win in Italy in 1967 and the first for a Honda engine since Gerhard Berger's triumph in Australia in 1992.

FP2 Highlights: 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix

Colapinto: 'We struggled with the balance, with the grip' around Hungaroring

Arriving into this weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix with a 16-point lead over team mate Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri is feeling confident in himself when it comes to the championship fight.

Oscar Piastri has admitted that he has “a lot of confidence” in himself when it comes to his chances of winning the World Championship, though the Australian also suggested “it's not going to be easy” amid close competition from team mate Lando Norris.

After Norris closed the gap by taking back-to-back victories in Austria and Great Britain, Piastri strengthened his lead in the standings by winning the Belgian Grand Prix last time out, meaning that he now holds a 16-point advantage over his fellow McLaren driver.

Asked ahead of this weekend's race in Hungary if he views the title fight as being just between himself and Norris by this point, Piastri responded: “I suppose so. The last few weekends it's been Lando and I.

“I expect our competition to still be strong and put up a good fight, especially at certain tracks through the rest of the year, but whether that comes from Max [Verstappen] or Ferrari or Mercedes or someone else, we never really know.

“I'm not too concerned about what happens in that, I'm just trying to win each race and extend the lead. I think clearly Lando and I are in the same car, which is the best, and he's naturally going to be the most competition.”

Piastri was then pushed on whether he feels confident enough that he will win the championship, to which the eight-time race winner answered: “I think I have a lot of confidence in myself that I can do it.

“Not every weekend has been perfect, but there's not many weekends in my whole life that have been perfect. I think just trying to put together a solid, consistent year is ultimately going to be an important thing.

“I think the pace in the last few weekends, especially Spa, I've been very confident in and I'm very proud of, and I think I'm more than capable of continuing that for the rest of the year. I'm confident that I can do it, but it's not going to be easy.”

In terms of whether being the fastest or making the fewest mistakes will count more in the title battle, Piastri conceded that “both ideally” are needed.

“You can make an argument for either one – you can be consistent, but if you're consistently coming second then that's not very useful for you, so you do need to have both,” he explained.

“At the level of the field and the level of my team mate, you need to bring your best, and evidently when you're pushing that hard there are going to be mistakes here and there, because it doesn't come without that risk.

“But you can't just afford to take things easy – you've got to try and be consistent, you need to push and you need to be quick, and then of course you try and execute as best as you can. You need both to win the championship – you can't just rely on one.”

This weekend sees Piastri return to the scene of his first Grand Prix victory 12 months ago, a race that saw him lead home a McLaren 1-2 after Norris belatedly handed back the lead following a change in positions during the pit stop phase.

Asked if he expects the 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix to once again be a fight between himself and Norris, Piastri reflected: “I don't know. Hungary has been historically a good track for us as a team in the two years that I've been with the team, so I expect us to be strong again this weekend.

“But there's been tracks this year where we thought we would be very strong against our competition and they were closer than we thought, and there's been other tracks where we thought our competition would be very close and actually the gap was bigger than we thought.

“You never know, but I expect us to still be at the front.”

And while last year's event may have been a slightly tricky moment for the squad in terms of executing that team order, Piastri believes that it also showed the positive dynamic within McLaren, as well as between himself and Norris.

“It underlined the good nature in the team,” said Piastri. “It was obviously a slightly awkward situation, but I think it kind of highlighted that we will do the right thing in all circumstances, or ideally all circumstances when we're on track.

“I think it just showed the trust that we have with the team and with each other as well, that things will be put the right way.”

THR is also debuting new stills from Richard Linklater's homage to 'Breathless' and the French New Wave, which premiered in May at the Cannes Film Festival, where it received rave reviews.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


Nouvelle Vague, Richard Linklater's loving homage to Jean Luc-Godard's 1960 film Breathless and the French New Wave, which received a 10-minute standing ovation and rave reviews following its world premiere at May's Cannes Film Festival, will be released in American theaters on Oct. 31 and play on big screens for two weeks before dropping on Netflix on Nov. 14, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.


	When Netflix acquired Nouvelle Vague's U.S. rights shortly after Cannes, some reacted with surprise and dismay that a movie shot on film and about cinema would end up with a streamer. But the company is planning a robust theatrical release that will include not only screens in New York (where, appropriately enough, it owns the historic Paris Theater) and LA, but in all of the top 10 U.S. markets.

	Additionally, THR can report that the largely French-language film will be pushed across all categories. In my humble opinion, it could well end up a finalist for best picture, a category in which non-English-language films have landed many noms in recent years (including France's Netflix-distributed Emilia Pérez earlier this year); best director (Linklater is a beloved auteur, but his only nom in the category came for 2014's Boyhood); and screenplay (it has yet to be determined if Holly Gent, Laetitia Masson and Vincent Palmo Jr.'s script will be classified as adapted or original).

	











	Meanwhile, Zoey Deutch, who is luminous as Breathless star Jean Seberg, will be campaigned in the supporting actress race, while French actors Guillaume Marbeck and Aubry Dullin, who eerily resemble the characters they play — Godard and Breathless breakout Jean-Paul Belmondo — will be pushed for lead actor and supporting actor, respectively.


	The big question moving forward is whether or not France will select Nouvelle Vague as its entry for the best international feature Oscar competition. Each country's submission is determined by a selection committee comprised mostly of people associated with that country's film industry, who must attest that “creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.”


	The key word is “largely.” In the case of Nouvelle Vague, Linklater and Deutch are American, but almost everyone else who worked in front of or behind the camera is French, including the film's two producers, Laurent Pétin and Michèle Pétin, so the film is certainly eligible. Plus, its financing came from France; it was shot in France; it premiered in France; and it is an out-and-out celebration of French cinema.


	Some selection committees are hesitant to submit a film directed by someone born outside of their country's borders, feeling that doing so would be a missed opportunity to highlight homegrown talent. But other countries enter whichever film they think offers them the best shot at actually landing an Oscar nom. For instance, Japan put forward — and landed a nom in 2024 for — German filmmaker Wim Wenders' Perfect Days. Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Holland has had films entered by Poland, West Germany and the Czech Republic. And twice in the last decade, France itself submitted films by non-French filmmakers: Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's Elle in 2016 and Italian filmmaker Filippo Neneghetti's Two of Us in 2020.

	











	France, however, has had bruising experiences with its last two submissions. In 2024, it entered The Taste of Things instead of Anatomy of a Fall; ultimately, the former was not nominated, while the latter went on to five other noms (best picture, director, original screenplay, actress and film editing), suggesting that it almost certainly would have been nominated for — and might have even won — best international feature had it been entered. And in 2025, its submission Emilia Pérez looked certain to bring the country its first win in the category since Indochine prevailed in 1993, but its prospects imploded shortly before the final round of voting, thanks to the exposure of problematic social media posts from its principal star, and it ultimately lost.


	Again, Emilia Pérez was handled by Netflix, so you can be sure that the company is hungry for another chance to get a French film across the finish line in the best international feature Oscar race. (In just the last six years, it backed two films from other countries that went on to win that prize, Mexico's Roma in 2019 and Germany's All Quiet on the Western Front in 2023.) But the decision about whether or not it will have that opportunity is ultimately France's, or at least the French selection committee's.


	Given that no other French film has emerged this year, so far, that would appear to offer the nation a better shot than Nouvelle Vague at landing a best international feature Oscar nom, and possibly even a win, it will be very interesting to see how France's selection committee plays it cards.

The 21-year-old K-pop star, formerly known as Seunghan, speaks with THR about his highly anticipated solo debut following his exit from Riize: ""I hope everyone can look at me from a fresh perspective."" 


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	“I'm very excited,” K-pop star XngHan tells The Hollywood Reporter about his solo debut. “My heart swoons.”


	The 21-year-old, officially making his solo debut today with his artist project XngHan and Xoul, is equal parts excited and optimistic on a Zoom call from his label SM Entertainment's Seoul headquarters as he speaks of his new chapter as a soloist. 




	XngHan's debut has been highly anticipated by much of the K-pop community. Late last year, it was announced that the K-pop star, who previously went by his name Seunghan, would be leaving the boy group Riize, just days after the news of his return from a lengthy hiatus. When it was later announced that he'd be debuting as a soloist, XngHan received genuine well wishes from fans across various K-pop fandoms – somewhat of a rarity in online music spaces these days.

	XngHan's first single, “Waste No Time,” is a pitch-perfect choice for his debut track. As the singer puts it, the “refreshing” summer song talks of not wasting any time and spreading his “boundless wings” – perhaps a perfect parallel to XngHan himself, who seems eager to tackle this new chapter head-on. The single is accompanied by a B-Side, “Heavenly Blue,” is similarly catchy and the perfect soundtrack for a sunny summer day. XngHan contributed to writing lyrics and choreographing for the song.

	Below, the XngHan speaks with THR about “Waste No Time” and “Heavenly Blue,” his exit from Riize and what his hopes for the future.


I think there are a lot of people who are eager to hear how you're doing these days. How are you feeling ahead of your debut?


	I made sure that I worked out. I've been practicing my dance skills and also my vocals, so that I can keep everything rolling and going. My solo debut is just around the corner, so I'm very excited. My heart swoons.


You seem very happy. To talk about your future, I think we need to talk a bit about the past. How are you feeling, looking back on what I assume has been an at times difficult year? How do you feel looking ahead?


	I used that time to look back on myself. I think it was a time given to me for more self-improvement, so I was really using that time to make sure that I got better at stuff. I think it was a time where I was trying to get ready for a new start, so I think all the things I learned along the way are definitely going to be something that I can use going forward as a fuel, so I'm very excited and looking forward to my debut as a soloist.


I think there are a lot of people who are really excited to see you debut and have been waiting for it since your time with Riize. Although you're no longer with Riize, you worked and trained alongside them. Do you have any wishes for them? But also what hopes do you have for yourself as a soloist?












	I know that Riize is doing so well, and] I'm rooting for them as a fellow artist. I hope they stay healthy and well. [Since] I'm also preparing my new launch as a soloist, I hope people stay tuned [for my debut]. I'm really going to pour my heart and soul into this.


Why was it so important for you to change your stage name? Do you see this as opening a new chapter for you?


	Yeah, it's exactly as you said. I think it's a new chapter for me, a new challenge for me, and I'm very much looking forward to it. The reason why I wanted to include the letter X is because it symbolizes infinite potentials, [an] infinity of possibilities. It's also the unknown variable when it comes to mathematical formulas. I think it symbolizes that I am now opening up the doors to all the different potentials and possibilities that I could dig into. I wanted to use this letter X to show that. I think with this new artist brand, I can show you different facets of myself.


How has your training been? What do you feel like you've been focusing on in terms of practicing for your debut “Waste No Time” the most?


	I guess the focus in training for this single was that it had to be fun. It's a very vibing kind of song, so I wanted to give it that refreshing mood and vibe. Especially since it's a summer song. Actually, the good thing was that it wasn't very challenging to get ready for these songs. It was actually a very fun experience for me, especially since I got to work together with Xoul, the dance crew comprised of two people. It was really fun. It was almost like we were just playing around, but we were making something and creating something. I felt very much at ease preparing for the songs.

	











Can you tell me about your collaboration with Xoul? Do you find yourself feeling a little more comfortable working alongside them, given you've previously worked in a group setting?


	Yeah, it's definitely a lot more comfortable [especially] because our interests align. These are two professional dancers, so all three of us are bonded by our love and passion for dance. We would be working [on choreography], but we'd also be having a lot of fun dancing. It just made me feel so comfortable and at home working together with them.


How did this concept that you would have a dance crew with you come about? Why did you feel it made the most sense for you right now?


	I thought long and hard about with whom I should collaborate, and I think my top priority was to bring to the table something new, something refreshing, something people haven't seen before. I myself love trying new things and that's how we got to brainstorming ideas. Then I thought my forte is definitely performance, so why don't I start from there and gather a group of professional dancers, and that's how I gathered my first batch of Xoul.


How do you envision this looking like for you going forward in the future?


	One of the ideas that I have in mind… I've always had this dream of creating a band, so that could be one idea. But right now I'm going to really focus on the Xoul dancers. We're just going to nail the performances.


	I have a lot of time ahead of me, and I think I have a lot of potential, a lot of possibilities. I'm going to open it up to all the different things that I could do.

	











Do you feel you've had any big changes in the way you work? Did you realize any new strengths during your debut preparation?


	When I was working on this debut, there's the B-side track called “Heavenly Blue,” and I contributed to writing the lyrics for the song. I also created the choreography together with Xoul. It was my first time trying to pen the words of my own song, and I realized that I'm actually pretty good at it. I think I do have a little bit of a forte in writing [lyrics].


I think for any soloist, it's a bit daunting, having to figure out who you'll be as a singer. What was that process like for you?


	I'd like to be a soloist who appears the same on and off stage. I changed the S in my name to an X, but it's actually not that different sonically because it's still Seunghan. I want to be a soloist who can really be his true self on stage and show his true colors and essence. That's what I'm trying to go for.


“Waste No Time” is so much fun and a great debut single. Why did you feel like it was the right fit?


	The genre of the track is electronic dance, which incorporates a wide range of sounds. That's something I liked about the song, and it was in line with the kind of concept that I wanted to go with. When I thought about performance, I thought this was a song that could really mesh well with the performance that I can show on stage. When I heard the demo of the song, I knew right away that this was the right one. From the very beginning, I really wanted this song to be my debut track.

	











Can you tell me a bit about working on choreography for this project and what that experience was like?


	To be honest, it was quite challenging in the beginning because it was my first time and [Xoul's] first time collaborating. We all had our own style, so it was very hard to come to a consensus in the beginning. But I realized that I was the one who had to lead the debate, so I orchestrated [the process] between us three, and they were very happy to give me a lot of ideas. I was happy to share my ideas, even the very bizarre ones. We had a lot of fun sharing and tossing around ideas and coming up with the choreography.


To look ahead – you're at a new starting line, which can be nerve-wrecking but at the same time, very exciting. What are you hoping the future looks like for you as a soloist? What are your aspirations for the year ahead?


	Maybe it's a little early to say this, but my ultimate dream and goal is to drop an album where I creatively contributed in all the different aspects of all the tracks, including the choreography and writing the lyrics and the composition of the songs. That's my ultimate dream. [Also] to have that album drop and perform it live and receive the love and support of the fans. That's my dream.


As an artist, people's perception of you is often out of your control, but you're a human being and an artist. You've put a great deal of work into this debut and likely have an idea of how you want people to feel. How are you hoping to be viewed as an artist?












	I just hope that when fans watch my performance and see me performing live, they get so excited and happy. They can't help but dance. That's what I want the fans to view me as. When I'm on stage, I want to be remembered as an artist who just lights the stage on fire and nails every performance.


Speaking of fans, do you have a message to the fans who have been eagerly awaiting your debut and supporting you from afar for a while now?


	Thank you for the long wait. Because the wait was so long, I created music that was worth the wait. I hope you stay tuned and really enjoy the music. I'm really going to pour my heart and soul into the promotion for this album. I hope you love the music and love me too.


I'd like to give you the chance to close a chapter for yourself. Is there anything you'd like to add about your exit from Riize and about your debut?


	[My solo debut is] a new beginning for me, so I hope everyone can look at me from a fresh perspective. I'm going to try my hardest to burn the soloist XngHan into your brain. I'm going to work hard to do that.

If you haven't seen the headlines by now, last week's episode of the 'Sex and the City' revival series broke up the beloved franchise couple.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


[This story contains spoilers from the 10th episode of And Just Like That season three, “Better Than Sex.”]


	It's true: Carrie and Aidan are over.




	Last week's episode of And Just Like That delivered the Sex and the City sequel series' biggest breakup yet when Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Aidan (John Corbett) mutually decided to end their long-distance romance, as it was revealed that Aidan still couldn't get over Carrie cheating on him with the late Big (Chris Noth) more than 20 years ago.

					How Did 'And Just Like That' Become So Divisive?		
			









	Julie Rottenberg and Elisa Zuritsky, the episode's writers who are veteran scribes for the franchise, told The Hollywood Reporter last week that the emotional hour closes the chapter on Carrie's love story with Aidan, and they promised a significant shift ahead for the series as it was entering its final three episodes of this buzzy third season.

	











	“Frankly, I don't think any of us were ready for Carrie to ride off in the sunset with anyone, yet,” said Zuritsky about Aidan not being Carrie's ever after. 


	So, what now for Carrie?


	In this week's 10th episode, “Better Than Sex,” Carrie struggles with her latent attraction to her sexy writer-neighbor Duncan (Jonathan Cake), worrying to Charlotte (Kristin Davis) if she is the only one who isn't admitting to their sexual tension (Aidan surely picked up on it). Ultimately, Carrie makes a leap and spends the night with Duncan, but the show makes it clear that this is a fling. Duncan has finished his book and is leaving town, committed to saying goodbye to his biggest writing distraction: Carrie.


	At the beginning of the season Michael Patrick King, the showrunner/writer, told THR that Carrie's fiction novel — which she has been narrating in voiceover throughout the season — was essentially a stand-in for Carrie's life.

	











	“The reason Carrie's writing a fiction novel set in the past this season is because she's afraid to talk about her feelings in the present because they're so fragile, confusing and private,” he explained. “In order for her to be able to do that thing that writers do, which is explore ideas without feeling guilty, she put the character in the past and didn't even name her Carrie, which she's done in all her other writing. She calls her ‘the woman.'”


	If we heed King's words, we could take a page out of The Woman's novel in order to glean where And Just Like That is going next for its final two episodes of the season.


	When asked by Duncan how Carrie will end her novel, Carrie says, in her signature wit, “Well, she'll die of loneliness, of course…or smallpox.”


	But by the end of the conversation — which takes place postcoital as the pair are wrapped up in Duncan's sheets — Carrie seems inspired by a plea from Duncan that she let her protagonist live. In the final scene of the episode, Carrie reads from her book in voiceover, “The woman sat in her garden. Even though summer had come and now gone, she could feel the warmth of its lingering touch on her face and body. How wonderful. How wonderful. How wonderful.”


	Rottenberg and Zuritsky had told THR that Carrie being on her own “is always an exciting and, in some ways, daunting challenge,” with Zuritsky saying that the season post-Aidan “certainly felt like a shift.”


	What does And Just Like That look like after both Aidan and Duncan? Rottenberg had teased in three words: “Surprise, fun and freedom.”

	











Update note: The following morning after this episode released, And Just Like That announced that the series is ending with the forthcoming season finale, making the third season the final one for the series. See Michael Patrick King's statement.


	And Just Like That releases new episodes Thursdays at 6 p.m. PT / 9 p.m. ET on HBO Max.

The superstar released the music video for her latest single Friday morning, her first new music since releasing ""The Giver"" back in March. 


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


Chappell Roan dropped the music video for her long-awaited single “The Subway” on Friday, just hours after she dropped the song on Thursday night, and over a year after she first performed the single during her viral Governors Ball concert in June of 2024.


	“I'm very proud of this song & what a journey she has been on,” Roan wrote on her Instagram Thursday after the song dropped. “I first played it at gov ball when I was painted green as lady liberty and in the past have played new songs live to feel them out.”




	The video, shot in New York, was directed by Amber Grace Johnson and shot on 35mm film, depicting Roan making her way through the city in cartoonishly long wigs and loathing about a broken heart on the subway.

	“Obviously not knowing this really chaotic year would follow the performance, it didn't really leave me the time to build the world the song deserved,” Roan wrote. “But finally we are here. I def ripped my hair out trying to figure out the puzzle of how this song should feel musically and visually and emotionally, luckily there are some to spare. Thank you for sticking it out for a whole year. It was worth it to make sure everything was absolutely right.”


	“The Subway” comes four months after Roan had dropped her country-tinged “The Giver” back in March. Fans had been waiting on that song for months after she debuted it on Saturday Night Live, and she teased the song with an extensive marketing campaign that included billboards in cities around the U.S. “The Giver” debuted at Number 5 on The Hot 100 and marked her first-ever number one on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. 

	











	With “The Subway” out, Roan will be performing a slate of pop-up shows in New York, L.A., and Kansas City later this fall.

The 2007 buddy comedy was one of Franco's first onscreen roles.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Dave Franco is sharing how his Superbad role turned into one of his most embarrassing moments, on- and offscreen, and actually pushed him to keep auditioning.


	In the 2007 buddy comedy starring Jonah Hill and Michael Cera, Franco makes a small appearance as Greg the Soccer Player, one of his first onscreen roles. In one of his scenes, Hill's Seth calls out his character for peeing his pants years prior.




	Not only was it an embarrassing scene, Franco revealed during a recent appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast, but it also led to a lot of embarrassing fan interactions in public, with people quoting the lines.

	“I had a journey with that scene in and of itself, where I only have a few lines in this movie, but the movie was so big that people did recognize me on the street,” the Together actor explained to host Alex Cooper. “And they were yelling at me, ‘Why don't you go piss your pants again?'”




			Related Video		







	However, Franco leveraged those awkward moments as motivation to keep auditioning so that his legacy as an actor wouldn't be that one Superbad scene. “I quickly realized, ‘I gotta keep working and get more jobs, so I'm not piss boy for the rest of my life,'” the actor said.


	Franco went on to star in dozens more films, including 21 Jump Street, Now You See Me, Neighbors, Now You See Me 2, Nerve, Love Lies Bleeding and, most recently, Together, alongside his wife, Alison Brie.

	











Superbad follows two co-dependent high school seniors who are forced to deal with separation anxiety after their plan to stage a booze-soaked party goes awry.

The song comes more than a year after she first premiered it at Gov Ball 2024.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	Stand clear of the closing doors, please. Chappell Roan‘s “The Subway” has finally pulled into the platform.


	After more than a year since she debuted the track at her 2024 Governor's Ball set — for which she was in full green body paint for Statue of Liberty cosplay — “The Subway” finally dropped on streaming services Thursday (July 31). Fans are well-acquainted with the song at this point, as the pop star often plays it at her live shows, but now, they'll have an official studio recording to listen to at last.


	On the lovelorn ballad about experiencing heartache in New York City, Roan eagerly awaits the day she'll have finally moved on from her ex. “It's just another day/ And it's not over 'til it's over,” she sings before belting cathartically on the outro: “She's got, she's got a way/ She's got a way, she's got a way.”

	“The Subway” comes a few months after Roan dropped “The Giver,” which reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. Before that came breakout single “Good Luck, Babe!,” which catapulted the Missouri native to superstar status last year following the release of debut album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.


			Trending on Billboard		







	Roan has since hinted that she's gearing up to start work on her sophomore effort, but not before she plays a string of pop-up shows in Los Angeles, Kansas City and New York City. “I love these three cities so much + wanted the chance to do something special before going away to write the next album,” she wrote on Instagram in July. “I truly cannot wait to see you.”

The vocalist hasn't dropped a pop song in years.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Demi Lovato is back in the mainstream music game, with the star's first pop song in three years, “Fast,” released today (Aug. 1).


	Over a club-ready, EDM-tinged beat, Lovato returns to the form of past Billboard Hot 100 hits such as “Cool for the Summer” and “Really Don't Care” on “Fast,” singing, “I wanna go fast/ I wanna go hard/ I wanna go anywhere, anywhere you are.”


	The track arrives after weeks of the musician teasing a return to pop music years after holding a “funeral” for her songs in the genre. Since 2022, Lovato has strictly released rock music, starting with 2022 album Holy Fvck and followed by Revamped, a compilation of the musician's past pop hits reimagined as rock anthems.

	











	According to a recent report from Rolling Stone, “Fast” is just the precursor for a full album of new pop music Lovato is preparing. The publication says that the vocalist is readying a “celebratory dance-pop” album informed by the singer's romance with husband Jordan “Jutes” Lutes.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The publication also spoke to their producer on the upcoming project, Zhone, who said, “This album is about letting inhibitions go, and we had so much fun making this music!”


	To promote her pop homecoming, Lovato also recently revisited another important piece of the past: The Bigg Chill, a.k.a. the frozen yogurt shop the Camp Rock alum previously visited in 2021 and made headlines for slamming as “toxic” because of its calorie-count displays. The singer apologized for slamming the store at the time, but now amends have truly been made with Lovato posting a video of their dessert run and writing, “love you bigg chill.”

Streaming growth hit UMG's target, foreign exchange was a big factor and superfan streaming tiers remain frustratingly out of reach (for now).


													By
												

	Glenn Peoples



Universal Music Group (UMG) reported strong streaming and publishing growth on Thursday (July 31), with total revenue reaching 2.98 billion euros ($3.38 billion), up 4.5% in constant currency (which excludes losses from foreign currency changes). That was less than half the first quarter's growth rate of 9.5%, and some parts of UMG's business — namely physical music and merchandise — didn't compare well to the prior-year quarter. 


	Here are some key takeaways from UMG's second quarter earnings release and a conference call with executives. 




			Trending on Billboard		







Streaming Growth Hit the Target 


	Streaming growth is the financial metric that tends to attract the most attention in earnings results, and for good reason. Streaming accounted for about 70% of UMG's recorded music revenue in the second quarter, and subscription revenue is the single most important determinant of the health of the music business. 


	UMG's recorded music division maintained strong subscription growth of 8.5% (in constant currency) in the second quarter, well within its target 8% to 10% range and comparable to the 9.3% growth rate in the first quarter (also in constant currency). The 8.5% growth also compares well to 2024's quarterly subscription growth rates of, in order, 12.5%, 6.9%, 8.2% and 9.0% (all in constant currency). 


	It's important to note that UMG's subscription results don't reflect its latest licensing deals with Spotify and Amazon, COO Boyd Muir said during UMG's earnings call on Thursday (July 31), which allow UMG to influence price increases through its setting of wholesale rates. In the second quarter, growth came mostly from an increase in the number of subscribers, while price increases played a smaller role, according to Muir. 


	Ad-supported streaming revenue improved 9.1% in constant currency, although as reported (which takes foreign exchange into account), the quarterly numbers haven't improved much recently. From broadcast radio to satellite radio and streaming, advertising revenues have disappointed in recent quarters. Spotify said as much on Tuesday (July 29): “We've simply been moving too slowly,” CEO Daniel Ek said of Spotify's advertising business during the company's earnings call. 


	UMG's publishing division doesn't break out subscription revenue, but its digital revenue, which includes all streaming income, jumped 16.2% to 351 million euros ($398 million) and accounted for 62% of total publishing revenue. 


Foreign exchange made the numbers look worse 


	UMG's total revenue in the second quarter grew 4.5% in constant currency but just 1.6% as reported. Billboard's article on UMG's earnings went to lengths to differentiate between “as reported” and “in constant currency” results. That's because looking only at numbers as reported would give the reader a warped sense of UMG's performance. By converting results to constant currency, UMG removed the effects of a weakened U.S. dollar. 


	Thanks to the uncertainties created by President Trump's tariff policies and Trump's criticism of the U.S. Federal Reserve, it's been a rough year for the dollar. In 2025, the euro has lost 9.3% of its value against the dollar and was once down 12.3%. Those changes add nuance to financial results for companies such as UMG, which reports in euros and receives a large portion of its business from the U.S. 


	Still, while a 4.5% growth rate beats 1.6%, it was less than half the 9.5% growth in the previous quarter and the 9.6% growth in the second quarter of 2024. 


Superfan products are delayed, but they're coming 


	Labels want to target superfans, but other than Tencent Music Entertainment, streaming services have yet to launch tiers aimed at those high-value customers. Alex Norström, Spotify's chief business officer, explained the wait on Tuesday when he mentioned the “very high value standards” Spotify has for new products. “We're making progress for sure, but it's taking time,” he said. 


	The topic also came up during UMG's earnings call, and executives provided a similar message. “Getting the product right is more important to us than launching it too early,” said CEO Lucian Grainge, while Michael Nash, executive vp of digital strategy, said that UMG is “encouraged” by its conversations with streaming services and “deeply engaged with all of our key partners, including Spotify.” But each company is going to move at its own pace. “These partners have product roadmaps and business development requirements around execution, which impact their timing,” Nash added. 


	Superfan tiers have become a hot topic because they could be a boost for both streaming services and rights holders. UMG's internal research suggests that 20% of subscribers would upgrade to a superfan tier. And short of constant price increases for all customers, using superfan tiers to generate more revenue from a subset of subscribers is a feasible way to support the revenue growth that companies and investors want to see. 


UMG's Downtown acquisition “will pass” the European Commission review 


	Grainge sounded confident that UMG's acquisition of Downtown Music Holdings will receive a green light from European Commission regulators, who are currently reviewing the deal. The way Grainge and UMG see it, UMG's bid for Downtown is fundamentally different from its 2012 acquisition of EMI Music's recorded music division, which reduced the number of major label groups from four to three. “Because the combined company will help support the growth and success of independent labels, and there are artists everywhere in what is a very highly competitive artist services space with more than 100 companies, we remain confident that the transaction will pass that review and will be completed before the end of the year,” Grainge said.

Metro Boomin dropped some heat on Friday (Aug. 1) with his A Futuristic Summa mixtape.


	He released the first single, “Slide” with Roscoe Dash, on YouTube on the Fourth of July. The hip-hop superproducer's MySpace-themed website revealed 23 tracks would be featured on A Futuristic Summa, which is hosted by renowned Atlanta DJ/producer DJ Spinz. Outside of Dash, Quavo, Young Dro, 2 Chainz, Lil Baby, Future, T.I., Waka Flocka Flame, Gucci Mane, Young Thug and more were previously revealed as features.


	He also echoed Tyler, the Creator's sentiments about wanting people to dance again without the pressure of being perceived behind screens. “PUT THE PHONES DOWN TOO!!!!! DANCE AGAIN!! PARTY AGAIN!! HAVE FUN AGAIN!!!!” Metro wrote on X on Wednesday (July 30).

	











	The Atlanta-bred hitmaker has been busy this year helming tracks on other artists' Billboard 200-topping albums, including The Weeknd's Hurry Up Tomorrow, Playboi Carti's MUSIC and JACKBOYS' second album. He also made a small cameo during the nightclub scene in The Weeknd's first feature film that shares the same name of his latest album.




			Trending on Billboard		







A Futuristic Summa arrives one year after Metro and Future's chart-topping LPs We Don't Trust You and We Still Don't Trust You. The former scored a Grammy nod for best rap album, while the title track for the latter, featuring The Weeknd, earned a nomination for best melodic rap performance. “Like That” with Kendrick Lamar from We Don't Trust You was also nominated for best rap song and best rap performance.

	And just like that, And Just Like That… is coming to an end on HBO Max.


	The show will wrap up its expanded 12-episode third season, which is currently airing, with a two-part finale. Showrunner Michael Patrick King notified cast of the decision Thursday, per our sources.


	“And just like that… the ongoing storytelling of the Sex and the City universe is coming to an end,” said King in a statement released Friday morning. “While I was writing the last episode of And Just Like That… season 3, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop. Along with Sarah Jessica Parker, Casey Bloys and Sarah Aubrey, we decided to end the popular series this year with a two-part finale and extended the original series order from 10 episodes to 12. SJP and I held off announcing the news until now because we didn't want the word ‘final' to overshadow the fun of watching the season. It's with great gratitude we thank all the viewers who have let these characters into their homes and their hearts over these many years.”Premiering in December 2021, And Just Like That… is a sequel to the iconic HBO series Sex and the City created by Darren Star. It reunited gal pals Carrie Bradshaw (Parker), Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon), and Charlotte York (Kristin Davis) for a series of midlife romantic adventures in New York City.

			Watch on Deadline		







	The show's first season saw protagonist Carrie navigating life after the sudden death of her husband, Mr. Big (Chris Noth), while Miranda dealt with an identity crisis, including a relationship with non-binary comedian Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez), and Charlotte embraced motherhood. In Season 2, premiering in 2023, Carrie rekindled her romance with former fiancé Aidan (John Corbett), Miranda deepened her connection with Che, and Charlotte faced challenges with family. This season, meanwhile, Carrie moves on from Aidan as Miranda explores new relationships and Charlotte continues to juggle motherhood and career.


	While And Just Like That… started strong in terms of new HBO Max signups as well as ratings, with a premiere ranking among the top 10 in HBO Max's history, viewership has waned over time. The Season 3 premiere was watched by 429,000 households, per Samba TV, down from 463,000 in Season 2.

	











	The series also has generated a lot of media attention — both positive and negative — over its run. In the end, the decision to end the series is believed to have been largely creative after fans already had gotten their update on Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte and storytelling no longer felt as urgent as it once did.

And Just Like That… was developed by King, who exec produced alongside John Melfi, Parker, Davis, Nixon, Julie Rottenberg and Elisa Zuritsky. The original HBO series adapted the book of the same name by Candace Bushnell.


	Others in the cast of the sequel series' final season include Mehcad Brooks, Jonathan Cake, Logan Marshall-Green, Sebastian Pigazzi, Dolly Wells, Sarita Choudhury, Nicole Ari Parker, David Eigenberg, Evan Handler, Christopher Jackson, Niall Cunningham, Cathy Ang and Alexa Swinton.

Id like to argue with you and have been watching the run but oof…it probably really is a good time for them to just stop

And just like that… nobody watched.

This is a wonderful place to stop. An even better place would have been right before the first episode.

Can she wake up in the finale and be like “it was all a dream…”

Sorry to see the show go but HBO Max did it justice

	Production cost on Bad Guys 2 is $80M net, $10M higher than the first movie, which repped a rebound for the Covid box office, that pic ultimately minting $97.4M domestic and $252.4M worldwide. The sequel's Rotten Tomatoes critics score is 85% fresh, which is 3 points under the 88% certified fresh of the first film.

	











	Paramount, on the precipice of its merger with Skydance, is trying to bring the big-screen comedy back to life with its reboot of 1980s classic The Naked Gun, that Liam Neeson-Pamela Anderson movie doing $1.6M last night from shows that started at 7 p.m. Comedy comps are hard, but The Naked Gun isn't that far from Sony's R-rated Jennifer Lawrence movie No Hard Feelings, which did $2.15M on its Thursday (4 p.m. start-time) previews in 2023 and turned into a $6.3M Friday and $15M 3-day at 3,344 sites. That's what hoped for here on this redo directed by Akiva Schaffer and produced by Seth MacFarlane. Net production cost is $42M.

The Naked Gun had a good night in PostTrak exits with 4½ stars and a 73% definite recommend. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film won over critics, a near-impossible feat when it comes to comedy, at 90% certified fresh with an 87% audience score.

	











	Neon's wide release of the Dave Franco-Alison Brie romantic horror movie Together grossed $1.35M in its second day at the box office for a running cume of $4M. The forecast is $8M-$10M over five days for the movie, which Neon snapped up for $16M out of Sundance. The last five-day genre movie that comes to mind is A24's Midsommar, and Together, which has higher Rotten Tomatoes critics and audience scores (91% critics/79% audience to Midsommar‘s 83% critics/63% audience) is currently $300K behind that 2019 Ari Aster film. As we told you Thursday, Together gets a C+ CinemaScore, same grade as Midsommar.


	It's all about the second weekend of Marvel Studios' The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which ends the week with $158.3M after an estimated $7.4M Thursday, -14% from Wednesday. The second-frame outlook is $45M-$47M for the net $200M-budgeted movie, which is around a 61% decline. The Matt Shakman-directed reboot keeps all the premium screens.


	Gowtam Tinnanuri's Kingdom opened Thursday, making $1.1M at 360 locations. The pic follows an undercover cop who is plunged into Sri Lanka on a covert mission to dismantle a powerful syndicate. He learns the mastermind is his estranged brother, forcing him to confront family loyalty, and the moral cost of duty.


	Here's the top 5:


	1.) The Fantastic Four: First Steps (Dis) 4,125 theaters, Thu $7.4M (-14% from Wed), Week $158.3M/Wk 1

Naked Gun's previews started later than most movies (7pm) it seems decently well liked and films in August tend to stay around longer. So, a 15-20 mil opening at least would be a win.

45-47 would seem on the optimistic side for FF after those weekdays. Same Thursday to weekend multiple as Superman's and JWR's second weekends would put it at 38-40M.

I want Naked Gun to do well. We need more broad comedy like this. Everyone can just laugh together. I'm seeing it next weekend though.

Naked Gun will have a lot of walk up business this weekend.

I think audience would LOVE Naked Gun, but I just don't see people paying to go see it, which sucks, but I think it has a huge run on streaming. I think the general audience score/awareness is no longer connected to whether they will pay to see it in theatres. They can still love the concept of a movie, and want to see it- but have been trained to watch at home

It seems like it might. Between skewing older and what appears to be really good audience word of mouth. It might leg out too in August if people need a good comedy and Freakier Friday doesn't take all the oxygen.

The difference between The Naked Gun and No Hard Feelings is The Naked Gun previews started late at 7 pm. So you shouldn't compare these two.

	The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is shutting down its operations after the loss of federal funding, marking the end of almost six decades as the entity that distributed grants to public media, PBS and NPR.


	The CPB informed employees on Friday that the majority of staff positions will end on Sept. 30, with a small transition team in place through January, 2026. The CPB has around 100 employees.


Patricia Harrison, the president and CEO of CPB, said in a statement on Friday, “Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations. CPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care.”

					Donald Trump Slaps Canada With 35% Tariffs As August 1 Deadline Passes - Update		
			








	The announcement follows the GOP's move to rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding already allocated to the CPB for the next two fiscal years. This week, Senate Republicans advanced a funding bill that also included no money for public media, dashing hopes that there would be at least some restoration of funding.




			Watch on Deadline		







	President Donald Trump had called on lawmakers to roll back funding for CPB, calling the programming of PBS and NPR biased, part of his broader attacks on traditional media.


	The CPB has noted that the majority of its funding, about 70%, goes to local stations, not the national outlets. Advocates also have pointed to polling showing high levels of public trust in public media.

	











	Harrison said in her statement, “Public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country. We are deeply grateful to our partners across the system for their resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication to serving the American people.”


	Members of the CPB board of directors, including Sony's Tom Rothman, have recently stepped down. In the spring, Trump sought to remove board members Rothman, Laura Ross and Diane Kaplan. The CPB sued to block the move, but that litigation now appears moot with the corporation ending its operations.


	Congress created the CPB in 1967 as a private non-profit to shepherd federal money to stations and other public media outlets. The idea was to shield the entity from political interference. With an advanced appropriations cycle, the CPB also helped give stations certainty in their budgets. With the loss of federal funding, stations are now scrambling to make up for the loss of funds, and advocates have warned that some are at risk of closure. According to an analysis from advisory firm Public Media Company, about 100 TV and radio stations in rural areas are threatened, per The New York Times.


	CPB has survived past funding battles, including during Trump's first term. His White House sought to zero out funding in their proposed budgets, but a bipartisan group of lawmakers blocked any such effort.


	This time around, the claw back of funding was part of a package of $9 billion in rescissions that also included support for foreign aid and health care. Trump threatened to withhold support for any lawmaker who voted against the clawback of funding. Only a handful of Republicans voted against the rescissions package, while even some past strident supporters of public media, like Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK) and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) voted to end the funding.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Smithsonian sweeps pesky impeachment history out of impeachment history display","https://www.avclub.com/smithsonian-removes-trump-impeachment-from-museum-display","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 02:09:00 GMT","

In 2006, Stephen Colbert—brutally in-character, and standing about six feet from the U.S. President he was openly mocking—remarked that reality should sometimes be disregarded on account of its “well-known liberal bias.” The same thought may, presumably, also be applied to history, when a sober recitation of things that actually happened, and which everybody quite clearly remembers, gets in the way of prevailing political winds. For instance: The Washington Post reports today that a display at the Smithsonian Institute, focused on the extremely rare practice of presidential impeachment, has now been altered to make it seem just a little bit rarer. You'll never guess which of America's three impeached presidents has been removed!

WaPo reports that, earlier in July, the Smithsonian's National Museum Of American History altered a display in its The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden exhibit, in order to remove references to the two times Donald Trump has been impeached by Congress. Trump's two impeachments (in 2019 and 2021) were added to the display via a temporary label, titled “Case under redesign (history happens)” back in 2021. The label has now been removed from the display, which now reverts to previous language that “only three presidents have seriously faced removal.” (For what it's worth, the online companion for the exhibit briefly mentions Trump's impeachments, and updates the number of imperiled presidents to four, also including Clinton, Johnson, and the nearly-impeached Nixon.)

According to unnamed sources, the reversion of the display came after the White House put pressure on the Smithsonian to undergo review for “anti-American ideology,” one of those phrases that feels like a warm little slice of dystopia sliding into the brain every time we read it. A Smithsonian spokesperson said the exhibit was reverted to its 2008 state because none of the other exhibits in the “Limits Of Presidential Power” section it's part of had been updated since then. (After all, why should the specific display on impeachment change, just because the total number of impeached or near-impeached presidents had increased by fully 33 percent since it was first created?) The decision comes as the Smithsonian comes under increased scrutiny from a President who's spent the last seven months fumbling and groping for the bra hooks of American cultural control; the Institute's National Portrait Gallery director, Kim Sajet, recently resigned her position after Trump repeatedly called for her firing, and painter Amy Sherald pulled a planned exhibit from the Portrait Gallery over reports that the Institute was considering removing her painting of a trans woman posing as the Statue of Liberty.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Bill Burr calls out podcasts offering ""softball interviews"" to racists, antisemites, and nationalists","https://www.avclub.com/bill-burr-politics-podcasts-softball-racists-nationalists","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 14:28:00 GMT","

In a new interview with Vulture, Bill Burr is extremely resistant to being defined on the political spectrum (he makes the case that both right and left are bad, classically citing the supposed “overcorrection after #MeToo” as an issue on the left). And yet he talks a lot about politics and the current state of affairs, roasting conservative commentator Ben Shapiro for complaining that Burr is “woke” now. “He doesn't even know what that word means,” Burr says, observing that Shapiro only came to see his stand-up “to be annoyed so he can then have something to talk about and then he can make money off dividing his own country. Those people, it's treasonous what they do.”

He says, “There's an ugliness out there right now where if you're a racist, if you're an antisemite, if you're a psycho nationalist and you want a softball interview, there's podcasts out there where you can get one, and they will laugh at your fucking bad jokes and give you this pass. There's a really ugly thing going on out there, and we've already seen what it does to a nation, and it's not the way to go.”

﻿

Burr says his comedy lately is focused less on the politicians and more on the “puppeteers,” the people who pay our politicians: “And they're always distracting us with other stuff. CNN and Fox News are a fucking disease.” But the comedy podcast scene has almost surpassed those traditional outlets as the foremost political commentary apparatus in the United States. Personally, Burr wouldn't interview a president on his podcast (“not with my intellect”) and suggests that there are a lot of dumb people out there acting as if they're smart by presenting information that they don't truly understand: “It's not just reading a bunch of smart shit, putting it in your head, and then puking it out at people. That's not smart. You're torturing people.” But entertainers getting involved in politics was “happening before” the podcast boom, he notes. “I remember the first time I saw a president go on The Tonight Show. I thought it was cheapening the office. They never did that. They used to run for office, they would have the debates, and they wouldn't even go on Meet the Press. But I just feel like now that everybody has a camera, it's just so all over the place. I just think the landscape of it has changed.”

Though Bill Burr is equal opportunity with making fun of all sides of the spectrum, he prefers to be left out of it himself—yet he feels “deliberately misunderstood” by folks trying to make him a champion of the right or a hero of the left. “What I'm finding is that people keep trying to categorize what you're doing. Like that idiot Ben Shapiro: ‘He's woke now!' That fucking guy,” he complains. “He was trying to bring me into his fold. At one point, the guy liked me and then, all of a sudden, I'm a fucking asshole. I'm supposed to look at that guy like he's an adult?” You can read the full interview here.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Yogurt Shop Murders takes a sensitive look at an unthinkable act","https://www.avclub.com/the-yogurt-shop-murders-review-hbo-tv-docuseries","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

This is probably anecdotal, but it feels like our collective TV diet is due for a good, HBO-grade true-crime docuseries right about now. Which, as eloquently intimated by an interviewee in The Yogurt Shop Murders (a new four-parter from that aforementioned network and A24 that very much fits that bill), is a pretty gross and callous thought to even have. “These murders…continue to devastate, puzzle, and fascinate many,” Sonora Thomas, the sister of one of the victims chronicled in the doc, reads from her own writings for the camera. “As a surviving sibling, I have alternated between disgust for the ongoing fascination and awe that the public continues to be horrified by an event that has shaped every aspect of my life.”

There is a guilt that comes—or at least should come—with wanting to watch these sorts of tragedies unfold and be picked apart over several hours, with casually clicking to the next episode from a couch as if the unthinkable stories that ruined the lives of real people are some sort of entertainment. That the segment above ends with news footage of a young Sonora in 1991, just after the murders, “hyperventilating while my grief-stricken mother talks to the reporter,” as she puts it years later, underlines this idea and, perhaps, even hints at some of the guilt director Margaret Brown (2022's Descendant) herself had with this project, not to mention the thorny issues that come with documenting such horrors in general. 

On a December evening in 1991, four teenage girls—Amy Ayers (13), Eliza Thomas, Jennifer Harbison (both 17), and the latter's sister Sarah (15)—were bound by their underwear and shot in the backs of their heads at strip-mall frozen-yogurt shop where two of them worked before the spot was set aflame. The case shocked the community and became a national story, with Thomas noting, “These murderers were said to have shattered the innocence of the small city of Austin,” a sentiment echoed almost verbatim by the actual mayor of that city in a news conference when suspects were apprehended nearly a decade after the killings occurred. (Highlighting that small-town-ness, the opening credits are set to a cover of “Devil Town,” which was also used to great, albeit very different, effect in the Austin-shot show Friday Night Lights.) 48 Hours on CBS did (at least) four episodes on the case and its many twists and turns. And from the get-go of this new docuseries, you get the sense that the relatives of the deceased have had to relive that one night over and over and in front of countless cameras. 

Which they have: A decent amount of the footage in The Yogurt Shop Murders is from an unfinished documentary that local filmmaker Claire Huie started shooting in the 2000s. (Huie is a voice throughout, with her at one point embarrassingly showing a clip of her, gracelessly and without a soft transition, asking Barbara Ayres-Wilson, the mother of Jennifer and Sarah—and another steady presence and one of the empathetic beating hearts of the doc—to talk about that night in 1991.) This narrative framing and seeing, say, John Jones, the first lead investigator assigned to the case, on the evening of the murders in front of news cameras, then sifting through the events again in 2009, then talking—with an air of PTSD but still personable—about how he can't shake the case pretty recently, stresses the weight and longevity of these killings.  



In the first half of the docuseries, Brown nicely creates a sense of place, showing, for example, Amy Ayers at FFA (Future Farmers Of America) events, riding horses, and helping out on her family's ranch. The director then delves into the flip side of that pastoral beauty, with the cops getting swept up in the '90s satanic panic. “They start going after goth kids and metalheads and ‘PIBs,' people in black—just club kids,” Michael Hall of Texas Monthly explains of the investigation going off the rails (a segment that has flashes of the community's hysteria in the Paradise Lost films). 

And in the back half, The Yogurt Shop Murders focuses on false confessions, which was initially the subject of Huie's film—namely, the ones given by four men (teen boys at the time of the murders) who were charged in 1999. Watching these hours-long interrogations (which recall bits of the first season of Making A Murderer) and seeing them break and switch their stories to satisfy investigators and just get out of that room is infuriating. And it's hard not to be left indignant and numb about all of it—the senseless killings, the incarcerations (and the time lost before two men were released years later), and the mystery that has hovered over that stretch of Austin about what happened in 1991 and who was responsible. But Brown's docuseries doesn't end on that note of frustration or on anything to do with developments in the case, really, and instead leaves us with a more human moment, of Thomas and Ayres-Wilson holding hands from across the table (as seen in the still above) and silently bonding over a pain that only they can understand.   

The Yogurt Shop Murders premieres August 3 on HBO

There's been a lot of talk lately about the fate of… well, a whole fucking lot of things, many of them of critical and life-threatening importance. But also: Late-night TV! After all, CBS just canceled Stephen Colbert's Late Show over the financial problems facing the chat show niche—and for no other reason—suggesting that not even the highest-rated network talk show can run profitably in the current climate. But don't we turn to late-night talk for more than just money and ad sales? Isn't it our national water cooler? A TV destination where we can all lighten up, have a little fun, and listen to the most recent Democratic candidate for president tell us that America's systems and institutions are now so fundamentally broken that she can't even be bothered to muster up an easy slam-dunk run for governor of California?

This cheerful little reminder brought to you by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who stopped by Colbert's couch for her first interview since the 2024 election earlier tonight. Harris has got a new book to hawk, of course, but she also popped by to spread a little political, uh, cheer, quickly shooting down the obvious question about whether her recent statement about not running for governor of California was part of the lead-up to a 2028 run at the Oval Office. “Nah” is the current party line, apparently, as Harris went on to say that she's spent her political life operating inside the system, and now views the whole thing as so thoroughly compromised that she can no longer bring herself to toss her bones back into the machine. “I always believed that, as fragile as our democracy is, our systems would be strong enough to defend our most fundamental principles,” she said with obvious emotion. “And I think right now that they're not as strong as they need to be.” When Colbert suggested that Harris' judgment of the situation is “harrowing,” she fired back quickly with, “But it's also evident, isn't it?” (Harris did push back on the idea that she was giving up, but stated her desire to operate outside politics for a bit, traveling across America and learning about people's problems in a “non-transactional” way where she wasn't hunting for anyone's vote. She makes it sound a bit like the old Incredible Hulk TV show, honestly.)

So, yeah, never let anyone tell you that late-night TV isn't still the place to go to let your hair down and have a little fun! The current clip of Harris' interview with Colbert is circulating on social media right now, ahead of a full conversation on the Late Show tonight. God help us if some poor beleaguered CBS editor removes even a second of footage from either, thus irreparably harming Donald Trump again; Paramount's presumably only got so much “settlement money” left to throw around.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","In Chief Of War , Jason Momoa thrills from both sides of the camera","https://www.avclub.com/chief-of-war-review-apple-tv-plus","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 02:00:00 GMT","

For decades, Hawaii has played host to millions of tourists who have flocked to its islands from around the world to bask in their lush, natural beauty. Countless films and shows have made use of its many exotic, picturesque locations, all while superficially touching on themes of ohana or the aloha spirit. But in Chief Of War, Kānaka Maoli (Native Hawaiians) Jason Momoa and Thomas Pa'a Sibbett have successfully excavated a little-known part of their ancestors' history, the effects of which can still be felt many generations later.  

Created by Momoa and Sibbett, the lavish new historical drama stars the former as Ka'iana, a Hawaiian war chief who forges a bloody campaign to unite the warring kingdoms in order to save them from the threat of colonization in the late 18th century. It's a particularly meaty role for Momoa to take on after making a career out of playing brawny heroes in Game Of Thrones, Fast X, and, of course, the DC universe as Aquaman.

Momoa has revealed that he has wanted to tell the story of the unification of Hawaii for most of his adult life, but that he and Sibbett needed a number of years until they felt they had sufficient star power and the requisite experience as writers and producers to tackle a tale of this magnitude. And the final product was worth the wait. With the kind of name recognition and clout that he has been able to cultivate from working on global film franchises, Momoa has clearly thrown a lot at this project to tell a necessary story that is large in scale but intimate in scope. 

Truth be told, the first season is, ultimately, less about the direct consequences of colonization and more focused on the regrettable bloodshed that preceded the reunification of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The story begins with Ka'iana, the son of Maui's greatest war chief who decamped for Hawaii, who begrudgingly agrees to team up with the army he abandoned to take down O'ahu—only to discover Maui chief Kahekili's (a terrifying Temuera Morrison) true intention of conquering and ruling all the islands in the region. Refusing to be used as a pawn in Kahekili's bid for power, Ka'iana attempts to flee Kahekili's men and ends up in the ocean, where he is rescued by a boat of English traders and surveyors. Since they were also fleeing the island after coming face-to-face with Native Hawaiians—who these foreigners described as “Sand Savage,” a warrior people with no fear of musket or cannon—Ka'iana has no choice but to adapt to living with the Englishmen for the foreseeable future. 

After becoming the first warrior to leave the islands, Ka'iana's eyes are permanently opened to the horrors of European—or, as he puts it, “pale-skin”—colonization. During a trip to the Spanish West Indies, for instance, he sees people involved in the slave trade and the trafficking of deadly weapons, who prioritize money above all else. It's a dramatic departure from his own upbringing, where gods are revered and prophecies are fulfilled. By the time he returns home, Ka'iana sounds the alarm about the potential consequences of a European invasion. “There is much suffering,” Ka'iana says midway through the season, only to be rebuffed by Hawaii's king, Kamehameha (Kaina Makua), and the people around him until it's too late. “The pale-skin honors no gods of land,” our protagonist warns. “They steal from it, leaving many sick and hungry without homes. Cruel men with strong weapons and the ships, they will be coming soon. We must find a king who can face them.”

Momoa is given a rare opportunity here to showcase his full range as both a dramatic actor and a visionary director here. Ka'iana consistently finds himself torn between two worlds: He's a Kānaka Maoli with the ethos of the pale-skin, a believer and an atheist, a speaker of Hawaiian and English, and a warrior who engages in hand-to-hand combat and firearms to kill his enemies. Momoa adeptly embodies all of Ka'iana's contradictions, creating a compelling portrait of a desperate leader bound by duty and sacrifice.



If Ka'iana is the heart of Chief Of War, the show's ensemble, made up almost entirely of Polynesian actors, forms its strong backbone. Along with Morrison, who plays the power-hungry Kahului (named after the god of thunder), Cliff Curtis tackles rival chieftain Keoua, an antagonist who is hellbent on recovering what he believes is rightfully his—even if it means killing his own flesh and blood. The Night Agent‘s Luciane Buchanan projects a quiet strength as Ka'ahumanu, the wife of Kamehameha, who pushes back against the societal constraints on women by becoming her husband's strongest political advisor. Te Ao o Hinepehinga portrays Ka'iana's powerhouse wife Kupohi, who cannot shake the feeling that the man who returns to Hawaii is no longer the same one she married. While the characters in Ka'iana's immediate family could have all used a tighter focus after his unexpected departure at the start of the season, their relationships eventually pay off in the final three episodes in a way that is rewarding and heartbreaking in equal measure.

All roads will eventually lead to “The Black Desert,” the season finale directed by Momoa from a script that he wrote with Sibbett, which sets up a potential second batch of episodes and is an ambitious feast for the eyes. Helming and acting in a climactic battle sequence on a massive lava field—which was filmed near a couple of real-life volcanic eruptions—Momoa masterfully captures the savage brutality of that era with the kinds of fight sequences that dare viewers not to look away. 

When he initially pitched the show, Sibbett insisted on writing the first two episodes entirely in Hawaiian. It's a creative choice that makes the most sense in principle, given that outside influences don't arrive on the island shores until the second episode, but it was still met with resistance from executives. But by sticking to his guns, Sibbett and his creative team were able to chart the subtle progression and integration of English into the lives of Native Hawaiians. In fact, the way Native characters code-switch between languages later in the season is just as informative as the words they say. Some want to assimilate for their own protection, some want to use English to conduct their business and political affairs, and others cannot be bothered to learn the language of “the white man.”

Plenty of Hawaiians, like other Native populations, have been stripped of their cultural customs, including language, but Momoa and his collaborators are part of a generation of great-grandchildren who are now actively trying to reclaim that part of their lineage. And at a moment when history is being actively suppressed from classrooms across the country, Chief Of War serves as a timely reminder that the most painful parts of history—especially Native history—cannot be erased.  

Chief Of War premieres August 1 on Apple TV+

Film distributor and streaming service Mubi issued a statement tonight denying that it's “shelved” chef and filmmaker Eddie Huang's new documentary Vice Is Broke, claiming that it's “in constructive discussions with the filmmaker and producers about the film's release on Mubi, and will share further updates as those conversations progress.” Said statement runs strongly counter to a video Huang posted on social media on Thursday night, claiming that his documentary—tracking Vice's transformation from a scrappy outsider into a soulless media juggernaut—was being mothballed and punished because he'd criticized Mubi's financial ties to Sequoia Capital, which in turn has connections with the Israeli defense industry.

In his video, Huang—a well-known chef and former Vice contributor, whose memoir also served as the basis for ABC's Fresh Off The Boat—claimed that Mubi president Jason Ropell called him up on Thursday and told him the film wouldn't be released, and that, in Huang's words, “You and the producers can buy it back from us if you want, but otherwise, nobody's gonna see the film.” Huang asserted he was being made an “example” of after calling out Mubi for its ties to Sequoia, and stating that he wouldn't do any promotion for the film. Mubi has denied this characterization of the conversation between Ropell and Huang.

Sequoia, a Silicon Valley investment firm, reportedly invested $100 million in Mubi earlier this year, provoking controversy that was directed toward the streamer/distributor. (Per Variety, Sequoia also has links to an Israeli defense tech start-up called Kela, which touts the Israeli military credentials of its founders, and whose website states that it provides “battle-tested tech for modern warfare.”) Several filmmakers posted an open letter earlier this week calling on Mubi to cut ties with Sequoia, with Huang posting a link to coverage of the letter with the comment “I agree. I did not make Vice Is Broke to help fund genocide.” Mubi has stated that “the beliefs of individual investors do not reflect the views of Mubi.”

As Justin Timberlake wrapped the final leg of his Forget Tomorrow World Tour, he took to Instagram on July 31 to share a deeply personal message with his fans.

“Well, as these two incredible years come to an end and I look forward to the future, I wanted to write something from the heart,” he wrote. “It's not an easy task to try to contextualize the whirlwind of touring –– but, I will try…”

The *NSYNC alum described the tour as “the most fun, emotional, gratifying, physically demanding, and, at times, grueling experience.”

A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake)

Known for his private nature, the 44-year-old singer decided to break his silence about the health battle he's been facing behind the scenes.

“Among other things, I've been battling some health issues, and was diagnosed with Lyme disease — which I don't say so you feel bad for me — but to shed some light on what I've been up against behind the scenes.”

Timberlake admitted the diagnosis came as a surprise. “I was shocked for sure,” he said. “But, at least I could understand why I would be onstage and in a massive amount of nerve pain or just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness.”

A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake)

Rather than cancel the tour, Justin decided to push through.

“I was faced with a personal decision. Stop touring? Or, keep going and figure it out. I decided the joy that performing brings me far outweighs the fleeting stress my body was feeling. I'm so glad I kept going.”

He credited the experience with proving his “mental tenacity” and creating memories with fans he'll never forget.

The Grammy winner also spoke about the discomfort of sharing personal struggles publicly.

“I was reluctant to talk about this because I was always raised to keep something like this to yourself,” he admitted. “But I am trying to be more transparent about my struggles so that they aren't misinterpreted.”

He ended the post with a message of hope and connection. “Sharing all of this with the hope that we can all find a way to be more connected,” Justin wrote. “I'd like to do my part to help others experiencing this disease too.”

A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake)

A fan wrote: “Justin, Thank you so much for your transparency because it really does bring a closer connection ❤️ we love and support you, and are grateful to have shared these wonderful moments of the forget tomorrow tour ❤️ I will be praying for your health and hope you feel better soon 💛 you are loved 🫰🫶”

Another fan chimed in and wrote: “You are so loved. 🫶🏼 Thank you for showing up for your fans & giving us an amazing show each time you stepped onto the stage. ♥️ You're an icon. 🩷 We are just as lucky to have been apart of this. Thank you for giving us ALL of YOU for the last year and half.”

A third chimed in: “Thank you for sharing something so deep. Admiring you since 2010 and counting… te amo 🇧🇷🤍”

Another fan shared: “saw you twice in the past year, and you blew me away! Thanks for pushing through for us! I hope you get some much needed rest. Don't wait too long to come back. We'll be waiting ! 🫶”

Another concerned follower wrote: “Justin, you didn't need to share this, but so glad you did. You didn't need to go on with the tour, but so glad you did. Take care of yourself and don't be a stranger!”

One follower observed: “You are loved!! Everyone is fighting a battle that others don't know about. Stay strong and enjoy the much deserve rest. Thank you for one hell of a tour. This one was more than I ever imagined it could be. I won't cry because it is over, I will smile because it happened and was magical in so many ways. Us fans are truly blessed with what you do for us. ❤️😍”

By sharing his journey, he's opening the door for greater awareness, compassion, and connection, proving that even in vulnerability, there is power!

Fans and loved ones have been remembering Ozzy Osbourne and the impact he had on the music industry since the news of his death was announced on July 22. He was 76.

A story from 2014 has resurfaced about the Black Sabbath musician and his feelings toward Taylor Swift. It shows there were people Ozzy admired, despite his tremendous success.

Ozzy's wife, Sharon Osbourne, told the story in an October 2014 episode of the talk show “The View.” She recalled how she and Ozzy had encountered Swift while out shopping. When Swift appeared on the show, Sharon asked her about their meeting and if she remembered it. 

“Remember the time that we were all out shopping separately and we bumped into you, and I had Ozzy with me, and [our daughter] Kelly was there, and we all had chats in the store?,” Sharon asked Swift, the Daily Mail reports. 

Sharon revealed what Ozzy had said about Swift. “Ozzy came away and he said, ‘Finally, out of all these young, new artists, I finally found one that is a true superstar,'” she said.

Sharon recalled how Ozzy had compared Swift to celebrities celebrated for their elegance and poise. “She's like Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, all rolled into one,” Sharon said of Ozzy's comments on Swift. She added, “He said he'd never met anyone that had the aura that you have because your aura is one of elegance and just pure, just genuine talent.”

Swift reacted to Ozzy's words, telling Sharon on “The Talk” how the comments were “the sweetest thing.”

A post shared by Ozzy Osbourne (@ozzyosbourne)

Ozzy‘s funeral procession was held on Wednesday, July 30, in his hometown of Birmingham, England. The hearse carrying his coffin drove through the city center for fans to get a glimpse and say their final farewell.

Ozzy's family, including his wife Sharon, their three children, Kelly, Jack, and Aimee, and his son Louis from his previous marriage, attended a memorial site in his honor.  It was there that fans had left flowers, notes, and photographs. 

The thousands of mourners who had gathered represented just a small percentage of people whose lives Ozzy had impacted. 

The funeral was held just over a week after his family announced his death on social media on July 22. In an Instagram post showing Ozzy performing, they informed fans of his passing and asked for privacy. “It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,” the family statement reads. “He was with his family and surrounded by love.”

Ozzy Osbourne will be missed!

Isla Fisher is stepping into a new chapter with a mix of raw honesty and optimism. Moving forward after a long marriage is never easy, but Fisher is embracing the challenge with optimism. The actress is opening up about life after her split from Sacha Baron Cohen.

In her Harper's Bazaar Australia August cover story, the “Now You See Me: Now You Don't” actress revealed she's been navigating a period of transition following her divorce from actor Sacha Baron Cohen.

“I'm really excited for the next chapter,” Fisher, 49, told the magazine. “I'm refocusing on my career because previously I was very much focused on my kids, which I still am, obviously, because [they're] my true love. But I'm enjoying tackling work again.”

Fisher candidly shared that she's had “a tough couple of years” but is finding strength in rediscovery. “One of the benefits of a challenging situation is the luxury of asking myself, ‘What would I like to do professionally and privately?'” she explained. 

“I'm trying to remind myself of my new identity as somebody outside of a partnership and to stay as buoyant as possible.”

Fisher and Cohen were together for more than two decades, having first met at a party in Sydney in 2001. They got engaged in 2004, married in 2010, and announced their divorce in 2023 after 13 years of marriage. The couple finalized the split in June and continues to co-parent their three children.

In a joint statement posted to Instagram Stories, the former couple wrote: “We are proud of all we've achieved together and, continuing our great respect for each other, we remain friends and committed to co-parenting our wonderful children.”

Despite their separation, Fisher & Cohen have publicly supported each other. Fisher wished Cohen a Happy Father's Day on Instagram, calling him “the best father our children could hope for.” Meanwhile, Cohen left encouraging comments on her Valentine's Day and Harper's cover shoot posts, calling them “stunning” and “great.”

On the work front, Fisher is keeping busy with several film projects. The exciting lineup includes the upcoming comedy “Spa Weekend” and the highly anticipated sequel “Now You See Me: Now You Don't”, set to hit theaters on November 14, 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Catherine Zeta-Jones Rocks Jaw-Dropping Red Carpet Look at ‘Wednesday' Premiere","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/catherine-zeta-jones-wednesday-premiere-dress/","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 00:08:36 GMT","

Catherine Zeta-Jones stepped back into full Morticia Addams mode for the “Wednesday” season 2, Part 1 premiere—and did so with dramatic flair. Attending the red carpet event in London on July 30, the 54-year-old actress turned heads in a vampy black gown that gave gothic glamour a sculptural upgrade.

The bold look featured a plunging chest cutout that dipped to her midriff, paired with a thigh-high slit and an open back with a keyhole design. Sculpted 3D mesh ruffles added dramatic flare to the gown, bringing movement and Morticia-worthy edge to the overall silhouette. Zeta-Jones finished the look with fishnet heels, a sleek ballerina bun, bold smoky eyes, a deep plum lip, and glittering spider-inspired ear cuffs that tied the whole gothic glam together.

She joined co-stars including Jenna Ortega, Luis Guzmán and Fred Armisen at Westminster's Central Hall, where the cast gathered ahead of the show's return to Netflix. Ortega opted for a nude snakeskin-print gown, while Zeta-Jones leaned fully into her character's dark feminine energy—marking a return to the haunting glamour fans have come to expect.

Just days earlier, Zeta-Jones surprised fans with a completely different aesthetic during the “Wednesday” season 2 photo call at London's Natural History Museum. On July 28, she traded in her signature gothic gowns for a fashion-forward silver power suit that looked plucked straight out of “Emily in Paris”, per InStyle.

A post shared by Catherine Zeta-Jones (@catherinezetajones)

Her tailored blazer and plunging blouse combo was styled with wide-leg trousers and towering dove gray platform heels by Le Silla. Zeta-Jones accessorized the outfit with black riding gloves featuring silver chain accents, silver cross earrings, and a black fishnet beret. With soft curls, a smoky eye, and a deep plum lip, she struck a balance between polished and edgy.

During this week's press events, Zeta-Jones proved her style versatility, effortlessly moving between gothic glam and chic European tailoring.

A post shared by Catherine Zeta-Jones (@catherinezetajones)

Zeta-Jones' premiere tour arrives just ahead of “Wednesday” season 2's two-part debut on Netflix. Part 1 of the hit Tim Burton series premieres August 6, followed by Part 2 on September 3. The show, led by Jenna Ortega, returns after its massive season 1 success, which earned over 252 million views and 12 Emmy nominations.

This season teases a darker tone, focusing on a chilling vision Wednesday has of her roommate Enid's death—an event she believes she may be responsible for. New cast members include Billie Piper, Steve Buscemi, Owen Painter, and Lady Gaga in a yet-to-be-revealed role. 

The new season reportedly promises expanded family dynamics, more horror, and a deeper look into Wednesday's relationship with her mother. A spinoff series centered around Uncle Fester is also in development.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kim Kardashian Reacts After Seeing Anthony Hopkins Poke Fun At SKIMS","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/kim-kardashian-anthony-hopkins-skims-reaction/","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 14:38:21 GMT","

Anthony Hopkins poked fun and gave a playful stamp of approval of Kim Kardashian's latest SKIMS product — the Seamless Sculpt Face Wrap. In a now-viral Instagram video posted July 31, he channeled his iconic “Silence of the Lambs” character, Hannibal Lecter, wearing the wrap in the “clay” shade. The 87-year-old actor mimicked Lecter's chilling voice and mannerisms and cheekily quipped that the product made him feel “10 years younger.” In his caption, he wrote, “Thank you, Kim. Don't be afraid to come over for dinner @kimkardashian @skims”

Fans were quick to catch the reference — and eat it up. “Are you having Kim for dinner???” one Instagram user joked, while another added, “This is the best publicity you could get @kimkardashian! lol. You have to reply. This is so epic!” A third fan wrote, “THIS is why the internet was invented. Amazing Sir Anthony!”

A post shared by Anthony Hopkins (@anthonyhopkins)

The viral moment didn't go unnoticed by Kim Kardashian herself. Just hours after Anthony Hopkins shared the video, the SKIMS founder reposted it to her Instagram Story, adding the caption: “I'M SCREAMING!!!!!”

Her repost — which tagged both Hopkins and the official SKIMS account — added even more buzz to the already viral video.

SKIMS' new face wrap immediately drew comparisons to Lecter's tan muzzle from the film. And whether intentional or not, the resemblance helped launch the product into meme-worthy territory.

Kim Kardashian's SKIMS officially stepped into new territory with the July 29 launch of its Seamless Sculpt Face Wrap — the brand's first-ever facial product. According to SKIMS' Instagram, the wrap is “made with signature sculpting fabric and infused with collagen yarns for ultra-soft overnight jaw support.”

The $48 accessory is designed to contour the jawline while you sleep, using velcro closures at the crown and nape to secure it in place. It comes in two shades, Clay and Cocoa. Despite mixed reactions online, the product sold out shortly after its release. Fans can sign up for restock updates via the SKIMS website.

Online responses ranged from curiosity to confusion. Some users asked whether the wrap helped with posture or face lifting, while others poked fun. The launch follows a series of SKIMS products that have sparked similar conversations, including hip-enhancing padded shorts and the “Ultimate Butt Enhancing” line.

A post shared by SKIMS (@skims)

While Anthony Hopkins helped bring some lighthearted flair to the launch, not everyone is convinced by the Seamless Sculpt Face Wrap's promised benefits. The product, which is described by SKIMS as “a must-have addition to your nightly routine,” has also drawn comparisons to a scene in “Death Becomes Her”, where Meryl Streep's character uses a similar beauty accessory in her quest for eternal youth, according to reports.

Experts, however, have expressed skepticism. Facial plastic surgeon Dr. Joel Kopelman told Yahoo Life that there's “no scientific evidence to support significant or lasting benefits,” and any improvements seen from wearing a chin strap overnight are likely temporary. Reconstructive surgeon Dr. Michael Bassiri-Tehrani added that such compression is mostly useful post-surgery, not for everyday use.

Despite the debate, SKIMS continues to spark conversation and sell out with each drop. And with Hopkins' cheeky cameo making headlines, the brand's venture into face shapewear is already shaping up to be one of its most buzzed-about moments yet.

Ben Mankiewicz is never someone who I expected to find on the wrong side of film history. The face of Turner Classic Movies since Robert Osborne's death, in addition to being the grandson of “Citizen Kane” screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz and the grand-nephew of “All About Eve” director Joseph L. Mankiewicz,” the Hollywood scion is nothing less than a living emblem of the sanctity and enduring value of 20th century cinema. Delivered in a nasal but welcoming voice that's capable of making 100-year-old masterpieces sound like vital artifacts and spectacular entertainments all at once, the erudite introductions he performs to camera before each program on TCM are a respite from — perhaps even a rebuke to — the solipsistic and unstudied commentary that passes for criticism on TikTok and YouTube. If not for Ben Mankiewicz and the New York Rangers, I would've cancelled my wildly overpriced cable package a long time ago.

Bad news for Spectrum: Both of them have gravely disappointed me this year. Both of them have betrayed their cores in the speculative pursuit of a lost cause. For the Rangers, that moment came when general manager Chris Drury sent a league-wide memo declaring open season on his own roster. For Mankiewicz, the trouble started a few days ago, when he announced his eager participation in a “CBS Sunday Morning” segment promoting — and there's really no other word for it — the Sphere's plan to screen a version of “The Wizard of Oz” on the world's biggest screen later this summer. (Fun fact: the Sphere and the Rangers are owned by the same billionaire.) 

 










It would be one thing if the Las Vegas tourist attraction was simply charging people several hundred dollars for the chance to experience one of the most beloved movies ever made on an 160,000 square foot LED display that warped around their field of vision. I mean, I regularly turn down free tickets to attend ScreenX showings of new releases because I refuse to soil the artistic purity of “Jurassic World Rebirth,” but I suppose there could be worse options for anyone stuck in the desert on a night when the Kelly Clarkson residency was sold out. (Have you listened to her “Fake Plastic Trees” cover? Divine.)

But the Sphere isn't planning to simply make “The Wizard of Oz” bigger — the plans go way beyond just stretching the sides of Victor Fleming's shots to approximate something akin to Polyvision. On the contrary, the cut of the 1939 classic screening at James Dolan's Technodrome has been so radically mutilated by A.I. that it seems less a celebration of the original than an Emerald City-sized version of Cecilia Giménez's Jesus fresco. 

Just when it seemed like “Wicked” would go down in history for giving us the world's ugliest Oz, the Sphere's VFX editors have upscaled Fleming's movie to a garish 16K, trimmed almost 30 minutes out of its runtime by smoothing over cuts and smooshing characters into scenes where they don't belong (the Sphere experience isn't conducive to breaks in the image), and filled the extra screen real estate with computer-generated backdrops that guess at what the Yellow Brick Road might have looked like if it had to match the majestic scale of I-95. Perhaps “Frankenstein” would have been a more fitting choice for the Sphere's first “restoration.” 

 










I obviously don't know what Mankiewicz stands to gain by shilling for this sacrilegious headache (though it's very possible that he was under pressure from TCM boss David Zaslav, whose Warner Bros. also owns “The Wizard of Oz”), but I have to shake my head at his claims that these screenings — which can't be replicated at other venues — are good for classic cinema. That it “keeps them alive,” and that “more people will be interested in Judy and her films.” I, uh, have my doubts that charging $200 for the experience of being attacked by a Kaiju-like Judy Garland will create many new fans of old movies, but my five-year-old son recently developed a brief fascination with cyberpunk because he watched an AI-generated YouTube video about a humanoid ninja coffee cup named Cappuccino Assassino getting killed by state police in a 22nd century rebellion of some kind, so who am I to say. 

More troubling to me is Mankiewicz's insistence that the Sphere is “completing work Fleming and [producer Mervyn LeRoy] would have if it had been possible,” as well as the line of thinking that led him to that defense: “The concerns over AI are real, Mankiewicz wrote in response to an upset tweet, “But it is here. We must accept that.” He's only half right. And, in the immortal words of the late Caledon Hockley: Not the better half. 

 










There's no denying that AI is here. It's everywhere. And not only in the places we can see it or might think to look. People are using ChatGPT instead of Google, to the point that Google's search engine has been inspired to serve up its own AI instead of people. Premium Twitter users have lost so much trust in reality that they wouldn't believe their own house was on fire unless Grok confirmed it first. Fake Spotify accounts are listening to fake bands in order to generate real profits at the expense of real artists. Natasha Lyonne has fallen. 

Like the unnatural carcinogens that are pumped into the air we breathe, AI has polluted our environment at the behest of an industry that doesn't care about the damage that it causes to this planet, its resources, or to any of the people who rely on them for their survival. Our kids are exposed to it from a young age (my poor kids have been, at least), our business leaders are sold on it as an inevitability (they'd sell us on anything if it meant they might not have to pay us for anything else), and even some of our artists and scholars are convinced that it might open new avenues for creativity instead of paving over the only viable ones we still have left. These things are happening, they're happening on purpose, and they're happening faster than we can process the collateral damage of such widespread “disruption.”

 










I suppose that's always been the case to a certain extent. “Progress” has long been the best propaganda for a world that loves to conflate sacrificing the past with creating the future, and art has been inextricably entwined with technology since either of those pursuits were first invented — a fact that movies have made more obvious than just about any other medium. Actualités gave way to montage, silence gave way to sound, and men in rubber suits gave way to motion-captured CGI all in the same period of time that literature only managed to evolve from paper to the Kindle. Some people would call that progress. Others might be a bit more ambivalent about the fact that we got from zoetropes to Netflix in the blink of an eye that lacks any peripheral vision. 

Regardless, it would be a categorical mistake to see AI as the next iteration of those earlier paradigm shifts. While I can imagine practical applications of AI (storyboarding comes to mind), it isn't just another tool at a filmmaker's disposal or an effective way of democratizing the filmmaking process itself — though Radu Jude's forthcoming “Dracula” actively uses it as both in order to highlight the technology's fundamentally vampiric nature. It doesn't streamline or emphasize human creativity so much as it insists that we've had enough of that already, and the algorithms can take it from here. 

 










The perfect form of expression for people who think memes are the ultimate height of comedy, AI doesn't allow for a world with more artists, it allows the tech industry to create a world that ostensibly doesn't need them. As “Everything Everywhere All at Once” co-director Daniel Kwan so elegantly put it at a recent event in West Hollywood, AI less represents a new form of storytelling than it does an invasive species to the concept of storytelling itself. It's a wasp, not a bee. And with all due respect to Mr. Ben Mankiewicz, using AI to preserve the magic of “The Wizard of Oz” is like using cancer to preserve the function of a pancreas. 

Which is all the more reason why I take issue with Mankiewicz's assertion that Fleming would have — not might have — Sphere-ified his masterpiece if only he had the technology to do so. That AI is somehow restoring “The Wizard of Oz” rather than eating away at its essence. It's an argument that presumes authorial intent as a means of inviting people to override it. 

“The Wizard of Oz (Skynet's Version)” may not imperil our ability to watch Fleming's classic as it was meant to be seen (one could make the case that television has already malformed the movie's afterimage more than a gimmick venue like the Sphere ever could), but it has the more broadly pernicious effect of positioning art as fodder for technology; of using one of the most cherished pieces of all American pop art to normalize the vandalism inherent to the use of AI. Submitting “The Wizard of Oz” to this technology doesn't retrench the film's legacy, it desecrates it. It's the cinematic equivalent of that awful “immersive Van Gogh experience.” And it clarifies how the technocratic plunderers we're permitting to build the world of tomorrow see even the greatest films — or worse, especially the greatest films — as just more grist for the mill. 

 










If there's any silver lining to the Sphere's “Wizard of Oz,” it's that it serves as a towering reminder that AI is not art. It doesn't want to be art, or to enrich art, or to inspire more art. It belongs in a separate lane, and its increasingly aggressive overtures towards the creative space threaten nothing less than a hostile takeover. 

If there's any silver lining to Mankiewicz's wrongheaded endorsement of the Sphere's “Wizard of Oz,” it's that it serves as an equally glaring reminder that we don't have to accept it — and that it feels like a flagrant own goal to watch a smart person surrender this early in the fight. 

It's too late to hope for a different future, you might say. This shit has metastasized well beyond our control, and the movies, which have survived a constant stream of existential threats since their inception, should officially be transferred to hospice care for what's left of their short life as a medium. Another film critic shaking his fist at the sky isn't going to change anything — shaking their fists at the sky and not changing things is basically 90% of what those blowhards get paid to do these days. Besides, didn't the one who wrote this article just say that he lets his kid watch Italian Brainrot? 

 










Well, yes. A part of me wants my son, even at his young age, to learn how to navigate the world on his own terms, just as another, much larger part of me is just too fucking tired at the end of the day to police the random garbage he watches before our nightly viewing of “The Bad Guys” (this might just be the Stockholm Syndrome talking, but “The Bad Guys” kind of rips?). But I've also explained to him that an AI chimera like Tralalero Tralala — a great white shark who wears Nikes on his fins — lacks the animating spark that he can find in any frame of “Bluey,” or even, dare I say it, “Ice Age: The Meltdown,” and I've been thrilled to discover I didn't even have to do that. 

It turns out that even a five-year-old can sense the difference between something that was made with care and something that was generated without thought, and it's been amazing to see how much deeper my son has naturally engaged with the former. (I'm not saying “The Bad Guys 2” is his most anticipated movie of all time because it takes a vehement stance against being ingested by AI, but I am saying that neither he nor anyone else could ever be so excited to watch something that AI had already spit back out.) People are born knowing the difference, and so there's no sense in accepting that we have to let “progress” condition us otherwise just so billionaires can sit on the shoulders of giants in order to make themselves feel tall — to borrow a line from a movie about the dehumanizing nature of modern technology.

 










The truth is that AI's incursion into the arts is nothing without our complete acquiescence at every level. AI still needs us so much more than we need it, especially in the entertainment sector. For evidence, look no further than Amazon's $20 million bet on Fable, a doomed novelty service that promises to let people create their own episodes of shows like “South Park” or whatever. Acquired on the same day that writer/director Scott Z. Burns warned IndieWire's Chris O'Falt that generative AI is a consumer product aimed at engagement rather than a viable replacement for narrative storytelling, Fable — the so-called “Netflix of AI” — epitomizes why these tools are useless without a bedrock of human creativity to steal from, and its certain failure will be an expensive testament to the fact that algorithms will never create new things. And not just because they're too busy mutilating old ones.

There is nothing inevitable about what comes next, and to read Daniel Kwan say as much within hours of watching Mankiewicz suggest otherwise hammered that point home for me stronger than anything has before. “Now is the time to put our hands on the steering wheel,” Kwan said. “Because if you don't, they will.” If Ben Mankiewicz lost his grip on the situation, that's only because he lost sight of the fact that the film industry is still in the driver's seat. And it will be for as long as people remember that the great and powerful Oz had nothing to offer Dorothy in the end — nothing beyond the recognition that she already had everything she needed to make her dreams come true.

[Editor's note: The following interview contains minor spoilers for “The Naked Gun.”]

There are a few jokes that “The Naked Gun” screenwriters and long-time partners Dan Gregor and Doug Mand are sad didn't make it into Akiva Schaffer's long-hoped-for new entry into the spoof canon. But mostly, the duo is thrilled about the stuff that did make it in there. All the stuff, really, enough to make a bona-fide, honest-to-God, true-blue spoof feature, the kind made by a studio and with a budget and giant stars and a full-fledged theatrical release.

 










For two creators (best known for everything from “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” to “Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers”) who can still easily and amiably recall the feeling of seeing “Spaceballs” or the original “Naked Gun” films for the first time, it's a dream come true. A silly dream, but still. We need those kinds of dreams these days.

The film, starring Liam Neeson, is both a reimagining and a continuation of the classic “Naked Gun” films of the '80s and '90s. In it, Neeson is Frank Drebin Jr., the grizzled cop son of original star Frank Drebin (the incomparable late Leslie Nielsen), who also happens to be seemingly genetically predisposed to wacky happenstance in his day-to-day life. When Frank takes on a big case, which inevitably brings him into the orbit of the alluring Beth Davenport (Pamela Anderson), he has to use all his brain power (silly jokes) and muscle (a love of chili dogs) to save the day, get the girl, and make everyone laugh while doing it.

Ahead, Gregor and Mand tell IndieWire about their hopes and fears around the film's reception (some sparked by this very website), writing for an Oscar nominee who can also punch a wolf, Pamela Anderson's otherworldly scatting, and the kind of jokes that could only live inside this delightful sort of package. 

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: We're going to start with the big, scary one: What is it like when you see a headline on IndieWire that calls your film the most important movie of the summer?

Doug Mand: So we saw that. It was sent to us. [Laughs]

Dan Gregor: And then we read the whole article. It's an amazing article. And he then goes into saying it's going to fix America, too. And I'll shoulder that burden. I will absolutely—

Mand: Not me. Not me, I want nothing to do with either of those endeavors. That's too much. I'm barely staying above water myself here.

Gregor: I always felt that America just needed a laugh, and that the only thing keeping us apart is a little bit of comedy. We're more than happy to do it. But I'm the first person to deflect and be like, “It's a movie, guys. It's a silly movie. And what we do is silly.” But I will say this, talking to other people around LA, that is a little bit of the vibe, of people feeling like this has to do well so that other comedies and scripts will be bought. I do feel that there's a lot of people [who] want this to work.

 










Mand: Even other studios and studio executives who are normally competitive are like, “No, no, no, we all want your movie to do well.” Which is a very lovely place to be in. It's a genre, in the large category of comedy and the small category of spoof, that has been very neglected for a while. As passionate comedy fans, it would mean a lot to us to have that be back in a sort of meaningful, central place.

Gregor: Meaning, in the theater.

When I saw it last week, it was with a somewhat smaller group of press, and many of them are younger than us, 25-year-olds and such, and I wondered, “How are they going to vibe with this?” And they really enjoyed it.

Gregor: The generational divide on this type of comedy is really interesting, because it's disappeared for 20-some years. We noticed in some of our test screenings, people under a certain age, mostly teenagers, it took them a couple of minutes just to get the education on how these movies work. It's like, “Wait, wait, he just lost his arms. Is that going to be a plot point?” And you're like, “No, no, that's not important.” It's cartoon logic, you can always snap back to normal. But it took a moment for it to register [with that age group].

Hopefully, the ads are doing the education now, where people are understanding, “Oh, this is really, really silly.” But I do think that there's a reintroduction of this type of comedy.

 










The film's trailer is mostly the opening scene, and it's one of the few times where I think a choice like that makes sense. You are setting up the logic, and you're setting up the expectations.

Gregor: That's our hope with the intro, that it does feel like you almost have a little CliffsNotes of like, “Oh, this is what a spoof feels like.” If we've done it justice, it should feel like you're in the genre of an action movie, a heist movie or a heist scene, and then something happens that's ridiculous, but we're still in the heist movie. Hopefully, that gets people in the mood for what they're about to see for the next hour and a half.

What are your memories of seeing spoofs when you were younger? The “Naked Gun” movies, “Airplane!,” “Spaceballs,” all that good stuff.

Gregor: I mean, “The Naked Gun” is actually my favorite of all of them.

Mand: Mm-hmm, same here.

Gregor: As a kid who grew up obsessed with this as a genre, Mel Brooks and “Monty Python” were everything to me. “Naked Gun” and “Spaceballs” were everything to me.

[I remember] moving to California and getting to drive down the highway where the two silos are, where in the beginning of the first [“Naked Gun” movie], Frank Drebin says, “Everything I see reminds me of her,” and it's just those two giant boobs.

 










I was driving to San Diego after the fires this year with my wife, because we were kind of escaping the fires and it was a very stressful time, we were kind of in a fight, and we're passing the boobs and I was like, “The boobs are there. We should stop fighting now.” And we both looked at them, and we were like, “Yeah, that's very funny. OK, you're right.”

Mand: It's “Spaceballs” and all the “Naked Guns” that really left a mark on me. I remember, as a kid, knowing that maybe I didn't understand more than half of “Naked Gun,” and still loving it. I remember the pistachios filling up outside of the car when they're on a stakeout and they can't open the door, and it's just a pile, and thinking, “This is the funniest thing I'd ever seen.”

Then coming back to it after starting to write sketch comedy in college and stuff, and there's a scene where Frank is questioning a guy at the docks for information, and it's the classic trope of the guy being like, “Eh, maybe I've seen him, maybe I ain't.” And Frank offers him a 20-dollar bill, and before you know it, the guy from the docks is like, “Well, why do you want to know?” And Frank goes, “Ah, I forget. I can't tell you.” And now the guy from the docks is paying him, and it basically ends with the guy from the docks borrowing twenty bucks from Frank to pay him back for information he got from Frank. And I was like, “This is a perfect comedy scene. It doesn't get better than this.”

 










But literally every other scene in that movie is the best scene I've ever seen, comedy-wise.

I love “Spaceballs,” but I saw “Spaceballs” before I saw “Star Wars.”

Mand: Same! So, the first time I saw “Star Wars,” I was like, “Eh, it's fine. It's not very funny.”

Gregor: Yeah, it's “Spaceballs” without the comedy. If I'm choosing between the two, why would I not just take the funny?

But it's funny the way that a good spoof can still work, even if you're not completely caught up on what is the inspirational source material.

Gregor: The first “Naked Gun” holds up to this day; it is still as funny as it was in 1988. Most comedies, even the best ones, are dated within a couple of years, and with “Naked Gun,” that did not happen. I think a big part of that was that they were basing it on already a throwback genre, “Police Squad” is based on “M Squad” and “Dragnet.” These are procedurals from the '50s and '60s, and so they already had a timeless quality to them.

That was definitely a big part of this movie for us, was to not try to be particularly topical, to hopefully feel like this is just a take on the last 20-some years of the genre of action movies, of detective movies. Our hope is that it has a little more longevity for not being topical.

 










Mand: If we used a reference, we wanted the reference to be older and lame. We wanted it to already be dated, so it wasn't something that would feel stale in a year or two.

Gregor: There's Janet Jackson references and Freedom Fries references. I mean, it's truly so dated.

Going back to thinking about the 25-year-olds and the teenagers watching it, how would you hold those two things in your head as you're writing, that you want this to have sort of a weird timeless quality because it is a throwback, but you also would like to bring in younger people to the fun?

Mand: This is something we talk about a lot, but I think you have to write to what makes you laugh first and foremost. The minute you're like, “I want everyone to like this,” then you're making a movie for almost no one. That's the first goal, and then it goes joke by joke, and then you're like, “Is this so specific?” And then is it so specific, but we don't care because we still like it? I remember watching “Barbie,” and that's a billion-dollar hit film—

Gregor: And what was the song that Ken played? Matchbox Twenty! That's as dated as it gets.

Mand: And I'm just like, “These jokes are for them or for their friends.” They didn't get huge laughs, but it didn't matter because you feel that you're in that movie and you're like, “This is a joy to watch.”

 










Gregor: It's the Looney Tunes lesson, which is you don't need to get every joke as much as you need to feel that the joy of the writing is there, because that part is infectious. I didn't know any of the opera references that they were making in Looney Tunes, but I could feel like, “Oh, man, I feel clever for being a part of it. I feel like I'm being let in a little bit of a club.”

People have wanted this kind of joy for a while — a “Naked Gun” reboot has been kicking around in Hollywood for years, and there have been many iterations of star, writers, and director attached. Did you guys take anything from the other scripts, or is this just you and Akiva?

Gregor: This is just us. Something that felt very important was that the only reason this movie exists in our minds is because Liam Neeson agreed to do this. We were dead set that we need to really honor that original “Airplane!” template of only casting dramatic actors, and looking at it really, really through the lens of drama.

But, we're comedians and we're friends with comedians, and it was very painful to tell all of our comedian friends, “Fuck off,” but—

Mand: We didn't have to use “Fuck off,” but we did.

Gregor: But I insisted! I said, “Hey, come to my house. I want to tell you something.”

 










With Liam, there's really nobody else in Hollywood who has both that gravitas and has not sort of smirked his way out of it with a Marvel movie.

Mand: Or something lighter or something like that, which is totally fine. He's spent the last 15 years making these vigilante movies, making “Taken” and movies like that where he is the lone man who is the only one who can get the daughter back or the only one who can—

Gregor: Punch a wolf.

Mand: So the whole approach of it for us three when we sat down was like, “We have Liam Neeson.” And Liam Neeson has this body of work, so we have to go back into this body of work, and also movies that haven't been spoofed that he isn't in, all the “John Wicks,” the “Mission: Impossibles” that haven't been touched, which is also a gift for us.

And Liam is not Leslie, and no one is Leslie. Leslie, he's a unicorn. And Liam is not trying to be that, so it was, let's lean into the fact that we have Liam Neeson here who is a generational talent, one of the greatest of all time, and he's doing these silly lines. That was the whole point, so it was less about the other scripts or projects before, and it was more just like, “Liam's here, what do we do with Liam?”

Gregor: The basic task was, “What's the stupidest thing we can get Liam Neeson to say?”

 










Mand: And we think we got him to say some really stupid stuff.

Gregor: He's such a good actor actor, so he'd show up and really the first take would be perfect almost without fail. It leaves us all this space to give him alts and to play with it. Then, he had this thing that he would say, after the script would make him do something particularly embarrassing or awful, when they'd yell cut, he would go like, “I'm Oskar Schindler, dammit, what's happened to me?” I think he had a really good time.

There are so many little touches throughout the film that will delight spoof fans, running gags you just build on. There's one with Liam and Paul's characters constantly getting fresh coffees handed to them, then bigger coffees, then biggest coffees. What is the calculus of writing stuff like that?

Gregor: It's the math of heightening, where you're like, “OK, we had the first joke where he's just wasteful, he's just tossing the coffee cup.” And then those throws get more and more aggressive. Then, likewise, it goes from how many coffees to now even bigger coffees. It can't plateau. That's the math of it.

The one joke that we found on set was him driving against the green screen, and then our prop master just [handed him a coffee]. That's another one of the old-fashioned tropes of the genre, especially Mel Brooks would do this a lot, we're just acknowledging that we're driving on a green screen. To us, that felt like a really fun nod. The green screens have gotten a lot better, and so people don't always register [them], but I always feel like there's a little part of the back of your brain that is registering Uncanny Valley. It used to be that there was just a horse chase or something going on behind your carriage and you're like, “That's fake.”

 










With your background, I'm not surprised that there are some songs in here, including this incredible sequence of Pam scatting.

Mand: Akiva can talk about this quite a bit, but it's something that I can say that I know that they did in the first audition. The time that they met, Pam actually said she did scat in high school, and she did some for him, and it was wildly endearing and sweet, and she just went for it. This was something that we knew we were going to do pretty early on.

Gregor: Do you remember the Kim Cattrall video?

Oh, do I.

Gregor: So it's very much that, that's certainly where we started from, where it was like, “OK, that's maybe the funniest thing anyone can do.”

Mand: But we're not going to be as funny as that, but what's the second funniest thing we can do? But that's Pam being unreal and a gift. Pam just kind of dove into this thing head-first and really wanted to be great and wanted to be silly and poke fun. That song was a lot of trial and error of what's going to play as silly versus what's not going to play as, like, is she really good at this?

Gregor: We recorded that as a real track with her beforehand. The amazing artist Liz Gilles basically coached her through it and helped us write some of the very musical stuff. We can write in the script “and then she scats,” but what the hell does that sound like? The word “Ski baba, do baba, la ba da da,” somebody still has to write that.

 










The very first time that it was all performed [as a whole] was the very first take on set, so the whole crew was seeing this as a real performance. And Pam got a standing ovation on set from the audience of crew and cast who were just like, “Holy shit, that was spectacular. That was amazing.” In edit, we kind of jumbled it up and mixed it around.

I'll say our saddest thing is that there was just the best scatting of the “Super Mario Brothers” underwater theme, and that was in all of the cuts until the 11th hour when Nintendo said that they weren't going to let us do it. If you got to see an early cut, you would've seen her scatting the “Super Mario Brothers” underwater theme. And that really, really, really tickled us.

That brings to mind — and this is one of the few movies I would ask for this — what are things in the movie that you would hope that people really can look out for, and maybe they look out for it in their second watch?

Gregor: This is not a spoiler or like an Easter egg kind of joke, but the detail that I continually love more than anything is when Frank is angry at Beth for deleting his old episodes of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and it's just the sound effect of him slowly clicking through an old TiVo. We actually did dig up the old TiVo sounds, and they have this weird, dated quality.

 










Mand: “Bloop… bloop bloop.”

Gregor: There's like a water drippy kind of sound to it. I love that detail so much.

Mand: I'm tickled by the movie. I still can't believe they made it. I can't believe that we're here right now in London about to go see a premiere of it. It's hopefully stupid at every minute.

Gregor: Oh, keep an eye out for the beaver. That's the Easter egg for the original movie that we're happy we got to sneak in here.

Going back to the hope that this is a success for comedies, but also specifically for spoofs, what are your big hopes for what this might do to the spoof market?

Gregor: I hope it brings us back, spoofs very specifically, but even just the concept of a very big, silly movie, and that comedies can just be fun.

Mand: [There can be] comedy-forward movies, not an action movie with jokes, a kid's animated movie with laughs, a romantic comedy, just like a movie that is here to make you laugh. So, spoof or no spoof, just the idea that it's just a comedy and there's just not as much fear of doing it. I feel like there's just become so much fear, that it's got to be comedy on top of something else as opposed to just being like, “The point of this movie is to make you laugh, and hopefully feel things as well.”

 










Like the original “Naked Gun,” you're rooting for that romance, hopefully, that happens in our movie. It's one of the tricks of these movies… that you may forget that the plot is there, but if you do it correctly, if you look at it, the plot makes sense, and the love story is something you actually care about. Not too much that it's getting in the way of the jokes, but just enough to root for it.

It's a comedy-first movie, so my biggest hope is that that starts to happen a little bit more. It just starts to drip out a little bit where people can just be like, “These are jokes.”

Gregor: It's also a weird byproduct of the disintegration of the monoculture. You need a baseline to spoof, and with fewer baselines, it's harder to find those things. But a friend of mine described this as “a fresh Mario board with untouched coins,” and I like that metaphor. Yes, this is a pre-existing genre, but there's this whole area that hasn't been touched.”

And the longer we've been away from it? I mean, God, the superhero genre is so ripe for spoof at this point, too. OK, I guess that's what I'm throwing my hat in the ring for, if they let us. [Laughs]

A Paramount Pictures release, “The Naked Gun” is now in theaters.

The reluctant warrior archetype tends to be as instinctively intriguing as it is irksomely far-fetched. Here's a dude (or a lady, or a nonbinary individual, but typically a man) who's the deadliest shooter west of the Mississippi or the toughest hombre east of Appalachia. They're not just an expert in their chosen method of violence; they're the expert. They're also a practicing pacifist.

As a viewer, it's an enticing characterization: Someone says they can do something extraordinary, but they refuse to do it, which only builds anticipation for the moment when they inevitably back up their claims. They don't want to outdraw their trigger-happy opponent. They don't want to throw down with a gang of knife-wielding assassins. They don't want to rip out a man's tongue with their bare hands and get a quick protein boost from eating it. But they can do all those things, and they will do all those things if they believe they have no other choice. 

 








Related Stories ‘She Rides Shotgun' Review: Taron Egerton Is an Ex-Con Trying to Save His Daughter from Skinheads in a Tough but Movingly Tender Crime Thriller Inside the Making of the ‘Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' Murder Mystery Episode 

There's also the handy moral shortcut. The reluctant warrior gets to acknowledge that murderous rampages are wrong before indulging in the murderous rampage anyway. Sure, some thoughtful audience members may have lingering questions like, “If so-and-so really is the best there is at beating the shit out of people, then how did they get to be so good at it? Wouldn't gaining such an elite expertise require a big time commitment? And wouldn't that commitment indicate an interest in, or a need for, performing these violent acts?”

 










Savvy writers will saddle their reluctant warriors (or martial pacifist, depending on your definition) with reasonable backstories explaining how they learned to commit such horrific acts of violence — they're ex-military, not active military, or they're reformed gunslingers, not functioning gun nuts — but the John Wicks of the world, on some level, have to enjoy what they do, don't they? A little bit? Even if they'd never admit it? And shouldn't that be seen as more of a problem for our warrior? Shouldn't the motivation for his initial reluctance outweigh the satisfaction of his inevitable victory? Shouldn't he mourn what he's been forced to do, once it's all over, rather than ride off into the sunset as the conquering hero?

Ka'iana, Jason Momoa‘s reluctant warrior in the Apple TV+ series “Chief of War,” wrestles with his character's contradictions almost as well as he wrestles with carnivorous sharks. At the start of the nine-episode first season, Ka'iana has already abandoned the titular role he inherited from his father, instead deciding to live as a peaceful outcast on Maui with his brothers and their wives. Each morning, they hunt for their own food. Each night, they sleep in their own shelters. Throughout it all, they protect and care for one another — the kind of simple, idyllic life that can never last.

 










It doesn't take long for the chief to come calling for his strongest soldier, and Ka'iana doesn't require much prodding to pick up a spear once again. He is, after all, afraid — afraid his people will be ruled over by the wrong man or, worse yet, controlled by outside forces. Is Maui's current chief, Ka'iana's uncle Kahekili (Temuera Morrison), the right leader? His previous war was driven by greed and cost hundreds of lives, Ka'iana's father among them, but Kahekili claims to have learned from his mistakes and now only wants what's best for the islands.

Doubts and suspicions aside, the uncle and nephew agree on one thing: A united Hawaii is needed to protect their people and culture. But joining forces isn't so easy. Maui is one of four kingdoms that make up Hawaii in the late 18th century, each with their own chief and each trapped in a “cycle of endless war.” Not only does each island chief cherish their power, but most of the islanders are waiting for a chosen one to rise up and lead them. The “prophecy” has gone unfulfilled for generations, and whether that means someone needs to seize the hands of fate themselves or continue waiting is a matter of interpretation, and thus, contention.

“Chief of War” shares plenty with last year's blockbuster historical epic, “Shōgun.” Co-creators Momoa and Thomas Pa'a Sibbett — who, per a note sent to reporters, are “direct descendants of characters in this series” — illustrate an in-depth appreciation of indigenous customs. Told with a predominantly Polynesian cast, who speak in native Hawaiian throughout the season, the Apple TV+ original spends ample time observing their characters' peaceful traditions and portrays their sun-drenched haven with consistent reverence. 

 










But “Chief of War” is also an action series, and despite its other attributes — the costumes are magnificent, the environments vivid, and performances strong (shout-out to newcomer Kaina Makua, an instantly endearing screen presence) — the action takes precedence. While mostly for the better, there are a few drawbacks. For one, “Chief of War” lacks the emotional nuance of “Shōgun.” Side plots largely go underdeveloped, including a few emotionally weight-bearing romantic and platonic relationships. (Momoa is technically caught in a love triangle, but it's hard to care how it shakes out, just as his friendship with Tony, a European sailor, never quite blossoms into its intended bromance.) Despite opening titles reminiscent of “Shōgun” (and thus “Game of Thrones”) that depict the grand expanse of the series' vision, Momoa, Sibbett, and showrunner Doug Jung (“Dark Blue”) don't bounce between islands, developing different arcs within each kingdom, so much as they remain laser-focused on the big, burgeoning war.

A similarly single-minded approach could weigh down a show with less momentum, but “Chief of War” has such a strong engine — in Momoa, his character, and their shared daring — it rarely feels slow or stagnant. For as hellbent as Ka'iana is on protecting his paradise, he's not immune to change. Various events beyond his control force him to expand his perspective and shift his positions. Momoa handles each challenge with his trademark blend of tenacity and grace (and to much greater effect than his last Apple effort, the widely unseen “See”). He can embody the vicious, hulking brute one minute, only to pivot into a vulnerable, slack-shouldered paragon of virtue the next. He is both bear and teddy bear at once, and Momoa's ability to sell each extreme makes for a commanding turn.

 










That being said, for as affecting as his quieter scenes can be, Momoa's berserk embodiment of Ka'iana's action scenes can't be overstated. The show starts — starts — with Momoa lassoing a shark underwater, and that's when Ka'iana is still living in peace. As his ever-expanding set of physical skills is called on more and more often, in more and more demanding scenarios — a feat of strength here, a clash of kingdoms there — Momoa sets his long-repressed warrior loose, one unhinged grunt, roar, or scream at a time. When the finale (which Momoa also directs) introduces the long-hyped battle royale, it sure seems like Ka'iana's fury road has run its course. And yet, there he goes again, unveiling even more eye-popping extravagance than many have dared to imagine.

In a note sent to media, Momoa and Sibbett said after seeing “the image of Hawaii […] packaged, sold, and resold, promising paradise for the price of a plane ticket,” they set out to make “Chief of War” as their homeland's “reintroduction to the world. It is Hawaii's story, told from a Hawaiian point of view.”

Ka'iana, based on the real Hawaiian warrior, is the main window for that perspective, and the series relies on the tension created by his continued calls for peace and how clearly he's drawn to war. Not only are we watching to see what happens to Hawaii (a predetermined fate, even if Season 1 illustrates the value of bearing witness), but we're watching to see if an honorable man can wield his demons for the greater good, or if by giving into them, he's perpetuating the same endless cycle of war he seeks to break. Men have been using violence to beget nonviolence for centuries, and they continue to insist on its effectiveness to this day. But is it ever really the way?

 










This, too, may end up a predictable dilemma, but it's a relatable one, too — and an effective way to galvanize “Chief of War.” Ka'iana does not want to fight, but when he lets slip the dogs of war, the havoc proves as terrifying as it is astonishing. 

“Chief of War” premieres Friday, August 1, with two episodes. New episodes will be released weekly through the Season 1 finale on September 19.

Cindy Lee has brought their entire catalog exclusively to Bandcamp, where it is now available to stream, download, and pre-order on vinyl. Physical reissues follow, via Superior Viaduct imprint W.25TH, on October 31. Among the new arrivals is the rare 2020 album Cat o' Nine Tails, the direct predecessor to Diamond Jubilee. That one is streaming for the first time, after its initial run of 50 lathe-cut LPs and a handful of cassettes. Listen to it below.

All Cindy Lee albums have been removed from Spotify at the artist's request, a press release notes. While a number of those records—not including Diamond Jubilee—had been officially uploaded to Spotify in the past, only two remained before being taken down yesterday: What's Tonight to Eternity and Model Express.

Diamond Jubilee got its vinyl release in February, having previously been exclusive to Cindy Lee's Geocities page. The project's other albums were similarly hard to find, including Act of Tenderness and Malenkost, which had been removed from Bandcamp and only returned today. The Halloween vinyl drop will bring most Cindy Lee albums back into print for the first time in years.

Genre:

Pop/R&B

Label:

Generations of gay sadsacks have found solace and identification in the melancholy blush of '80s dream-pop and indie rock, and so it goes for Chappell Roan, who, on her new single “The Subway,” treats an open wound with the sounds of the Cocteau Twins, the Sundays, and the Cranberries. Roan has an uncommonly good ear: Unlike many of her contemporaries, she's able to load her music with references without it ever feeling like she's just slapping on her logo. Such is the case here—perhaps you can hear shades of Robin Guthrie's skyward-soaring guitar, or Elizabeth Fraser and Dolores O'Riordan's Celtic lilt, or Patch Hannan's gentle rhythmic chug, but no single reference ever threatens to overwhelm.

That's because, in just a few years, Roan has established herself as one of pop's most distinctive writers. All the hallmarks of her style are here: the blunt nods to modernity (“I saw your green hair”); the frank sexuality (“Till I can break routine during foreplay”); the dryly theatrical humour (“I'm movin' to Saskatchewan”). And, of course, an insistent, driving melody that reveals successive hooks with the fluidity and efficiency of synchronized swimmers. Roan's real magic trick is in her ability to weaponize familiarity and novelty in such a way that a song like “The Subway” sounds totally fresh, even if it feels like you've been singing along with Roan's cry that “she got away” for your whole life.

“Your face” was the first song Natalie Lu had ever made, and it happened nearly instantly. One night, she sang over a fuzzy rock instrumental she nicked from the producer grayskies on YouTube; the next day, it went viral. Within months, she vaulted from computer science student to a major label star.

As Wisp, Lu is a prominent case study for a new generation of shoegaze artists who've honed their technique not in basements with friends, but on a laptop and DAW. Zoomers have crowned her a latter-day shoegaze princess, the wunderkind presiding over the genre's recent boomlet. It's a resurgence that's spawned festivals, like Slide Away, and shocked 1990s pioneers out of retirement—including Slowdive, with whom Wisp toured in 2024. The new generation has unleashed plenty of freaky innovations on the style but also produced a heap of slop-gaze: indistinguishable foghorns of fuzz and reverb-stained singing destined to soundtrack aggressively stylized summer-vacation reels.

Wisp's debut, If Not Winter, tries to sculpt a world out of her ASMR-meets-arena-rock odysseys. A press release describes the album like a medieval fantasy quest, full of “holy grails from villages,” a triumph of “experimental cartography.” Our trip to these faraway lands begins by cresting the grunge-gaze volcanoes of “Sword” and “Breathe onto me,” before daylight fades to atmospheric dusk on “After dark” and “Guide light.” Then everything resets: “Latvia” stands in a town square as a bell tower chimes. The title track drops us in a patch of grass with folksy acoustic strums. Soon the reverb fog returns and we're soaring through a wind tunnel of metallic hard rock and billowing shoegaze. By the end of this musical hero's journey, Wisp seems to realize that the pain she's endured was worth it: “Told myself I wouldn't run back/But it's so different when you're all I need.”

If Not Winter is deliciously distorted and pleasing on the surface; at peak moments, like the gale-force tempest of “Breathe onto me,” the music feels electrifying. But prolonged listening reveals how insubstantial and third-hand it all is. Lu's vocal delivery hovers between a coo and a stage whisper, though it rarely delivers the sort of blissful incoherence that shoegaze and dream pop are known for. The softness makes sense on a raw acoustic ballad like “All i need,” but it feels more like rote theatrics on “Black swan,” where the raging noise practically begs her to snap out of her feathery stupor. She's previously said she wants her music to sound like she's underwater, but mostly it sounds like she's just floating somewhere.

Behind the stonewalling exteriors of great shoegaze albums lie big feelings and emo vulnerability, but this aspect of If Not Winter often feels abstract and impersonal. The protagonist of a voice memo dreams of meeting a lover at a coffee shop; the rest is cheesy love poetry (“Holding your heart/My skin rips apart/Weren't we once art?”), confusing rhymes (“Gasoline near my feet/Your tears burn through my heartbeat”), and over-the-top edginess (“Cut the light that shines in me/So my darkness is all I see”). The blandness of the vocals means that none of these lines prickle with gravitas or feeling.

Wisp's approach to older shoegaze resembles PinkPantheress' take on UK garage—rewiring it for the 2020s and layering in hushed bedroom-pop vox—but with a fraction of the sound-hopping curiosity and moxie that Pink brings to the party. Sadly, some of If Not Winter's most hypnotic passages are also its most derivative. The witchy synths flooding over highlight “Guide light” feel cribbed from Elusin's “Highway,” another surprise TikTok smash from an act with an enchanted-forest aesthetic. The crystalline static that opens “Mesmerized” smacks of My Bloody Valentine's wonky feedback sampling, but Philly shoegazers Full Body 2 do that second-hand trick better on “keygen memory.” Cool ideas flash up here and there—“Get back to me” could be a microwaved Cocteau Twins instrumental; the barely audible susurrations on “Save me now” and fluttering hook on “Breathe onto me” hit perfectly—but they fizzle out quick.

The core concept of Wisp's music—blanket-soft purrs draped over the gnarliest, most calamitous riffs—could be intoxicating if executed with more nerve and weirdness. The torrential “Black swan” just makes me want to listen to quannnic's “life imitates life,” whose anesthetized meltdown actually sounds frayed, unpredictable, and on the brink of collapse. Wisp's music simulates the thrill of reckless, no-holds-barred rock without actually fucking with the formula.

Sofia Kourtesis' dance music brims over with wistful, curative potency. The Peru-born, Berlin-based producer and singer dapples her songs with joyful synth melodies and taut rhythms, often merging electronic music's most effusive elements to poignant, heart-rending effect. Kourtesis' outstanding 2023 debut, Madres, showcased her finesse behind the boards while infusing her soundscapes with yearning and intention, featuring both protest anthems and pensive songs about caring for her cancer-stricken mother. On new EP Volver, inspired in name by Spanish icon Pedro Almodóvar's 2006 film, Kourtesis unveils a distinct, utopian vision of dance music dedicated to the LGBTQ+ community, specifically trans women, who have influenced her artistry and activism throughout the years. It's a delightfully slippery, kaleidoscopic set that moves briskly between misty and propulsive floor-fillers, each song marked by poised rhythmic tension and a sense of play.

Kourtesis found time to write Volver while on tour behind Madres, eventually recording between her homes in Germany and Peru. You can hear traces of her electrifying live sets in the EP's standout dance tracks, designed to jumpstart throngs of blissed-out clubgoers. On the ecstatic “Unidos,” she and Daphni (aka Caribou's Dan Snaith) lock into a tightly wound, acid-tinged groove that cants between hiccuping vocal samples, submerged basslines, and bleeping house melodies. The song's frolicking bounce brings out Kourtesis' mischievous streak, especially once she stitches in a sample from the radio DJ in the New York street gang movie The Warriors, recalling a ballroom emcee proselytizing over a sweaty club night just before the downbeat kicks back in. She similarly holds court on the instrumental highlight “Nitzan and Aminaa,” a rippling deep house track spritzed with bright keys and a sinuous, syncopated beat. Seemingly custom-fitted for sunrise raves, the song moves between its disparate elements like clockwork, even when it comes perilously, thrillingly close to unraveling.

On “Canela Pura,” Kourtesis reveals a newly intimate side to her lyrics. Against colorful, rounded synth pads, she sings of love and freedom in a homespun, sensual scene of domestic pleasure. The Balearic-inspired opener “Corazón,” meanwhile, offers a strong showcase for Kourtesis' soaring voice, richer and more confident since her breakthrough Fresia Magdalena EP. Daubed with meditative synth melodies and fuzzy field recordings, the song ratchets up to an uplifting chorus: “Y nadie nos va a separar/Separar/Separar” (“And no one is going to separate us/Separate us”), she insists in a bright, clear tone, transforming her words from a melancholy promise to a life-affirming rallying call for queer communities under threat.

Volver flourishes in those alchemical, heart-thumping moments. “Ballumbrosio,” named after and featuring Peruvian musical legend Miguel Ballumbrosio, is one of the EP's bolder left turns; incorporating walloping cajón, chanted vocals, and zapateo rhythms, Kourtesis rewires Afro-Peruvian traditions into her own kinetic fusion. The song is one of several in Kourtesis' catalog that shines a light on her home country's cultural heritage and impact while simultaneously asserting her personal touch. Like Madres before it, the best of Volver's shapeshifting songs tap into Kourtesis' skill at gracefully weaving together musical, political, and personal influences, capable of evoking a spectrum of emotion when you least expect it.

							By 

	Rob Sheffield



	Reneé Rapp has drastically switched up her game since her excellent 2023 debut, Snow Angel — and it's a glorious noise to hear. She spends her second album, Bite Me, enjoying what a rowdy-and-proud mess she is, for one of the year's most delightful pop blowouts, an uproarious 33-minute celebration of sex, drugs, and rock & roll. It's her first album since coming out, and damn, she's making up for lost time, with bangers full of Hollywood parties and thirsty groupies and hangovers and the mad dash to the next club. It's a concept album where the concept is “If I can't be happy, then at least I'm hot.”


	“She asked me how I like my breakfast/I told her ‘hot on the bedroom floor'” — that's a pretty typical conversation on this album, from the hell-raising rocker “Kiss It Kiss It.” But as she shrugs later in the same song, “Talking is boring,” and that's the last thing she wants to be on Bite Me. 


	Rapp broke out as an actress, in the Broadway show Mean Girls and HBO Max's The Sex Lives of College Girls, but now she dismisses her actorly past with the kiss-off, “I took my sex life with me, now that show ain't fuckin.'” She was so demure and forlorn by comparison on Snow Angel, which had wonderfully heartbroken confessions like “I Hate Boston,” one of the very best Boston-hating songs ever written. But that was a short ingenue era, because Bite Me is a lot less melancholy than Snow Angel, to say the least. These days, she's living the hedonistic high life in L.A., just young, rich, and tasteless.

	











Bite Me gets production mainly from Omer Jedi, along with other heavy hitters like Alexander 23 (who executive-produced her debut), Ryan Tedder, Julian Bunetta, Carter Lang, and others. The rock moves are straight-up Nineties grunge — like so many of today's brightest pop queens, Rapp aspires to make her own L7, Hole, and Garbage bangers. Party-hearty anthems like “Leave Me Alone” hit like old-school Sunset Strip rock sleaze updated for the sapphic pop explosion of our moment — as if David Lee Roth or Bret Michaels got reborn as Gen Z lesbian icons.

	Hell, she doesn't even make it out of the first verse of the opening song before she's rhyming “Wear my jeans so low, I show my little back dimples” with “Even line my lips just to match my nipples.” It takes her all the way to the end of the song to end up in bed with a couple of her exes — “the three of us together, that's a real tongue-twister” — and that's honestly one of the album's longest celibate stretches.


	Practically every song explodes with one-liners that demand to be quoted, from “Don't handle me with care when you're pulling my hair” to “Funny, because it didn't feel like ‘friends' on the kitchen floor.” “At Least I'm Hot” is a Seventies disco tribute featuring a cameo from her real-life guitar-hero girlfriend Towa Bird, as they chitchat their flirtatious banter in the studio. This power couple's sensibilities match each other perfectly; they're basically the Cher and Greg Allman for a whole new era of Hollywood rock-star debauchery. 


	“I'm just a little bit shy,” Rapp claims in “Shy,” a slightly dubious-sounding confession in a rocker where she chants, “Come on and cross my heart and hope to die/I'm thinking somewhere in between your thighs.” As on the rest of Bite Me, she doesn't sound like she's anywhere near shy's area code. “I'm violent when I'm drinking,” she boasts. “I'm violent when I'm sober, too/I'm useful in a bar fight/But my hands work differently on you.” 


	“Good Girl” is Eighties-style synth-pop, not a long way off from Stacey Q's unjustly forgotten 1988 mall-disco classic “Good Girl.” Rapp remembers how she used to be such a responsible adult (“sunsets and yoga, safe sex and no drugs”), ready to leave the party early and get a healthy night's sleep, until she loses her mind over the baddie across the room with the lip tattoo.

	She takes on relationship melodrama in “Why Is She Still Here?,” “I Can't Have You Around Me,” and “Mad,” grousing, “All the time you wasted being mad/We could have been cute and we could have been stupid … we could have been having sex.” In “You'd Like That Wouldn't You,” she gloats over how easy it would be to snag her ex back (“If I drive out to your spot/And my tits spilled out of my cherry top/And apologized for a lot”), promising, “I swear that I would never ever ever cheat … again.” But no matter how much she misses this ex, she admits, “The thought of getting back together makes me wanna die alone.” 

	











	The piano ballad “That's So Funny” addresses a femme fatale — the same ex that she skewered on her debut in “Poison Poison” — except this time she brings a more playful sense of vengeance. “Now everyone hates you except for my lawyer,” she sings, noting, “If you're looking for closure, you got a better shot with God than you do with me.” But it's an a change of pace on an album that usually doesn't slow down long enough for sad songs. On Bite Me, she isn't here to express regrets or mourn the past — instead, she's out to party her troubles away. And against a force of nature like Reneé Rapp, her troubles don't stand a chance.

	Former Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show for her first interview since losing the presidential election to Donald Trump. 


	In the episode aired on Thursday, Harris, who has since left office, detailed her decision to not run for governor of her native California. After a long career of being a “devout public servant,” Harris said that “for now, I don't want to go back into the system,” adding, “I think it's broken.”


	While there are “so many good people who are public servants, who do such good work, teachers and firefighters and police officers and nurses and scientists,” Harris continued, “I always believed that as fragile as our democracy is, our systems would be strong enough to defend our most fundamental principles. And I think right now that they're not as strong as they need to be, and I just don't want to for now. I don't want to go back in the system. I want to travel the country. I want to listen to people, and I don't want it to be transactional, where I'm asking for their vote.”

	











	In response, Colbert said, “As someone who is very qualified for the presidency …  To hear you say that it's broken, to hear you say that our systems aren't strong enough, is harrowing.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“Well, but it's also evident, isn't it?” Harris replied, drawing applause from the audience. “But it doesn't mean we give up,” she pressed on. “I am always going to be part of the fight.”

	











	“The power is with the people,” she said. “It is our government. It is our country. And it is important, I think, that in this moment where people have become so deflated and despondent and afraid, that those of us who have the ability — which I do right now, not being in an office where I'm campaigning for that office — to be out there and to talk with folks and remind them of their power and their importance.”


	Elsewhere, Harris detailed her 107 Days book, which chronicles her 2024 election campaign, and is set for release Sept. 23 by Simon & Schuster. When discussing her upcoming book, the former vice president acknowledged that while she predicted many of the actions Trump took in office, she did not expect the “capitulation.”

	“I believed that on some level there should be many who consider themselves to be guardians of our system and our democracy, who just capitulated,” said Harris.


	Her interview on the talk show arrives after CBS‘ abrupt decision to end The Late Show in 2026. While the network claimed the cancellation was financial, it drew backlash, since the announcement came days after Colbert slammed Paramount, which owns CBS and Comedy Central, over its decision to agree to a settlement with Trump. An array of celebrities, politicians, and fellow late-night legends have thrown their support behind Colbert following the unceremonious decision.

S
aigon, Vietnam, June 8, 1972. Just before sunrise, a small group of newsmen slid into combat fatigues and safari jackets before slipping through the waking city in a convoy of vans and rental cars. As they sped northwest, they snaked past legions of people seeking refuge, a silent cortege of poverty and misery. Burdened with all they could carry and cradling children in their arms, the civilians formed a great river of sorrow flowing south as the newsmen scurried north for their rendezvous with the war. 


	The journalists were racing some 30 miles to a town called Trảng Bàng, to cover the third day of a North Vietnamese offensive against the South Vietnamese army. For most of the them, the day would end as routinely as it had begun. Once there, the journalists loitered on the road and waited; they smoked, talked, checked equipment, then smoked and talked some more. It was shaping up to be another unexceptional day in an already decade-long war — 99 percent waiting, one percent action. Among the group were several South Vietnamese military photographers, including a trained cinematographer and photographer who sometimes freelanced for local press to supplement his meager salary. Sometime around midday, he saw a white flare drop on the town and shouted to his colleagues that an airstrike was incoming. 




	Two South Vietnamese A-1 Skyraiders released a stick of napalm canisters, which cascaded like airborne baguettes onto the primrose-yellow Cao Đài temple. But the bombers hit the wrong target. The pilots incinerated their own soldiers and a group of women and children who had been seeking sanctuary from the war in a place of prayer. 




	The village of Trảng Bàng exploded in fire and was consumed by black smoke. Soon the group of women and children, napalm on their clothes and burning into their skin, fled from the scorching temple, bolted through a field, turned onto Highway 1 headed southeast, and raced toward the line of men — troops from the army that had just bombed them and the group of journalists dressed like soldiers.

	Alan Downes, a cameraman with Independent Television News, was on his knees. He told a colleague he couldn't film what was happening before his lens, yet he managed to compose himself and capture the pain. He focused on the children in his viewfinder: a nine-year-old girl named Phan Thị Kim Phúc and four others, running toward his rolling camera, screaming.


	Kim Phúc, her brothers, and her cousins ran past Downes, who was with two other TV crews and a stills photographer — six men lined up across a two-lane highway, filming the children as they approached. In a fraction of a second, a photographer snapped what would become one of the most celebrated photographs of all time, often called “Napalm Girl” or “The Terror of War.”


	The devastating black-and-white image — so cruel it dares you to look away — has become a defining depiction of America's most brutal war: a naked girl running, her skin smoldering from napalm. The photograph captures, like few others, war's raw violence, inhumanity, and despair. It is the deliberate work of a gifted photographer who instinctively grasped what was in front of him and created a decisive image that would ricochet within hours into the world's conscience, where it still lives 53 years later. The documentation of pain and suffering would win a Pulitzer, galvanize the antiwar effort, and turn a photographer into an overnight sensation. The British war photographer Sir Don McCullin has called it the best photograph of the conflict. Susan Sontag proclaimed it “the signature Vietnam War horror-photograph.” 


	The photo has always been credited to a Vietnamese Associated Press staff photographer, Huỳnh Công “Nick” Út, who was on the road that day. Út has told many stories over the decades about the horrific attack and his work. But a few years back, rumors began circulating among my colleagues in the photojournalism community that Út did not make that image.

	For the past two years, I have been part of a team, along with award-winning producers Fiona Turner (to whom I am married) and Terri Lichstein (formerly of ABC News), reporting on the photograph's origins. Our investigation is the subject of a new independent documentary film, which I also executive-produced, called The Stringer. Multiple on-the-record sources stepped forward during our reporting to dispute the accounts of Út and the AP. We also commissioned a forensic-analysis team to examine the available data, images, and film from that day. Their conclusion: What we have been told for more than 50 years about who took the most indelible photograph of the war is unlikely to be true.




	Who took the photo does not change its profound impact, but it does alter some of what we know about the culture of the Saigon press corps during the glory days of war correspondence. And our film has caused disruption and fierce anger among veteran photographers all these decades later. Starting before The Stringer had even premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, a handful of journalists from the Vietnam era, as well as friends of Nick Út, were calling for the film to be shelved — despite never having seen it. Others have contacted employers of people who support the film, condemning their stance and threatening to sever business ties over the issue.


	This visceral reaction might be because The Stringer probes more than the authorship of a single photograph. It invites conversations about the potency and mutability of memory, our collective desire for uplifting narratives and uncomplicated heroes, and a grasping for certainties where there may be none to be found. The revised history also questions the behavior of colleagues we have put on pedestals and whose careers inspired others to follow. And it does so in the face of a photograph that is foundational, as is the period of journalism it represents. What is happening in the photograph is not in dispute, but a great deal of what happened outside of it is.


	Both Út and the AP declined to be interviewed for the film. An attorney for Út tells Rolling Stone his client “had no intention of helping Knight … by participating in Knight's defamatory efforts.” The AP says it “declined to enter a nondisclosure agreement with the filmmakers.” (In a letter from July 2024, the filmmakers asked the AP to “agree to an embargo” until “an agreed upon date of publication.”) 


	On May 6, the AP released a 97-page report that marked the culmination of what it says was its own yearlong investigation into the photograph, including analysis of footage from the scene, interviews with Út and “others in the AP office that day,” and a 3D-model reconstruction of the event. The results, according to an introductory summary: “AP has concluded that it is possible Nick Út took the photo. However, that cannot be proven definitively due to the passage of time, the death of many of the key players involved, and the limitations of technology. New findings uncovered during this investigation do raise unanswered questions, and AP remains open to the possibility that Út did not take this photo.” The summary of findings goes on to state: “AP's standards say ‘a challenged credit would be removed only if definitive evidence … showed that the person who claimed to have taken the photo did not.' All available evidence analyzed by AP does not clear that bar. Thus, the photo will remain attributed to Út.”




	In June, the Amsterdam-based nonprofit World Press Photo, which in 1973 awarded Út the Photo of the Year for “Napalm Girl,” released a report on its own five-month investigation into the photograph, which determined “its authorship cannot be definitively established.” Drawing on material from both The Stringer and the AP report, as well as its own archival research and interviews, World Press found that “the cumulative evidence strongly suggests that it is highly unlikely that Nick Út is the author of ‘The Terror of War' photograph.” The organization stripped Út's credit from the photo. (Út's attorney says World Press “never sought any input” from Út after an initial outreach — a claim the organization denies — and alleges they had “made up their mind to punish Nick Út from the start.” The attorney also cites a letter signed by 640 photographers urging World Press to rescind its decision and restore Út's credit.)


	Út's first, and for a time only, public comment after the film's release was a statement he posted to Facebook in February, which read, in part, “I took the photo of Kim Phúc. I took the other photos from that day that show her family and the devastation the war caused. No one else has the right to claim that I did not take that specific or any other photo attributed to me because I am the creator of all the work I've done since day one.” Út added that “this accusation […] is a slap in the face of everyone who dedicated their entire lives, careers to creating authentic, real and true images in very difficult situations like the Vietnam War.”


	In a statement provided to Rolling Stone, Út's lawyer disputes the findings laid out in The Stringer based on several factors, including the accounts of numerous eyewitnesses on the scene that day who still believe Út took the photo; the AP's investigation, which concluded Út could have been in position to take it; and the 50 years that passed before another photojournalist, whom he claims has a “vendetta” against Út, surfaced allegations about its origins. The statement begins with a simple declaration: “Nick Út took the famous image.” 


	THE MEN AND WOMEN who covered Vietnam as journalists were a decidedly mixed cast. There were seasoned reporters who'd covered World War II and had a hard time believing they were being misled by U.S. officials. Young Ivy Leaguers like David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan, and Fox Butterfield brought their privilege to the front. And wigged-out stoners like my friend and mentor Tim Page and his pal Sean Flynn hitched rides to the darkest zones of the war carrying Nikons, Leicas, and “uppers” and “downers.” Some photographers there were already legendary — Philip Jones Griffiths, Don McCullin, and Larry Burrows. Some were becoming so, like the female war reporters and photographers who battled prejudice and emerged on the scene, including the spectacularly courageous Australian Kate Webb, the French Catherine Leroy and Françoise Demulder, and the Americans Elizabeth Becker and Frances FitzGerald.



“Kim Phúc emerged from the smoke crying and on fire. It was very powerful.”


	The Vietnamese journalists operating in combat zones didn't include Ivy Leaguers, didn't include women, and didn't include men who could afford to go to war stoned; they had too much at stake. They reported on the disintegration of their own country during the day and managed the needs of their families at night. There were dozens of freelance and staff Vietnamese journalists crisscrossing the country for every agency and broadcaster. They were ubiquitous, indefatigable, and extraordinarily brave. The backbone of the press corps, many of them died and have been overlooked in the retelling of the war. Other than Nick Út, the Vietnamese have been mostly whitewashed from the history of the journalism of their own war.


	The regular AP reporting staff in Saigon in early 1972 comprised bureau chief Richard Pyle, American correspondents George Esper and Mike Putzel, chief Vietnamese reporter Huỳnh Minh Trinh, as well as photo editor Carl Robinson and photojournalists Lê Ngọc Cung, Đặng Văn Phước, and Út. The 1972 offensive had been wretched for AP, which was being regularly beaten by its main rival, United Press International. With four Pulitzer Prizes in Vietnam since 1963, AP wasn't accustomed to being second-best. This could be why the AP bosses sent in more manpower, including Peter Arnett, Mort Rosenblum, Yuichi “Jackson” Ishizaki, and the legendary photographer and regional chief photo editor Horst Faas. Faas' job: Beat UPI back into second place and win the photo coverage. 


	Faas was born in 1933. A child of Nazi Germany, he lived in Berlin and, in his own telling, was a member of the Hitler Youth in World War II. He once told me his trench was overrun by Russians who killed or executed everyone around him and that he was saved by a Russian sergeant who told him to go home to his mother. He spent the following years living in a divided, impoverished postwar society. Photojournalism offered him an escape route, and he seized it. Faas had a colossal aura in Vietnam — Falstaffian, fueled by fine wine and refined food, able to entertain for hours with his great sense of humor. He could be distant, gruff, and intimidating, and he was also capable of great generosity, loyalty, and compassion. He covered the Vietnam War for 12 years, proving instrumental in four of AP's eventual five Pulitzer Prizes from the war and helping to create what became a mythical news bureau. If the war in Vietnam marked the pinnacle of war journalism, and AP had a legendary perch in that war, much of it was due to Faas.


	I met Faas in London in the early 1990s, when I was a young photographer working in the war in Bosnia. He was then in his sixties and had mellowed, but he had a real presence. He was at the time head of AP Photos for Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, and was close to retirement. He invoked admiration and respect in young photographers who had worked for him during the Balkan wars. He was a company man: He loved AP, and AP came first — but if you worked hard and delivered the goods, he would back you in the field. By then, he wore a suit to work, enjoyed long, boozy lunches in El Vino on Fleet Street, rode his Brompton bike to the office, and relished his role as a revered elder statesman.


	Faas, Tim Page, and I worked together to train young photographers in Vietnam in the early 2000s. You could tell that Faas loved giving back, and he was a great teacher, direct and concise. His commitment to Vietnam to the end of his life was as unequivocal as his commitment to journalism and the AP.




	In the years following the war, Nick Út was accruing a kind of global celebrity that was rare for a photographer. I never met Út back then, but I was aware of the awards and international acclaim he was earning. For “Napalm Girl,” he had been celebrated with a Pulitzer Prize, the World Press Photo of the Year, the Overseas Press Club of America award, the George Polk Award, and, later, the U.S. National Medal of Arts. He met heads of state, the pope, and the queen of England. The AP posted him to Tokyo, and then Los Angeles, where he worked for the next 40 years. He seemed to me a worthy advocate for photojournalism as he traveled around the world with Kim Phúc, a United Nations ambassador and advocate for peace. Now, in retirement, he still travels the globe giving speeches and presentations.


	In early November 2022, I was asked to teach a workshop in Hanoi the following spring with Nick Út and the storied war photographer James Nachtwey, in memory of Tim Page, who had recently died. It didn't take long to decide to go. Vietnam is where my children come from and has special meaning in my family. I was keen to reconnect with my old friend James, who I hadn't seen for a while, to meet Nick for the first time, and to do something for young Vietnamese photographers in memory of my old mentor Tim.


	But before embarking to Vietnam, on the 23rd of December, I was at my Massachusetts home when I happened to check my junk-mail folder. I opened a message that had sat there for nearly a month.


Dear Gary:



Through Mort Rosenblum from a while back, I am wondering if we could discuss the Napalm Girl photo and its provenance. I may be of assistance — and vice versa.


Best regards,Carl Robinson


	Carl Robinson had been the AP photo editor in Vietnam in June 1972. He had typed out the caption on the print of Kim Phúc that was transmitted from Saigon on June 8. Robinson was referring to information that I and a mutual friend, the former AP bureau chief Mort Rosenblum, had discussed on another, earlier teaching gig in Vietnam. Robinson was in Vietnam at the time, and recalls visiting the workshop and talking to Mort. My memory of those interactions is incomplete, but I recall Mort telling me that the AP photo editor working in Saigon in June 1972 had recently told him that Út hadn't taken the photograph known as “Napalm Girl.” Mort and I continued to talk about this when we met over the following year or two, but we all moved on; rumors aren't uncommon in our field.


	I responded to Robinson's email, asking for context. A lengthy follow-up message mentioned Faas, Út, photographers for the South Vietnamese army (ARVN), and Peter Arnett, an AP journalist who had won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize in International Reporting for his work in Vietnam. Robinson's detail was extraordinary:


We had several rolls of black & white film of the incident, Nick Út's and those of three Vietnamese freelancers, often official ARVN photographers, out making extra money.   


As usual, under Horst's system, each roll was meticulously logged in with a double set of stick-on numbers: first beside the photographer's name in a school exercise book and second on the actual roll of film for processing in the darkroom. 


The two pictures Jackson had already chosen and printed up focused on the girl — one full-frontal running towards the camera, and [another] from the side as she ran past […] We both hesitated.   


AP had a thing — not actual policy — about showing any nudity, even boys and girls. […] Well, the side shot, then. Discreet but still dramatic, Jackson and I agreed. As I prepared to type up the caption for the radio-photo and short-wave transmission to Tokyo, I double-checked the strips of film negatives and their numbers for the byline on our chosen picture. The side shot was from Nick Út and the full-on shot from a freelance photographer.


Then, Horst Faas walked back into the photo office from his long lunch down at Le Royal with his longtime colleague Peter Arnett, who was also back in Saigon for the Easter Offensive. Horst looked at what Jackson and I were doing. As I pointed out, we really couldn't see [using] the girl's naked frontage, which even seemed to show pubic hair.   


Pointing straight at that picture, Horst ordered, “No, we will go with this one.” He checked the negative, ordered a tighter crop, and sent Jackson back into the darkroom for a new print. 



…I began typing the caption on our hulking Underwood typewriter. SAI, for Saigon, a hyphen and then a number; the dateline; the date of June 8; and a tight three lines about the picture. Horst hovered over my right shoulder as I typed.   


Typically, at the end of each radio-photo caption came the photographer's by-line with an “stf/name” for a Staffer or “str/name” for a Stringer, or freelancer. And that's when Faas leant into my ear and ordered me to put Nick Út's name on the picture — and I just did it. I didn't argue back. 


	Reading Robinson's second email, I understood that if what he said was true, if the name on this photo had been changed deliberately, this was of enormous importance. Public trust is fundamental to the value of journalism, and if the press wants to hold the rest of society to account, it has to start with itself. (Út's attorney condemns Robinson's “50 year + delay” in making his claim public, and accuses him of “intentionally waiting” until Faas and other “key witnesses had passed.” He also alleges that Robinson has “clear animus toward Nick Út and the AP, as disclosed in his own book and other correspondence.”)


	I couldn't let my doubts go this time. Further examination was needed. Importantly, if Út didn't take the photograph, who did? With Fiona Turner and Terri Lichstein, I embarked on an intense preliminary investigation. We read every book and essay on the matter we could find, reviewed all of the available photographs and film, and talked to as many eyewitnesses as we could trace, including David Burnett, who was then a young photographer on assignment for The New York Times, and Mort Rosenblum. We wanted as much information as we could get before we went to Vietnam, where I hoped to teach the workshop and interview — and perhaps challenge — Robinson.


	In March 2023, I arrived in Hanoi with James Nachtwey and Nick Út. It was awkward; I considered talking to Út about the accusations, but until I had interviewed Robinson and determined whether what he said was credible, it was premature to confront Út. I would just be repeating a rumor. The following week, I flew to Ho Chi Minh City to meet Turner and Lichstein and to interview Robinson, who was by then close to 80.


	Years earlier, Robinson had created a Google Group, Vietnam Old Hacks, an online forum for veteran Vietnam War reporters dozens of members strong; his claims that Út didn't take the photo, which until then had been shared only between small groups of colleagues, resurfaced there. Those who question why Robinson took so long to come forward, and why others have been so reluctant to speak, might find some answers in those pages. Former Newsweek correspondent Paul Brinkley-Rogers reacted to Robinson's allegation by likening him to “a snake hissing in the dark.” Journalist Barry Fox had responded with a bit of catnip: “Alan Downes, the ITN cameraman who was there and shot the news film of the ‘Napalm Girl' story, denied that Út was even there. Downes told me this shortly after Út won the award. He was as much baffled as anything else.” Peter Arnett — who wasn't on the road in Trảng Bàng or in the bureau when the film was being processed in the darkroom — had tried to discourage Robinson in 2009, writing, “You must be aware that the AP with all its resources, and Horst and his many friends, along with Nick Út himself and his Vietnamese associates, and all those AP staffers who take pride in their Vietnam service, will do everything possible to discredit you and your assertions, and challenge all of what you say.” (AP tells Rolling Stone, “It's clear from the time and resources AP has dedicated to investigating this claim that we've taken the question about the authorship of its image extremely seriously.”)



“This accusation is a slap in the face of everyone who dedicated their lives to creating images in difficult situations like the Vietnam War.”


	Downes was an esteemed cameraman with ITN for decades. His harrowing footage from Trảng Bàng had enhanced his reputation. But Downes had died in 1996 and could not confirm for us his bafflement. That Út was there is beyond doubt; we see him in photographs and film from that day, and we know he shot many photos while there. But buried in Downes' footage was a piece of evidence that has been hidden in plain view for 50 years.


	Downes had filmed many of the journalists present at the scene of the photograph. (Those who weren't in his film are in still photographs made that day.) In particular, Downes was one of the six people in the group of newsmen closest to fleeing civilians, all of whom were capturing Kim Phúc and the other children as they ran toward them.


	Kim Phúc has written powerfully about her experiences, and makes it clear she believes Út took the photo, stating that one of her uncles and other journalists and eyewitnesses have told her so. In a statement issued in January, she said, in part, “Nick took the image and he deserves the credit he has received. He is a good man who fully deserves to be treated with respect, dignity, and kindness. I am so thankful he was not just a photographer. He is my hero for putting down his camera […] and saving my life.” 


	She has also noted that she has no memory of who took the famous photograph. In her autobiography, Fire Road, she writes, “The sum of what I know from that day and the days to follow, I owe to Uncle Út. His memories became my memories.” It is a poignant statement, not just in what it shows about the depth of her trauma, but also the kindness and generosity she feels has been shown to her by Út.


	We began to compile a list of the surviving eyewitnesses to the moment, which included Út; Hoàng Văn Danh, a freelancer sending photos to UPI; Fox Butterfield of The New York Times; Donald Kirk of the Chicago Tribune;  David Burnett; Trần Văn Thân, an NBC soundman; Christopher Wain, the ITN TV correspondent who worked with Downes; and a man in a white shirt, black trousers, and a black vest, who we were told went by the name of Nghệ.




	WHILE ÚT REFUSED MULTIPLE requests to talk to me, he has been interviewed many times about the day's events, and his account is widely available. Although his story has become accepted as fact, he has told slightly different variations, embellishing some details over time. In a more recent telling — an opinion piece he wrote for The Washington Post in June 2022 — Út offers this description:


When the bombs exploded, we didn't know whether anyone had been injured. All morning, the village had seemed empty. But many people were hiding inside the village temple.


As we came closer, we saw people fleeing the napalm. I was horrified when I saw a woman with her left leg badly burned. I can still see so vividly the old woman carrying a baby who died in front of my camera and another woman carrying a small child with his skin coming off.


Then I heard a child screaming, “Nong qua! Nong qua!” Too hot! Too hot! I looked through my Leica viewfinder to see a young girl who had pulled off her burning clothes and was running toward me. I started taking pictures of her.


Then she yelled to her brother that she thought she was dying and wanted some water. I instantly put my cameras down so I could help her. I knew that was more important than taking more photos. I took my canteen for her to drink and poured water on her body to cool her off, but it created more pain for her. I didn't know that when people get burned so badly, you're not supposed to put water on them.


	One problem with Út's account is the camera. He has frequently told the story of using a spare Leica M2 to make this decisive frame. But the AP investigation found that the camera used to make the photograph was “unlikely” to have been a Leica, and especially not the camera Út donated to the Science Museum in London, where it was displayed as the camera that took the famous photo. Different brands of cameras produce slightly different-sized negatives, and by examining the dimensions of the negative, AP determined that “Napalm Girl” was “likely” made with a Pentax. A Pentax and a Leica M2 bear little resemblance to each other and, for a professional photographer, would be difficult to confuse.


	Út's attorney tells Rolling Stone that Út inherited two Pentax cameras from his brother, a photographer who had been killed on assignment for AP, and “carried [one of them] every day as a talisman.” He continues, “Nick Út has explained that the day the photo was taken, Horst Faas complimented him and told him it was a great Leica picture. At the time, Nick was 21 years old and certainly listened to his boss and mentor. He knew Horst was a Leica proponent and accepted Horst's statement. Nick used multiple cameras that day and turned in eight rolls. He could not possibly know in the chaos of that day which roll came from which camera.”




	How Faas would have been able to differentiate a Leica negative from a Pentax negative with his naked eye is difficult to fathom; they are nearly indistinguishable but for a difference in size of fractions of millimeters. 


	Another wrinkle in Út's account is the timeline. In the past, he's claimed he was photographing the elder woman and, through his viewfinder, saw Kim Phúc running down the road. Yet an examination of photographs and footage from the day indicates that Kim Phúc came out of the village before the elder woman, and she fled very soon after the napalm hit. As Kim Phúc runs toward the camera, the smoke from the burning fuel is still so black it is not even possible to see the Cao Đài temple. By the time the elder woman came down the road carrying the baby, the wind — which historical weather reports indicate was at its strongest right after the bombing — had dispersed most of the smoke, and the temple had become visible. In ITN's film footage, we see that Kim Phúc and the children have run past the camera significantly before the elder woman comes into view. Út's photographs of the elder woman appear to have been made after Kim Phúc ran down the road, not before. 


	Út's attorney tells Rolling Stone, “Seeing all the footage and other images that have now been shown to Nick, he is convinced he was confused by the chaotic events that unfolded that day as to the sequence.” Being confused in combat is understandable; it happens to many of us, and it might suggest the possibility that this is not the only important detail about which Út could be confused. 


	In the films and photographs made that day, Út is visible wearing his distinctive helmet with a tab sticking out of it, a flak jacket with “AP” written on the back, short sleeves, his camera bag, poncho, and watch. Burnett has often noted how his friend Út took the photo while he, Burnett, missed it because he was rewinding his film. He's said he recalls seeing Út run up the road with Newsweek stringer Alex Shimkin. Burnett has repeatedly said he did not see who took the photograph, but he is convinced Út did, saying that, to his recollection, Út was the only person in the right position to have gotten the shot. Butterfield, who also maintains Út took the photograph, told us in August 2024, “Kim Phúc emerged from the smoke crying and on fire. It was very powerful. Not sure who else was there. I wasn't paying attention to [Út], I didn't know him at that time. I was moving all the time, because the scene was moving, and we didn't know what was going to happen next.” 


	When pressed, neither Burnett nor Butterfield is able to say they actually witnessed Út take the photograph, and no one else has come forward to say definitively that they saw him take the photo. Burnett has referred to a lone photographer we can see beyond the concertina wire earlier in the sequence as Út, which might make it possible for Út to have been in the right place at the right time. But that is not Út; we believe it's a military photographer, later identified by the AP as Huỳnh Công Phúc. (Both AP and World Press, in their own investigations, concluded based on available footage that Huỳnh Công Phúc could plausibly have been in the right area to take the “Napalm Girl” photograph, though no one has to this point come forward claiming he did. Huỳnh Công Phúc died in 2009.) The military photographer is carrying a bag and wearing camouflage, not the U.S. military olive-green that Út was wearing; he wasn't wearing a flak jacket, as Út was, and he bears no resemblance to the person Út identified as himself that day years later on his own Instagram feed. And besides, the picture of that lone photographer beyond the wire is credited to Út in the AP archive, in which case Út couldn't be in the photograph. We know the TV crews and photographer who made the images of Kim Phúc all moved beyond the concertina wire. In one intriguing photo, we see a photographer in a white shirt and black vest photographing the children as they run past the TV crews, putting him in an ideal place to have taken the photograph moments before.


	HOW DO YOU FIND SOMEONE maybe called Nghệ with nothing but a 50-year-old photo of a small figure whose face is partly hidden by a camera? We weren't even sure of the name, which was given to Carl Robinson's wife by a Vietnamese AP photographer who claimed it belonged to the person who had really taken the photo. 




	Robinson, his wife Kim-Dung, Terri Lichstein, and the Vietnamese reporter we hired to work with us, Lê Vân, came up with an idea to hire a prominent local blogger who had an extensive network through his Facebook page, both in Vietnam and in the diaspora, to find Nghệ. In March 2023, we agreed on a fee of $1,000, and the blogger, Nguyễn Ngọc Vinh, posted the photo along with a message asking anyone who thought they might know the man in the white shirt, dark trousers, and dark vest — who might be called Nghệ — to please contact him.


	Three days later, a retired film technician from Los Angeles, Chinh Dao, responded. The man in the photo was his friend Nguyễn Thành Nghệ. Chinh and his brother Thang had met Nghệ in the late Eighties and worked with him at FotoKem in L.A., printing films for Hollywood studios, where Nghệ spent much of his postwar life building a career to support his family in California. Chinh later told us, “I hope, I hope that story is going to come out soon. My friend Mr. Nghệ has been waiting for the whole of his life.” 


	Chinh sent a message to his brother in Los Angeles, who called Nghệ right away. “Really, some people are looking for me?” Nghệ said, according to Thang. Then, says Lê Vân, Nghệ, who was in the Mekong Delta on vacation, called the blogger: “I am the one you are looking for.”  




	Nghệ was by then 85 years old. In an interview the following day, Lê Vân found him lucid but frail. The story she heard from him seemed to corroborate and add to Robinson's. When asked which photos he took on June 8, 1972, he said, “The one with the naked little girl whose clothes were burned.” Lê Vân asked him, “The one that won the Pulitzer later on?” “Yes,” he replied. When she returned home to Ho Chi Minh City, Lê Vân says, she burst into tears and then called us.


	We intensified our effort to reconstruct the narrative of June 8, 1972. Then, inevitably, things started to go sideways. The blogger we had hired understood the impact of what we had found and threatened to publish the story of Nghệ in Vietnamese on Facebook unless we gave him $10,000. We didn't, and he published what he had. While the foreign press didn't notice, Nick Út did, and promptly posted a photo of himself in Trảng Bàng on his Instagram page. Út then went on Bolsa TV — a U.S.-based Vietnamese-language media organization — and defended himself. Separately, he also proclaimed that AP would sue anyone who challenged his authorship. Soon after, the network of veteran Vietnam correspondents we had been talking to closed ranks. Portentously, it began to get ugly as friends and colleagues of Faas attacked Robinson's credibility.


	In his appearance on Bolsa TV, Út referred to Nghệ as a driver for NBC, but he was neither a hired driver nor had a job for NBC. Nghệ was freelancing on spec and had NBC accreditation. Like many photographers in wars before and since, he needed accreditation to access combat zones if he was working as a freelancer; at the time, news bureaus would often give them out in exchange for a first look at your material. Nghệ says he drove to Trảng Bàng that day and took Út as a back-seat passenger, then drove directly back to Saigon after the work was over, also with Út in the back seat. This may explain why Út refers to him as a driver.


	As our reporting soon bore out, Nghệ was far more than a driver. Piecing together information from him, his children, and Department of Defense records, we formed a picture of his life and his dedication to the craft of making pictures.


	Born to his father's mistress, Nghệ was raised by a surrogate family that received money from his father. Around age 18, he left home to study cinematography at college, and around the late 1950s, he started work as a cameraman and photographer for the South Vietnamese army. He received signals training from the U.S. military in New Jersey in 1961 and then returned to Vietnam. Later in the war, because of that training, he was seconded, or essentially loaned, by the South Vietnamese army to the CIA PsyOps program transmitting broadcasts to North Vietnamese forces for “Mother Vietnam,” a propaganda unit of the CIA.


	By 1970, Nghệ had become a first sergeant and an experienced war photographer. While his civilian colleagues donned tailor-made combat fatigues, he would sometimes slip out of the office in street clothes and photograph the war to earn extra money to support his three children by selling photos to local newspapers. He says he carried a Pentax Spotmatic — the type of camera AP's extensive investigation suggests was used to take the photo — loaded with black-and-white Kodak Tri-X film, and used a 50mm lens. He also used a Bolex film camera, he told us, so he could double up and sell film to the TV networks.




	June 8, 1972, was the first and last time Nghệ says he ever sold photos to AP.


	It was Nghệ's brother-in-law, the NBC soundman Trần Văn Thân, who recounts going with Nghệ to sell the photos to AP. Thân was one of the six men in the first group of newsmen closest to the Cao Đài temple who were filming Kim Phúc and the children running toward them.


	Thân was one of the last people we were able to track down and interview. He summarized the material from our two interviews in November 2023 and May 2024 in a letter he sent me shortly thereafter, describing the events on the road. “While we were filming,” he wrote, “Nguyễn Thành Nghệ stood on my left side and took a photo of the burned girl. After finishing, I said to Nguyễn Thành Nghệ, ‘Today, there were no reporters from the news agencies UPI and AP here. Give me the film; I'll help sell it to AP.'”

“You must be aware that the AP with all its resources . . . will do everything possible to discredit you and your assertions.”


	Thân explained to us that “the office of NBC News and the news agency AP [were] just a wall apart, so we [were] very familiar with each other.” Thân says he went with Nghệ to sell his photos to AP and feels certain about the role of Horst Faas in what followed: “He selected the photo of the burned child and returned all the other film rolls to me, giving me 20 dollars for the photo he chose. Along with it, there was one [print] picture of the burned child. I handed everything to Nghệ.”


	Thân describes the “surprise, shock, and fury” he and Vietnamese colleagues felt when, a few months later, the photo of the burned child won an international award for Út. Thân says he dared not utter a word about the deceit at the time. The directors of AP and NBC News were, he explains, very close. “I had to stay silent; otherwise, I could lose my job and my source of income,” he told us, his voice at once plaintive and matter-of-fact. “How would I support my family?” 


	One of several reasons Arnett, Burnett, Butterfield, and others are convinced Út took the photograph could be that, by their own accounts, Faas told them so. None of them have ever claimed they definitively saw who pressed the shutter. In books and interviews, they have shared how they heard Faas congratulate Út in the AP office. Burnett and Arnett may have witnessed that, but if Faas' own telling of the story is to be believed, they would have arrived too late to see the film being delivered to the AP bureau and being processed, and neither of them claim to have seen the caption being typed. They just have Faas' word. 




	Carl Robinson is not close with Út's most vocal supporters, and is something of an outsider among expat reporters who covered the war, but that doesn't disqualify him as a credible witness. Nor does his self-acknowledged drug use, which many Út supporters have cited in an effort to discredit him. (If his recreational drug use in the early Seventies in Vietnam makes him unreliable, where does that leave the rest of the press corps?) What is certain is that the truth cannot be established solely by what took place in the AP Bureau; it must come, ultimately, from the road to Trảng Bàng.


	Fortunately, that road is littered with evidence in the form of photographs and film.


	Acknowledging the distance in time between what happened in a small village in Vietnam in 1972 and now, and understanding that there are so many conflicting accounts by Út, Faas, Nghệ, Thân, and other eyewitnesses, our filmmaking team engaged the French NGO Index Investigation, one of the world's leading independent forensic-investigation companies, to examine all of the data and evidence we had gathered. Relying on a careful review of the available documentation — including photographs taken that day, aerial images, U.S. satellite imagery of Trảng Bàng from 1972, video recordings, and information about the height, clothing, and equipment of journalists on the scene — the firm created a 3D model in which all of the relevant players were positioned along the axis of the Trảng Bàng road. Their movements were reconstructed in chronological order. 


	The Index report referred to a “frame-matching” technique that allowed precise positioning of various people present on the road that day at different times. It used still images and film that show Nghệ in his white shirt and dark vest, the film crews with their cameras and sound equipment, the tall ITN reporter Christopher Wain, Út wearing his distinct helmet with the tag, his AP flak jacket, short sleeves, a bulging camera bag on his left hip, poncho, and watch, and reconstructed the scene. Index initially concluded that just seconds after the picture was taken, Út was located roughly 200 feet away from that spot; following the AP report, which introduced new information, Index revised its estimate of the distance to roughly 75 meters or 250 feet.


	Francesco Sebregondi of Index says, “Nick Út's presence at that specific moment in the ITN news video makes it highly implausible that he could have taken the ‘Napalm Girl' photograph. Indeed, in order to shoot ‘Napalm Girl,' and appear in that frame of the ITN footage walking toward the scene he would have had to cover a distance of approximately 75 meters in a matter of seconds, and do so outside of the ITN camera's frame. 


	“This seems very unlikely,” Sebregondi continues, “and editorially, doesn't make any sense that he would want to move away from the action. We can conclude that it is highly unlikely that Nick Út took the ‘Napalm Girl' photograph.” Út's attorney dismisses the Index findings as “junk science,” citing the AP's analysis, which posits that the distance Út would have covered was less than 75 meters. (AP's investigation disputes some elements of Index's report, but the core findings were supported by World Press Photo's investigation.) 


	CREDIBLE JOURNALISM RELIES on credible authors, credible editors, and credible news organizations. If, as our reporting and the Index forensics suggest, Nick Út didn't take the photograph, why wouldn't he have said anything? Út wouldn't talk to the filmmaking team, so we haven't been able to ask him. But one theory concerns the power and authority of Horst Faas. If Carl Robinson, an established photo editor and a fellow American, didn't feel confident enough to challenge Faas, why would the young Vietnamese photographer Út, the most junior person in the office? Robinson maintains he changed the byline exclusively at Faas' bidding, suggesting that Út had no agency and was never consulted on the matter. 




	How could AP bosses in New York have allowed such an egregious offense to happen? The agency proudly calls itself “the most trusted source of fast, accurate, unbiased news.” AP HQ would not have known at the time who took the photo, and would have trusted their people in the field, just as other news organizations would. According to a post Peter Arnett wrote in November 2015 on Vietnam Old Hacks, modern-day senior AP editors had by then heard the rumors about this photo and dismissed them. (Arnett did not reply to the filmmakers' request for an interview, and AP says that “there has been no serious challenge to this photo's authorship until now.”) 


	And how could Faas have knowingly perpetrated such deception? This is the question that, in my mind, deserves the greatest scrutiny. Faas writes that he was returning from lunch with Arnett when he first saw the photo. He has also written he was returning from an assignment. Memory can play tricks on all of us, but his recounting of the moment he first saw the photo doesn't change: “When I got back to the office,” he wrote, “I glanced at films edited by others, not out of lack of trust, but because I thought a second look was often helpful. And there, without a doubt, the best photo was the one that had been discarded. Richard Pyle, then bureau chief, remembers me saying, ‘I think we've got the next Pulitzer!' … The film was processed by one of the editors. He did not select this photo because the little girl was naked, and the rule at AP was to not show a naked young girl, especially a pubescent girl. That editor, Carl Robinson, fearing that the photo was too risky and wouldn't get by the New York office, suggested other photos, all of which were good but just hovered around the subject.”

“I'm voicing a truth that has weighed heavily on my heart for over half a century.”


	Faas' instinct for prize-winning photographs was acute. He took credit for training Malcolm Browne, who photographed the image of a self-immolating Buddhist monk in 1963, and, in 1968, he'd picked out Eddie Adams' photograph of Brig. Gen. Nguyễn Ngọc Loan executing a Viet Cong prisoner. He won his first Pulitzer for photography from Vietnam in 1965 and his second from Bangladesh in 1972.


	Faas is the only person who knows why he allegedly told Robinson to change the name from Nguyễn Thành Nghệ to Nick Út. But Faas is dead. So what could have motivated him? We know the decision was made quickly. The film could not have been in the bureau for much more than three hours, and Faas was at lunch for some of that time, so perhaps he didn't think it through; perhaps it was impulsive. He would have had no loyalty to the stringer Nghệ, having never met him, and Nghệ says he had never sold an image to AP before that day. Faas was, however, loyal to Út, a young staffer he'd mentored after Út's brother, Huỳnh Thanh Mỹ, was killed while working for AP a few years prior. Giving this image to Út wouldn't make up for his brother's death, but is it possible Faas thought it would make Út more secure at AP? 


	As AP director of photography Hal Buell recounts in From Hell to Hollywood, a 2021 book about Út, Faas had already sent a message to New York alerting them to the idea that this photo would be “an icon of all time.” He knew it had the potential to win prizes, and prizes — like being wounded in action — burnish a journalist's reputation. There was another consideration: Faas, along with Arnett, Mort Rosenblum, and Jackson, had been flown into Saigon to support the bureau because — according to Robinson — AP was “losing the play” to UPI. This was not a moment for an “icon of all time” to be transmitted with the byline of a stringer, underscoring that the AP staffer had missed the photo. That could signal to New York that the bureau had failed. Faas wasn't used to failure.




	Tim Page once claimed to me that Faas had put his name on the work of Vietnamese photographers and taken credit for them as his own. Page was one of my mentors, and his word mattered to me. That wasn't the first time I had heard such a story from one photographer about another; the profession — like most others — is not free of jealousy. Nevertheless, while misattribution never happened to me, I had seen it happen to other young photographers, especially local photographers, as I was building my own career, and the allegation didn't seem implausible. At a meeting in June 2024, the widow of French photographer Michel Laurent had told me that her husband left AP for the French agency Gamma after Faas transmitted images from Bangladesh in 1972 co-bylined with his name and Laurent's. The photographs won the Pulitzer Prize, with both men's names on them. She claimed to me that the photos were 100 percent Laurent's. (Pulitzer tells Rolling Stone, “This is the first we are hearing” of such an allegation.)


	Had Faas grown to rationalize occasionally changing the credit on photographs over nearly a decade of war? Would this explain how he might have taken something from a stringer he didn't know, given AP and the younger brother of his dead colleague the kudos, and enhanced his standing at the agency?


	WE MAY NEVER KNOW why Nick Út was seemingly given something he never asked for. But we know that countless Vietnamese photographers and reporters worked in anonymity during the Vietnam War, not out of choice but because their work was not credited at all, or was credited to others. To this day, dozens of gifted and courageous Vietnamese photographers, cameramen, and reporters remain unknown and unrecognized for the brilliant work they produced. They accepted that status quo because they had no choice. The politics of race and power, and the suffocating presence of the U.S. military, meant they were outsiders in their own country; they knew no one would listen, because they weren't equal. Some of them still don't feel safe talking now.


	Among those outsiders is the last person we tracked down from the full-frame version of the photograph of Kim Phúc that the AP sent around the world. A Vietnamese photographer, he took photos of the children as they came across the field toward the road but then ran out of film. Repeatedly mistaken by Fox Butterfield and others for David Burnett in the famous photograph, he can be seen on the right, wearing a helmet and urgently rewinding his camera. His name is Hoàng Văn Danh, a freelancer who sold photos to UPI, AP's main competitor. 


	In September 2024, after all our emails with Carl Robinson, after all our interviews, after meeting Nghệ, after Index's forensics investigation, we met Văn Danh. We showed him the photograph and asked him if he recalls Nick Út standing next to him.




	“Nick? No, no, no,” he answered emphatically. “He wasn't there, he was way back.”


	Of those who had special knowledge of that day, Nghệ's brother-in-law, the NBC sound engineer Trần Văn Thân, who was standing next to Nghệ when the photograph was taken, was one of the most torn by the course of events. Thân says he sold those images on Nghệ's behalf to the AP, but his account had never entered the public record. (In fact, he had become estranged from Nghệ after the latter separated from Thân's sister.) The letter he wrote to us in fall 2024 with details of the day ends as a lament:


Though [I] remained silent, I couldn't forget that incident. Until today, more than half a century later, this incident still lingers bitterly in my heart. It's the truth, why hide it?


I've never spoken this truth out loud. My soul is still troubled, restless, because I feel like I am someone who concealed the truth!


Today, I'm telling this truth. I saw Nguyễn Thành Nghệ taking the photo of the burned child with my own eyes.


	After decades, Trần Văn Thân released his burden: “I'm writing these words, remembering and voicing a truth that has weighed heavily on my heart for over half a century.” 




	I asked Nghệ how he felt when he learned his name may have been deliberately removed from the photograph. He replied, “I'm just sad, not knowing what to do. My life is not equal to them, so I lost, there's nothing more I can do.” Since The Stringer premiered at Sundance in January, there have been suggestions by some journalists that this story should not have been told; they posit that in this moment when journalism is being so savagely undermined by the very forces it seeks to hold to account, the last thing we need is to reveal our own failures. But journalism is essential to democracy, and it is in the interests of both the press and the public that trust in the Fourth Estate is repaired. That can't be done if we choose to ignore accusations of wrongdoing in our own profession. The passage of time may increase the anguish of self-examination, but the search for truth is always worth the cost.

	President Donald Trump's primary Super PAC has raked in over $200 million this year, with the donations ranging from unseemly to objectively funny. 


	Perhaps the most notable donor to the group, MAGA Inc., is Elon Musk, who gave $5 million in late June despite publicly feuding with the president ever since he left his role leading Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. The world's richest man made his contribution on June 27, several days before Trump publicly mulled deporting him. 


	Another comical name: Jared Isaacman, who had been Trump's nominee to lead NASA. The president decided to pull his nomination because he previously donated to Democrats, yet Isaacman gave $1 million a month later. 


	It's not all fun and games, though. There was plenty of money to be found from billionaires, fossil fuel companies and executives, cryptocurrency firms and investors, health care behemoths, big banks, and other businesses with vested financial interests in policy decisions coming out of Trump's administration, according to MAGA Inc.'s filing on Thursday. (Musk, for his part, remains a massive government contractor.)

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The single biggest donor to MAGA Inc. since the start of the year is Jeff Yass, who gave $15 million in March. Yass' financial firm owns a big stake in the Chinese parent company of TikTok. Trump has allowed the platform to continue operating in the U.S. despite Congress passing legislation last year banning TikTok from doing so unless it's sold. Trump has twice signed executive orders extending the deadline. 

	











	MAGA Inc. received a combined $25 million in February from pipeline giant Energy Transfer LP and its CEO Kelcy Warren. On the first day of his second term, Trump rescinded Joe Biden's executive order blocking the permit for Energy Transfer's controversial Keystone XL Pipeline. “We want the Keystone XL Pipeline built!” Trump posted on Truth Social a few days after the donations.


	America's largest health insurer, UnitedHealthcare, donated $5 million to MAGA Inc. in January, days before Trump took office. The embattled insurer, which has been reeling in the wake of the murder of its CEO, is being investigated by the Trump Justice Department over its Medicare billing practices.

	The Super PAC received $5 million in February from Extremity Care, a company that sells so-called skin substitute bandages. In April, the Trump administration delayed a Biden administration policy that would limit Medicare spending on the wildly expensive bandages, which cost the essential health program billions of dollars each year. 


	As Trump and his family build a massive crypto fortune, he has aggressively pushed the industry's interests in Washington and sought to deregulate the exceedingly risky assets. He recently signed legislation creating new, light-touch regulations for so-called stablecoins, crypto assets with a price pegged to the U.S. dollar. 


	Crypto interests have poured money into his Super PAC. Foris DAX Inc., better known as crypto.com, donated $10 million. Blockchain.com gave $5 million.


	Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the crypto investors who lead the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, have each donated $3 million. Gemini Trust Company, a crypto exchange launched by billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has donated $1.4 million; the twins kicked in another $1 million together. Crypto investment firm Paradigm Operations gave $1.2 million. 


	​​Kelly Loeffler, Trump's Small Business Administration chief, donated $2.5 million to MAGA Inc. Warren Stephens, Trump's ambassador to the United Kingdom, gave $1 million to the Super PAC in February, two weeks after his nomination was formally submitted to the Senate.

	Health care entrepreneur Elizabeth Fago contributed $1 million to MAGA Inc. in April. Weeks later, Trump granted her son, who had pleaded guilty to tax crimes, a full and unconditional pardon.


	Tools for Humanity, an eyeball-scanning company co-founded by OpenAI's Sam Altman, is another major donor to MAGA Inc., giving $5 million. Tools for Humanity has reported lobbying the Trump administration on issues related to digital identification, artificial intelligence, privacy, and cybersecurity.

($2 million), Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones ($1 million), and big bank JPMorgan Chase ($964,000).


	MAGA Inc. also received nearly $14 million in dark money from Securing American Greatness, a pro-Trump nonprofit that does not disclose its donors.

Bill Burr vehemently rebuffed his conservative critics in a new interview with Vulture, stating that people who call him “woke” don't even understand the word, while also calling out the “horrible people” who send racist pictures to him and his wife.


	The exchange began when Burr was asked about far-right commentator Ben Shapiro, who leveled the “woke” criticism after attending one of Burr's stand-up shows last year. “He doesn't even know what that word means,” Burr fired back. “His definition of woke is white liberals' definition of woke, and they didn't even know what it was; they just took the word from Black people. That's the worst thing about our people — not only do we take from other cultures, we don't even take the time to understand the definition.”


	Speaking on Shapiro specifically, Burr claimed he just attended one of his shows so he'd have “something to talk about” online and “make money off dividing his own country.”

	“Those people,” Burr added, “It's treason what they do.”


	When asked about the extent to which Shapiro's shtick worked in enflaming right-wing corners of the web, Burr remained unfazed. “Racists. They're racists,” he said. “They send pictures of monkeys to me and my wife. They're fucking horrible people. And they're cowards, and they never say it to your face.”


	Looking at the highly politicized media ecosystem more broadly, Burr continued: “There's an ugliness out there right now where if you're a racist, if you're an antisemite, if you're a psycho nationalist and you want a softball interview, there's podcasts out there where you can get one, and they will laugh at your fucking bad jokes and give you this pass. There's a really ugly thing going on out there, and we've already seen what it does to a nation, and it's not the way to go.”

	











	But Burr also pushed back against the way the left has ostensibly embraced him in this new era of his career. “Most of the left feels like if they have a Black friend, they don't have issues,” he cracked. “You voted for a guy that is staring off into space … Your fucking party has not let you choose your candidate since Obama's second term.”


	The comedian stated flatly he wanted nothing to do with any of it. “I am out of that, so I don't want to hear any ‘left' and ‘right' crap,” he said. “They're all fucking nuts.”

	For Burr, his primary villains are billionaire “puppeteers” and cable news stations that are “always distracting us with other stuff.” CNN and Fox News, Burr pointedly added, “are a fucking disease.” 


	“[M]y new perspective is there's nothing wrong with being a billionaire, but if somebody is working 40 hours a week, 160 hours a month, and they can't make their rent, you're not paying them enough money,” Burr said. “Maybe you should just be worth $900 million. How does a CEO take a fucking eight-figure bonus and none of your employees have dental insurance? They can't even go out and get a filling.”

Jerry Garcia isn't just one of the most beloved rock stars ever, a legendary guitar player, and leader of the greatest rock band of all time from its inception in 1965 up through his passing in 1995. The Grateful Dead co-founder was also a font of casual philosophical wisdom, offering up pearls of insight throughout his life on anything from religion to finance to art. Here are some classic nuggets of Garcia genius to guide you through life.


On God“There was one dream when I thought everybody on Earth had been evacuated in flying saucers and the only people left were these sort of lifeless automatons that were walking around, and there's the kind of sound of that hallow mocking laughter, when you realize that you're the butt of the universe's big joke.” —1989


	“The date that holds significance for me is 2012. That's Terence McKenna's alpha moment, where the universe undergoes its most extraordinary transformations. He talks about these cycles, which, in each epic, more happens than in all previous time…. They're huge transformations in consciousness. This is going to peak in 2012.” —1993












	“After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of protoplasm that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off. They were run through with neoprene tubing, and there were these insects that looked like cockroaches which were like message-units that were kind of like my bloodstream. That was my image of my physical self, and this lasted a long time.” —1994












	I have been spoken to by a higher order of intelligence – I thought it was God. It was a very personal God, in that it had exactly the same sense of humor that I have. I interpret that as being the next level of consciousness.” —1994


On Drugs“Being high, each note is like a whole universe. And each silence. And when you're playing and you're high on acid in these scenes, it is like the most important thing in the world. It's truly, pshew, cosmic.” —1972

	“To get really high is to forget yourself – and to forget yourself is to see everything else – and to see everything else is to become an understanding molecule in evolution, a conscious tool of the universe. And I think every human being should be a conscious tool of the universe. That's why I think it's important to get high.” —1972


	“I'm the sort of person that will just keep going along until something stops me. For me and drugs, the bust helped. It reminded me how vulnerable you are when you're drug dependent. It caught my attention. It was like, ‘Oh, right: illegal!'” —1987


	“Drug use is kind of a cul-de-sac: It's one of those places you turn with your problems, and pretty soon, all your problems have become that one problem. Then it's just you and drugs.” —1987


	“In my life, all kinds of drugs have been useful to me, and they have also been a hindrance to me. As far as I'm concerned, the results are not in.” —1991


	“Q: If you were made Clinton's drug-policy adviser, what would you do?A: I would advise him to make everything legal immediately. Take the profit out of it and the whole criminal structure will collapse. The next part is the health aspect, making drugs that are clean and in knowable, understandable doses. Why not spend research money on making drugs that are good for you, that are healthy? Is the problem that we don't like people changing their consciousness? I don't think that's a good enough reason not to have drugs.” —1994


His Peers“Maybe Chuck Berry was the first rock musician because he was one of the first blues cats to listen to records, so he wasn't locked into the blues idiom. Nobody has to fool around with musty old scores, weird notation and scholarship bullshit. You can just go into a record store and pick a century, pick a country, pick anything, and dig it, make it a part of you, add it to the stuff you carry around and see that it's all music.” —1969

	“I knew Janis eight years ago, and she was singing her heart out in the funkiest places you could imagine, with abscesses on her arms, dumpy and strung out, head all fucked up, wearing the plainest, most nondescript clothes you've ever seen. She was really singing, and nobody was even listening.” —1971












	“Dylan was able to tell you the truth. He was able to talk about the changes that you'd go through, the bummers and stuff like that – and say it in a good way, the right way. Back in the folk music days, I couldn't really dig this stuff, but on Bringing It All Back Home he was really saying something that I could dig, that was relevant to what was going on in my life at the time. Whether he intended it that way or not is completely unimportant.” —1972


	“The Beatles were real important. They were a little model, especially the movies – the movies were a big turn-on. Just because it was a little model of good times … it was like [they] were saying, ‘You can be young, you can be far-out and you can still make it.' They were making people happy. That happy thing – that's the stuff that counts – was something we could all see right away.” —1972


	“The Rolling Stones never did have a cool audience. [At concerts] Jagger would make his little speech about turn on the lights so we can see you, and everybody would scream and run up to the stage. It was so predictable. They knew it would work. They're good – they don't need any tricks.” —1971


	“I didn't get serious about music until I was 18 and I heard bluegrass. I heard Earl Scruggs play five-string banjo and I thought, ‘That's something I have to be able to do.' I fell in love with the sound, and I started earnestly trying to do what I was hearing. That became the basis for everything else that was my model.” —1994


On Health“I'm basically a lazy fuck. Things have to get to the point where they're screaming before I'll do anything. I could see it coming, and I kept saying to myself: Well, as soon as I get myself together, I'm going to start working out. I'm going on that diet.” —1993


On Money“I've always thought the Grateful Dead should be sponsored by the government or something. It should be a public service, you know, and they should set us up at places that need to get high. That's the kind of thing we should be doing. We shouldn't be in business.” —1972


	“Somehow, we've ended up successes. But this ain't exactly what we had in mind, 12,000-seat halls and big bucks. We're trying not to redefine. What can we do that's more fun, more interesting?” —1973


	“We really manage ourselves. The band is the board of directors, and we have regular meetings with our lawyers and our accountants that take about three hours, every three weeks. The last couple of times, I've been there screaming, ‘Hey, you guys!' Because there are times when you go onstage and it's just plain hard to do and you start to wonder, ‘Why the fuck are we doing this if it's so hard?'” —1991












On the SixtiesIt wasn't a gig, it was the Acid Tests, where anything was OK. Thousands of people, man, all helplessly stoned, all finding themselves in a roomful of other thousands of people, none of whom any of them were afraid of. It was magic, far-out, beautiful magic.” —1969


	“The [Black] Panthers are righteous. What they're doing is actual, practical things. They got a free breakfast trip, and they're starting a free shoes thing – they're starting shoe factories and stuff like that. They're really doing things, man. They're into action, and that's something we can understand 'cause we're from a place where talk is cheap.” —1970


	“I thought we were experiencing a lucky vacation from the rest of consensual reality to try stuff out. I didn't have anything invested in the idea that the world was going to change. Our world certainly changed. Our part of it did what it was supposed to do, and it's continuing to do it, continuing to evolve. It's a process. I believe that if you open the door to the process, it tells you how to do it and it works. It's a life strategy that I think anyone can employ.” —1994


On SongwritingI don't write them unless I absolutely have to. I don't wake up in the morning and say, ‘Jeez, I feel great today. I think I'll write a song.' I mean, anything is more interesting to me than writing a song. It's like pulling teeth. I don't enjoy it a bit.” —1991


	“I don't feel I have what it to takes to be a writer. I've never been able to sustain an idea and get it down. It's hard for me to do it with music, too. My own preferences are for improvisation, for making it up as we along. The idea of picking, of eliminating possibilities by deciding, that's difficult for me.” —1993


	“Robert Hunter's really good about writing into my beliefs. He knows I'm going to be battling with my intelligence about whether I can sing this lyric or whether I'm going to feel like an idiot singing it.” —1994


	“I don't think of my ideas as being far-out, musically. What works for me is the emotional component, not the technical.” —1993


On Books“My life would be life would be miserable if I didn't have those little chunks of Dylan Thomas and T.S. Eliot. I can't imagine life without that stuff. Those are the payoffs: the finest moments in music, the finest moments in movies. Great moments are part of what support you as an artist and a human.”—1991


	“I fell in with a teacher who turned me on to the intellectual world. He said, ‘Here, read this.' It was 1984 when I was 11 or 12. That was when I was turning on, so to speak, or became aware of a whole other world that was other than the thing you got in school, that you got in the movies and all that; something very different.” —1972

(NewsNation) — Vice President JD Vance is “obsessed with the whole UFO thing,” he said on a podcast episode released Friday. 

“What's actually going on? What were those videos all about? What's actually happening?”  Vance said on the “Ruthless Podcast.” “I haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet, but we're only six months in.” 

Though Vance was not specific about which “videos” interested him most, there was plenty to see in the skies — and the headlines — last year.

In November, the House Oversight Committee held a hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena that was intended to find out the extent of Pentagon programs investigating UAPs and any information recovered by them.

Witnesses testified about their experiences working with or in the alleged programs, including Pentagon insider Luis Elizondo. 

“Let me be clear: UAP are real,” Elizondo testified. “Advanced technologies not made by our government, or any other government, are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.”

Other phenomena included mysterious drones that were spotted across a majority of the continental United States in November and December 2024, with a majority cropping up in New Jersey's airspace. 

The sightings prompted a federal probe, which ultimately determined that the drones weren't a national security threat nor the work of an “adversary,” Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said in December.

On the first day of his second term, Trump promised to release a report on the unexplained drones spotted over the Northeast. A week later, the White House said the drones were “not a threat” and were approved by the FAA for research.

Some, including Vance, are still searching for answers about unidentified flying objects. 

He joked on the podcast that he would spend Congress' August recess “trying to dive to the bottom of the whole UFO thing from last year.”

Social media feeds across Australia were alight with footage of what people thought were UFOs flying over Queensland and northern New South Wales on 30 July. 

But experts say what people actually saw was a Chinese rocket as it passed over Australia.

Professor Jonti Horner was able to match the sightings from his home state with a Long March 8A rocket launch from Hainan. The rockets are used to launch satellites for China's state-owned internet network into space.

A daily update by email. Science news, great photos, sky alerts.


UFOs in Canada: Canada's top scientists are recommending the creation of a new federal body to standardize, collect and investigate unidentified aerial phenomena. Video via CTV News.

We've been hearing a lot lately about UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, aka UFOs). That's largely because of a renewed discussion in the U.S. Congress. But Canada has been involved as well. The Office of the Chief Science Advisor of Canada (headed by Mona Nemer) has released a long-awaited new report on UAP. The office said on July 14, 2025, that the report recommends the creation of a new federal body to standardize, collect and investigate UAP reports. 

Previously, the office had launched its own research initiative in 2022, known as the Sky Canada Project.

The government had released a preliminary version of the report last January. Nemer, a cardiovascular scientist, has been Canada's chief science advisor since 2017. The focus of this particular report was not to investigate UAP sightings specifically. Rather, it is to improve the reporting mechanisms among various government departments and agencies.

The report does not specifically address the question of what unexplained UAP might be. As the report states:

The project was not meant to prove or disprove the existence of extraterrestrial life or extraterrestrial visitors. The collection or analysis of 1st-hand data such as photos, videos or individual UAP sighting reports was not part of the project.

The report, “Management of Public Reporting of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in Canada,” is available on the Government of Canada website.

Canada needs agency to manage public UFO sightings, says new federal reportWhether you're a believer, skeptic or fall somewhere in between, a new federally-commissioned report recommends a government agency be tasked with responding to UFO reports …#cbc #cbc-canada-news #Canada 

— CBC Bot posting select CBC RSS Feeds (@scrubfire84.bsky.social) 2025-07-17T14:38:46.825293+00:00



The purpose of the report was not to investigate specific UAP sightings or make any conclusions about UAP. Instead, it recommends improvements in how such reports are handled by government departments and agencies. To this end, the Office of the Chief Science Advisor of Canada recommends the creation of a new federal body to standardize the process. The report states:

The mystery of unidentified phenomena in the sky has long fascinated humanity, capturing the public imagination and arousing both skepticism and curiosity. Together, the analysis presented in this report suggests that Canada would benefit from an improved process for reporting, collecting, and studying UAP sightings.

Our goal was to find the current resources and processes in place for handling and following up on UAP reports, to compare them with the best practices in other countries, and to make recommendations for potential improvements. The preparation of this report has garnered more public anticipation than any project in the history of this office.

A federal department or agency responsible for managing public UAP data should be identified. This service would collect testimonies, investigate cases and post its analyses publicly.

Nemer told CTV News:

The Sky Canada Project recommendations provide a realistic framework for the consistent and efficient management of UAP sightings in Canada. I am confident that our leaders will take these recommendations seriously.

The report specifies various government agencies that should be involved, and recommends the Canadian Space Agency to lead the effort. It also names Transport Canada, the Department of National Defense and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. According to CTV News, Transport Canada and the Canadian Space Agency have both shown interest, but need more time to determine what actions they should take. The Canadian Space Agency told CTV News:

The [Canadian Space Agency] is pleased to be recognized in the report as a trusted and respected scientific institution that regularly engages with the public on space-related matters. Although the [Canadian Space Agency] is not currently involved in the management of unidentified anomalous phenomena, it acknowledges the opportunity for coordinated action across federal departments and civilian organizations.

In regard to sightings by pilots and other aviation personnel, the report notes:

Transport Canada should encourage pilots, cabin crews and air traffic controllers to report UAP sightings without fear of stigmatization.

The report also makes other recommendations. These include new tools for data collection, such as a bilingual (English/French) mobile reporting app, providing the public with more access to UAP records and data and finding ways to combat disinformation.

The report says:

Improved data from public reports will enable more comprehensive and accurate research analyses. Investigating UAP reports may also enhance airspace security by identifying threats, thus strengthening national security through the proactive mitigation of risks from UAPs.

Some other countries already have official government UAP bodies. These include the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in the U.S., established in 2022, and the Unidentified Aerospace Phenomenon Research and Information Group (GEIPAN) in France, which has been active since 1977.

Chile and China also have active government UAP investigation bodies.

Canada's Sky Canada Project is just the latest. It remains to be seen, however, how the various government agencies implement the new recommendations. For the most part, UAP reports typically fall outside their official mandates.

And just like many other countries, Canada has a long history of UAP sightings. You can find out more from Chris Rutkowski, a leading Canadian researcher in Winnipeg, Manitoba, NARCAP Canada and MUFON Canada, among others.

As in other countries, most UAP reports in Canada are found to have prosaic explanations. This has been the case ever since reports of sightings started becoming widespread in the 1940s (and in some cases earlier). It's the few remaining percent that have intrigued the public and even a growing number of scientists. As has been shown even by AARO and earlier government investigations, some cases remain stubbornly difficult to explain, even with adequate data available. The report says:

UFOs are by their very definition unidentified but this does not imply that they are of extraterrestrial origin, that they defy natural or scientific explanation, or that they would not be identifiable with access to additional or better data and tools. Nonetheless, some UAP sightings – for which data exist – remain unexplained even after investigation.

… some remain unsolved, suggesting the need for further analysis using advanced analytical tools.

Paul Delaney, an emeritus professor of physics and astronomy at York University in Toronto, added:

Determining once and for all that UAP sightings are of an extraterrestrial origin or not is of deep interest to people everywhere. While the overwhelming results of UAP reports turn out to have terrestrial explanations some 1 to 2% remain truly unidentified and that remaining percent needs clarity, not speculation or disinformation.

Bottom line: The Chief Science Advisor of Canada has released a new report about UFOs in Canada. It provides guidelines to standardize UAP reports for government agencies.

Mama June Shannon is in the hospital just shortly after a psychic warned her about future health troubles.

On the July 25 episode of Mama June: Family Crisis, the 45-year-old met with a psychic with daughter Jessica Shannon and husband Justin Stroud for Jessica's bachelorette party. During the session, the psychic told June that she's ""lost a lot of her health” and is carrying a lot of stress, which isn't good. The psychic added that she ""may have a heart attack"" because of it.

Justin suggests taking June to the hospital but she refuses. But as the pain continued, she said she feels like she's ""about to throw up"" and a producer agrees that they should go get medical attention.

“It is way worse than it has ever been,” June said as they got in the car to go to the emergency room.

Doctors later ""determined that ovarian cysts are causing her severe pain"" and June is now “considering her treatment options.”

Ovarian cysts are common; the Mayo Clinic states that ""many women have ovarian cysts at some time,"" and most ""present little or no discomfort and are harmless.""

By Afouda Bamidele on July 31, 2025 at 5:30 PM EDT

Prince Harry's reunion with the Royal Family is reportedly never going to happen, according to the readings done by a famous psychic.

George Valentino, an international psychic medium to celebrities and royals, recently weighed in on the fraught relationship between the Duke of Sussex and his estranged family. He predicted there was no hope for the ousted prince and his wife, Meghan Markle.

Prince Harry's issues with the Royal Family began after he and his wife stepped down as senior royals in 2020. They also dropped scathing allegations against the British monarchy in a Netflix documentary and ""Spare,"" Harry's bombshell memoir.

Valentino shared the outcome of his readings on Prince Harry's relationship with the Royal Family, claiming his reconciliation attempts won't bear positive results. ""There's nothing in the cards to denote peace between the families for another eight to ten years to come,"" he said.

""There will be no reconciliation, and Harry is always going to be an outcast,"" Valentino added. He claimed Harry and his older brother, Prince William, would remain at odds for years, alleging their relationship won't heal until their ""old age.""

The renowned psychic echoed similar sentiments about the brothers' wives, Meghan and Kate Middleton, claiming the women did not have an olive branch in their future. Valentino told The Daily Mail that Meghan was ""frustrated"" because Kate wouldn't push her husband to reconcile with Harry.

Valentino predicted that Harry's next move after failing to reconcile with his family would be to play uncle to his nephew, Prince George. ""The beautiful twist and turn of this is that Harry will try and maintain a relationship with Prince George,"" he claimed.

""He's going to be a well-wisher and will send him cards or messages. But it's not reciprocated, I'm afraid,"" Valentino added. The psychic's claims paint a bleak picture for Harry's future with the Royal Family, and his words may hold some weight given his past predictions.

In 2019, Valentino famously foresaw the controversy Harry and Meghan would face for calling their daughter Lilibet two years before she was born. Additionally, his skills have earned him famous clients like ""The Only Way Is Essex"" star Gemma Collins.

Valentino's predictions about Harry's future relationship with his family follow an insider's claims about Megan. The Blast covered the story, reporting that the source claimed the Duchess of Sussex feared losing her husband if a reconciliation came with a divorce offer.

They claimed she was worried about experiencing the same fate as the late Princess Diana, whose divorce from King Charles was allegedly orchestrated by Queen Elizabeth II. The source stressed that Meghan was hopeful for Harry's reunion with his family as long as it did not involve a divorce.

""She's clinging to the hope that this doesn't backfire and end with them manipulating him to turn on her,"" the insider shared. They added that Meghan's fears stemmed from Harry's sudden change amid the peace talks, noting he no longer did the things he used to.

Meghan's concerns about her relationship with Harry amid his reconciliation efforts skyrocketed after the secret meeting between the aides for Harry and King Charles. The event occurred on July 12, with the source claiming Meghan immediately implored Harry not to keep her in the dark.

She reportedly urged him to respect their partnership, fearing history might repeat itself and she would suffer a similar fate like Princess Diana. The source claimed Meghan suspected her relationship with Harry might be ""deemed expendable in service of royal repair.""

Despite her concerns, an insider claimed Harry remains faithful to his wife and their future. ""Harry's stepped up to handle the talks himself, partly because he knows Meghan, despite his love for her, can be perceived as confrontational,"" they explained.

Although Harry wishes to reconcile with his family, The Blast shared that sources claimed he and Meghan won't return to the UK. ""They're very happy living in and raising their family in California and, as it stands, have no plans to leave,"" a source declared.

Harry and Meghan relocated to the US after retiring as senior working royals in 2020. They built a home in Montecito, with their mansion facing two natural disaster threats this year. 

The Sussexes recently received a tsunami warning after a high magnitude earthquake rocked the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. Earlier this year, their neighborhood became a high-risk zone following the devastating wildfires that ravaged California. 

Montecito was placed under a red flag warning as strong Ana winds were predicted to drive ""explosive fire growth"" and increase the threat of more fires across the greater L.A. region.

“When you repeat them back to him, even he can't understand what you're saying,” the NBC host says

The Trump administration claimed this week that thousands of documents relating to the 2016 investigation into the president's ties to Russia were found in “burn bags” at the CIA. However, when Trump himself was asked about them, he had no idea what one reporter was talking about. And that, according to Seth Meyers, just proves “how confusing” Trump's “bulls–t conspiracy theories” are.

During a press briefing at The White House on Wednesday, a journalist simply asked for Trump's thoughts on the “burn bags” FBI director Kash Patel says he found, but the president was visibly confused at the question.

“I don't know that,” Trump replied. “I don't know, I don't know what you mean by that statement.”

When the reporter clarified that it literally meant bags of documents, Trump said he thought she meant that Patel “appointed a man named Burn Bag.” Naturally, Meyers cringed at that.

“Oh, dude, don't admit that,” the comedian said. “Just say, ‘I couldn't hear you.' Don't tell the world you are off by a country mile.”

“That's how confusing Trump's bulls–t conspiracy theories are,” Meyers added shortly therafter. “When you repeat them back to him, even he can't understand what you're saying.”

That said, the late night host has a guess at why Trump struggled so much to understand. To kick off the “A Closer Look” segment, Meyers poked fun at the president's age, reminding viewers that he is 79. The NBC host noted that it's been easy to forget, “because he was often next to someone who was really old, but he's still old.”

“You can just see his age getting to him,” Meyers said. “He can't hear or understand reporters' questions anymore, even when those reporters are trying to tee him up by parroting his own bulls–t back to him.”

A 16-year-old girl who was reported missing last week may have run away from her home to meet with people she interacted with online, police said on Thursday.

The Fremont Police Department said that Katie Hong – who was last seen leaving her home on Friday evening – left a note to her family that expressed “an intention of ‘running away' and to potentially meet with individual(s) known only by online screen names.”

      What type of shenanigans is his mentor Peter Thiel up to with Sean Kirkpatrick/Enigma Labs/promoting/debunking this topic? Why does it seem like he supports disclosure and against disclosure at the same time? What are his actual intentions here?
    


      If JD Vance is so interested in this topic, ask him why he doesn't publicly support the bipartisan UAP Disclosure Act that was just introduced in the Senate. And maybe prevent House Republicans like Mike Johnson/Mike Turner/Mike Roberts from blocking it again this time.

(NewsNation) — Vice President JD Vance is “obsessed with the whole UFO thing,” he said on a podcast episode released Friday. 

“What's actually going on? What were those videos all about? What's actually happening?”  Vance said on the “Ruthless Podcast.” “I haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet, but we're only six months in.” 

Though Vance was not specific about which “videos” interested him most, there was plenty to see in the skies — and the headlines — last year.

In November, the House Oversight Committee held a hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena that was intended to find out the extent of Pentagon programs investigating UAPs and any information recovered by them.

Witnesses testified about their experiences working with or in the alleged programs, including Pentagon insider Luis Elizondo. 

“Let me be clear: UAP are real,” Elizondo testified. “Advanced technologies not made by our government, or any other government, are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.”

Other phenomena included mysterious drones that were spotted across a majority of the continental United States in November and December 2024, with a majority cropping up in New Jersey's airspace. 

The sightings prompted a federal probe, which ultimately determined that the drones weren't a national security threat nor the work of an “adversary,” Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said in December.

On the first day of his second term, Trump promised to release a report on the unexplained drones spotted over the Northeast. A week later, the White House said the drones were “not a threat” and were approved by the FAA for research.

Some, including Vance, are still searching for answers about unidentified flying objects. 

He joked on the podcast that he would spend Congress' August recess “trying to dive to the bottom of the whole UFO thing from last year.”

Ghislaine Maxwell, the sex offender accomplice of Jeffrey Epstein, has been moved from a low-security federal prison in Florida to a less restrictive federal lockup in Texas, her attorney confirmed to NBC News on Friday.

Maxwell's transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons minimum security camp in Bryan, Texas, came after two days of meetings she and her lawyer had last week in Tallahassee, Florida, with a top Justice Department official.

Mawell's lawyer did not explain why the 63-year-old was transferred from the federal minimum security prison in Tallahassee.

Maxwell was convicted at trial in 2021 of crimes related to grooming underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell for hours last week after saying he was interested in learning whether she had information about other potential abuses of girls and women in Epstein's orbit.

Blanche asked Maxwell ""maybe about 100 different people,"" her lawyer David Oscar Markus said last week.

Blanche's meeting raised questions about whether the Trump administration will seek a reduction of Maxwell's sentence or whether President Donald Trump will pardon her.

The Justice Department and Trump have been criticized for nearly a month for failing to release evidence accumulated in an investigation into Epstein despite prior promises to make that information public.

The New York Sun first reported that Maxwell had been transferred from her prison in Florida.

Epstein died in August 2019 from a jailhouse suicide, weeks after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.

Switzerland is officially on holiday Friday for the country's national day. But many market watchers have been hauled back to their desks by news overnight that they have been hit with a 39% tariff rate by the White House.

That came as a shock to the Alpine nation. Indications in the Swiss press had been that the country was close to negotiating an outline deal similar to those struck by the European Union, the U.K. and Japan, which set baseline tariffs between 10% and 15%. Instead, it has received one of the highest rates of any country.

That is hugely significant, with the U.S. accounting for around a sixth of Switzerland's total exports. Businesses breathed a sign of relief in April when the country swerved initial plans for a 31% tariff, being handed an interim 10% duty along with most of the world.

As of late Thursday, new tariff rates on a dozens of countries that have not yet agreed a framework trade arrangement with the U.S. are set to come into force from Aug. 7. Given the precedent set by U.S. President Donald Trump for last-minute deadline changes and down-to-the-wire deals, that does leave room for the situation to change.

Another potential reprieve came as the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs told Reuters on Friday it understands the 39% tariff will not include the pharmaceutical sector, which is separately facing volatility from Trump's latest comments on drug pricing. CNBC has contacted the White House for comment.

Amid the uncertainty, reactions were overwhelmingly negative on Friday.

Switzerland's federal council said it had ""great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland's very constructive stance from the outset, the US intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland."" It added that it continued to seek a ""negotiated solution"" and was in contact with U.S. authorities.

Manufacturing association Swissmem said a 39% tariff would hit the tech industry, exports and therefore the whole country ""extremely hard,"" noting that every second franc brought into the economy was made from foreign trade.

""I am stunned. These tariffs are based on no rational basis and are arbitrary. This decision puts tens of thousands of jobs in the industry at risk,"" the group's director Stefan Brupbacher said.

Beat Wittmann, chairman and partner at Porta Advisors, said the news delivered a ""devastating"" blow to the Swiss economy and businesses.

""The U.S. leads a zigzagging unilateral war on tariffs and this unpredictability imposes a rising risk premium on financial assets,"" he said in emailed comments. ""This will lead to a weakening of the Swiss economy, the Swiss Franc and the Swiss equity market, particularly the all-important export sector.""

The Swiss government needs to recognize that the time for ""cherry picking, carve outs and special deals"" is over, particularly for small, highly-exposed states, Wittmann added.

Key Swiss exports include chemical and pharmaceutical products, watches and jewelry, chocolate, gemstones and electronics.

Adrian Prettejohn, Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note that a 39% tariff rate would knock around 0.6% off Switzerland's GDP, or more with the inclusion of pharmaceuticals — but that he expected it to be negotiated down.

With the Swiss stock market closed for national day, indicators are instead feeding through other avenues such as the performance of London-listed Watches of Switzerland, which fell nearly 9% in morning deals.

In a Friday note to clients, analysts at investment bank Jefferies cited the company, along with Richemont and Swatch Group, as among those that would take the biggest hits from the news, particularly relative to previous expectations. But they added that the Aug. 7 start date allowed for ""plenty of last minute tweaks and changes to be agreed.""

The Swiss franc meanwhile slid around 0.4% against the U.S. dollar on Friday.

That comes after a huge appreciation in the franc against the greenback this year, with gains of around 11% as investors hunted for safe-haven assets. The rally has delivered challenges to the economy, which in May marked a return to deflation for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic — spurring the Swiss National Bank to cut interest rates to zero in June.

Rahul Sahgal, CEO of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" the tariff news was ""very disappointing"" after many rounds of negotiations with the U.S. Treasury Department.

""I have to say, however, that I hope and I do not think that it is the end,"" he said.

""We have still, firstly, those days till the 7th of August, and also, if you read the executive order, it does leave a certain window open, let's put it that way, saying that if you are in negotiations with the U.S. these additional tariffs may not apply.""

One element of previously-struck deals is a commitment to increase investment in the U.S., which in the case of the EU is set to total $600 billion along with hundreds of billions in additional energy purchases. On this, Sahgal said Switzerland was looking in the range of a $150 billion investment pledge, which was one of the biggest relative to the size of its economy. The country is already the sixth largest overall investor in the U.S., he added.

Sahgal continued that it was hard to say what the sticking point in negotiations had been or how the 39% rate had been calculated, noting that across both goods and services the trade relationship between Switzerland and the U.S. was balanced — but that Trump was only focused on the former.

""Switzerland is a country... of 9 million people, and the U.S. has something like 300 million people. So even if... every Swiss was to drink a bottle of bourbon and eat a steak every single day and buy a Harley Davidson, we would not be able to balance the trade in goods,"" he said.

US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he has ordered two nuclear submarines to move close to Russia, citing social media comments by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.

Trump announced the decision on his Truth Social platform, condemning Medvedev's “highly provocative” statements and claiming that “words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences.” 

“I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,” the US president wrote.

Trump has lately been locked in a bitter war of words on social media with Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council. While the US president did not elaborate, his announcement of a military response apparently relates to a post made by the Russian politician on Thursday.

Medvedev was responding to a post by Trump on Truth Social hours earlier, in which the American president branded him a “failed” former leader and warned him to “watch his words.” The former Russian head of state mocked the “nervous” reaction displayed by Trump, suggesting it only proved that “Russia is doing everything right and will continue to proceed along its own path.”

“And about India's and Russia's ‘dead economies' and ‘entering very dangerous territory' – well, let him remember his favorite movies about ‘the walking dead,' as well as how dangerous the fabled ‘Dead Hand' can be,” Medvedev wrote.

The latter remark referred to the legendary ‘Perimetr' system, dating back to the Soviet era and presumed to still exist in Russia. The autonomous system is believed to be an apocalyptic dead man's switch, capable of firing the surviving nuclear arsenal at once in a scenario where the country was hit by a devastating first strike that eliminates its leadership and breaks the chain of command responsible for ordering retaliation.

Containment slips for megafire in Grand Canyon and large blaze in Utah as hot and dry weather fans flames

Two wildfires burning in the western United States – including one that has become a “mega-fire” on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon – are so hot that they are spurring the formation of “fire clouds” that can create their own erratic weather systems.

In Arizona, the wind-whipped wildfire that destroyed the Grand Canyon Lodge is 9% contained and has charred more than 164 sq miles (424 sq km) to become the largest fire now burning in the continental US and one of the top 10 largest in recorded Arizona history. Getting around it would be roughly like driving from New York City to Washington DC.

Another large fire in Monroe, Utah, has burned 75 sq miles (194 sq km) since 13 July and is 11% contained, officials said on Thursday. Evacuation orders were issued on Wednesday for several towns in the fire's path, and scorched power poles caused electricity to be shut off in other nearby communities in south-central Utah.

Spencer Cox, Utah's governor, declared an emergency on Thursday as wildfires grew around the state and planned to visit Monroe on Friday.

Towering convection clouds known as pyrocumulus clouds have been spotted over Arizona's blaze for seven consecutive days, fueling the fire with dry, powerful winds, fire information officer Lisa Jennings said. They form when air over the fire becomes superheated and rises in a large smoke column. The giant billowing clouds can be seen for hundreds of miles and can resemble an anvil.

Their more treacherous big brother, a fire-fueled thunderstorm known as the pyrocumulonimbus cloud, sent rapid winds shooting in all directions this week as a smoke column formed from the Utah fire then collapsed on itself, fire team information officer Jess Clark said.

“If they get high enough, they can also create downdrafts, and that's something we really watch out for because that can quickly spread the fire and can be very dangerous for firefighters who are doing their work on the ground,” Jennings said.

Multiple fire crews in Utah were forced to retreat on Wednesday as the unpredictable climate created by the clouds threatened their safety, officials said. Fire crews in both Utah and Arizona had better control of the blazes, but containment has been slipping as the fires grow rapidly.

The same type of cloud, which the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has dubbed the “fire-breathing dragon of clouds”, recently formed a fire tornado that tore through an eastern Utah neighborhood with wind speeds estimated at 122 miles per hour.

“Think of the fire as kind of like a hot-air balloon, so it adds buoyancy and things rise as a result,” said Derek Mallia, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Utah who studies pyrocumulonimbus clouds and tracks fires in Utah and Arizona. “You get this towering thunderstorm over the fire, and just like any other thunderstorm it gets really windy underneath it. Because it's the west, these thunderstorms tend to be very dry.”

These clouds, he said, may appear more frequently as the climate crisis causes a longer fire season, drought conditions and extreme weather events.

A megafire, although not a formal scientific term, generally is a fire that has burned at least 156 sq miles, or about half the size of New York City.

The Dragon Bravo fire on the North Rim of Grand Canyon national park surpassed that mark in the latest update on Thursday. It was sparked by lightning on 4 July and being managed by the park to benefit the landscape.

About a week later, officials switched to suppressing it as conditions deteriorated, with hot, dry and windy weather pushing the flames toward the Grand Canyon Lodge and the historic cabins that surround it. The fire destroyed dozens of buildings and forced the closure of the North Rim for the rest of the season as hundreds of firefighters struggled to gain an upper hand.

Thursday marked the eighth straight day of historically dry conditions, Jennings said. Humidity levels have been in the single digits, fuel moisture levels are extremely low and wind gusts were expected to crank up to 35mph.

The pyrocumulus clouds have reached heights of at least 25,000ft (7,620 meters), and fire behavior analyst Arthur Gonzales said they could go higher.

The direction of the wind has been fairly consistent for crews working the Dragon Bravo fire. Although they have been strong, the predictability has allowed fire managers to more easily position crews on the fire lines. But when pyrocumulus clouds form and the winds become less predictable, Jennings said firefighters often have to be pulled back to safety.

Hot, dry winds fanned the flames of the Monroe Canyon fire on Thursday as firefighters worked to contain the spread. The fire has burned 12 power poles, and many homes have been without electricity since Wednesday afternoon.

The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for extreme fire danger in much of central and south-west Utah this week.

In Antimony, Utah, 54 miles south of Monroe, the town's 123 residents were without power on Thursday afternoon. Mayor Kasey King, who was helping people gather food and supplies at a community center, said they could be without power for a week.

The power company, Garkane Energy Cooperative, said it was working to restore power as quickly as possible and has brought in backup generators.

Marnie Reynolds, a resident of Antimony, worried for the town's many elderly residents. She has been using a camp stove to offer hot meals to neighbors and is using a generator to help people refrigerate groceries and medications.

“We have been facing a lot of challenges, but we have the best community,” she said.

In Richfield, Utah, 10 miles north of Monroe, Lee Stevens said his yard was coated in ash. He and his wife, who has asthma and is sensitive to the smoke, have not yet been told to evacuate but are making preparations in case the fire spreads.

The National Interagency Fire Center said on Thursday that even with fewer square miles having burned so far this year than average, many parts of the country remain vulnerable to new starts and fast-moving flames.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Why Qatar's gas lifeline to Germany is at risk","https://www.dw.com/en/why-qatars-gas-lifeline-to-germany-is-at-risk/a-73460153","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 14:00:47 GMT","

Qatar is due to supply 2 million tons of liquefied natural gas to Germany from next year. The deal is now under threat from an EU directive on rights and the climate that critics say is too costly and bureaucratic.

In November 2022, as Europe grappled with an escalating energy crisis, Germany sealed a deal with Qatar to import up to 2 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) annually from the Gulf state.

The agreement, due to start in 2026, was part of Europe's broader strategy to reduce reliance on Russian gas following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Nearly three years later, Qatar has threatened to halt LNG deliveries to Europe in a row over a European Union directive aimed at improving ethical standards in global trade.

German newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported last weekend (July 26/27) that Qatari authorities have written to several EU governments urging the EU to revise the directive. 

The letters warned that, without substantial changes, Qatar may redirect LNG exports to markets offering a ""more stable and business-friendly environment.""

The EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), adopted last year, orders large European firms to scrutinize their global supply chains — from raw materials to finished products — to spot and fix issues like human rights abuses or environmental harm. 

The directive also mandates that companies develop climate transition plans aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement.

While the CSDDD has been praised by human rights and environmental advocates, it has drawn criticism from industry groups and non-EU suppliers for its high compliance costs, administrative burden and international legal scope.

Qatar has complained that the directive's climate protection rules ""go beyond the objectives and intentions"" of the Paris Agreement, adding that ""high fines, penalties, and civil liability for noncompliance"" pose a risk for state-owned QatarEnergy, the world's largest LNG producer.

The CSDDD conflicts with Qatar's national energy strategy. The Gulf country's economy is deeply tied to LNG, which it sees as a ""green"" transition fuel rather than a climate liability.

Qatar has said it wants to make gradual, measurable progress toward carbon-neutrality, without undermining its energy exports. 

""Qatar and some other oil producers and exporters have not yet put net-zero pathways in place,"" Andreas Goldthau, a public policy professor at the University of Erfurt in Germany, told DW. Goldthau said this puts them at risk of EU penalties for failure to comply with the CSDDD.

Under the directive, firms could face fines of up to 5% of global annual turnover if they don't carry out due diligence checks. For QatarEnergy, which reported $48.6 billion (€42.2 billion) in revenue for 2024, that could translate to a $2.43 billion penalty.

Qatar has supplied 12-14% of Europe's LNG needs since Russia's war began in Ukraine in early 2022, according to data provider Kpler, sending a total of 37.1 million metric tons of the gas to the bloc. The 2022 deal with Germany is expected to further boost Europe's supply.



Analysts warn that any disruption to these volumes, especially during peak winter demand, could tighten supply and trigger a renewed surge in energy prices.

Thierry Bros, a professor at Sciences Po University in Paris, told DW that it was ""unsurprising"" that Qatar was now threatening supplies as ""no company"" wants to be exposed to an ""overly complex and burdensome piece of legislation.""

""Instead of entering protracted negotiations, Qatar has chosen a more assertive approach — acting early and decisively to position itself for a full exemption from the directive,"" he said.

EU states were initially expected to turn the CSDDD into national legislation by next year, initially targeting firms with more than 5,000 employees and annual turnovers of over €1.5 billion. By 2029, smaller firms with head counts of 1,000 or more will be required to comply. 

But faced with growing pushback from the likes of Germany, France and Italy, as well as the finance and energy sectors, the EU has now proposed a two-year delay, until June 2028.

""The EU already relaxed some of those requirements, pushing some back into the second half of the decade,"" said Goldthau.

A key legal question now looms: Can Brussels legitimately impose steep fines on non-EU firms like QatarEnergy? Experts believe practical challenges and trade implications may complicate any enforcement action. If not, the financial burden may shift to its European partners.

""Importers with legal entities within Europe could be asked to withhold payments to QatarEnergy as fines by proxy,"" Goldthau speculated.

Qatar's move may be strategically sound, but its timing has raised eyebrows. Some analysts believe Qatar is leveraging the recent US-EU trade tensions to push for an exemption.

But on July 27, Brussels agreed $750 billion (€650 billion) worth of US LNG purchases as part of the tariff deal with US President Donald Trump, dealing a major blow to the country's approach.

""I'm puzzled why Qatar put this forward right now,"" said Goldthau. After all, he added, Trump has just struck a deal that gives Brussels another excuse to ""pivot to the US.""

But Bros sees it differently, believing Qatar's move is well timed to capitalize on Europe's lingering vulnerability from the post-Ukraine energy crisis.

""The LNG market remains tight and will likely stay that way for another three years, giving Qatar significant leverage at precisely the right moment to exert pressure,"" he said.

With global LNG demand projected to rise to over 600 million tons per year by 2030, Qatar's North Field expansion and long-term contracts help position the emirate as a critical energy supplier to Europe.

But if EU regulations become too burdensome, Qatar may accelerate its pivot to Asia, where demand is booming and compliance costs are much lower.

Order suggests president might be ready to launch nuclear strike against Russia as tensions rise over Ukraine war

Donald Trump has said that he has deployed nuclear-capable submarines to the “appropriate regions” in response to a threatening tweet by Russia's former president Dmitry Medvedev, suggesting that he would be ready to launch a nuclear strike as tensions rise over the war in Ukraine.

In a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump wrote that he had decided to reposition the nuclear submarines because of “highly provocative statements” by Medvedev, noting he was now the deputy chairman of Russia's security council.

Medvedev had earlier said that Trump's threats to sanction Russia and a recent ultimatum were “a threat and a step towards war”.

“I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,” Trump responded. “Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences, I hope this will not be one of those instances.”

He did not specify whether he was referring to nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines.

Medvedev, who was sidelined when Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, is also an avid fan of X, formerly Twitter, where he often posts aggressive and curiously worded attacks against western countries and leaders in the evening in Moscow.

Earlier this week, Medvedev had attacked Trump for shortening his timeline for Russia to make progress toward peace with Ukraine from 50 days down to just 10, saying that he was ready to impose sanctions and other financial penalties against Russia if it didn't comply.

“Trump's playing the ultimatum game with Russia: 50 days or 10,” Medvedev wrote in a post. “He should remember 2 things: 1. Russia isn't Israel or even Iran. 2. Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country.

“Don't go down the Sleepy Joe road!” he added, referring to the former US president Joe Biden.

Trump has voiced frustration with Putin, who he said had been stalling on Trump's efforts to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, a campaign promise that he said that he could achieve in just 24 hours. On Thursday he described Russia's continued attacks on civilian areas as “disgusting”.

“I go home. I tell the first lady, ‘You know, I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.' She said, ‘Oh, really? Another city was just hit,'” he said in at the White House last month.

Putin has not responded to Trump's ultimatum. On Friday, he said he wanted a “lasting and stable peace” in Ukraine but gave no indication that he was willing to make any concessions to achieve it, after a week in which Russian missiles and drones again caused death and destruction across Ukraine.

“We need a lasting and stable peace on solid foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and would ensure the security of both countries,” said Putin, speaking to journalists on Friday, a week before a new deadline imposed by Trump for hostilities to cease.

Putin has periodically claimed to be interested in peace, but only on terms wholly unacceptable to Kyiv. Last week, the third round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in Istanbul, but broke up in less than an hour and have so far led to no agreements except on prisoner exchanges.

In an apparent reference to Trump's comments, Putin said on Friday: “As for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general rule.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Yoon's charge of insurrection is punishable by death or life imprisonment and he also faces a string of other investigations led by special prosecutors.Kim Hong-Ji/The Associated Press

South Korea's ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol, who is in detention while on trial and facing various criminal probes, lay on the floor of his cell on Friday and refused to leave it for questioning, a spokesperson for a special prosecutor said.

Yoon was removed from office in April by the Constitutional Court over his botched attempt last year to declare martial law and is now being investigated by a special prosecution team formed under new President Lee Jae Myung.

Prosecutors investigating influence-peddling allegations connected to Yoon and his wife had tried to get him to comply with an arrest warrant and attend questioning voluntarily, a spokesperson for the special prosecution said.

“But the suspect stubbornly refused to do so, while lying on the ground, not dressed in a prison uniform,” Oh Jung-hee told a news briefing. She said investigators would try again to bring him in, even if they had to use force.

Yoon was dressed only in his undershirt and underwear when prosecutors came to his cell, the Yonhap News Agency reported, citing the special prosecution.

Yu Jeong-hwa, one of Yoon's lawyers, told Reuters that bringing up what he was wearing in a small space where the temperature was close to 40 degrees Celsius (104°F) was a public insult to his dignity and showed how the state was violating inmates' human rights.

The former president was put back in a solitary cell at the Seoul Detention Center in July, as prosecutors investigating his short-lived declaration of martial law in December sought additional charges against him.

Yoon is already on trial for insurrection, a charge which is punishable by death or life imprisonment.

He also faces a string of other investigations led by special prosecutors including one into scandals surrounding his wife, former First Lady Kim Keon Hee, where the couple allegedly exerted inappropriate influence over elections.

Yoon has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyers have accused prosecutors of conducting a politically-motivated witch hunt.

The former president has repeatedly rejected requests by prosecutors to appear for questioning, citing health issues.

His lawyers said on Thursday that he was unwell due to preexisting conditions, including a condition that meant there was a risk of him losing his eyesight.

In a reference to Yoon's position as a former top prosecutor, Oh, the spokesperson for the special prosecution, said the case was being closely scrutinised by the public.

“The suspect has consistently highlighted the importance of laws, principles, fairness and common sense and through this case people are watching if the law applies equally to everyone,” Oh said.

Separately, investigators requested that Yoon's wife Kim, who has also denied any wrongdoing, attend questioning on August 6. Kim's lawyers have said she would cooperate with the investigation.

Pictures have been released of the woman beaten unconscious during a public brawl in Cincinnati in a possibly racially motivated assault.

The victim, a white woman from Russia known as Holly, was punched in the face after intervening in the melee to come to the aid of a man being attacked by a group.

Photographs of the aftermath show Holly, a single mother, according to reports, with deep purple bruising around her swollen right eye and a split lip.

She is said to have spent several days in hospital being treated for severe concussion and other injuries before returning home to Russia.

Footage from the attack on Saturday has attracted the attention of leading figures including JD Vance, the vice president, and Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and former senior advisor to President Donald Trump.

Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant attorney general in the US Justice Department, suggested the attack may have been motivated by race and that federal hate crime charges could be brought.

“Nobody in our great nation should be the victim of such a crime, and where race is a motivation, federal law may apply,” she said.

Sharing the pictures online, Republican state Senator Bernie Moreno said: “This is Holly. She wanted to have a nice evening out with friends. Instead, she got this.

“Holly gave me permission to release the photos so that others will never suffer what she did. We need and deserve change.”

Videos of the attack have circulated widely, leading to speculation it was racially motivated, although there is no evidence at this stage.

Two black men, Montianez Merriweather, 34, Jermaine Matthews, 39, and one woman, Dekyra Vernon, 24, have been charged with felonious assault, assault and aggravated riot.

Cincinnati councilwoman Victoria Parks, in an online post that has been condemned by conservative politicians and public figures, said the pair “begged for that beat down. I am grateful for the whole story”.

Ms Parks made the comment on a video showing an excerpt of the brawl in which a white man slaps the cheek of a black man's face before being set upon and beaten to the ground by the mob.

Ms Parks has defended her comments, saying that “when a black person is hit by a white person, generations of frustration, pain and terror is released”.

In an interview with Local 12, a Cincinnati news channel, she said: “When I first saw the brawl, I was devastated. But then I realized that there was more to the story.

Asked if they “deserved” being beaten, she replied: “Nobody deserves a beating.“There is such [sic] thing as inappropriate actions, and there are consequences to actions.”

Cincinnati police have said there is video evidence of the Caucasian victim being hit by the suspects before the slap.

The melee broke out just after 03:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Saturday, according to Cincinnati Police Chief Teresa Theetge.

Footage of the incident went viral after being posted online, including to a local crime-focused Facebook page.

A white man is seen reaching out to slap a black man dressed in a red T-shirt while the pair argue surrounded by a group.

Several people are then seen kicking, punching and throwing themselves at the man while he attempts to protect himself.

He falls to the floor and multiple people stamp on the man's head.

Another clip, apparently later in the altercation, shows Holly being punched in the face by a man and collapsing on the street.

The FBI and the Department of Justice have confirmed a federal investigation into the assaults is ongoing.

Mr Merriweather appeared in court Thursday, where his family claimed afterwards the fight has only drawn so much attention and outrage because of race.

“If it was an African American woman who got knocked out… We wouldn't have been going through all this,” one of his unidentified loved ones told WLWT news outside the courthouse.

Desire Merriweather, Mr Merriweather's cousin, expressed sympathy for the victims but insisted her relative is not a “racist,” pointing to his biracial son as evidence.

Mr Merriweather was indicted earlier in July on weapons charges and a count of receiving stolen property, but was released on bail after paying 10 per cent of a $4,000 (£3,000) bond.

Records indicate Mr Merriweather is now being held on $500,000 bond and that Bond has been set at $200,000 for Ms Vernon and $100,000 for Mr Matthews.

The FBI and the Department of Justice have confirmed a federal investigation into the assaults is ongoing.

Vivek Ramaswamy, an Ohio gubernatorial candidate who has claimed to have spoken with Holly, said in a post on X “She's a single working mom who went to a friend's birthday party.

“It's unconscionable that there were no police present in that area of Cincinnati on a Friday night, or even an ambulance to take her to the hospital.”

It's unclear how much of the funds needed for the project would come from taxpayers.

While millions of people in the U.S. struggle to afford basic necessities, Trump has announced plans to build a $200 million White House party room.

“For 150 years, Presidents, Administrations, and White House Staff have longed for a large event space on the White House complex that can hold substantially more guests than currently allowed,” the White House said in a statement on its website. “President Donald J. Trump has expressed his commitment to solving this problem on behalf of future Administrations and the American people.”

Truthout is not aware of any such “longing,” other than from Trump himself. 

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

It's unclear how much taxpayers will end up paying for Trump's 90,000 square foot party room. The White House says that Trump and other “patriot donors” have committed to pay for construction, which the administration estimates will cost $200 million, and that the Secret Service, which is funded by taxpayers, will provide the “necessary security enhancements and modifications.” The ballroom is planned for the location where the East Wing currently sits. 

In a statement to Truthout, Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pennsylvania) condemned Trump's plans.

“Trump and Republicans passed a bill that would gut healthcare for millions of people, haven't fulfilled their promises to lower grocery bills, and continue to block transparency around the Epstein files,” she said. “This new plan to build a $200 million White House ballroom is more proof of his administration's corruption and self-serving governance. It is yet another example of Trump putting the desires of the wealthy over the needs of the American people, and it is a shameful abuse of power.”

The project is slated to begin in September 2025, and the White House says it “is expected to be completed long before the end of President Trump's term.” The administration says McCrery Architects is lead architect on the project, the construction team will be headed by Clark Construction, and the engineering team will be led by AECOM. 

Trump's record in construction and business has been marred by decades of controversy, including bankruptcies, failure to pay contractors, and labor violations. He has repeatedly refused to pay workers and contractors, as well as the attorneys who represented him in nonpayment lawsuits, according to an investigation published by USA Today in 2016 during his first presidential run. 

“We're good at building,” Trump said on Thursday while discussing the ballroom. “I'm good at building things, and we'll get it built quickly and on time. It'll be beautiful — top of the line.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.


Yet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining. Why? Blatant political censorship from Big Tech.

President Donald Trump's Education Secretary Linda McMahon spoke with Fox News Digital at the National Governors Association (NGA) about her collaboration with state governors.

Colorado Springs, Colo. – Despite Democrats protesting President Donald Trump's plan to dismantle the Department of Education, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said returning education to the states is a ""nonpartisan issue.""

""I'm not getting push back, because if it were just Democrat states or Republican states that were doing well or doing poorly, that would be one thing, but it's many of the states on both sides of the aisle. That's why this is really a nonpartisan issue,"" McMahon explained in an exclusive interview at the National Governors Association (NGA) summer meeting.

The Education Secretary participated in discussions with governors from both parties at the Colorado Springs, Colo., meeting, and her department announced the release of roughly $6.8 billion in previously frozen federal funds for K-12 programs ahead of her panel discussion with the outgoing NGA chair, Gov. Jared Polis, D-Colo.

""It's just incredibly important that if we are going to return education to the states, we have to talk to the governors,"" McMahon emphasized. ""What's meaningful to them? How can we work together? This is both sides of the aisle because, clearly, education is a nonpartisan issue.""

Trump signed an executive order earlier this year to dismantle the Department of Education, fulfilling one of his key campaign promises during the 2024 presidential election. 

McMahon explained that returning education to the states ""just means giving them back the part that is now provided by the federal government, and they're anxious for it.""

In a joint statement on behalf of the NGA, Polis and incoming NGA chair Gov. Kevin Stitt, R-Ok., said they were ""thankful these bipartisan discussions with Secretary McMahon and other key officials during the NGA Summer Meeting led to the distribution of these education funds,"" adding that they are ""proud our advocacy helped secure this vital support for states and districts.""

The Education Secretary, the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), explained to Fox News Digital that participating in events like NGA, having discussions with governors from both parties and visiting as many states as possible is critical to understanding America's diverse educational landscape. 

McMahon said she has already visited different types of schools, from charter schools to public schools, to learn the best practices across the country.

""Every state does have different needs,"" McMahon said. ""There's no one size fits all, but what I hear with every governor and almost every educator coming in, is what we are stressing, which is literacy.""

A Department of Education report released earlier this year revealed that American students' reading skills have continued to decline since the COVID-19 pandemic, and their math skills have barely improved. 

Despite the dismal report, McMahon said ""the future for education is very bright"" because the Trump administration has called attention to the ""Nation's Report Card,"" which reveals ""how the United States doesn't compare all that favorably with the rest of the world.""

""The president is very keen on making sure that those levels rise, so that the United States takes its rightful place as one of the leaders in education in the world,"" McMahon explained.

And when asked how the Education Secretary would address teachers who are anxious about the dismantling the Department of Education, McMahon said she is focused on ensuring best practices are carried out nationwide, while empowering states to deliver for teachers' individual needs.

""[Teachers] are working with their school boards, they're working with their principals and superintendents and their governors to have the best policies in their states,"" McMahon said. ""This is a win for teachers because governors are already talking about that teachers should be paid fairly, that they should be allowed to innovate in the classroom, that they shouldn't spend their time doing paperwork and regulatory compliance. They should be able to spend that time with the students.""

""Let's let teachers teach. This is all good,"" McMahon explained.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Ghislaine Maxwell moved to federal prison in Texas","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3488711/ghislaine-maxwell-moved-to-federal-prison-in-texas/","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 17:12:57 GMT","

Ghislaine Maxwell has been moved from the federal prison in Florida where she was serving her 20-year sentence to a facility in Texas.

It is unclear why the Jeffrey Epstein associate was moved. The decision came after she spoke with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last week.

“We can confirm, Ghislaine Maxwell is in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) at the Federal Prison Camp (FPC) Bryan in Bryan, Texas,” a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson told the Washington Examiner.

Trump administration officials and congressional leaders have turned to Maxwell as a result of fervor over the Justice Department's decision not to release any more files related to Epstein. The House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena for Maxwell to be deposed on Aug. 11. Maxwell's attorneys suggested she would consider the deposition in exchange for an advanced look at the questions.

She has also been pressing for a pardon from President Donald Trump, which he has acknowledged he can do. Her lawyers have also appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn her sex trafficking conviction.

David Oscar Markus, a Maxwell attorney, confirmed to USA Today that she has been moved to Texas.

The family of the late Virginia Giuffre reacted to the news with “outrage.”

“It is with horror and outrage that we object to the preferential treatment convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has received,” the family said in a statement. “Ghislaine Maxwell is a sexual predator who physically assaulted minor children on multiple occasions, and she should never be shown any leniency. Yet, without any notification to the Maxwell victims, the government overnight has moved Maxwell to a minimum security luxury prison in Texas. This is the justice system failing victims right before our eyes.  The American public should be enraged by the preferential treatment being given to a pedophile and a criminally charged child sex offender. The Trump administration should not credit a word Maxwell says, as the government itself sought charges against Maxwell for being a serial liar. This move smacks of a cover up. The victims deserve better.”

GHISLAINE MAXWELL FILES SUPREME COURT BRIEF AMID DOJ TALKS

Giuffre died by suicide in April and was one of Epstein's first accusers. She was also allegedly associated with Prince Andrew in relation to Epstein while she was underage.

The prison move appears to be an upgrade for Maxwell. She will go from a low-security Tallahassee facility to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas. Her new facility is solely for women, unlike the prison in Florida.

In The Naked Gun, the perennial tough guy Liam Neeson makes a perfect transition to comedy.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Forgive me for saying this, but Liam Neeson has been in a few very silly movies. I refer not to the actual comedies he's popped up in but to the legion of action films he's churned out nonstop over the past 20 years—each seemingly more perfunctory and high-concept than the last. The actor has growled melodramatic lines, brandished a gun, and dealt with assorted faceless bad guys in an airplane and in an ice-road truck, and even while trapped inside a parked car. His on-screen tough-guy persona is so ubiquitous and over-the-top that in the new comedy The Naked Gun, it barely requires any calibration to be funny.

The original Naked Gun films, as well as the TV show, Police Squad!, that inspired them, were rooted in the same comedic spin. They starred Leslie Nielsen, who was known as a dramatic actor before his turn in the film Airplane! established him as a master of spoof comedy. Nielsen played the bumbling LAPD lieutenant Frank Drebin with sincerity, making the absurdity around him all the funnier. Neeson makes sense as Nielsen's successor: the stone-faced hero squinting at the silliest stuff imaginable.

The goofiness of 2025's The Naked Gun, directed by Akiva Schaffer, is especially enjoyable in the current cinematic landscape. Amid the typical clamor of summer blockbusters, an out-and-out farce is like an oasis in the desert. Comedies used to be a major part of the moviegoing world, and I continue to be baffled that films filled with ridiculous gags and one-liners are almost impossible to find in theaters these days. Laughing along with a crowd is a beautiful, irreproducible experience, yet Hollywood seems to have shifted its priorities toward pumping out action-adventure movies—a genre hardly known for its humor.

Read: The world doesn't want Hollywood comedies

Although not quite as transcendent as its forebears, the new Naked Gun manages to provide the inane fun I've been missing. The action-inflected comedy keeps the ensemble tight: Neeson plays Lieutenant Frank Drebin Jr.—a macho, trigger-happy presence on the force who's never without a cup of coffee. (An off-screen figure even passes one to him through his car window while he's driving on the freeway.) The supporting cast includes the well-meaning Captain Ed Hocken Jr. (played by an affably dim Paul Walter Hauser), the grumpy Chief Davis (CCH Pounder), and a femme-fatale type named Beth (Pamela Anderson), who enters Drebin's world to request that he investigate her brother's death.

The movie judders from one set piece to another with only a loose plot to follow—the story involves some dead bodies, an evil billionaire (Danny Huston), and a budding romance between Drebin and Beth. Everyone plays it reliably straight, a contrast that helps the film maintain its zany energy—and, in the spirit of the original trilogy, maximize the number of jokes per minute. If one bit flops, another arrives in a few seconds to make up for it.

The Naked Gun's commitment to that airy sense of pointlessness is refreshing. Schaffer's most notable long-form work to date is probably Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, a scrappy collaboration with his friends and former Saturday Night Live collaborators Andy Samberg and Jorma Taccone, a.k.a. the Lonely Island; the movie skewered music biopics with cheerful, vulgar aplomb. Popstar was largely ignored by most theatergoers, but it became a near-instant cult classic among comedy diehards. Now Schaffer is trying to sneak the same high-grade, unadulterated fun into a major motion picture, with a steely Neeson as its guise. By attaching his farce to the face of some of Hollywood's biggest action movies, the director is gambling that it will draw a wider audience.

Read: Long live the delightfully dumb comedy

The world needs more comedies, and the sillier the better. The Naked Gun is happy to deliver plenty of chortles, along with some wild swings that are just slapsticky enough to work. (A sequence featuring a sentient snowman defies easy description.) I'm rooting for its success in the hope that it brings some genre diversity to the silver screen—not just action movies with jokes, but action movies that are a joke.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Casual pursuits can enrich our lives, regardless of if we're any good at them.

Every evening around 10 p.m., I settle onto the couch, open up the New York Times crossword app on my phone, and complete the day's puzzle. One moment I'm stumped; the next I'm struck by an epiphany. Once the grid is filled with interlocking words, I get no tangible reward for my efforts. All I have is a gold star on a screen—and the kind of fulfillment that comes only from doing something for the love of it.

Crosswording, like many other hobbies, is not productive—but it's not vapid consumption, either. Crocheting a scarf, doing ollies at the skate park, adorning one's nails with intricate designs: These are hardly the most utilitarian ways to spend an afternoon. The decision to pursue an activity simply for one's own enjoyment, though, is deeply human—especially at a moment when our time and attention are treated as commodities. Trying a new hobby gives us the opportunity to learn and grow: a situation that can be rare in adulthood.

In the eight books below, casual pursuits such as knitting, gardening, and drawing, undertaken with varying levels of skill and success, become life-affirming practices. Each reminds us of the possibilities that lie in our hobbies—even the ones we might be bad at.



Unraveling, by Peggy Orenstein

During the pandemic, many people revisited old hobbies or took up viral recipes. (Who could forget the great sourdough mania of 2020?) Orenstein doubled down on her lifetime love of knitting. She sought what she calls “the primal joy of transforming raw material into something useful and, hopefully, beautiful,” and challenged herself to create a sweater entirely from scratch. In Unraveling, she recounts her year-long quest to meet this goal: She shears a sheep, spins its wool fibers into yarn, dyes that yarn, designs a sweater, and finally knits the thing together. Orenstein's book highlights how much of the charm of craft is found not only—or even mostly—in the objects it yields, but also in the private moments and time-consuming processes behind the final results. Unraveling is an ode to the herculean efforts we make for ourselves, for no reason other than to know that we can.



The Backyard Bird Chronicles, by Amy Tan

Tan coped with the political tumult of 2016 by returning to two of her childhood refuges: nature and art. Drawing was an early hobby of hers, but she'd felt discouraged from taking it seriously. At 65, she took “nature journaling” lessons to learn how to depict and interpret the world around her—most notably the inter-avian dramas of the birds behind her Bay Area home. The Backyard Bird Chronicles is a disarming account of one year of Tan's domestic bird-watching, a book “filled with sketches and handwritten notes of naive observations,” she writes. That naivete is endearing: The accomplished novelist becomes a novice, trying to improve through eager dedication. Over the course of this engaging book, her illustrations grow more sophisticated, more assured—leaving readers with a portrait of the hobbyist as an emerging artist.

Slow Tech, by Peter Ginn

My friends and I are obsessed with the BBC's “historical farm” series, in which historians and archaeologists explore and reenact agrarian life across different eras, spanning the Tudor period to World War II. The shows make clear not only how laborious everyday existence once was, but also how much skill and ingenuity were required just to address our basic needs. In Slow Tech, Ginn, one of the co-hosts, walks readers through dozens of projects featured on the shows, and a good many new ones: weaving baskets, making candles, roasting meat, extracting salt from seawater. The book is a manual for learning skills that, in today's world, are largely outsourced to technology or industry; it also emphasizes the point that doing these tasks by hand connects us with a long human lineage. Extracting plant dyes, whittling a spoon, making felt—these projects are inefficient and, Ginn argues, extremely satisfying.



Soil, by Camille T. Dungy

Soil follows Dungy's years-long efforts to remake her “water-hogging” lawn into a pollinator-friendly garden by diversifying the plant species there, while considering what it meant to do so as a mother and a Black woman living in a mostly white Colorado town. Her garden becomes a site of hands-on learning, teaching her daily how to be patient, embrace change, and be a steward for the land she lives on. Importantly, gardening is far from a solitary hobby for Dungy: It can't be separated from the world at large. On her hands and knees planting tulips, she thinks about laboring to give birth to her daughter; watching goldfinches perched on her budding sunflowers, she is reminded of the Indigenous people who have cultivated these plants in the American West for 4,000 years. “Whether a pot in a yard or pots in a window, every politically engaged person”—by which Dungy means anyone who cares about the future of human relationships—“should have a garden,” she writes. “We should all take some time to plant life in the soil. Even when such planting isn't easy.""

The Boatbuilder, by Daniel Gumbiner

Gumbiner's debut novel introduces readers to Berg, a Silicon Valley defector with an opioid addiction who has left his tech-startup gig to apprentice with Alejandro, an eccentric boatbuilder. Alejandro—a chronic hobbyist who also carves Elizabethan lutes and builds portable pasteurizers in a rural Northern California town—teaches Berg the minutiae of boatbuilding, such as how to gauge the moisture content of a piece of wood and how to ready a vessel for its maiden voyage. The work is painstaking, but Berg's measurable progress lends direction and meaning to his otherwise unsettled existence. Perhaps most importantly, he forges a profound bond with another human being, something missing from his former life. “When was the last time you got lost in a thing?” Alejandro asks Berg at one point. Berg can't summon an answer. What he seeks, Gumbiner writes, is to learn “how to do things properly,” and as his skill grows, he only becomes “more confident, more connected to the world.”



The Puzzler, by A. J. Jacobs

Consistent hobbies become rituals that can give our lives shape and meaning. (This has certainly been the case for me; my New York Times crossword streak now exceeds 1,500 days.) In this thorough and spirited survey, Jacobs celebrates how puzzles of all kinds—jigsaws, sudoku, Rubik's Cubes—give us not only fun and purpose but also a secret set of superpowers. Puzzle lovers, he writes, have heightened capacities for critical thinking and problem-solving, which can come in handy in daily life. “Don't freak out, seek out,” my dad used to say to me whenever I would misplace an object; similarly, puzzling instructs us to keep cool and find solutions. But self-improvement need not be the goal of puzzling, or of any hobby, for that matter. Offering a succinct quote from Maki Kaji, the “godfather of sudoku,” Jacobs writes that puzzles exist to propel us from “? → !”—that is, from a state of confusion and frustration to surprise and delight.

Picture This, by Lynda Barry

Part how-to guide, part graphic memoir, part manifesto about creativity, Picture This celebrates drawing as a means of spontaneous expression. The cartoonist Barry puts aside any pretense toward quality: Even simple doodling can be a salve, she writes, and therefore a worthy endeavor. Through her beguiling multimedia collages, which incorporate hand-drawn illustrations and typewritten notes along with phone-book pages and cotton balls, Barry makes the case that sketching offers us a way to forge a more curious, childlike relationship with our surroundings—an ethos that could apply to just about any artistic act. She tells her readers that they have to “be willing to spend time making things for no reason” and be okay with setting aside self-doubt and its accomplice, perfectionism—the surest enemies of discovery.



In Defense of Dabbling, by Karen Walrond

Unlike some of the other authors on this list, Walrond is not an expert at anything—she says so on the very first page of this ode to what she calls “intentional amateurism.” The word amateur, though mostly used to disparage, is derived from the Latin “to love,” and Walrond builds an argument for indulging our interests free of expectation or commitment. Dalliances demand neither talent nor discipline, she argues—we need only enjoy what we're doing. The book is a ringing endorsement for being just okay at stuff. Instead of trying to gain mastery at any one thing, Walrond tries to gather as many experiences as she can, letting pleasure lead the way. She attempts surfing, pottery, and astrophotography, with mixed results but sustained amusement. “The joy I've had in almost everything I've ever done,” she writes, “has arisen mostly in the attempt.” Walrond concludes the book with a compendium of more than 200 amateur pursuits, some of which she's tried and some she hasn't (yet)—a great place for the beginning hobbyist to start their journey.

President Donald Trump isn't saving the SAVE plan.

The Department of Education announced earlier in July that interest charges for student-loan borrowers on the SAVE plan are restarting on August 1 after being paused for a year while the plan was facing legal challenges.

SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden, intended to give borrowers more affordable monthly payments with a shorter timeline to debt relief. The plan was blocked in July 2024, and 8 million enrolled borrowers have been in a forbearance without interest accumulating.

That relief is officially over. The department said that it is restarting interest charges on SAVE accounts to comply with the court order that blocked the plan, although the order did not explicitly provide instructions on handling the interest charges. Interest rates vary depending on when the loan originated. Today's undergraduate direct rate is 6.39%.

Linda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, said in a statement that she recommends borrowers ""quickly transition to a legally compliant repayment plan,"" like income-based repayment, to avoid balance growth.

Business Insider has spoken with dozens of student-loan borrowers grappling with changes to debt relief and repayment in the last year. Share your story by emailing asheffey@businessinsider.com and read more here:

Some Democratic lawmakers previously criticized the interest charge restart and urged the administration to reverse course. On July 14, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Chuck Schumer sent a letter to McMahon saying that the restart is ""devastating for millions of American families.""

""It defies logic and the law that a months-old preliminary injunction against SAVE, which makes no mention of the interest-free forbearance, requires you to start charging interest to millions of borrowers in forbearance now,"" they wrote.

The lawmakers also cited a backlog in income-driven repayment plan processing that would make it difficult for borrowers on SAVE to switch to a new plan. While the department said in its press release announcing the interest charges that borrowers who switch to a new plan ""can expect quick and timely processing,"" the department in May reported a backlog of nearly 2 million income-driven repayment applications.

The income-based repayment plan, which the department specifically mentioned as a viable option for SAVE borrowers, is also facing a debt relief processing delay. The department posted on Federal Student Aid that loan forgiveness through IBR plans is paused to update payment counts without providing a timeline for when relief will resume.

For now, borrowers can choose to remain on SAVE while interest accumulates, or they can switch to a new plan and make payments. Due to Trump's spending law, student-loan borrowers will have two repayment options beginning July 2026: a standard repayment plan or a new Repayment Assistance Plan that forgives borrowers' balances after 30 years.

The new plans are less generous than existing ones, including the SAVE plan, which Trump's spending law eliminates.

These changes come amid Trump's broader plans to dismantle the Department of Education. The Supreme Court ruled that the department can proceed with firing nearly 1,400 workers, and limited staff means likely hurdles in carrying out the student-loan repayment overhaul.

The redactions were made by a team of FBI employees tasked with reviewing the Epstein files for potential public release. The names were withheld under privacy protections because those individuals, including Trump, were private citizens when the federal investigation into Epstein began in 2006, the people said.

War in Ukraine:

India's largest oil refiner has snapped up millions of barrels of crude from the US and United Arab Emirates, with the South Asian nation facing mounting pressure from Washington and Europe over its purchases from Russia.

State-owned Indian Oil Corp. bought at least 5 million barrels US crude, on top of 2 million barrels of supplies from Abu Dhabi, according to traders who asked not to be identified as they aren't authorized to speak publicly. The purchases were both large and for relatively immediate delivery by the company's usual standards. State-owned processors were told to come up with plans for buying non-Russian crude earlier this week. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

President Donald Trump on Friday fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, hours after the agency reported that job growth in the U.S. had slowed to a near-halt.

In a Truth Social post that also directed even more fire at Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump accused BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer of being a political appointee who was manipulating jobs data.

""I was just informed that our Country's ""Jobs Numbers"" are being produced by a Biden Appointee, Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, who faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's [Harris'] chances of Victory,"" Trump wrote.

""We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified,"" he added.

CNBC has reached out to the BLS for comment. NBC News confirmed that McEntarfer has been fired. The BLS operated under the Department of Labor, whose commissioner, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, is a Trump appointee.

The stunning demand came the same day that the BLS reported a gain of just 73,000 nonfarm jobs in July, below market expectations. In addition, the bureau revised the two previous months down sharply, cutting a combined 258,000 from the prior counts, putting the three-month growth rate at a paltry 35,000. It was the biggest two-month downward revision since April 2020, the early days of the Covid crisis.

Trump and congressional Republicans have repeatedly criticized the BLS over the years for its data collection. In particular, the large revisions have been a target.

In his spending plan this year, Trump proposed an 8% reduction in staff at the bureau, raising questions over the integrity of its counts on employment, consumer prices and multiple other economic metrics. The bureau has had to impute a growing amount of estimated data into a number of its reports.

""Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,"" the president wrote. ""McEntarfer said there were only 73,000 Jobs added (a shock!) but, more importantly, that a major mistake was made by them, 258,000 Jobs downward, in the prior two months. Similar things happened in the first part of the year, always to the negative.""

Prior to Friday's report, Trump repeatedly has championed the strength of the labor market. After the June numbers had been released initially, the White House put out a statement calling it a ""June Boom.""

The weak jobs report Friday preceded a sharp drop in markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off more than 500 points and the tech-focused Nasdaq off more than 2%. Treasury yields also slumped.

""I can't believe what I just saw,"" said Peter Mallouk, president and chief investment officer of Creative Planning. Trump's social media post seemed like a parody or satire at first, Mallouk said.

""This is not healthy,"" he added. ""We can't have a set of numbers come out and fire somebody that served under numerous administrations in various roles because you don't like the numbers.""

Along with his tirade against McEntarfer and the BLS, Trump for at least the third time Friday tore into the Fed's Powell, who has advocated that the central bank not lower interest rates until it has a better idea of how the president's tariffs will impact inflation.

""The Economy is BOOMING under 'TRUMP' despite a Fed that also plays games, this time with Interest Rates, where they lowered them twice, and substantially, just before the Presidential Election, I assume in the hopes of getting 'Kamala' elected – How did that work out?"" Trump wrote. ""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should also be put 'out to pasture.'""

The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's monetary policy arm, on Wednesday voted to keep its benchmark interest rate steady, where it has been since December. However, following the weak jobs report, futures markets priced in a strong possibility the Fed will cut in September.

President Donald Trump on Friday said that he ordered two nuclear submarines ""to be positioned in the appropriate regions"" in response to warnings made to the United States this week by high-ranking Russian official Dmitry Medvedev.

Medvedev in a social media post on Monday wrote that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine ""is a threat and a step towards war.""

""Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country,"" Medvedev wrote on X that day.

Trump earlier Monday had said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big ""secondary tariffs"" on Moscow's trade partners.

On Friday, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, ""Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that.""

""Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences. I hope this will not be one of those instances,"" Trump said. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

Medvedev, in his tweet Monday, wrote, ""Trump's playing the ultimatum game with Russia: 50 days or 10… He should remember 2 things.""

""1. Russia isn't Israel or even Iran. 2. Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war,"" Medvedev wrote.

""Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country. Don't go down the Sleepy Joe road!"" Medvedev added, referring to former President Joe Biden.

Trump in a Truth Social post on Thursday warned Medvedev about his rhetoric, while also taking a shot on Russia's trading partnership with India.

I don't care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,"" Trump wrote. ""We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World.

""Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together,"" Trump said. ""Let's keep it that way, and tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he's still President, to watch his words. He's entering very dangerous territory!""

Medvedev responded Thursday with a statement saying, ""If a few words from a former Russian president can provoke such a nervous reaction from the sitting and supposedly formidable president of the United States, then clearly Russia is entirely in the right and will continue on its chosen path.""

""As for his remarks about the 'dead economies' of India and Russia and 'venturing into dangerous territory,' perhaps he should revisit his favorite movies about the living dead and recall just how dangerous the mythical 'Dead Hand' can be,"" Medvedev said.

The Dead Hand is Russia's system for automatically launching nuclear strikes if a nuclear attack is detected against the country.

Two sexual abuse victims of Jeffrey Epstein and the family of late Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre on Friday blasted President Donald Trump after learning that Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell had been transferred to a less restrictive prison in Texas from Florida.

""This move smacks of a cover up,"" Epstein victims Annie Farmer and Maria Farmer, as well as Giuffre's relatives said in a statement.

""President Trump has sent a clear message today: Pedophiles deserve preferential treatment and their victims do not matter,"" the statement said, noting that the two women and Giuffre's family had not been notified of Maxwell's transfer before media reports of it.

Maxwell's transfer to minimum security camp in Bryan, Texas, came after two days of meetings she and her lawyer had last week in Tallahassee, Florida, with a top Justice Department official.

That official, Deputy Attorney Todd Blanche, is Trump's former criminal defense lawyer.

Trump is a former friend of Epstein and Maxwell.

""It is with horror and outrage that we object to the preferential treatment convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has received,"" the statement said.

""Ghislaine Maxwell is a sexual predator who physically assaulted minor children on multiple occasions, and she should never be shown any leniency,"" the statement said.

""Yet, without any notification to the Maxwell victims, the government overnight has moved Maxwell to a minimum security luxury prison in Texas,"" the statement said.

""This is the justice system failing victims right before our eyes. The American public should be enraged by the preferential treatment being given to a pedophile and a criminally charged child sex offender. The Trump administration should not credit a word Maxwell says, as the government itself sought charges against Maxwell for being a serial liar,"" the statement said.

""This move smacks of a cover up. The victims deserve better,"" the statement said.

Mawell's lawyer, who confirmed the transfer to NBC, did not explain why the 63-year-old was transferred from the federal minimum security prison in Tallahassee.

A senior administration official told NBC News, ""Any false assertion this individual was given preferential treatment is absurd.""

""Prisoners are routinely moved in some instances due to significant safety and danger concerns,"" the official said.

Jack Scarola, a lawyer who represents 20 Epstein victims, told NBC News, ""The victims of the Epstein/Maxwell conspiracy continue to endure the emotional pain of every development in the negotiations with Ghislaine Maxwell.""

""They wait anxiously and expect to be afforded full access to all relevant information concerning the criminal conduct that has so severely damaged them,"" Scarola said. ""Then, once properly informed, they look forward to having their voices be heard with respect to any action concerning Ms. Maxwell that might be contemplated.""

Maxwell was convicted at trial in 2021 of crimes related to grooming underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Blanche met with Maxwell for hours last week after saying he was interested in learning whether she had information about other potential abuses of girls and women in Epstein's orbit.

Blanche asked Maxwell ""maybe about 100 different people,"" her lawyer David Oscar Markus said last week.

Blanche's meeting raised questions about whether the Trump administration will seek a reduction of Maxwell's sentence or whether President Donald Trump will pardon her.

The Justice Department and Trump have been criticized for nearly a month for failing to release evidence accumulated in an investigation into Epstein despite prior promises to make that information public.

The New York Sun first reported that Maxwell had been transferred from her prison in Florida.

Epstein died in August 2019 from a jailhouse suicide, weeks after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.

In this article

Palantir has inked a contract with the U.S. Army worth up to $10 billion to meet growing warfare demands over the next decade.

As part of the deal, Palantir will help the military streamline efficiencies while preparing for threats, consolidating 75 total contracts into one enterprise deal, the release states.

The agreement creates a ""comprehensive framework for the Army's future software and data needs"" that provides the government with purchasing flexibility and removes contract-related fees and procurement timelines, according to a release.

The deal further cements the company's role in the U.S. government's clampdown on cost efficiencies by using artificial intelligence tools in President Donald Trump's administration. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency has cut jobs and programs in an effort to curb spending.

Palantir co-founder and CEO Alex Karp has been a vocal proponent of protecting U.S. interests and joining forces on AI to fend off adversaries.

Shares of the Denver-based artificial intelligence software company have more than doubled year to date.

Earlier this year, Palantir delivered its first two AI-powered systems in its $178 million contract with the U.S. Army. In May, the Department of Defense boosted its Maven Smart Systems contract to beef up AI capabilities by $795 million.

In this article

Ford is recalling 312,120 vehicles in the U.S. as loss of power brake assist while driving can extend stopping distance and increase the risk of a crash, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Friday.

The recall affects certain 2025 Lincoln Navigator, F-150, Expedition, Bronco, and Ranger vehicles.

The agency flagged that the Electronic Brake Booster (EBB) module might fail while driving or using the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) feature, causing a loss of power brake assist.

As a remedy, the EBB module software will be updated over-the-air (OTA) or by a dealer, free of charge, NHTSA said.

Bitcoin's on-chain velocity—how often coins move—is at decade lows. To some, that's a red flag: has Bitcoin lost momentum? Is it still being used?

In fact, falling velocity may be the clearest signal yet that Bitcoin is maturing, not stagnating. Instead of circulating like cash, Bitcoin is increasingly being held like gold.

In traditional economics, velocity refers to how often money changes hands; it's a proxy for economic activity. For Bitcoin, it tracks how frequently BTC is transacted on-chain. In Bitcoin's early days, coins moved frequently as traders, early adopters, and enthusiasts tested its use cases. During major bull runs, like those in 2013, 2017, and 2021, transaction activity spiked, with BTC flowing quickly between wallets and exchanges.

Today, that has changed. More than 70% of BTC hasn't moved in over a year. Transactional churn has slowed. At face value, this could seem like declining usage. But it reflects something else: conviction. Bitcoin is being treated as a long-term asset, not just a short-term currency. And that shift is driven largely by institutions.

Since the launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, institutional holdings have soared. As of mid-2025, spot ETFs hold over 1.298 million BTC, approximately 6.2% of total circulating supply. When including corporate treasuries, private companies, and investment funds, total institutional holdings approach 2.55 million BTC around 12.8% of all Bitcoin in circulation. These assets remain largely static, stored in cold wallets as part of long-term strategies. Firms like Strategy and Tesla are not spending their Bitcoin; they're holding it as a strategic reserve.

That's bullish for scarcity and price. But it also lowers velocity: fewer coins circulating, fewer transactions happening on-chain.

It's important to note that on-chain velocity doesn't capture all of Bitcoin's economic activity.

On-chain velocity only tells part of the story. Increasingly, Bitcoin's real economic activity is happening off the base layer, and outside traditional measurements.

Take the Lightning Network, THE Bitcoin's Layer-2 scaling solution which enables fast, low-cost payments that bypass the main chain entirely. From streaming micropayments to cross-border remittances, Lightning makes bitcoin usable in everyday scenarios, but its transactions don't appear in velocity metrics. As of mid-2025, public Lightning capacity surpassed 5,000 BTC, reflecting a nearly 400% increase since 2020. Private channel growth and institutional experimentation suggest the real number is much higher.

Similarly, Wrapped Bitcoin WBTC$113,677.86 is enabling BTC to circulate across Ethereum and other chains, fueling DeFi protocols and tokenized finance. In the first half of 2025 alone, WBTC supply grew by 34%, a clear signal that bitcoin is being deployed, not dormant.

And then there's custody: institutional wallets, ETF cold storage, and multisig treasury tools allow firms to hold BTC securely, but often without moving it. These coins may be economically significant, yet they contribute nothing to on-chain velocity.

In short, Bitcoin is likely more active than it appears, it's just happening outside traditional velocity metrics. Its utility is shifting to new layers and platforms- payment rails, smart contract systems, yield strategies—none of which register in traditional velocity models. As Bitcoin evolves into a multi-layer monetary system, we may need new ways to measure its momentum. Falling on-chain velocity doesn't necessarily mean usage is slowing. In fact, it might just mean we're looking in the wrong place.

While slow velocity reflects conviction and long-term holding, it also presents a challenge. Fewer on-chain transactions mean fewer fees for miners: a growing concern after the 2024 halving, which cut block rewards in half. Bitcoin's long-term security model depends on a healthy fee market, which in turn relies on consistent economic activity.

There's also the question of perception. A network where coins rarely move can start to resemble a static vault rather than a dynamic marketplace. That may strengthen the “digital gold” thesis but weakens the vision of bitcoin as usable money.

This is the core design tension: Bitcoin aims to be both a store of value (digital gold) and a medium of exchange (peer to peer cash) . But those roles don't always align. Velocity is the measure of that push and pull, this ongoing struggle between preservation and utility, and how Bitcoin navigates it will shape not just usage patterns, but its role in the broader financial system.

In the end, falling velocity doesn't mean Bitcoin is being used less. It means it's being used differently. As Bitcoin gains value, people are more inclined to save it than spend it. As adoption grows, infrastructure moves off-chain. And as institutions enter, their strategies center on preservation, not circulation. The Bitcoin network is evolving. Velocity isn't vanishing; it's going silent, reshaped by a changing user base and new layers of economic activity.

If velocity ticks up again, it could mark a resurgence of transactional use; more spending, more movement, more retail involvement. If it stays low, it suggests Bitcoin's role as macro collateral is taking firm root. Either way, velocity offers a window into Bitcoin's future. Not as a coin to spend, but as an asset to build on.

Ethena's synthetic stablecoin, USDe, has crossed $8.4 billion in supply, adding more than $3.14 billion over 20 days in a surge that outpaced flows into BlackRock's (BLK) flagship bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds.



According to on-chain data curated by the Ethena community, the supply increase since July 17 is the fastest period of growth since the protocol's inception in February 2024. 

Inflow into the yield-bearing stablecoin exceeds the $2.75 billion added to BlackRock's ether ETF (ETHA) and the $1.60 billion into its bitcoin ETF (IBIT) in the same period, making the DeFi-native stablecoin the biggest magnet for capital across both on- and off-chain markets in recent weeks.

The rally has spilled over into Ethena's governance token ENA, which more than doubled in the past month, though it is down 12% in the past 24 hours as traders hope the long-awaited fee switch will soon activate.

The protocol has already surpassed most of the thresholds required to distribute revenue to staked ENA holders, with the final benchmark, a favorable yield spread versus rivals, expected to be met soon.

USDe's reflexive loop

USDe's recent growth reflects a powerful reflexive loop built into its core design, as Nansen explained in a recent research report on the Ethena ecosystem.

As bitcoin and ether prices rally, perpetual funding rates in turn increasingly positive. Ethena captures this funding via delta-neutral hedges, and distributes it as real-time yield to sUSDe holders.

That higher yield then draws in more users, leading to greater USDe issuance, more hedging, and more protocol revenue.

In the last month, Ethena has brought in nearly $50 million in feed and $10 million in revenue, according to DeFiLlama data. This makes it the sixth best-performing protocol for monthly fee revenue according to the data aggregator.

ENA is currently trading for $0.58.

 Ethereum's 10th anniversary celebration was marked by an uptick in institutional demand for Ether as an alternative treasury reserve asset, prompting Wall Street to look past Bitcoin. 

Ethereum's 10th anniversary was marked by a significant milestone in terms of institutional crypto adoption, as cryptocurrency treasury firms surpassed $100 billion in collective investments on Thursday.

Ethereum's 10th birthday brought renewed corporate interest in Ether (ETH), which saw the 10 largest corporate crypto treasury firms amass over 1% of the total Ether supply since the beginning of June, according to a Tuesday report by Standard Chartered.

The bank predicted that corporations will eventually hold 10% of the total Ether supply, which may see the world's second-largest cryptocurrency surpass the bank's year-end target price of $4,000 per Ether.

Ether's corporate adoption is “happening faster than with Bitcoin during its early treasury adoption phase,” since Ether enables corporations to tap into staking yields and “actively generate value,”  Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at Brickken asset tokenization platform, told Cointelegraph.

Ethereum celebrated its 10-year anniversary on Wednesday, with renewed institutional momentum fueling hopes that Ether (ETH) could challenge its all-time high set in November 2021.

Over the past decade, Ethereum has become the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) blockchain, with nearly $85 billion in total value locked (TVL) at the time of writing.

Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder, circulated an early version of the white paper in 2013. The project raised $18.3 million in its initial coin offering (ICO) and officially launched in 2015 as a blockchain for smart contracts. Its cryptocurrency, Ether, now ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin (BTC).

Here's a look back into Ethereum's first decade, featuring the ICO boom, DeFi summer and the rise and fall of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Corporate cryptocurrency treasuries are emerging as a new class of public companies bridging traditional finance and digital assets, signaling increasing institutional interest in crypto.

Corporate cryptocurrency treasury firms, including Strategy, Metaplanet and SharpLink, have collectively amassed about $100 billion worth of digital assets, according to a Galaxy Research report released Thursday.

Bitcoin (BTC) treasury firms hold the lion's share, with over 791,662 BTC worth about $93 billion on their books, representing 3.98% of the circulating supply. Ether (ETH) treasury firms hold 1.3 million ETH tokens, worth more than $4 billion, representing 1.09% of the Ether supply, the report said.

Corporate buyers are becoming a key source of Ether liquidity alongside US spot ETH exchange-traded funds, which recently posted 19 consecutive days of net inflows, a record for the products.

Since July 3, the Ether ETFs amassed $5.3 billion worth of ETH as part of their record winning streak, Farside Investors data shows.

More corporate buying and continued ETF inflows may help Ether surpass the $4,000 psychological mark, which is also the year-end price target of Standard Chartered, the bank said in a Tuesday research report.

“We think they may eventually end up owning 10% of all ETH, a 10x increase from current holdings,” the bank said, adding that Ether treasury firms have more growth potential than Bitcoin treasuries, from a “regulatory arbitrage perspective.”

Abu Dhabi-based Bitcoin miner Phoenix Group launched a $150 million strategic cryptocurrency reserve, becoming the first publicly listed company on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) to establish a digital asset treasury.

The company said Thursday the reserve includes 514 Bitcoin (BTC) and 630,000 Solana (SOL), describing it as a long-term holding strategy.

This makes Phoenix Group the first company listed on the ADX to establish a strategic cryptocurrency treasury, the company said in an announcement shared with Cointelegraph.

“Holding Bitcoin and other strategic digital assets isn't just about exposure. It's about alignment,” said Munaf Ali, co-founder and CEO of Phoenix Group. “We believe in the long-term value these networks represent, and our treasury strategy reflects that belief.”

Phoenix Group was one of the five most-traded and best-performing stocks on the ADX in the second quarter of 2025 after its share price rose by over 72% from April to June.

Increasingly more Bitcoin mining companies are considering altcoins as part of their balance sheet, signaling more institutional demand for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin.

Publicly listed Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies became the largest Ether (ETH) treasury firm after announcing plans to acquire up to 5% of Ether's supply.

Japanese investment firm Metaplanet is seeking to raise 555 billion yen ($3.73 billion) through a new stock offering to support its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy.

The company, which is known as “Asia's Strategy,” announced Friday that it will issue perpetual preferred shares to fund its goal of acquiring 210,000 Bitcoin (BTC) by the end of 2027. The shares will offer up to a 6% annual dividend, depending on market conditions and investor demand.

“The Company intends to actively pursue equity financing as part of its ‘Bitcoin Strategy,' which aims to acquire 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027,” it said. “We believe that introducing Bitcoin-backed preferred shares represents a pioneering effort to fill this gap.”

Metaplanet's stock offering comes a day after Cointelegraph reported corporate crypto treasury firms had surpassed $100 billion in collective investments, with Bitcoin-focused treasuries amassing $93 billion worth of that value.

Continued corporate accumulation from the likes of Strategy and Metaplanet, paired with the growing money supply, could push Bitcoin's price above $132,000 before the end of 2025 based on Bitcoin's correlation with the global M2 money supply.

Strategy, the world's largest corporate Bitcoin treasury firm, has launched similar capital-raising efforts. On July 22, the firm announced a new type of Bitcoin-backed stock pegged to $100 per share with an initial monthly dividend of 9% annually.

Decentralized finance platform Veda has appointed a former US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official to its ranks as it ramps up efforts to expand crosschain yield products aimed at institutional investors.

TuongVy Le, who spent nearly six years at the SEC as chief counsel and senior adviser in the Enforcement Division and the Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, has joined Veda as general counsel, the company announced Tuesday.

During her SEC tenure, Le advised Congress on early drafts of digital asset legislation and served on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Global Markets Advisory Committee.

According to her LinkedIn profile, Le was involved in some of the SEC's earliest crypto enforcement actions.

She served in the SEC's Enforcement Division from 2016 to 2021, a pivotal period in the agency's crackdown on unregistered securities offerings tied to initial coin offerings (ICOs). 

During that time, the SEC brought actions against the promoters of BitConnect's lending program and against LBRY, alleging both conducted unregistered securities offerings. In 2021, the agency also initiated one of its earliest DeFi-related enforcement actions, charging Blockchain Credit Partners with securities fraud.

As China accelerates deployment of its digital yuan, and the European Central Bank advances toward a digital euro, the Republican Party is seeking to prevent the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the United States. Their insistence on clinging to an increasingly obsolete financial infrastructure means that Americans will continue to be saddled with billions in unnecessary fees every year and that corporations will be empowered to erode our privacy in Orwellian fashion. What's more, handicapping ourselves in this way will only make it more likely that the dollar's dominance in global finance will come to a premature end. America needs a digital dollar, and we need it now.

The Trump administration's recent digital assets report explicitly prohibits federal agencies from establishing or promoting CBDCs, arguing they ""threaten the stability of the financial system, individual privacy, and the sovereignty of the United States."" This position reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how digital currencies actually work—and ignores the privacy advantages they could provide over our current system.

Consider this analogy: when you send a package through the United States Postal Service, the Fourth Amendment protects its contents from unreasonable government search. That same package sent via FedEx or UPS enjoys no such constitutional protection. Similarly, a government-issued digital currency would operate under constitutional constraints and democratic oversight that private payment systems simply don't face. As such, a government run service inherently offers more privacy protection than its privately run counterpart.

Today, every swipe of your credit card, every electronic transfer, and every digital payment flows through private corporations that collect, analyze, and monetize your financial data. Banks routinely share transaction information with third parties, build detailed consumer profiles, and sell insights about your spending habits. In contrast, a properly designed CBDC could implement strong privacy protections by design, limiting data collection to only what's necessary for monetary policy and financial crime prevention.

The economic benefits of a digital dollar are even more compelling. Americans currently pay $5-10 billion annually in overdraft fees alone—money that could stay in families' pockets with a CBDC system that allows direct government-to-citizen transfers and eliminates many banking intermediaries. The millions of Americans who remain unbanked or underbanked would finally have access to basic financial services without requiring a traditional bank account.

Even for those in the baking system, the benefits of a CBDC are potentially enormous. Wire transfers, which cost $13-$44 each on average and take days to settle, could become nearly instantaneous and free. That speed in payment settlement would also make a huge difference to Americans when they need emergency aid quickly, as a CBDC could allow the government to deliver relief payments in minutes rather than weeks.

The urgency in America to adopt a CBDC extends beyond domestic concerns. In an era of growing geopolitical competition, monetary policy has become a tool of statecraft. The country that controls the dominant digital payment infrastructure will wield enormous influence over global commerce. China understands this, which is why it has invested heavily in digital yuan infrastructure and is actively promoting its use. China is creating first-mover advantages that will be difficult or even impossibly to overcome if we continue to stall.

The Federal Reserve has spent years studying CBDC technology. We should be encouraging and guiding them on this task rather than holding them back. In doing so, critics should keep in mind that CBDC implementation need not be revolutionary. A digital dollar should complement rather than replace physical currency, giving Americans choice while maintaining familiar monetary arrangements. So too could retailers freely choose whether to accept digital payments, just as they currently decide whether to accept credit cards. Additional privacy protections for all users can also be built into the system's architecture, not added as an afterthought.

The real threat to American privacy and financial sovereignty isn't a democratically governed CBDC—it's ceding monetary leadership to authoritarian competitors and unaccountable private corporations that enrich themselves off our data while impoverishing the worst off among us.

The question isn't whether digital currencies will reshape global finance, it's whether America will lead this transformation or watch from the sidelines as others determine the future of money. For the sake of American competitiveness, financial inclusion, and yes, even privacy, it's time for a digital dollar.

Introduction

On July 31, 2025, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins delivered a major policy address at the America First Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., unveiling “Project Crypto”—a Commission-wide initiative to modernize securities regulation in support of President Trump's vision of the United States as the “crypto capital of the world.” Framing the moment as a defining opportunity for American leadership in digital finance, Atkins outlined a regulatory agenda focused on integrating “on-chain” (on blockchain technology) software systems into US markets, enabling decentralized finance, and launching a new “innovation exemption” to accelerate the commercial deployment of novel technologies. His remarks signal a significant shift toward a more flexible regulatory posture that could shape the future of the US digital asset market for years to come.

American Leadership in the Age of Digital Finance

To secure US leadership in the digital finance era, Atkins unveiled Project Crypto as a Commission-wide initiative to modernize securities rules and regulations to enable America's financial markets to move on-chain. Atkins highlighted the GENIUS Act and Congress's ongoing efforts to pass market structure legislation and described the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets (PWG) Report as “the blueprint to make America first in blockchain and crypto technology.” Rejecting the prior “regulation-by-enforcement” approach, Atkins committed to reshoring crypto businesses and directed Commission staff to:

Encouraging Crypto Asset Distributions to Return to the US

Atkins announced that he has directed SEC staff to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework to bring crypto asset distributions back to the US in order to eliminate reliance on offshore structures and provide legal clarity for innovators. Specifically, he said he instructed SEC staff to:

Atkins emphasized his view that most crypto assets are not securities and that being classified as a security should not be a deterrent to development. He expressed support for crypto asset securities that offer features like voting rights and distributions. Atkins also rejected the need for premature decentralization or offshore structuring and advocated instead for a regulatory environment that encourages innovation and includes American investors.

Choice Among Custodians and Trading Venues

Atkins stressed that market participants must have “maximum choice” in how they custody and trade crypto assets. He reaffirmed his strong support for self-custody, calling it a “core American value,” while recognizing that many investors will continue to rely on SEC-registered intermediaries like broker-dealers and investment advisers.

To address this and implement the PWG Report's recommendation to modernize the SEC's custody rules, Atkins directed SEC staff to evaluate how to adapt the existing custody regime to accommodate crypto assets, including through exemptive relief and potential rule changes. He also called for allowing market participants to operate across multiple business lines under the most efficient licensing structure possible and expressed support for regulatory flexibility that protects investors without imposing unnecessary burdens.

Horizontal Integration of Product Offerings

Atkins identified enabling “super-apps” as a key priority of his chairmanship. He defined them as platforms that allow securities intermediaries to offer a wide range of services—including trading in crypto asset securities, non-security crypto assets, crypto services (such as asset “staking”), and traditional securities—under a single license. He asserted that the federal securities laws do not prohibit SEC-registered venues from listing non-securities today. Accordingly, Atkins directed SEC staff to:

Atkins also called on the SEC and other regulators, consistent with the PWG Report, to streamline licensing structures and avoid duplicative regulatory burdens, emphasizing the importance of regulatory efficiency and competition.

Integrating On-Chain Systems in Securities Markets

Atkins directed SEC staff to update outdated rules and regulations to support the integration of on-chain software systems into US securities markets. He explained that these systems vary in structure—some are fully decentralized and operate without intermediaries, while others have identifiable operators. Both models, he emphasized, should be accommodated within the regulatory framework. Atkins stressed the importance of enabling decentralized systems, such as automated market makers, which facilitate non-intermediated financial activity. He noted that while federal securities laws have traditionally assumed the presence of intermediaries, regulation should not impose intermediaries where markets can function without them.

Atkins also stated that the SEC will work to protect pure publishers of software code, clarify the distinction between intermediated and disintermediated activity, and establish practical rules for intermediaries operating on-chain. These systems, he said, should not be stifled by duplicative or unnecessary regulation. Atkins acknowledged that to implement this vision, rule changes may be necessary, including potential amendments to Regulation NMS to accommodate tokenized securities trading.1

Commercial Viability as the Guiding Principle

Atkins concluded by calling for a more flexible regulatory posture that prioritizes commercial viability. He proposed a new “innovation exemption” to allow novel business models and technologies to enter the market quickly, even if they don't fit neatly within existing SEC rules. This exemption would be principles-based, requiring compliance with core objectives of federal securities laws without imposing rigid or incompatible requirements.

Atkins suggested that conditions under the exemption could include periodic reporting, use of whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality—which restrict transactions to pre-approved, compliant participants—and limitations on tokenized securities that do not comply with standards like ERC-3643, which embeds features such as identity verification and transfer restrictions. He emphasized that both SEC staff and market participants should evaluate new models with an eye toward practical implementation and market readiness.

Conclusion

Atkins's speech marks a major shift in the SEC's approach to digital assets. With the launch of “Project Crypto,” the Commission is moving toward a proactive regulatory framework aimed at making the US a global leader in blockchain finance. While guidance, rulemaking and the “innovation exemption” are still underway, a federal pathway for the blockchain industry is becoming apparent. Market participants should actively monitor key developments (including the GENIUS Act, the PWG Report, and market structure legislation), consider engaging directly with the Crypto Task Force, and review their business structure, products, and compliance programs to position themselves for this new regulatory framework.2

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Bitcoin Price (BTC) News: No Relief From Prospect of Lower Rates","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/01/crypto-carnage-continues-even-as-gold-bonds-surge-on-soft-u-s-jobs-data","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 18:26:37 GMT","

Soft U.S. July jobs numbers released Friday morning combined with shocking revisions lower to June and May prints to produce the weakest three-month period of employment growth since the Covid shutdowns of 2020.

The data seems likely to put an end to the wait-and-see approach of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and set the central bank on a path to restarting rate cuts at its next meeting in September.

That's sent the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond plunging 14 basis points to 4.22% and the price of gold pumping 1.5% to $3,400 per ounce and back within sight of its record high.

Whither two other interest-rate sensitive assets: bitcoin and stocks? Not so much. With about 90 minutes to go in the U.S. trading session, both are at session lows, with the Nasdaq plunging 2.5% and bitcoin down more than 3% to $113,800.

And bitcoin's an outperformer. Ether (ETH), solana SOL$165.90 BNB (BNB), and dogecoin DOGE$0.2074 are all down about 6%. Notably holding its own is XRP (XPR), off just 2.9%.

""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell is a disaster,"" said President Trump on Truth Social shortly after the jobs report. ""DROP THE RATE.""

Minutes ago, the president again took to his social media platform to call for the firing of Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the Commission of Labor Statstics (the group overseeing the jobs data), accusing her of cooking the books to boost Biden/Harris last year and make things look worse under his administration.

As for crypto-related stocks, don't ask. Coinbase (COIN) has plunged nearly 18% as the day's risk-off mood combined with a punk earnings report Thursday evening. Tradfi-related peer Robinhood (HOOD) is lower by only 3.1%. 

Also reporting last night was bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) and it's tumbling 17%. Peer MARA Holdings (MARA) is down 3%.

High-flying stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) is off 7.5%, as is bitcoin treasury leader Strategy (MSTR).

Bitcoin's on-chain velocity—how often coins move—is at decade lows. To some, that's a red flag: has Bitcoin lost momentum? Is it still being used?

In fact, falling velocity may be the clearest signal yet that Bitcoin is maturing, not stagnating. Instead of circulating like cash, Bitcoin is increasingly being held like gold.

In traditional economics, velocity refers to how often money changes hands; it's a proxy for economic activity. For Bitcoin, it tracks how frequently BTC is transacted on-chain. In Bitcoin's early days, coins moved frequently as traders, early adopters, and enthusiasts tested its use cases. During major bull runs, like those in 2013, 2017, and 2021, transaction activity spiked, with BTC flowing quickly between wallets and exchanges.

Today, that has changed. More than 70% of BTC hasn't moved in over a year. Transactional churn has slowed. At face value, this could seem like declining usage. But it reflects something else: conviction. Bitcoin is being treated as a long-term asset, not just a short-term currency. And that shift is driven largely by institutions.

Since the launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, institutional holdings have soared. As of mid-2025, spot ETFs hold over 1.298 million BTC, approximately 6.2% of total circulating supply. When including corporate treasuries, private companies, and investment funds, total institutional holdings approach 2.55 million BTC around 12.8% of all Bitcoin in circulation. These assets remain largely static, stored in cold wallets as part of long-term strategies. Firms like Strategy and Tesla are not spending their Bitcoin; they're holding it as a strategic reserve.

That's bullish for scarcity and price. But it also lowers velocity: fewer coins circulating, fewer transactions happening on-chain.

It's important to note that on-chain velocity doesn't capture all of Bitcoin's economic activity.

On-chain velocity only tells part of the story. Increasingly, Bitcoin's real economic activity is happening off the base layer, and outside traditional measurements.

Take the Lightning Network, THE Bitcoin's Layer-2 scaling solution which enables fast, low-cost payments that bypass the main chain entirely. From streaming micropayments to cross-border remittances, Lightning makes bitcoin usable in everyday scenarios, but its transactions don't appear in velocity metrics. As of mid-2025, public Lightning capacity surpassed 5,000 BTC, reflecting a nearly 400% increase since 2020. Private channel growth and institutional experimentation suggest the real number is much higher.

Similarly, Wrapped Bitcoin WBTC$113,677.86 is enabling BTC to circulate across Ethereum and other chains, fueling DeFi protocols and tokenized finance. In the first half of 2025 alone, WBTC supply grew by 34%, a clear signal that bitcoin is being deployed, not dormant.

And then there's custody: institutional wallets, ETF cold storage, and multisig treasury tools allow firms to hold BTC securely, but often without moving it. These coins may be economically significant, yet they contribute nothing to on-chain velocity.

In short, Bitcoin is likely more active than it appears, it's just happening outside traditional velocity metrics. Its utility is shifting to new layers and platforms- payment rails, smart contract systems, yield strategies—none of which register in traditional velocity models. As Bitcoin evolves into a multi-layer monetary system, we may need new ways to measure its momentum. Falling on-chain velocity doesn't necessarily mean usage is slowing. In fact, it might just mean we're looking in the wrong place.

While slow velocity reflects conviction and long-term holding, it also presents a challenge. Fewer on-chain transactions mean fewer fees for miners: a growing concern after the 2024 halving, which cut block rewards in half. Bitcoin's long-term security model depends on a healthy fee market, which in turn relies on consistent economic activity.

There's also the question of perception. A network where coins rarely move can start to resemble a static vault rather than a dynamic marketplace. That may strengthen the “digital gold” thesis but weakens the vision of bitcoin as usable money.

This is the core design tension: Bitcoin aims to be both a store of value (digital gold) and a medium of exchange (peer to peer cash) . But those roles don't always align. Velocity is the measure of that push and pull, this ongoing struggle between preservation and utility, and how Bitcoin navigates it will shape not just usage patterns, but its role in the broader financial system.

In the end, falling velocity doesn't mean Bitcoin is being used less. It means it's being used differently. As Bitcoin gains value, people are more inclined to save it than spend it. As adoption grows, infrastructure moves off-chain. And as institutions enter, their strategies center on preservation, not circulation. The Bitcoin network is evolving. Velocity isn't vanishing; it's going silent, reshaped by a changing user base and new layers of economic activity.

If velocity ticks up again, it could mark a resurgence of transactional use; more spending, more movement, more retail involvement. If it stays low, it suggests Bitcoin's role as macro collateral is taking firm root. Either way, velocity offers a window into Bitcoin's future. Not as a coin to spend, but as an asset to build on.

 After banning retail access to crypto ETNs and derivatives in 2021, the FCA has reversed its approach in favor of ETN access for retail. 

The United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has lifted the ban on retail access to cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes (cETNs).

Companies in the UK will soon be able to offer retail consumers cETNs, with regulatory changes effective Oct. 8, according to an FCA announcement on Friday.

The new development in the UK's regulatory approach on crypto comes after the FCA banned crypto ETNs in January 2021, citing the extreme volatility of crypto assets and a “lack of legitimate investment need” for retail consumers.

“Since we restricted retail access to cETNs, the market has evolved, and products have become more mainstream and better understood,” David Geale, FCA executive director of payments and digital finance, said in the announcement.

Unlike cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which track the price of underlying assets like Bitcoin (BTC) in custody, crypto ETNs are not backed by any underlying assets and represent debt securities.

“Instead of equity in the fund, each traded note of an ETN represents an obligation from a legal entity holding the underlying asset as collateral,” according to the ETN description by the Austrian crypto trading platform Bitpanda.

By investing through an ETN tracking crypto, investors can obtain exposure to physical crypto assets via their regular brokers or banks.

ETNs are associated with risks like limited control over their assets, which underscores the importance of purchasing ETNs from reputable institutions to ensure safety, Bitpanda said.

While allowing crypto ETNs, the UK FCA is yet to make a decision on whether to allow retail investors to access crypto derivatives, which the authority banned alongside ETNs in 2021.

“The FCA will continue to monitor market developments and consider its approach to high-risk investments,” the regulator stated.

Crypto derivatives, or products such as crypto futures, options and perpetual contracts, have shown resilience in the second quarter of 2025, with volumes netting $20.2 trillion, according to the crypto analytics platform TokenInsight.

In contrast, centralized exchanges' (CEXs) volumes plummeted by 22%, showing a big contrast to cryptocurrency ETFs.

Cryptocurrency ETFs have seen remarkable growth since their historic launch in the US in 2024, with issuers like BlackRock posting a 370% surge in inflows in Q2 2025 and crypto funds breaking multiple records.

On Tuesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delivered another crucial decision on crypto ETFs, authorizing issuers to proceed with in-kind creations and redemptions or to exchange ETF shares for the underlying crypto assets.

Although the move is largely seen as big news for the crypto industry, ETF analysts like Eric Balchunas say that the event will likely have little to no impact on retail investors.

“It's not a huge impact to retail but more of a plumbing fix. It just makes the pipes a little better,” Balchunas said in an X post on Tuesday. The biggest takeaway from the milestones is that the SEC is ready to treat crypto like a legit asset class, he added.

 Following the landmark US passage of the GENIUS Act, Fabian Dori of Sygnum Bank breaks down what lies ahead for stablecoins, institutional adoption and global crypto regulation. 

The recent US passage of the GENIUS Act marked a significant turning point for stablecoins, setting a regulatory precedent that may shape digital finance globally.

Fabian Dori, chief investment officer at Sygnum Bank, joined the latest episode of Cointelegraph's Byte-Sized Insight podcast, detailing how the act will influence stablecoin adoption, institutional engagement and international regulatory alignment.

The GENIUS Act, which introduces a clear federal regulatory framework for fiat-backed stablecoins, demands full transparency from issuers, including one-to-one asset backing, mandatory federal licensing and independent reserve audits. 

According to Dori, these provisions are essential for driving responsible innovation and financial stability.

“I truly think that the impact of the GENIUS Act will be significant, both in the short and in the long term,” said Dori.

Yet, one controversial aspect of the act, the prohibition of yield-bearing stablecoins, may substantially reshape how stablecoins integrate within decentralized finance (DeFi).

Dori points out that the move may create a clearer market distinction between payment-focused stablecoins and yield-generating tokenized money market products.

“It's true that it's not possible anymore to earn yield directly from holding fiat-backed stablecoins,” he said.

Another key topic discussed is the divide between regulation in Europe and the US.

Europe, which has been cautious in its regulatory stance, particularly with the digital euro initiative, may now face pressure to accelerate innovation due to the US stance taken through the GENIUS Act.

“It seems a bit like the US is much more focusing on a framework that allows and drives innovation, while Europe is primarily focused on risk management,” Dori said.

U.S. Science and Scientific American Have Weathered Attacks Before and Won

Federal officials seized 3,000 copies of Scientific American in 1950 in a “red scare” era of attacks on science. The move backfired and offers lessons for today

We're celebrating 180 years of Scientific American. Explore our legacy of discovery and look ahead to the future.

Worth recalling in this anniversary year, one of Scientific American's proudest moments came in a past era of attacks on science. The lesson—that speaking out for science is worth the criticism it brings—is surely worth recalling today.

The year was 1950, and the “red scare” was fully underway, alongside a nascent arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The Soviet demonstration of an atomic bomb in 1949 had galvanized calls for a bigger bomb, a hydrogen bomb, in the U.S., sparking the paranoia today best remembered for claiming the career of Manhattan Project chief J. Robert Oppenheimer. But a war on scientists not toeing the political line was in full swing then, and Scientific American was in the thick of it.

On March 20, 1950, a U.S. Atomic Energy Commission agent named Alvin F. Ryan seized and burned 3,000 copies of the forthcoming April issue of Scientific American, which the commission claimed held atomic secrets. Ryan also supervised the melting of four printing plates holding a feature story in the issue, “The Hydrogen Bomb: II,” that contained the supposedly objectionable information within one of its columns.

“Strict compliance with the commission's policies would mean that we could not teach physics,” said an outraged Gerard Piel, then publisher of Scientific American, in the April 1, 1950, report of the seizure on the front page of the New York Times. He threatened to take further censorship to the Supreme Court.

Piel had relaunched Scientific American in 1948, with a focus on bringing the views of scientists like Bethe, thoughtfully edited, to the public. This scientists-as-writers approach came about by happenstance, Scientific American editor Gary Stix found while researching the history of the magazine. Piel found it was cheaper to pay scientists to write copy and then rewrite it, rather than hire magazine writers. The approach proved so successful, with the public then clamoring to hear the news straight from scientists, that the magazine had 100,000 readers and 133 pages of advertising by 1950.

Berthe's article was just one of four published by the magazine on the H-bomb, which President Harry Truman had decided to pursue in January of 1950. Much debate, among scientists and the public, followed over whether such a weapon would make the U.S. safer or endanger humanity. The Nobel Prize–winning discoverer of how fusion in stars baked elements, Bethe, was in the latter camp. His article went through the physics of fusion and pled to “save humanity from this ultimate disaster” by reconsidering the president's H-bomb decision, or at least pledging no first use of the weapons in warfare, a commitment still unmade, and widely debated in nuclear circles.

“Piel had made his publication an important forum for critical analysis of U.S. science policy during the coldest years of the cold war,” in exposing the Atomic Energy Commission's attack on press freedom, wrote history professor Alfred W. McCoy. To satisfy the AEC, Bethe made four “ritual” cuts to the final version of the article and published it.

Even so, U.S. security officials continued to pressure scientists and the press over the course of the red scare. The FBI searched Bethe's luggage after a European trip in 1951. “Scientific American runs to the sort of stuff which the Soviets would like to see in a popular science journal,” claimed an AEC memorandum that same year. The U.S. tested its first H-bomb a year later, and stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance, in 1954, in a power play now seen as a political vendetta. The arms race played out through the 1960s, building stockpiles of tens of thousands of nuclear missiles on both sides until its folly, and frightening close brushes with Armageddon, lowered those numbers in an era of détente, the sort of world that Bethe had called for in his article.

All the while, Scientific American stood for the importance of scientists speaking out, and providing the public, even amid the unhinged persecution of the red scare, choices for a better world. Throughout science, the lesson stood, among eminent voices ranging from Linus Pauling to Carl Sagan. Scientists led calls for test ban treaties and disarmament; they warned of nuclear winter throughout the cold war. In the magazine, former CIA official Herbert Scoville Jr. warned of the danger of a new generation of U.S. submarines as “first-strike” weapons, that familiar warning, in 1972. Bethe himself kept speaking out, against the Reagan administration's “Star Wars” missile defense plan as unworkable, costly and destabilizing in the 1980s (views heard today on its current “Golden Dome” revival). Accepting the Einstein Peace Prize in 1992, he acknowledged that while scientists had not ended the cold war, they had succeeded in “planting the idea there was an alternative to the arms race.”

Their example, and that idea, remains as important as ever, especially with U.S. science facing severe cuts, and nuclear weapons a renewed flashpoint in geopolitics. Piel's statement released after the 1950 seizure—“there is a very large body of technical information in the public domain which is essential to adequate public participation in the development of national policy and on which the American people are entitled to be informed”—still stands true today at this magazine. We will continue to speak out and provide scientists with a place to make their voices heard.

In the cell nucleus, chromatin is anchored to the nuclear lamina, a network of lamin filaments and binding proteins that underly the inner nuclear membrane. The nuclear lamina is involved in chromatin organization through the interaction of lamina-associated domains within the densely packed heterochromatin regions. Using cryo-focused ion beam milling in conjunction with cryo-electron tomography, we analyzed the distribution of nucleosomes at the lamin–chromatin interface at the nanometer scale. Depletion of lamins A and C reduced nucleosome concentration at the nuclear periphery, while B-type lamin depletion contributed to nucleosome density in proximity to the lamina but not further away. We then investigated whether specific lamins can mediate direct interactions with chromatin. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we identified a specific binding motif of the lamin A tail domain that interacts with nucleosomes, distinguishing it from the other lamin isoforms. Furthermore, we examined chromatin structure dynamics using a genome-wide analysis that revealed lamin-dependent macroscopic-scale alterations in gene expression and chromatin remodeling. Our findings provide detailed insights into the dynamic and structural interplay between lamin isoforms and chromatin, molecular interactions that shape chromatin architecture and epigenetic regulation.

Nuclear lamins provide mechanical support and safeguard the integrity of the cell nucleus. At the nuclear lamina (NL), lamins contribute to the organization of chromatin1,2. In mammals, four main lamin isoforms are expressed: the A-type lamins (A and C; A/C) and the B-type lamins (B1 and B2; B1/B2)3. During their posttranslational processing, lamins A, B1 and B2 are farnesylated at their C terminus. Notably, while lamin A loses its farnesyl group through a subsequent cleavage, the B-type lamins retain their farnesylation, serving as anchors to the inner nuclear membrane (INM)4. The two types of lamin proteins have been described to form two separate but interconnected filamentous meshworks5, wherein the B-type lamin meshwork is localized closer to the nuclear membrane6,7. Previous investigations of the NL of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed a 14–16-nm-thick meshwork consisting of ~3.5-nm-thick lamin filaments8,9.

Knockout (KO) of A-type lamins in MEFs greatly impacts nuclear mechanics by reducing stiffness and structural integrity10,11,12 and decoupling nuclear and cytoplasmic forces13. These observations suggest direct interactions between lamins A/C and chromatin14 at the docking sites of heterochromatic regions15,16,17,18. These large sites, commonly termed lamina-associated domains (LADs), can extend up to 10 Mb in length and are typically enriched with the H3K9me3 repressive mark, rendering them transcriptionally inactive. However, 10% of the genes inside LADs are still expressed19. Interestingly, A-type lamins were shown to also interact with euchromatic DNA20 and with facultative H3K27me3-enriched chromatin21,22,23,24, whereas lamin B1 is also localized to open and actively expressed chromatin regions25. Insufficient lamin expression results in genome remodeling, manifested by alterations in histone markers and the detachment of LADs26,27. Genome-wide approaches such as HiC or DamID have detected lamin-dependent chromatin alterations17,26,27; however, the direct molecular interactions and effects of the lamin isoforms on chromatin organization remain elusive.

To dissect the contribution of nuclear lamins to the organization of the nuclear envelope (NE), we analyzed tomograms of cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB)-milled, vitrified cells (Methods) in which the cytoplasm, NE, NL and nucleosomes were clearly observable (Fig. 1a). Next, the coordinates of nuclear lamins, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and nucleosomes were extracted from each nuclear volume (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Videos 1–3). Subsequently, the nucleosomes were subjected to subtomogram averaging and classification28,29, yielding a 13-Å-resolved structure exhibiting the typical appearance in which a DNA double strand is wrapped around a histone octamer (Extended Data Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Table 1). We then measured the in situ local concentrations and distributions of lamins and nucleosomes within LAD regions (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 3), where chromatin is attached to the NL; these regions are commonly attributed as heterochromatin-rich domains30. We quantified the number of neighboring nucleosomes within a distance of 24 nm for each nucleosome, reflecting the local nucleosome concentration (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 4a). Our analysis resolved varying nucleosome concentrations within these regions (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 4b–d), showing a fine modulation within both high (Extended Data Fig. 4c) and low (Extended Data Fig. 4d) nucleosome concentrations, in line with the limited presence of open chromatin regions near NPCs31 or within LADs32. In wild-type (WT) MEFs, this measurement revealed a specific nucleosome pattern, which showed a gradual increase in nucleosome concentration at a distance of ~20 to ~60 nm from the lamin filaments, followed by a constant nucleosome concentration farther away (Fig. 1c). This suggested a less dense chromatin organization at the NL–chromatin interface, where LADs interact directly with the lamina, than 60–100 nm away from the NL. Interestingly, the concentration of nucleosomes was not linearly correlated with the local concentration of lamin filaments at the NL (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 4e).

Significance was calculated using a one-way ANOVA. ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01 and *P < 0.05; not significant (NS), P > 0.05. A total of 15 tomograms were used for the analysis shown in c–f, h and j. Gray dashed lines in c, h and j connect the mean values of each column. Each colored triangle in e and f represents the most frequent minimal distance between nucleosomes and lamin filaments, in each tomogram.

Next, we measured the position of individual nucleosomes as a function of their distance from their closest lamin filament in every reconstructed nuclear volume, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 4f. In half of the nuclear volumes, the highest nucleosome concentration was located within a narrow range of 35–47 nm from the NL (Fig. 1e) and remained at similar levels for the next ~50 nm (Extended Data Fig. 4g). We also measured the distance from each lamin filament to its nearest nucleosome (Extended Data Fig. 4h), finding an average minimal lamin–nucleosome distance of 22 ± 5 nm across all tomograms (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 4i). This analysis further showed that 1.6% of nucleosomes are located within 10 nm of a lamin filament (Extended Data Fig. 4i, shadowed in gray). Representative examples of nucleosomes in direct contact with lamin filaments from this population are shown in Fig. 1g.

A previous study described that chromatin is excluded from the vicinity of NPCs33. We investigated the concentration of nucleosomes around NPCs and its correlation with the lamin meshwork density. To this end, we determined the coordinates of NPCs and measured the concentration of nucleosomes as a function of the distance to the center of the closest NPC (Fig. 1h–i). Given that the diameter of NPCs is ~110 nm in MEFs34, we measured the local concentration of nucleosomes within a radial distance of 60 to 160 nm from the NPCs' central coordinates. The nucleosome concentration increased with increasing distance from the NPCs, reaching the previously measured maximal values (Fig. 1c) only at a distance of >150 nm. However, the concentration of lamin filaments was less affected by distance from NPCs (Fig. 1j). Conclusively, lamin filaments are affected by specific NPC components35; however, their concentration is steady around NPCs. These results suggested that variations in chromatin density at the nuclear–lamina interface require high-resolution approaches, such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), to be detected.

To investigate the effect of A-type and B-type lamins on chromatin structure, we firstly applied super-resolution microscopy36 to visualize the global chromatin organization in WT, Lmna−/− (LmnaKO) and Lmnb1−/−;Lmnb2−/− (LBDKO) MEFs (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 5a). KO cell lines exhibited slightly enlarged nuclei (Extended Data Fig. 5b) and altered high-density chromatin foci, highlighting the role of lamins in maintaining nuclear architecture (Fig. 2b, left, and Extended Data Fig. 5c). Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence images indicated that peripheral chromatin staining was reduced in both lamin-KO cells (Fig. 2b, right). To further explore the molecular organization of the nuclear periphery at higher resolution, we used cryo-FIB milling in conjunction with cryo-ET and image analysis, as described for WT MEFs. Lamins were segmented from 13 LmnaKO and 15 LBDKO MEF tomograms and the local concentrations of lamin filaments were determined (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). While the lamin meshwork underlying the NE appeared visually similar, substantial differences were observed in the proportion of single lamin filaments without neighboring filaments. In WT MEFs, the majority of lamin filaments were organized into a closely packed meshwork, with only 16% of isolated filaments (Fig. 2c). In the absence of A-type lamins, up to 28% of filaments were isolated, whereas the removal of B-type lamins resulted in a modest increase to 19% of lamins lacking closely neighboring filaments (Fig. 2c). An additional effect of lamin A/C KO was the overall decrease in the mean count of neighboring filaments, from 2.1 in WT to 1.6 in LmnaKO cells (Extended Data Fig. 4j). Interestingly, the lamin meshwork density in LBDKO cells was not substantially altered (Extended Data Fig. 4j), possibly reflecting the enrichment of A-type over B-type lamins in these cells.

a, The chromatin in WT, LmnaKO and LBDKO MEF cells was stained by DAPI and imaged by 3D-SIM. b, Left: quantification of high-density fluorescent chromatin foci exhibited significantly lower overall fluorescence intensity in LmnaKO nuclei compared to LBDKO and WT nuclei. Right: quantification of DAPI signal revealed a reduction in peripheral chromatin in both lamin-KO cells compared to WT cells. The signal was quantified within the 40% distal area of nuclei. The numbers of nuclei assessed for volume calculation were 48 and 35 for LmnaKO, 89 and 47 for LBDKO and 47 and 36 for WT cells. c, The meshwork density of lamin filaments is shown. The number of neighboring filaments detected at <24 nm around each lamin segment is plotted. The fraction of lamins without neighboring filament was significantly increased from 16% in the WT to 28% in LmnaKO cells and 19% in LBDKO cells, with a drop in the mean neighbour count of 2.1, 1.6 and 1.9 in each cell line, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4j). d, The overall minimal lamin-to-nucleosome distances are plotted for each cell line (as in Fig. 1f). Each data point represents the highest nucleosome density distance per tomogram. The medians of the minimal lamin-to-nucleosome distances were 18.4 ± 4.1 nm for LmnaKO cells and 18.7 ± 3.8 nm for LBDKO cells, corresponding to ~82% of the WT's mean. Each colored diamond indicates the average minimal lamin–nucleosome distance in a single tomogram. e, The concentration of nucleosomes as a function of their distance from the NL (as in Fig. 1c). The lamin-independent average nucleosome concentration is presented in Extended Data Fig. 4k. Gray lines connect the median values of each column. f, For each cell line, nucleosomes are grouped into two by a distance to the center of the closest NPC of ≤160 nm or >160 nm. All box plots show a box between the 25th and 75th percentiles, the median as a horizontal line, the mean as a black square and 1.5 s.d. as whiskers. Significance was calculated using a one-way ANOVA. ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01 and *P < 0.05; NS, P > 0.05. For the analysis shown in c–f, 15 WT, 13 LmnaKO and 15 LBDKO tomograms were used.

The decrease in the minimal distance between lamins and nucleosomes demonstrated that nucleosomes were positioned closer to the NL in nuclei lacking one of the lamin types (Fig. 2d). This may be attributed to the lower occupancy of lamins and their associated factors at the NE in lamin-KO cell lines. Surprisingly, the overall nucleosome concentration was significantly reduced in LmnaKO cells, within 100 nm from the lamina, while remaining unchanged in LBDKO cells (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 4k). In LmnaKO cells, nucleosome concentrations peaked at a shorter distance of ~40 nm from the NL and did not reach the same concentration level as observed in WT cells (Fig. 2e). Notably, LBDKO cells exhibited a surge in nucleosome concentration at 40–60 nm from the NL, followed by a decline in nucleosome density, reaching concentration levels comparable to those in LmnaKO cells at 80–100 nm. These findings indicated a correlation between A-type lamin and a denser chromatin architecture at the nuclear–lamina interface that may be mediated by a direct molecular lamin–chromatin interactions.

Moreover, in both KO cell lines, we noted a statistically significant alteration in the concentration of nucleosomes around NPCs. Nucleosomes were less concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the NPC (≤160 nm away from the center coordinates of NPCs) compared to WT (Fig. 2f), indicating that alterations in lamins also affect the chromatin organization around NPCs. Thus, in addition to lamins, other NE structures, such as the NPC, impact local chromatin organization.

Previous studies showed the possibility of a direct molecular interaction between chromatin and lamins37,38 through their tail domains38,39,40. On the basis of sequence alignment (Fig. 3a), we designed a set of lamin A tail truncations (Extended Data Fig. 6a) and studied their binding properties to H2A–H2B heterodimers and reconstituted nucleosomes (Fig. 3b,c). Using pulldown assays (Methods), we found that the C-terminal tail (C-tail) of lamin A (LA 394–646) effectively binds to H2A–H2B heterodimers (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Notably, a truncated tail domain spanning from amino acids 430 to 585 (LA 430–585) exhibited a similar binding property to the full-length tail domain (LA 394–646), indicating that this region is sufficient for binding to H2A–H2B heterodimers. In contrast, truncated tail regions comprising either the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and the Ig-like domain (LA 394–548) or only the Ig-like domain (LA 430–560) did not bind to H2A–H2B heterodimers, although weak binding was detected with LA 430–579 (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements indicated a dissociation constant KD of 12 ± 1 µM for the binding of LA 430–585 to purified H2A–H2B heterodimers (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 6c).

a, A schematic view of the lamin A protein shows the various protein domains and the position of the NLS. The sequence of the lamin A tail domain, amino acids 548–585, is aligned to the other main lamin isoforms: lamin C, lamin B1 and lamin B2. The relatively conserved amino acids are colored. b, The affinity of LA 430–585 toward the H2A–H2B heterodimer was determined by FCS (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 6c). c, The affinity between LA 430–585 and nucleosomes was quantified by an EMSA (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Data are presented as the mean values ± s.d. d, The structure of the LA 430–585 (cyan)–nucleosome (gray) complex was determined by cryo-EM. The densities corresponding to the Ig-like domain (arrowhead) and additional lamin A tail (red dotted oval) were identified. The Ig-like domain was filtered to 6.8 Å. e, Variability in the position of the Ig-like domain, filtered to 6.8 Å, was detected across different structural classes (pinkish, yellow and cyan), indicating that the Ig-like domain exhibits greater flexibility compared to the stationary binding site (red dotted oval in d). f, The nucleosome structure (PDB 6ZHX) fitted into the EM density indicated that LA 430–585 interacts with the H2A–H2B heterodimer. Three independent biological replicates were applied to analyze b and c.

Source data

Next, we analyzed the interactions between LA 430–585 and reconstituted nucleosomes41 (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed direct binding between LA 430–585 and nucleosomes (Extended Data Fig. 7b), while no interactions were detected between nucleosomes and the truncated tail domain of lamin B1 amino acids 432–569 (LB1 432–569) (Extended Data Fig. 7c). We determined a KD of 48 ± 5 µM for the binding of LA 430–585 to nucleosomes (Fig. 3c). This modest affinity suggested a dynamic interaction between lamin A and nucleosomes. Subsequently, using GraFix42, we purified the complex and conducted cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis. The structure of the LA 430–585–nucleosome complex was resolved to ~3.6-Å resolution using single-particle cryo-EM (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 7d–I and Table 2). Two separate densities of the lamin A tail domain (Fig. 3d, cyan) were detected in addition to the nucleosome (Fig. 3d, gray). The characteristic density of the Ig-like domain (Fig. 3d, arrowhead) was found in multiple positions in the vicinity of the nucleosome (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 7f). The other density found attached to the nucleosome (Fig. 3d, red dashed circle) revealed a contact site with the H2A–H2B heterodimer of the nucleosome (Fig. 3f). We identified densities of a tyrosine and an arginine and assigned them to lamin A Y579 and R582. To validate these amino acid assignments, we used a shorter lamin A truncation LA 430–579 and analyzed the structure of the LA 430–579–nucleosome complex by cryo-EM (Supplementary Fig. 2). As expected, the density map showed the canonical nucleosome structure without any additional density, implying that amino acids 579–585 are indispensable for the binding of lamin A to nucleosomes.

To further explore this interaction, we analyzed the binding of a synthetic peptide comprising amino acids 572–588 of lamin A (LA 572–588) to nucleosomes. Using cryo-EM structural analysis, we resolved the complex at 2.3-Å resolution (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 8a–e and Table 2). Eight amino acids (AEYNLRSR) of the peptide were resolved at the nucleosome surface (Fig. 4b), while five amino acids (YNLRS) were found to interact with the acidic patch of the H2A–H2B heterodimer (Fig. 4c). The side chain of Y579 forms a hydrogen bond (H-bond) with H2A E56, stabilized by a hydrophobic interaction through H2A A60 and H2B V41. The main chain of N580 forms an H-bond with H2B H106 and E110. The Cβγ of H2A E61 and E64, the aromatic ring of H2A Y57 and the side chains of H2A A60 and H2B V41 provide a hydrophobic surface for holding the side chain of L581. Most importantly, R582 acts as an arginine anchor to H2A E61, D90 and E92 through salt bridges. Lastly, the side chain of S583 interacts with H2A E64 through an H-bond. Remarkably, the YNLRS motif is unique to the lamin A tail domain (Fig. 3a) and highly conserved in evolution (Extended Data Fig. 6d). The lamin A tail domain can extend up to ~50 nm from the filament, with the nucleosome-binding site positioned up to ~30 nm away (Extended Data Fig. 6e). Given that our in situ measurements showed an average distance of 22 ± 5 nm between lamin filaments and nucleosomes (Fig. 1f), direct binding between these two components at the nuclear periphery is plausible.

a, Cryo-EM structural analysis of the peptide LA 572–588 (cyan) interacting with the nucleosome (gray) through the H2A–H2B heterodimer (yellow and pinkish, respectively). b, Eight amino acids (AEYNLRSR) of the peptide LA 572–588 were identified in the negatively charged acidic patch of the nucleosome. c, Five amino acids (YNLRS) specifically interact with H2A–H2B within nucleosome. This interaction is stabilized by H-bonds, hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges. d, A schematic view of the experimental design used for studying lamin A–nucleosome interactions by TIRF microscopy. A passivated glass coverslip was patterned using deep-ultraviolet illumination (1); then, the patterned surface was coated with fluorescently labeled nucleosomes (2). The functionalized coverslip was mounted onto a PEGylated glass slide to fabricate a chamber, where fluorescently labeled LA 430–585 polypeptide was injected at the onset of the binding reaction (3). e, The fluorescence intensity of the labeled LA 430–585 polypeptide (top) associated with patterned fluorescently labeled nucleosomes (bottom) for representative single images, averaged images of 14 frames containing a total of 126 patterned spots and related s.d. images. f, The LA 572–588 peptide competes with the LA 430–585 polypeptide for nucleosome binding. The unlabeled peptide was added to the reaction mixture described in d. The fluorescence intensity of the LA 430–585 polypeptide (top) associated with the patterned fluorescently labeled nucleosomes (bottom) is shown for average images of at least 24 frames. g, The fluorescence ratio of nucleosome-associated LA 430–585 against spotted nucleosomes was calculated (Methods), and a curve was fitted with a four-parameter dose–response Hill–Langmuir equation (Methods). The best fit of the overall dataset was obtained for a maximal ratio fixed to less than 1 and showed an EC50 of 5 µM. R2 was 0.78 for the overall dataset. In e and f, fluorescence calibration bars are provided. All spots are 3 μm in diameter.

The NL features a high concentration of lamin tail domains along each filament, which can potentially interact with dense nucleosome regions constituting the LADs. To mimic this scenario, we patterned surfaces with fluorescently labeled nucleosomes to create high-concentration spots of nucleosomes. We used a fluorescently labeled LA 430–585 and exposed it to nucleosomes immobilized on patterned surfaces (Fig. 4d). Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy imaging showed that LA 430–585 bound specifically to the spotted nucleosomes (Fig. 4e), while LB1 432–569 did not, even at higher nucleosome concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 8f). Next, we demonstrated that the presence of the peptide LA 572–588 competed with LA 430–585 for nucleosome binding. This competition was evident from a decrease in fluorescence signals as a function of increasing peptide concentration (Fig. 4f). Quantification of these assays indicated a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 5 µM (Fig. 4g). While peptides commonly require higher concentrations for competition, this observation may hint at an additional low affinity of the tail domain to nucleosomes that accounts for the multiple positions of the Ig-like domain found in our structural analysis (Fig. 3e). Overall, these results showed that the direct interaction between lamin A and nucleosome occurs through the tail domain. These interactions are dynamic, as expected for elements undergoing reorganization during the cell cycle.

To reveal the impact of lamins on genome organization, we examined chromatin structure dynamics using genome-wide sequencing-based techniques, including 4 fractions sequential analysis of macromolecules accessibility sequencing (4f-SAMMY-seq)24,43, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq)44 and RNA-seq45. Genome-wide correlation analysis between the 4f-SAMMY-seq and ChIP-seq data for open and closed chromatin-associated histone modifications, as well as lamins A/C (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9a,b), confirmed that 4f-SAMMY-seq effectively captures lamin-induced changes in chromatin solubility profiles (Fig. 5a and Methods).

a, A representative genomic region of chromosome 18 (40 Mb on chr18: 35,000,000–75,000,000) showing tracks for lamin A/C ChIP-seq, H3K9me3 ChIP-seq and 4f-SAMMY-seq in the WT, LmnaKO and LBDKO cells. 4f-SAMMY-seq solubility profiles comparing the different cell lines are represented as the log of sequencing reads of the more soluble S2S over those of the less soluble S3. The line represents the mean of triplicates and the s.d. is shown as a shadow. Below each track pair, the respective significantly differentially soluble regions are indicated as follows: S2S up, red; S2S down, orange; S3 down, dark blue; S3 up, light blue. b, The percentages of the genome affected by the removal of lamin genes are shown as a stacked bar plot, following the color code described in a. c, Stacked bar plot showing the number of protein-coding genes with altered solubility (Methods). d, Chromatin compartment analysis using 4f-SAMMY-seq (Methods). The representative first eigenvector on chromosome 8 (32,000,000–95,000,000) at 50-kb resolution is reported for WT, LmnaKO and LBDKO cells. Regions with concordant (A–A and B–B) or discordant compartment (B–A and A–B) classification in LmnaKO and LBDKO compared to WT are marked. e, A stacked bar plot showing average percentages of A and B chromatin compartments in WT.

Bar plots represent significantly enriched Reactome (REACT), biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF).

Our analysis identified specific LmnaKO and LBDKO genomic regions with significantly altered solubility profiles compared to WT (Fig. 5a–c). Here, positive values of the solubility profile coincide with euchromatin, whereas negative values, enriched in the insoluble S3 fraction, match LADs43 (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). KO of both lamins resulted in ~10% genome-wide remodeling with over half of the changes affecting LADs (Fig. 5b). These changes impacted over 1,500 genes (Fig. 5c) and significantly modified gene expression patterns, confirmed by RNA-seq analysis (Extended Data Fig. 10a–d). As expected, a decrease in S3 enrichment coincided with a decrease in H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin (Extended Data Fig. 9c, S3 down). The H3K9me3 signal revealed the different impact of lamin isoforms on constitutive heterochromatin (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Additionally, our analysis indicated that the two lamin-KO cells differed by 7% in chromatin solubility changes (Fig. 5b) but still shared overlapping regions of alteration when compared to the unmodified cells (~36% S3 down and ~ 40% S3 up; Extended Data Fig. 9e). Notably, LmnaKO cells exhibited an extensive loss of heterochromatin specifically on the X chromosome (Extended Data Fig. 9f, S3 down).

On the basis of the biochemical properties of chromatin, we built three-dimensional (3D) compartmentalization maps (Methods), as seen by HiC46. Chromatin was segregated into active ‘A' and inactive ‘B' compartments for WT and lamin KOs (Fig. 5d). In both KO cell lines, ~10% of the genome underwent compartment changes, characterized by more genome regions shifting from B to A (Fig. 5e). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that A-type lamins are likely to involve in chromosome condensation, histone binding and modifications, while B-type lamins are associated with cell morphology, homeostasis and transmembrane transport (Extended Data Fig. 10e). These results suggested that A-type and B-type lamins epigenetically regulate lamin-specific domains of the genomic compartments.

To shed light on the importance of lamin A tail domain in chromatin organization, we analyzed genome compartmentalization in MEFs that transiently expressed full-length lamin A (WT + LA 1ç646) or a truncated lamin A lacking the C-tail domain (WT + LA 1–429), both fused to eGFP. We ensured comparable lamin expression levels in both cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 10f–i). Interestingly, compared to WT + LA 1–646, WT + LA 1–429 cells exhibited a 6% shift from B to A and only a 2% shift from A to B, suggesting that the lamin A tail domain supports B compartments (Fig. 5e). Notably, GO analysis revealed that the lamin A tail domain is primarily associated with chromatin structure, nucleosome organization and epigenetic regulation (Fig. 5f). These results were in accordance with our structural analysis.

The interactions of lamins and chromatin have been studied14,39,40; however, the precise structural details of these interactions and 3D imaging of lamin–chromatin interplay at the nuclear periphery remain unresolved. By using state-of-the-art in situ and in vitro approaches, we shed light on how different lamin isoforms modulate nucleosome distribution at the NL and around the nuclear pores, impacting heterochromatin compartmentalization and transcription regulation. As summarized in Fig. 6, our findings suggest that, at the interface between the NL and chromatin, the intrinsically disordered and extensible C-tails of lamin A interact with chromatin through their YNLRS motif (Fig. 6, top left). Although the C-tail domain of lamin A exhibits a modest affinity to nucleosome, the high concentration of lamin A at the lamina, coupled with densely packed nucleosomes in LADs, facilitates continuous, albeit dynamic, lamin√chromatin interactions. In LmnaKO cells, this interaction is tuned down because of the loss of direct or indirect lamin A–chromatin associations. As a result, nucleosome density at the nuclear periphery is reduced (Fig. 6, right), leading to altered heterochromatin organization and compartmentalization.

The model shows lamins and chromatin organization underneath the NE in WT and LmnaKO MEF cells. The chromatin (nucleosomes in green) forms a dense structure at the NE by association with the NL, consisting of lamins A/C (red) and lamins B1/B2 (yellow) in WT cells. Top left, lamin A can interact with the nucleosomes through its tail domain. In the absence of A-type lamins (LmnaKO), chromatin remodeling affected the concentration of nucleosomes at the NE, which are less densely packed and shifted closer to the more dispersed NL. These structural effects lead to major nuclear reorganization, including a large number of genes moving from transcriptionally active compartment A to inactive compartment B and vice versa.

The expression of lamin A varies across cells and tissues47. Therefore, direct lamin A–chromatin interactions are likely to frequently occur in cellular systems with high level of lamin A expression. Additionally, lamin A is also found in the nucleoplasm, where phosphorylated lamins A/C are associated with presumably active transcription chromatin48,49. In this case, lamin–nucleosome or lamin–H2A–H2B interactions may take place and function during transcription.

Our structural analysis revealed that the motif YNLRS in lamin A specifically recognizes the acidic patch formed by the H2A–H2B heterodimer within nucleosomes (Fig. 6, top left). The acidic patch is not a known target for histone modifications, which predominantly occur on the histone tails. The lamin A–nucleosome interaction is presumably independent of histone modifications. However, previous studies demonstrated that the depletion of lamin A reduces the activity of methyltransferase Suv39h1, resulting in decreased levels of H3K9me3 (ref. 50). Therefore, it is plausible that, upon binding to nucleosomes, the Ig-like domain of lamin A may facilitate the recruitment of methyltransferases, thereby contributing to the maintenance of highly compacted heterochromatin. Importantly, the structural positioning of the Ig-like domain within the lamin A tail presumably enables the recruitment of chromatin-associated factors without interfering with its nucleosome-binding function.

Most importantly, this interaction is unique to lamin A and appears to be evolutionarily conserved, as other lamin isoforms lack the YNLRS sequence motif. Hence, this study suggests a functional distinction between lamin A and other isoforms. Consequently, the lamin A–chromatin interaction leads to reduced dynamics of lamin A compared to lamin C, as shown previously51. Indeed, the removal of a fragment of lamin A that contains LA 572–588 increases its mobility at the NL52. Moreover, several mutations impacting the YNLRS motif and the surrounding region have been identified in persons with laminopathy, including R582C (ref. 53), R582H (ref. 54), S583L (ref. 55) and R584H (ref. 56). These substitutions are associated with familial partial lipodystrophy, while the E578V and C588R (ref. 57) substitutions are linked to atypical progeroid syndrome. Together, these disease-linked mutants underscore the importance of the YNLRS motif in lamin A.

The lamin A tail domain is composed of two intrinsically disordered amino acid stretches, 45 and 98 aa in length, separated by a well-structured Ig-like domain (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6e). These long, intrinsically disordered regions enable the lamin A tail domain to extend up to ~50 nm. The position of the nucleosome-binding motif in the lamin A tail can be localized up to 30 nm from the NL. This extension would allow the tail domain to be associated with other factors while bound to nucleosomes. For example, the barrier to autointegration factor simultaneously binds to DNA and Ig-like domain, potentially enhancing lamin A binding to nucleosomes58. Similarly, intrinsically INM proteins (for example, Emerin, LEMD2 and LBR)59 exhibit comparable behavior.

The organization of chromatin at the NE allows cells to regulate gene expression and other essential nuclear functions17. Here, we revealed the alteration in spatial nucleosome concentration at the NE as a consequence of the KO of specific types of lamins in MEFs. The surface of the NL is enriched with flexible and unstructured protein domains, primarily the C-tails of lamins and their associated proteins. KO of lamins creates additional vacant space at the NE, allowing nucleosomes to localize in the vicinity of the lamina. In LmnaKO cells, nucleosome concentration is reduced at a distance of 40–60 nm from the lamina. In contrast, loss of B-type lamins leads to an increased nucleosome concentration within this same range, suggesting that A-type lamins have a key role in promoting nucleosome accumulation at the nuclear periphery. In WT cells, chromatin at the NL, primarily consisting of LADs, is enriched with heterochromatin histone methylation marks and only hosts a small fraction of expressed genes60. However, our data revealed, even in WT MEFs, local variations in the concentration of nucleosomes at the NE, which may correlate with more open chromatin, typically associated with expressed genes.

Nuclear lamins and chromatin synergistically form a mechanical functional unit to overcome cellular and environmental stress61. This synergy relies on tight interactions between these two structures. Cells that express different isoforms of lamins show variations in the lamin meshwork. Notably, we found a reduced concentration of nucleosomes (that is, chromatin) at the NL of MEF cells that express solely B-type lamins. This coincides with previous observations indicating that A-type lamins are mostly expressed in differentiated cells, where the interactions of tightly packed heterochromatin with the NL are enhanced62. Consistently, only modest changes in nucleosome concentration were detected upon the removal of B-type lamins, suggesting that A-type lamins exert a prominent influence on chromatin organization at the NE (Fig. 6).

Genome-wide chromatin analysis revealed that A-type and B-type lamins have a selective role in the functional organization of the genome, predominantly by controlling heterochromatin organization (Fig. 5). In agreement with structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and cryo-ET analyses, the absence of A-type lamin results in rearranged global chromatin organization, including changes in LADs, and a reduction in H3K9me3 levels63. These alterations correlate with our genomic analyses showing that A-type lamins influence heterochromatin solubility and impair transcription from these regions. Interestingly, the absence of B-type lamins leads to a loss in H3K9me3 domain boundaries. Overall, A-type and B-type lamins display distinct patterns of transcriptional regulation, suggesting their involvement in specific epigenetic pathways and underlying the importance of native lamin expression in retaining functional nuclei. Most importantly, the expression of C-tail-deficient lamin A, lacking the YNLRS lamin A nucleosome-binding motif, reducing densely packed chromatin B compartments. This may explain the reduced nucleosome concentrations observed at the nuclear periphery of LmnaKO cells. Moreover, it suggests a substantial alteration of chromosome organization in agreement with single-cell fluorescence analysis in MEFs64 and previous genome-wide analysis65.

In summary, we used in vitro and in situ structural analysis to reveal the molecular basis of lamin–chromatin interactions in conjunction with genome-wide analysis. Our findings demonstrate the lamin-dependent organization of the 3D genome and its impact on gene expression variability. A-type and B-type lamins exhibit differential regulatory roles in chromatin architecture, with lamin A distinguished by its direct interaction capabilities with nucleosomes. Therefore, retaining the native levels of each lamin isoform is important for the optimal function of cells.

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The data met the assumptions of the statistical tests used; normality and equal variances were formally tested. The experiments were not randomized, and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments or outcome assessment.

WT, Lmna−/−, and Lmnb1−/−+Lmnb2−/− MEFs were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in high glucose DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, D5671) supplemented with 10% FCS (v/v), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, G7513) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, P0781). Cells were seeded onto glow discharged cryo-EM grids (Quantifoil 2/1, 200 mesh, Au) overnight. Grids were washed in 1xPBS (Fisher bioreagents, BP399-1) before manual plunge freezing into liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. Grids were stored in liquid nitrogen before further use. WT, Lmna−/−, and Lmnb1−/−+Lmnb2−/− cells were cultured in parallel, with each cells consisting of >3 independent biological replicates.

Grids were clipped into CryoFIB AutoGrids (Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA) before being transferred to the FIB-SEM loading station. The grids were mounted onto a custom-built grid holder before being sputter coated with 8 nm Pt/C in a Leica BAF060 system cooled to −160 °C and directly inserted into the Zeiss-Auriga 40 Crossbeam FIB-SEM with a stage temperature of −150 °C. Before milling, grids were covered with 2×5 s flashes of organometallic platinum with the internal gas injection system. Milling was performed at a stage angle of 18 ° and a FIB beam current from 240 to 20 pA at a constant voltage of 30 kV. The process was controlled with the Nano Patterning and Visualization Engine software (Zeiss) and progress was observed with the SEM. Grids with finished lamellae with a thickness of 100–200 nm were stored in liquid nitrogen until further usage.

Grids with FIB-milled lamellae were transferred to a Titan Krios EM instrument (Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA) equipped with a Gatan K2 summit direct electron detector and a Gatan energy filter operated at 300 kV in zero-loss mode. Tomograms of the NE were acquired with a magnification of 64000x (0.21 nm pixel size) with −4 µm defocus and a dose symmetric tilt scheme66 from ±60 ° in 3 ° increments and a total dose of 160 e−/Å2 in SerialEM67.

Drift-corrected tilt series were aligned and CTF corrected with IMOD68 using either platinum depositions as fiducials or the IMOD patch tracking for alignment. For subsequent lamin and nucleosome detection, tomograms were reconstructed with WBP in bin 4 with a SIRT-like filter applied.

Total 100 WT, 53 LmnaKO, 52 LBDKO tomograms from 90 cells were collected. The final analysis was conducted on 43 tomograms with the highest signal to noise ratio, because of the similar thickness of the lamellae (~150 nm). Nucleosomes were detected using a crYOLO69 model trained on a data subset of 10 tomograms and applied on the full dataset from all three cell lines. This resulted in 130000 initial nucleosome coordinates, which were imported into MATLAB R2019b (MathWorks, USA) using the TOM toolbox70 where subtomograms of 16x16x8 pixels were projected in the z-direction to generate 2D particles71. Subsequently, with these particles a 2D classification was performed with RELION 4.0.134,72 to remove obvious non-nucleosome particles and particles that could not form reasonable 2D classes(Supplementary Fig. 1a).

In order to estimate the ratio of false-positive nucleosomes in the remaining subtomograms after 2D classification (103173 particles), we defined the cytoplasmic (false-positive) picking ratio (CPR) as the ratio between the number of false-positive particle coordinates in the cytoplasm and the total number of picked particles. To measure the CPR (Extended Data Fig. 1), we overlaid the particle coordinates with the tomographic data and annotated the particle coordinates, which were localized in cytoplasmic regions of the tomograms. This procedure was implemented as a graphical user interface in MATLAB R2019b.

For the calculation of the in-situ nucleosome consensus average (Extended Data Fig. 2b) the subtomograms were reconstructed with a binning factor of 2 (voxel size 4.4 Å) and a box size of 64x64x64 voxels. The subtomograms were processed using a Refine3D job in RELION 5.073 with 7.5° initial angular sampling, an initial offset range of 5 pixels, and the maxsig parameter set to 300. The initial reference for 3D refinement was created by low-pass filtering the nucleosome structure EMD-33132 ref. 74 to 40 Å (Extended Data Fig. 2a). During the alignment process, a reference mask to minimize the influence of neighbouring nucleosomes was applied. This mask was created with the RELION command relion_mask_create based on the initial reference by extending the binarized reference of 4 voxels and adding a soft edge of 8 voxels. The resolution of the in-situ nucleosome consensus average (Extended Data Fig. 2b) reached 15 Å (Supplementary Fig. 1b, d), which was estimated based on gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) using the RELION command relion_postprocess.

For 3D classification (Extended Data Fig. 2c) the subtomograms were processed with a Class3D job in RELION 5.0. In this calculation the number of classes was set to 40, the regularization parameter to 1, the angular sampling interval to 7.5°, the offset search range to 5 pixels, and the maxsig parameter to 300. The same initial reference and reference mask were used as described above. The 3D classification was stopped after 17 iterations. The class which attracted the most subtomograms (13255 particles) was selected for further processing.

Subsequently, the selected particles were processed with an identical Refine3D job as described above for the consensus average (except the maxsig parameter was increased to 2000), starting again with the 40 Å low-pass filtered initial reference. Next, the selected particles were reconstructed without binning (voxel size 2.2 Å) and a box size of 128x128x128 voxels. In order to calculate the final in-situ nucleosome canonical average (Extended Data Fig. 2d) the unbinned subtomograms were processed with another Refine3D job in RELION 5.0. Here an initial angular sampling of 7.5°, an initial offset range of 5 pixels, and a maxsig parameter of 2000 were set. As reference map the result of the preceding 3D refinement was used, rescaled to a voxel size of 2.2 Å and low-pass filtered to 18 Å. This structure was also used to create the reference mask for this Refine3D job with relion_mask_create by extending the binarized reference of 4 voxels and adding a soft edge of 8 voxels. The resolution of the final in-situ nucleosome canonical average (Extended Data Fig. 2d) reached 13 Å (Supplementary Fig. 1c, e), which was estimated based on gold-standard FSC using relion_postprocess.

Lamins were manually segmented using IMOD's68 3dmod software. To be able to properly follow the filaments, the tomograms were rotated using the slicer viewer to bring the lamina into the viewing plane. Resulting filament coordinates were imported into MATLAB R2019b (MathWorks, USA) and resampled into equidistant coordinates with a 3.5 nm distance using the interparc function75. This resulted in 44880 lamin coordinates across the three cell lines. Additionally, in the tomograms containing one or more NPCs, the centres of the NPCs were defined as coordinates for further measurements.

All distance and neighbourhood measurements were performed in MATLAB R2019b (MathWorks, USA). For all measurements, we excluded nucleosomes that were further away from the NL than 100 nm because of the different field of views between tomograms and to focus on the lamin-peripheral nucleosomes. All neighbourhood measurements were done by measuring the number of neighbours in a sphere with a 24 nm radius, a volume that host twice the maximum nucleosome diameter (12 nm) from each measure coordinates.

Graphs were drawn with Origin 2018 (OriginLab, USA) and 3D visualization was performed with ChimeraX 1.776. Additionally, the Artiax77 plugin was used for the NPCs.

Histone protein expression, purification and heterodimer assembly.

Xenopus laevis histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, were expressed and purified as previously described41. H2A and H2B or H3 and H4 were mixed separately at equal molar ratios, followed by dialysis using refolding buffer (2 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT). Insoluble components were pelleted by high-speed centrifugation. Soluble H2A–H2B heterodimers and H3–H4 tetramers were purified using size exclusion chromatography (SEC).

The 197 bp DNA fragment was designed based on the 147 bp 601 wisdom nucleosomal DNA78 and cloned into the PUC57 plasmid. Large-scale PCR amplification was performed, followed by purification using the phenol-chloroform DNA extraction method. DNA was then precipitated in 70% ethanol and resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA buffer (TE buffer) for subsequent nucleosome reconstitution.

Xenopus laevis histones were assembled into nucleosomes as previously described41. Following the removal of dissolved components by centrifugation, the supernatant was concentrated and subjected to further purification using a Superdex™ 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (cytiva). The fractions obtained were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Nucleosomes containing a cysteine substitution at H4K20 (H4K20C) were reconstituted and purified using established protocols. Then the H4K20C nucleosome was dialyzed into PBS buffer, followed by two rounds of dialysis. The labeling process involved incubating the H4K20C nucleosomes with Alexa Fluor™ 488 C5 Maleimide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A10254) dye at a 5:1 molar ratio overnight at 4 °C. To quench the labeling reaction, DTT was added to the sample at a final concentration of 10 mM. Finally, free dye was separated from the labeled nucleosomes using glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation, using a 10% to 30% glycerol gradient.

DNA sequences encoding for lamin A 394–646 (LA 394–646), 394–548 (LA 394–548), 430–585 (LA 430–585), 430–579 (LA 430–578), 430–560 (LA 430–560), laminB1 432–569 (LB1 432–569) were cloned into pET28 vector. Additionally, DNA sequences for LA 430–585 and LA 430–579, intended for structural analysis, were inserted into the 6xHis-SUMO plasmid. For FCS experiments and TIRF microscopy, the LA 430–585 C570A mutation was prepared in the 6xHis-SUMO plasmid to allow specific labeling of CF660R SE dye at position C522. Lamin B1 432–569 (LB1 432–569) was also cloned into the same plasmid.

The above constructs were transformed into the BL21(DE3) bacterial strain and cultured in TB medium at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG, followed by 16 h culturing at 18 °C. Harvested bacteria were lysed into 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 25 mM imidazole buffer. Bacteria were lysed by sonication followed by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 1 h. The supernatants were applied to Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Targeted proteins were eluted by a linear gradient with elution buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM imidazole). The His-SUMO-tagged proteins were subjected to ULP1 protease incubation, followed by dialysis into the imidazole free lysis buffer for 3 h. Next, the samples were purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, allowing the target proteins to be collected and concentrated to the desired concentration. Finally, proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad™ 16/600 Superdex™ 75 pg (cytiva)., The buffer contained 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mM DTT. The samples were accessed by SDS-PAGE, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C.

Purified LA 394–646, LA 394–548, LA 430–585, LA 430–579, LA 430–560, along with a His-GST (negative control), were immobilized on the Ni-NTA resin using a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 25 mM imidazole, 0.01% tween. Rigorous washing steps were performed prior to the introduction of equimolar amounts of the H2A–H2B heterodimer to each lamin truncation. The samples were incubated for 1 h followed by extensive washing steps. Subsequently, the resin was boiled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Equal protein amounts were used for each truncation to ensure an accurate comparison.

Prior to passivation, slides and coverslips (CVs) were drastically cleansed by successive chemical treatments: 2 h in 2% Hellmanex III; rinsing in ultrapure water; 30 min in acetone; 30 min in 96% ethanol; rinsing in ultrapure water. Slides and CVs were dried using a filtered nitrogen gas flow and oxidized with oxygen plasma (3 min, 30 Watt, Femto low-pressure plasma system Type A, Diener electronic GmbH, Germany), just before an overnight incubation in a solution containing tri-ethoxy-silane-PEG (5 kDa, PLS-2011, Creative PEGWorks, USA) 1 mg/ml in 96% ethanol and 0.02% of HCl. mPEG-silane passivated slides and CVs were stored in a clean container and used within a week.

To direct the binding of nucleosomes to predefined positions on glass CVs, we used the micropatterning strategy79 by printing adhesive patterns on a protein-repellent surface. mPEG-silane passivated CVs were exposed to short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation (184.9 nm and 253.7 nm, Jelight, USA) for 2 min through 24 × 24 transparent micropatterns printed on a photomask (Compugraphics, Germany), and immediately mounted onto a PEGylated slide using a double-sided tape (3 M electronics). Then, immediately, the fabricated flow chamber was incubated for 5 to 10 min with 0.2 µM of 25% Alexa Fluor 488 labeled nucleosomes, then saturated with 0.8% BSA in a wash buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 100 mM NaCl and finally washed in the wash buffer supplemented with 0.08% BSA. Likewise, free nucleosomes were washed away, and any uncoated position was likely saturated with BSA.

Reconstitution assays were performed using freshly functionalized chambers and the Lamin A/nucleosome reaction buffer, containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.3% BSA, 0.03% TWEEN 20, 60 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.6% methylcellulose, and lamin polypeptides. The final CF660R fluorescently labeled LA 430 – 585 truncation polypeptide concentrations were 1 µM (Fig. 4e). Alternatively, nucleosome-coated patterns were also tested for their binding capacity to the CF660R fluorescently labeled LB1 432 – 569 truncation polypeptides at a final concentration of 1 µM (Extended Data Fig. 8f). The reaction medium was also supplemented with a variable concentration of unlabeled lamin A-derived peptide 572 – 588. This reaction medium was injected into a passivated flow cell at the onset of the reaction, and imaging was performed after 1 h, at steady state. Specifically for Fig. 4, the amount of nucleosome-associated lamin A truncation polypeptide 430 – 585 was calculated from 442, 815, 560, 369, 731, 653, 675, 665, 616, 298 spots for 0, 5, 10, 20, 60, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 1500 µM peptide 572 – 588, respectively, with a SEM of 0.007, 0.003, 0.010, 0.006, 0.002, 0.003, 0.002, 0.002, 0.002, and 0.004, respectively. TIRF images were acquired using a Widefield/TIRF – Leica SR GSD 3D microscope, consisting of an inverted widefield microscope (Leica DMI6000B / AM TIRF MC) equipped with a 160x objective (HCX PL APO for GSD/TIRF, NA 1.43), a Leica SuMo Stage, a PIFOC piezo nanofocusing system (Physik Instrumente, Germany) to minimize the drift for an accurate imaging, and combined with an Andor iXon Ultra 897 EMCCD camera (Andor, Oxford Instruments). Fluorescent proteins were excited using 3 solid-state diode lasers, 488 nm (300 mW), 532 nm (500 mW), 642 nm (500 mW). Laser power was set to 5% for Alexa-labeled proteins, and dyes were excited for 50 ms. Image acquisition was performed with 25 degrees-equilibrated samples and microscope stage. The microscope and devices were driven by Leica LAS X software (Leica Microsystems, GmbH, Germany).

Steady-state images taken after 1 h reaction was processed with Fiji software (NIH). 46 to 88 or 54 steady-state images were taken for LA 430–585 polypeptide +/- LA 572–588 peptide or LB1 432–569 polypeptide, respectively. To determine the ratio of nucleosome-bound lamin polypeptide to the total patterned nucleosomes, macros written in Fiji allowed to first subtract the background for each individual image and quantify the mean fluorescence intensity of lamin polypeptides and related nucleosomes immobilized on patterned spots in each individual image. The fluorescence ratio was then calculated, and data (Fig. 4f) was fitted with a dose–response curve using GraphPad Prism 10 (‘[Agonist] vs. response, Variable slope'). The equation was

where a and b are plateaus in the units of the y-axis, HillSlope describes the steepness of the curve, and EC50 is the concentration that gives a response halfway between a and b. Three parameters, EC50, HillSlope, and b, were unconstrained. The best-fit values for the three parameters, plateaus, HillSlope, and EC50, were calculated from the overall dataset, with the value of the saturation plateau set to less than 1.

To assess nucleus volume and chromatin organization at the microscopic level, overnight cultured cells were first washed in 37 °C-warmed phosphate saline solution (PBS) before being fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde (PFA). After removal of the fixative, nuclei were stained with 10 µg ml−1 DAPI solution (DAPI, FluoroPure™–grade, Thermo Fisher) and the actin cytoskeleton with one unit of Alexa 568-labeled phalloidin (Thermo Fisher). For observation, labeled fixed cells were embedded in ProLong Glass antifade (Thermo Fisher). Cells with a typical, well-organized actin cytoskeleton, observed in spread MEFs, were used to assess chromatin organization. For SIM imaging, we used an inverted widefield Zeiss microscope (Axio Observer 7 SR RP Stativ for ELYRA 7) equipped with a 63x ZEISS Plan-Apochromat objective (1.4 NA), providing a field of view of 1280 ×1280 pixels (or 82 µm), along with two pco.edge 4.2 sCMOS, a Piezo stage, an Apotome for grid-based optical light sectioning. In combination with the SIM2 processing module, Apotome imaging achieves lateral and axial resolution down to ~110 nm and ~300 nm, respectively. For the spinning disk confocal microscopy, we used an inverted widefield Olympus IXplore SpinSR10 microscope, equipped with a 60x UPLSAPO UPlan S Apo objective (1.3 NA), along with two sCMOS cameras, a YOKOGAWA CSU-W1 spinning disk, and an IX3-ZDC2 Olympus Z-drift compensator.

The 3D SIM images were reconstituted from z-stacks consisting of 13 phase images for each z-plane with the same method using SIM2 processing algorithm (Zeis). The full z range was analyzed with a sharpness setting of 3, Wiener filter and 20 iterations. The high-density fluorescence chromatin particles were segmented using the Trainable Weka Segmentation plugin (Fiji/ImageJ2), and their number, size, and fluorescence intensity, along with the overall size and fluorescence intensity of the nucleus, were measured. The images reconstructed from SIM2 algorithms using the same settings for all samples to avoid any bias into fluorescence intensity comparison, and all reconstruction parameters (number of phases and grid spacing) were consistent across all images. To compare chromatin fluorescence intensity quantitatively, the images were all acquired with the same illumination settings, and for each nucleus, chromatin fluorescence was normalized to the overall nuclear fluorescence intensity. Calculations and figures were performed using MATLAB R2019b and GraphPad Prism 10.

The nucleus volume was calculated from the 3D confocal z-stacks using Imaris software (Imaris 10.2.0 Bitplane). All nuclei were segmented using the same segmentation method obtained after training in Imaris.

The CF660R SE (Sigma-Aldrich, SCJ4600053) labeled LA 430–585 C570A and LB1 432–569 were subjected to SEC to remove free dye. FCS measurements were conducted at protein concentrations of 500 pM in a buffer composed of 20 mM HEPES pH 8 and 150 mM NaCl, supplemented with 0.01% Tween20 (to reduce surface adhesion) and 2 mM of both ascorbic acid and methyl viologen as photoprotectants. The samples were measured in µ-Slide chambers (ibidi) on a custom-built confocal single-molecule fluorescence instrument equipped with a UplanApo 60x/1.20 W objective (Olympus) and a red 640-nm diode laser (LDH-D-C-640, PicoQuant) used in continuous-wave mode at a power of 50 µW. Fluorescence photons were separated from scattered light by a triple-band mirror (zt405/530/630rpc, Chroma) and then passed through a 100-μm pinhole. CF660R photons were selected by a dichroic mirror (T635LPXR, Chroma) and an LP647RU long-pass filter (Chroma) and detected by a SPCM-AQRH-14 single-photon avalanche diode detector (Excelitas).

Data analysis was performed using Mathematica (Wolfram Research) with the custom add-on Fretica (available at https://schuler.bioc.uzh.ch/programs/). Correlation curves, G(τ), were fitted with a model that includes an amplitude, 1/N, and a diffusion time, τD, for each measurement, and triplet dynamics (with a triplet amplitude, cT, and a triplet time, τT) that is common for all points of a titration:

where s = 6 is the ratio of the axial to lateral radii of the confocal observation volume. The extracted diffusion times, τD, were plotted against H2A–H2B concentration, and this curve was fitted with a one-to-one binding model between LA 430–585 C570A and the H2A–H2B dimer. The fit parameters were the equilibrium dissociation constant KD, the diffusion time of unbound LA 430–585 C570A and the diffusion time of H2A–H2B-bound LA 430–585 C570A.

EMSA was conducted at 4 °C in a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT. Alexa 488-labeled nucleosomes were used to assess binding to LA 430–585 and LB1 432–569. A concentration of 0.05 µM of labeled nucleosomes was incubated with progressively doubling amounts of either LA 430–585 or LB1 432–569. The concentration range of LA 430–585 or LB1 432–569 spanned from 3.1 µM to 400 µM. Following 1 h incubation, the samples were loaded onto a 6% native PAGE gel and imaged for 488 nm fluorescence using Fusion Fx Spectra (Vilber). The decreased quantity of nucleosomes was calculated by ImageJ and the curves were fitted by GraphPad Prism 10.

An excess of LA 430–585 was mixed with purified nucleosomes and incubated on ice for 1 h. Grafix method42 was applied to prevent aggregation and stabilize the lamin-nucleosome complex. The glycerol gradient ranged from 10% to 30% while the gradient of glutaraldehyde ranged from 0 to 1% in a buffer containing 100 mM NaCl 20 mM, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5. A total of 200 µl of mixed the complex was loaded and centrifuged at 215,600 g for 16 h at 4 °C. The gradient was manually fractionated using 200 µl per fraction and Tris-HCl pH 8.0 was added into each aliquot to quench the excessive crosslinking. 10 µl was uploaded into 6% native PAGE, to identify the position of the complex. Fractions containing the complex were selected, and the buffer was changed into 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. As a control, LA 430–579 was prepared in a similar manner. For peptide bound nucleosome complex, 1 mM of the 17-amino-acid peptide (SSGDPAEYNLRSRTVLC, PEPTIDE 2.0 Inc.) was mixed with 1 µM nucleosome in 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 buffer.

Vitrified grids were prepared by applying 3 µl of 1 uM complex sample to a freshly glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 Au 200 mesh). The sample was blotted for 3–5 s at 4 °C with 100% humidity and plunged-frozen in liquid nitrogen cooled ethane (FEI™, Vitrobot). Electron micrographs were acquired using a 300 kV Titan Krios G3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a BioQuantom and K3 direct electron detector (Gatan) in super-resolution mode. All images were recorded by EPU (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a pixel size of 0.65 Å and a defocus range from 0.8 µM to 2.8 µM with a total exposure of ~70 e−/Å2.

Datasets were processed by CryoSPARC v4.4.180 following the workflow in Extended Data Figs.,7,8, Supplementary Fig. 2. Initially, all movies were subjected to live processing. Patch motion correction and patch CTF estimation were applied to the movies. High-quality micrographs were sorted out based on relative ice thickness and CTF resolution. Subsequently, particles were picked using automated template picking and extracted with a box size of 360 pixels, which were then down-sampled to 180 pixels for following 2D classification.

For the LA 430–585/LA 430–579 bound to nucleosome complex, particles selected after several rounds of 2D classification were used for generating three or two ab initio classes, followed by heterogenous refinement. In the case of the peptide-nucleosome complex, particles were used for generating two ab initio classes. Promising classes were subjected to focused 3D classification based on the Ig-like domain density.

Classes of interest were further processes through homogeneous refinement, non-uniform refinement, reference-based motion correction, another round of non-uniform refinement, local CTF refinement, and non-uniform refinement. The quality of the map was validated by FSC validation and local resolution analysis.

For the visualization of the nucleosome structures in Fig. 3d–f, the flexible Ig-like domain density was masked and the mean local resolution within this mask was determined as 6.8 Å. Accordingly, the Ig-like domain in the structure was low-pass filtered to this resolution. The visualization of the map is a composite between the nucleosome structure and the low-pass filtered Ig-like domain density.

For the peptide-nucleosome structure, the initial model was obtained by fitting a well-solved nucleosome model from Protein Data Bank (PDB) 6ZHX ref. 81 into the final map using ChimeraX 1.776. The model of the nucleosome was refined into cryo-EM density using Phenix 1.21.2–5419. The model of peptide was manually built in Coot 0.9.8.9582 and refined in PHENIX 1.21.2–541983 iteratively. Visualization of all cryo-EM maps and figure preparation were done by Chimera X1.776.

The 4f-SAMMY-seq was performed on 5×105 MEFs at 90% confluency using 12 units of DNase I (Invitrogen, AM2222) as described in43.

Libraries were then qualitatively and quantitatively checked on and run on the TapeStation System. Libraries with distinct adapter indexes which were normalized to a concentration of 2 nM, equimolarly, pooled, and then loaded onto the Illumina NextSeq 2000 instrument. The sequencing was performed with a minimal target of 15 million reads for 100 bases in single-end mode on the Illumina NextSeq 2000 instrument.

Total RNA was extracted from 1×106 MEFs at 90% of confluence using TRI-Reagent (Sigma, T9424) following the recommended guidelines. The quantification of total RNA was performed with a Qubit 4 fluorometer using the Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Q10210), and RNA integrity was assessed by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent, 5067–1511). For each sample, 10 ng of total RNA was used to construct a strand-specific RNAseq library with SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit - Pico Input (Takara, 634487). The quality and the size of the libraries were analyzed with TapeStation System according to the assay guide. The final RNAseq libraries were adjusted to a concentration of 4 nM, equimolarly, pooled, and then loaded onto the Illumina NextSeqTM 550 system. A sequencing depth of 20 million for 75 bases in paired-ends mode was achieved for each sample.

MEFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM (Gibco, 10566-016) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Gibco,10270106) and then fixed 10 min at RT with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, F8775), adding 1:10 of formaldehyde solution (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 11% formaldehyde) on cultured cells. Formaldehyde was then quenched with addition of Glycine (Carlo Erba, 453807) to a final concentration of 125 mM for 5 min at RT, followed by two washes with cold 1xPBS. Cross-linked cells were rapidly collected in a falcon tube by scraping on ice and centrifuged at 2000 g at 4 °C. Pellets of 3×106 cells were stored at −80 °C until sonication. Each 3×106 cell pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of cold Lysis Buffer: 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, and 0.25% Triton X-100. After 10 min on a rotator at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 1350 g at 4 °C and resuspended in 130 μl of sonication buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 04693116001); 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, 93482) and 0.25% SDS (for histone modifications) or 0,1% SDS (for lamin A/C). Cells were subjected to lysis on ice for 1 h and homogenized by pipetting every 15 min. Total extracted chromatin was sonicated in a Covaris M220 focused-ultrasonicator using snap cap microTUBEs (Covaris, 520045) (water bath set to 7 °C, peak power 75.0, duty factor 10.0, cycles/burst 250, duration 420 s). Fragmentation of chromatin to an average size of 150–500 bp was checked on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser using High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent, 5067–4626). To reduce the SDS, ChIP of histone marks were dilute to a final concentration 0.1% SDS by adding 1 volume of equilibration buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 233 mM NaCl, 1.66% Triton X-100, 0.166% Deoxycholic acid sodium salt (DOC), 1 mM EDTA, 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 04693116001), and 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, 93482). Samples were then centrifuged at 14000 g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet insoluble material. Supernatants were quantified using Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer. For immunoprecipitation, and 80 ug of chromatin was used for each histone modifications and 150 ug for lamin A/C in a final volume of 300 μl of IP buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 140 mM NaCl, 1.66% Triton X-100, 0.166% DOC, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 04693116001); 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, 93482). 3% of total chromatin was preserved at 4 °C as input normalization-control for each experimental condition. The remaining chromatin was incubated overnight on a rotator at 4 °C with 6 μg of H3K9me3 (Abcam, ab8898) or H3K27ac (Abcam, ab4729) or H3K4me3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 07-473) or 15 μg of lamin A/C (Abcam. ab26300) antibodies. 20 μl of Protein G beads (Life Technology, 1004D) for each IP were washed twice in 0.1% BSA/IP buffer and incubated on rotator overnight at 4 °C. On the next day, protein G beads were added to each sample and incubated on rotator for 2 hours at 4 °C. Beads/IP complexes were then washed 10 min on rotator at 4 °C twice with IP buffer, twice with high-salt IP buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 1.66% Triton X-100, 0.166% DOC, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 04693116001); 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, 93482); twice with RIPA-LiCl buffer: (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% DOC, 0.5% NP-40, 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 04693116001); 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, 93482); twice with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Crosslinking was reversed by incubating the beads and input at 65 °C overnight with 100 μl of Elution buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 0,5 mM EDTA, 300 mM, and 0.4% SDS. The next day, all samples were diluted with 100 μl of 1x TE buffer, treated with 2.5 U of RNAse cocktail (Ambion, AM2286) at 37 °C for 120 min, followed by addition of 100 ug of Proteinase K (Invitrogen, AM2548) at 55 °C for 120 min. DNA was then isolated using phenol/chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich, 77617) extraction, followed by a back extraction of phenol/chloroform with additional volume of 1x TE buffer. DNA was precipitated in 2 volumes of cold ethanol, 0.3 M sodium acetate and 20 ug glycogen (Ambion AM9510) for overnight at −20 °C. Pellets were suspended in 31 μl of nuclease-free water and quantified using Qubit 2.0 fluorometer with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kits (Invitrogen, Q32854). The libraries were then prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, BE7645L) and NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (NEB, BE6440S). Libraries were then qualitatively and quantitatively checked and run on the TapeStation System. Libraries with distinct adapter indexes were normalized to a concentration of 2 nM, equimolarly pooled, and then loaded onto the Illumina NextSeq 2000 instrument. The sequencing was performed with a minimal target of 15 million reads for 100 bases in single-end mode on the Illumina NextSeq 2000 instrument.

WT MEFs were transfected with plasmids encoding full-length (LA 1-646) or truncated (LA 1-429) of lamin A C-tagged with eGFP, using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L3000001), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 150,000 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate 12 hours before transfection. The medium was replaced with serum- and antibiotic-free medium, 5 µg of plasmid DNA was combined with 5 µL of Lipofectamine 3000 reagent in OPTIMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31985062) and added to each well. After 6 hours, the medium was replaced with fresh complete growth medium. eGFP-positive transfected cells were sorted 24 hours post-transfection on FACS Aria SORP (BD), seeded for an additional 24 hours, and then collected for 4f-SAMMY-seq analysis To quantify the percentage of EGFP-positive cells and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), 50,000 WT cells transfected with pEGFP-LA 1-646 or pEGFP-LA 1-429 were acquired on a BD FACSCanto flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software. Unstained cells were used as negative controls, and sequential gating was performed to exclude debris and doublets.

The results of the sequencing were demultiplexed with bcl2fastq (https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/bcl2fastq-onversion-software.html, v2.19.0.316). Both 4f-SAMMY-seq and ChIP-seq high-throughput sequencing lanes were merged with the help of GNU parallel software (http://www.gnu.org/s/parallel). All sequencing reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v0.39)84 with clip file ‘TruSeq3-SE-2. fa' and the following parameters: 2:30:10 for seed mismatch, palindrome threshold and simple threshold, respectively; 4:15 for sliding window. The minimum threshold of 36 bp length was applied for all reads. Trimmed reads were aligned using BWA (v0.7.17-r1188)85 setting -n 2 -k 2 parameters and using as reference genome the mm10 version downloaded from refgenie86. The result was saved in BAM file format. PCR duplicates were marked and removed with Picard (v2.23.9) (https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard) ‘MarkDuplicates' option, collecting the filtered reads in another BAM file. All the reads with mapping quality lower than 1 were filtered out with Samtools (v1.11)87 creating another BAM file used for subsequent analyses.

For each alignment, coverage analyses were performed using Deeptools (v3.5.0)88 with ‘bamCoverage' function. Original trimmed reads of 100 bp were extended up to 250 bp and normalized with RPKM method with a bin size of 50 bp. The mm10 size was considered of 2652783500 bp, as suggested in the Deeptools manual https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/feature/effectiveGenomeSize.html) and blacklisted regions, known to be problematic in terms of sequencing reads coverage, were obtained by ENCODE portal (https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF547MET) and excluded from the analysis. To generate the normalized relative enrichment ratios along the genome for each sample using the 4f-SAMMY fractions, the SPP, R package (v1.16.0)89 was used and the library was built under R (v4.1.2). The relative enrichment ratio between 4f-SAMMY-seq fractions was calculated per each biological replicate by comparing the S2S reads against the S3 reads, which was used as baseline (\(\frac{\rm{S2S}}{\rm{S3}}\)). Fraction specific reads were imported from BAM files with ‘read.bam.tags' function, additionally filtered with ‘remove.local.tag.anomalies', and the relative differential enrichment was computed using ‘get.smoothed.enrichment.mle' function setting ‘tag.shift = 0' and ‘background.density.scaling = TRUE'. The resulting computed signal corresponded to the log2 ratio between the pair of sequencing samples. We defined the solubility profile as the relative enrichment ratio of 4f-SAMMY-seq sequencing reads distribution along the genome for S2S vs S3 fractions. To maximize comparability with 4f-SAMMY-seq data, we computed the normalized relative enrichment ratios of ChIP-seq IP over INPUT genomic profiles using the same methodology described above. To compute correlations between genomic tracks, the smoothed differential signal enrichment was re-binned with Deeptools ‘multiBigwigSummary' at 50 kb. Genome-wide Spearman correlations between 4f-SAMMY-seq fractions and between 4f-SAMMY-seq solubility profile and ChIP-seq was computed using Deeptools, using the function ‘plotCorrelation' with the following settings: ‘–corMethod spearman -p heatmap–skipZeros'.

Each solubility profile was imported with R (v4.3) using the library GenomicRanges (v1.52.0)90, resized at genome wide level with 50 kb window. Adjacent blacklisted regions were merged if separated by less than 50 kb with the function ‘reduce' and setting ‘min.gapwidth= 50000'. It is worth remarking that having the resulting binned genome with a fixed window size of 50 kb, the genomic region adjacent and upstream to the merged blacklist region could be reduced to a different length <50 kb. On the other hand, the genomic region adjacent and downstream to the merged blacklist region were extended to 50 kb, reproducing the original window size. All solubility profiles were normalized by quantile normalization with the preprocessCore library (v1.62.1) (https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.BIOC.PREPROCESSCORE) using the function ‘normalize.quantiles'. The consensus track of each group of samples was generated by computing the mean \(\bar{x}\) of normalized solubility profiles for each genomic window. The shaded areas represent standard error intervals calculated as \({\rm{SE}}=\,\frac{\sigma }{\sqrt{n}}\) where σ is the standard deviation and n is the number of samples.

The visualization of genomic tracks was performed with Gviz R library (v 1.44.1)91. The ChIP-seq samples were imported using the function ‘import' of the rtracklayer library and plotted using the function ‘plotTracks' setting the value ‘windowSize = 1500' to plot a fine grain profile. Visualization of the 4f-SAMMY-seq consensus tracks were computed using all normalized samples of each group (for example WT, LmnaKO, LBDKO) setting the parameter type as ‘a' and ‘confint' overlayed using the function ‘OverlayTrack'. Single samples mountain plots were computed by setting the parameter type as ‘polygon'. Extra elements of the panel, chromosome ideogram and relative genome axis, were displayed using the functions ‘IdeogramTrack' and ‘GenomeAxisTrack', respectively. The murine cytobands of the chromosome ideogram were downloaded from the UCSC golden path (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/mm10/database/cytoBand.txt.gz).

Differential enrichment analyses were calculated on consensus tracks. Using the WT solubility profile, all the genomic regions with a solubility value outside the arbitrary threshold of ≤ ±0.1 were filtered out. Accordingly, the LmnaKO solubility profile was used as reference for LmnaKO vs. LBDKO comparison. Each genomic bin with a solubility score >+0.1 was considered euchromatin (S2S > S3), while each genomic bin with a solubility score <−0.1 was considered heterochromatin (S2S < S3). For each comparison (WT vs. LmnaKO, WT vs. LBDKO and LmnaKO vs. LBDKO), considering ± 2 standard error intervals for the reference strain, differentially enriched bins were identified as genomic regions where all solubility scores of the compared strain fell outside the interval of consensus of reference (WT or LmnaKO). Candidate bins were then validated with a two tailed z-test with a confidence interval of 0.99, with the function z.test from BSDA R library (v1.2.2) (https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.BSDA) and adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method for multiple testing correction with the ‘p.adjust' function and the argument ‘BH'. S2S differentially enriched bins were classified as ‘S2S UP' or ‘S2S DOWN' if, with respect to the reference strain, the compared strain increased or decreased its solubility score. S3 differentially enriched bins were classified as ‘S3 UP' or ‘S3 DOWN' if, in respect to the reference strain, the compared strain decreased (with more negative numerical values) or increased its solubility score.

Significant enriched regions of ChIP-seq for the lamin A and H3K9me3 were called in wt MEF, with EDD92 (v1.1.19), with configuration options set as: ‘max_CI_value = 0.25', ‘required_fraction_of_informative_bins = 0.98', ‘p_hat_CI_method = agresti_coull' and ‘log_ratio_bin_size = 10'. The options –bin-size and –gap-penalty for the H3K9me3 ChIP-seq were set to 75 for bin-size and 15 for gap-penalty, whereas for lamin A ChIP-seq they were set to 50 for bin-size and 15 for gap-penalty.

To compute the average profile over a set of genomic regions of interest (that is, the meta-profile analysis), average enrichment ratio of single H3K9me3 ChIP-seq replica, previously rebinned at resolution of 2 Kb and normalized with quantile normalization with preprocessCore library (v1.62.1) (https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.BIOC.PREPROCESSCORE) using the function ‘normalize.quantiles', was plotted over the S3 UP and S3 DOWN regions, together with 1 Mb of upstream and downstream regions. Each genomic region (upstream, S3 UP or DOWN, downstream) was further divided in 600 subregions with R (v4.3) using the library GenomicRanges (v1.52.0)90 and the function ‘tile'. For SAMMY-seq metaprofiles, the same methodology was applied on the enrichment ratios over the H3K9me3 ChIP-seq peaks called with EDD92 (v1.1.19). The mean signal of IP over the INPUT or the SAMMY-seq enrichment ratios were measured in each tile for all the regions of the metaprofile with the function ‘mean' and the ChIP-seq signal was smoothed by ggplot2 (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) with the function ‘geom_smooth' using method = ‘gam' and formula = ‘y ~ s (x, bs = “cs”)'. To statistically compute the difference of H3K9me3 signal at the peak's borders, each H3K9me3 domain was partitioned into 200 equal-sized bins subregions with R (v4.3) using the library GenomicRanges (v1.52.0) with the function ‘tile'. For each sample, the mean signal intensity of IP over the INPUT within each bin was calculated. The B point was defined as the bin located in the centre of domain. The A point was defined as the bin corresponding to the Domain Start (DS). Then, the A point value was subtracted from the B point value, yielding the B-A difference for each peak within each sample. Finally, a two-sided, unpaired Wilcoxon rank test was performed using the ‘wilcox.test' function from the ‘stats' base R package (version 4.3.1), with the ‘alternative' parameter set to ‘two.sided' and the ‘paired' parameter set to ‘FALSE'.

Sequenced reads were analyzed with the pipeline nf-core/rnaseq version93. The overall quality of the sequenced reads was assessed using FastQC 2 (v0.11.9) (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Reads were trimmed and adapters were clipped by cutadapt (v3.4) (https://doi.org/10.14806/ej.17.1.200). Reads overlapping ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were filtered with SortMeRNA94 (v4.3.4), considering all the available databases of rRNA. Reads were then mapped in paired end mode with STAR (v2.7.10a)95 on the mouse genome mm10 version. Transcripts were quantified using Salmon96 on GENCODE (M25)75. Basic gene annotation filtered for transcript with HAVANA characteristics (https://www.sanger.ac.uk/project/manual-annotation/#:~:text=The%20HAVANA%20team%20manually%20annotate,well%20as%20poly%2Dadenylation%20features) and protein coding genes. The full matrix with gene level quantification was created by importing transcript abundances with R (v4.3) library tximport (v1.28.0)97 using the function ‘tximport' and setting the parameter ‘type = “salmon”'. The resulting matrix loaded in R (v4.3) was constructed with genes with a total count greater than 15 in all conditions. The counts were normalized with DESeq2 (v1.40.2), using the median of ratios98 and accounting for batch effect using the ‘design = ~ batch + condition'. RNA-seq samples were grouped in different flow cell batches as follows: Batch 1 contained replicates 3 for LmnaKO and 3 for WT. Batch 2 included replicates 2 for WT, 1-2 for LmnaKO, and 1-2-3 for LBDKO. Finally, Batch 3 consisted solely of replicate 4 of the WT. The differential expression test was done using the default Wald Test and Benjamini and Hochberg correction for multiple tests, to compute p-values and adjusted p-values, respectively. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified as those with an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and the absolute value of the | Log2 Fold Change | > 3. Because of high p-values in differential expression results, we also applied the ‘lfcShrink' function of DESeq2 with type ‘ashr'99. The volcano plot showing the DEGs have been done with EnhancedVolcano library (v1.18.0) (https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.EnhancedVolcano).

To compute the metaprofile of the solubility score at differentially expressed genes, the solubility profiles previously rebinned at a resolution of 2 kb and normalized using the preprocessCore library (v1.62.1) (https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.BIOC.PREPROCESSCORE) using the function ‘normalize.quantiles'. The plots were made using Deeptools (v3.5.0). The merging distance between blacklisted regions was fixed at 5 kb. The 4f-SAMMY-seq solubility score was computed per DEG using the command ‘computeMatrix' from deeptools scale-regions with setting ‘–beforeRegionStartLength 5000–regionBodyLength 5000–afterRegionStartLength 5000–skipZeros'. The metaprofile was plotted using the command ‘plotProfile' with the specific settings–plotType heatmap–yMin −0.25–yMax 0.75'.

Chromatin compartments were calculated using a revised version of the CALDER algorithm (version 1.0)100 as implemented in the original 4f-SAMMY-seq pipeline43. Namely, for each chromosome: i) the four 4f-SAMMY-seq fractions' (S2S, S2L, S3, and S4) reads distribution profiles were calculated and normalized with RPKM using Deeptools (v3.5.0), rebinned at 50 kb and merged blacklisted regions were filtered out using R (v4.3); ii) for each genomic bin, defined as a vector containing the four RPKM values (one for each fraction), the Euclidean distance (dist, R stats package, method = ‘euclidean') was calculated with all the other bins of the same chromosome. These steps produced an NxN matrix, where N is the number of bins for the considered chromosome. Starting from this matrix, the eigenvector was derived to reconstruct chromatin compartmentalization. Sub-compartment segmentation was limited to the highest level, thus obtaining only 2 compartments corresponding to ‘A' and ‘B' compartments. The compartment analysis was performed independently for each chromosome. The consensus of compartment calls across strains was produced by labeling each genomic bin (50 kb) according to the most recurring call across samples: for example, if a bin is labeled as A in more than half of the WT samples, that bin will be defined as A in the consensus of controls. Bins with an equal assignment of compartments were not considered in the consensus. The definition of compartment shifts was based on the concordant or discordant compartment classification with respect to WT for each 50 kb genomic bin. In the comparison between LMNA1-646 and LMNA1-429 transfected cells, we assessed A-to-B and B-to-A compartment changes using Cohen's d effect size analysis. For each genomic region, we extracted the corresponding eigenvalue signals across biological replicates and calculated effect sizes using the cohen.d() function from the effsize R package (v1.16.0). Our analysis revealed that over 70% of regions undergoing compartment switches exhibited medium to large effect sizes (d ≥ 0.5 and d ≥ 0.8, respectively).

GO analysis for both RNA-seq differential expression analysis and compartment switches analysis were performed for Biological Process – BP and Molecular Function – MF using R (v4.3) with gprofiler2 library (v0.2.2) (https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.gprofiler2) and the GO database id ‘e111_eg58_p18_b51d8f08', taking as final enriched terms only those with p-value < 0.01, calculated by the function ‘gost' with correction_method = ‘g_SCS' (Set Counts and Sizes)101.

a. Nucleosome picking is shown for one of the WT tomograms. The image on the left shows a xy slice with 8.8 Å thickness through the tomogram. The nuclear envelope was imaged in a side view orientation. Scale bar is 200 nm. The image in the middle shows the same xy-slice as on the left, together with the coordinates of the nucleosomes (red dots), which were detected in that slice. The apparent low density of picked nucleosomes in this visualization is due to the fact that only nucleosomes with their z coordinate falling exactly within this xy-slice are displayed. The top image on the right side shows this xy-slice, overlaid with all the nucleosome coordinates (blue dots), which were picked in this tomogram. This context was used to annotate cytoplasmic false-positive nucleosome detections (blue dots encircled with a yellow dashed line). In this tomogram, 10 cytoplasmic false-positive particles were detected. A total of 2673 subtomograms were extracted from this tomogram. Therefore, the individual cytoplasmic (false-positive) picking ratio (CPR) of this tomogram is 0.4%. The bottom image on the right side shows a zoomed view on the picked nucleosomes (red circles). Scale bar is 100 nm. b. Nucleosome picking is shown for one of the LmnaKO tomograms. In this tomogram zero cytoplasmic false-positive particles were detected, therefore the CPR is 0%. c. Nucleosome picking is shown for one of the LBDKO tomograms. Here, the nuclear envelope was imaged in a top view orientation. Cytoplasmic false-positive particles are shown per xy-slice in the middle image (red dots encircled with a yellow dashed line) and all cytoplasmic false-positive particles identified in this tomogram are shown in the top image on the right (blue dots encircled with a yellow dashed line). In this tomogram, 156 cytoplasmic false-positive particles were detected. A total of 1842 subtomograms were extracted from this tomogram and therefore its CPR is 8.5%. d. Histogram of all CPR values per tomogram of the complete dataset (43 tomograms). Most of the tomograms (30 tomograms) exhibit CPR values between 0 to 3%. e. Zoomed view on individual nucleosome detections. The nucleosome coordinates, which were picked in the shown xy-slice, are depicted as red circles. Scale bar is 100 nm.

a. The initial reference for 3D refinement and 3D classification is shown in 4 different views, namely disk view, side view, gyre view, and front view. The reference was obtained by low-pass filtering the nucleosome structure EMD 33132 to 40 Å resolution. At this resolution the histones in the core of the nucleosome disappear and the DNA resembles a torus. b. In the top row the in-situ nucleosome consensus average is displayed. Compared to the initial reference, the density of the histone core is restored and linker DNA densities appear (black arrowheads). In the bottom row the docking of the nucleosome model PDB-7XD1 in the consensus nucleosome average is shown. c. The subtomograms, which were averaged to form the consensus average (103173 particles), were classified with 3D classification into 40 classes. The image shows the central xy-slices (thickness 4.4 Å) of the resulting class averages in disk view orientation. All class averages resemble nucleosome features at varying resolutions. The class average, which attracted the most particles (13255 particles), is framed by a yellow dashed line. d. Subsequently, these particles were averaged with 3D refinement. In the top row the resulting average is displayed. It shows clear features of a canonical nucleosome structure, with extended linker DNA (black arrowheads), a well-defined histone core, and the DNA wrapped around the histone core in a left-handed manner. In the bottom row the docking of the nucleosome model PDB-7XD1 in the canonical nucleosome average is shown. Scale bar is 10 nm.

Each tomogram is depicted by the xy-coordinates of the three analysed structures: lamin coordinates are shown in red, nucleosome coordinates are coloured by increasing concentration, as indicated by the calibration bar, and NPC coordinates are shown in grey.

a. A schematic illustration indicating how we quantified local nucleosome concentration as a function of distance from a lamin filament. The number of nucleosomes located within a 24 nm radius of a nucleosome positioned 20 nm from a lamin filament. b. Bar plot showed nucleosome concentration in each tomogram from WT MEFs. c-d. Regions with high local nucleosome concentration, with ≥4 neighbouring nucleosomes (c) or nucleosomes with ≤3 or fewer neighbours in grey (d). e. A Schematic illustration exemplifying the approach used to measure the relationship between local nucleosome concentration and lamin concentration. For each lamin segment, the number of neighbouring lamin segments within a 24 nm radius was quantified. The coordinates of the nearest nucleosome to each lamin segment were then identified, and the number of neighbouring nucleosomes within a 24 nm radius of that nucleosome was calculated. These values were plotted as a function of the corresponding local lamin density. f. A schematic diagram illustrating how the distance from each nucleosome to its nearest lamin filament was measured. These distances were plotted in (g) for each tomogram, using a line fit for an average of ~2400 particles per tomogram. High-density peaks are indicated by triangles. h. A schematic diagram illustrating how the distance from each lamin filament to its nearest nucleosome was determined. These distances were plotted in (i) for each tomogram. The peaks are indicated by triangles. The shadowed region in (i) highlighted that 1.6% of nucleosomes are located within 10 nm of lamin filaments. In these instances, direct lamin-nucleosome interactions can be detected. j. For each lamin segment, the number of neighbouring filaments was plotted for each cell line. The mean neighbouring filaments count was 2.1, 1.6 and 1.9 for WT, LmnaKO and LBDKO cells, respectively. k. The number of neighbouring nucleosomes for each nucleosome was plotted, resulting in mean values of 6.0, 4.8 and 6.3 neighbouring nucleosomes for WT, LmnaKO and LBDKO cells, respectively. All boxplots show a box between 25th and 75th percentile, median as a horizontal line, mean as a black square, whiskers represent 1.5 standard deviations. Significance calculated using a one-way ANOVA. p-value < 0.0001 (****).

a. Super resolution structured illumination microscopy, 3D-SIM, images of WT, LmnaKO, LBDKO MEF cells. Chromatin was stained with DAPI. b. Quantification of nuclear volumes indicated increase in both lamin knockout cells (left). Quantification of nuclear area (using projection images) showed a slight increase in the lamin knockout cell lines, compared to the WT (right). c. The number of high-density fluorescence chromatin foci, exhibited a significant increase in both LmnaKO and LBDKO compared to WT nuclei (left), while the total area of foci normalized to the nucleus area remained similar across all cell lines (right). The number of nuclei assessed were 35 for LmnaKO, 47 for LBDKO, and 36 for WT cells. Data were from two distinct experiments. All boxplots show a box between the 25th and 75th percentiles, the median as a horizontal line, the mean as a black square, and whiskers represent 1.5 standard deviations. Significance was calculated using a one-way ANOVA. p-value < 0.0001(****), p-value < 0.001(***), p-value < 0.05 (*), and n.s. p-value > 0.05.

a. Five truncations of lamin A tail domain were used during in vitro biochemical and structural analyses. b. Pull-down assay for identifying the region within lamin A responsible for H2A-H2B binding. 100 ug of each candidate truncation, LA 394-646, LA 394-548, LA 430-585, LA 430-579, LA 430-560 and His-GST as a negative control were immobilized on the 200 µl Ni-NTA resin. 5 µl of each sample was analysed by SDS-PAGE (lane 1-6). Purified H2A-H2B heterodimer was shown in lane 7. 100 µg H2A-H2B was applied to each sample and after several rounds of washing and migrated on the SDS-PAGE (Lane 8-13). c. Binding isotherms based on the translational diffusion times observed in FCS measurements as a function of lamin concentration yielded a binding affinity between LA 430-585 and H2A-H2B heterodimer of 12 ± 1 µM, confirmed by three biological replicates. d. Sequence alignment of lamin A from amino acid 548 to 585 in 5 different species, HslaminA (homosapiens lamin A), MslaminA (musmusculus lamin A), RnlaminA (Rattusnorvegicus lamin A), DrlaminA (Daniorerio lamin A), XtlaminA (Xenopustropicalis lamin A). It shows that the tail domain of lamin A is highly conserved, especially in the region of 578-585 (underlined in blue). e. A schematic illustration shows that the C-terminal laminA domain can be extended to a distance of up to ~51 nm away from the lamin filament. The nucleosome-binding site within the C-terminal laminA domain is located at a distance of ≤30 nm away from the lamin rod domain. Three independent replicates were done for b and c.

The panels show lamin B1 fluorescence intensity (upper row) associated with the spotted fluorescently labelled nucleosomes (bottom row) for a representative single image, for an average image of 18 frames and a total of 162 spots, and its related significantly low standard deviation image. Fluorescence calibration bars are provided. All spots are 3 μm in diameter. The graph on the right shows that nucleosome-associated lamin fluorescence indicated that lamin B1 (Bound LB1 432-569) fluorescence detected on patterned is negligeable compared to that of lamin A (Bound LA 430-585), even for 4 times more immobilised nucleosomes. For lamin A, 399 fluorescence values ranged between 361 and 2446 a.u., and for lamin B1, 370 fluorescence values ranged between 0 and 142 a.u.

a. Distribution along a representative region of chromosome 4 (chr4: 20,000,000-END) of 4f-SAMMY-seq consensus track of WT MEF (S2S vs S3). The continuous line represents the mean across the WT replicates and the lighter colour shadows represents the standard deviation. Positive signal enrichments, defined as the ratio of S2S over S3, are enriched in the most accessible S2S fraction and coincide with euchromatin, while its negative values, enriched in the insoluble S3 fraction, match lamina-associated heterochromatic regions, LADs. The ChIP-seq tracks for histone mark associated to active chromatin (H3K27ac – purple, H3K4me3 - red), constitutive heterochromatin (H3K9me3 –blue) and laminA/C are also shown. For ChIP-seq data, the y axis range is set to zero as minimum value. b.

Meta-profiles of H3K9me3 enrichment signal over S3 UP and S3 DOWN genomic regions in LmnaKO (top) and LBDKO (bottom). Lines represent two replicates of the H3K9me3 experiment, WT (green), LmnaKO (yellow), and LBDKO (light blue). The x-axis shows the relative position with respect to the start (domain start, DS) and end (domain end, DE) of S3 UP and S3 DOWN genomic regions, along with 1 Mb flanking regions. d. Metaprofile of H3K9me3 enrichment within 2 Mb of H3K9me3 domains in WT (green), LmnaKO (yellow), and LBDKO (light blue) MEF cells. The A-B circles illustrate the method used to calculate the relative differences in H3K9me3 ChIP over input enrichment at two points in the H3K9me3 domain: the Domain Start (DS) (point A) and the center of the peak (point B). The box-plot distribution on the right shows the A-B ChIP-seq enrichment for MEF WT (green), LmnaKO (yellow), and LBDKO (light blue) cells. The lower and upper edges of each box correspond to the first and third quartiles, respectively, with the horizontal bar representing the median. Whiskers extend up to 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the edges. Data points outside this range are outliers and are represented by dots. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sided Wilcoxon test. WT vs LBDKO p = 0.0062 (**); WT vs LmnaKO p = 0.3757 (n.s.). Two independently processed ChIP experiments were performed for each condition. e. Proportional Venn diagram showing the common S3 UP and S3 DOWN genomic regions in LmnaKO and LBDKO. f.

In 2005, when South Africa and its partner countries in Africa submitted a proposal to host the world's largest radio telescope, called the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the continent had five radioastronomers, all based in South Africa. That year, the country embarked on a targeted human-capital-development programme to develop the talent needed to build, operate and use radio telescopes, which collect radio signals emitted by celestial objects. Marking its 20th anniversary this year, the government-funded programme has created 5 research chair positions and more than 1,370 scholarships for undergraduate, master's, doctoral and postdoctoral studies — at a total cost of about 500 million rand (US$28 million). 

Now, the SKA is under construction. It will have more than 100,000 tree-like antennas in Australia and almost 200 dish antennas in South Africa. South Africa owns and operates several radio telescopes, and there are hundreds of radioastronomers and radioastronomy students at African universities and institutions. 

Nature's careers team spoke to officials and scientists working to boost Africa's radioastronomy capacity, in part through the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. In the last of a short series of articles investigating the growth of the discipline on the continent, Brenda Namumba, who was the first woman to receive a doctorate in astrophysics in Zambia, talks about how networks built her career.

I only found out about astronomy back in 2009, as an undergraduate studying physics, when I happened to attend an international conference on space science and astronomy at the University of Zambia in Lusaka. That was the first time I heard about young people studying space science and astronomy at the master's or PhD level. Back then, I had not even met anyone from Zambia doing a master's in physics.

At the meeting, I interacted with established scholars and graduate students, who told me about their research and what they wanted to do in future. We kept in touch and some of them helped me to apply for scholarships and explained how to write a personal statement. 

‘I didn't know someone could pursue astronomy as a career'

‘I didn't know someone could pursue astronomy as a career'

The conference made me decide to further my studies, and I applied for many scholarships while working as a secondary-school physics and mathematics teacher. Eventually, in 2012, I was accepted into South Africa's National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (NASSP) as an honours undergraduate student at the University of Cape Town (UCT). This scholarship programme, established in 2003, has supported more than 300 honours-degree students and more than 140 master's candidates.

The programme introduced me to the idea that astronomers can make use of a range of electromagnetic wavelengths. In 2012, there was a lot of talk about the exciting science that was going to happen with the SKA. That was the year when it was decided to split the telescope between South Africa and Australia. South Africa had built the 7-dish KAT-7 radio telescope, which was the test bed for its 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope that will eventually form part of the SKA. I wanted to be at the forefront of answering some of the interesting questions that these radio instruments would make it possible to tackle. 

One topic in particular caught my attention. During my honour's degree, I took a course in extragalactic astronomy in which the lecturer (who later became my PhD supervisor) talked about dwarf galaxies. At the time, they hadn't been explored in much detail with optical telescopes because they are faint and difficult to detect, and the situation was even worse at radio wavelengths. But, the new generation of instruments, such as KAT-7, was better suited to exploring their structure and properties to understand galaxy evolution. The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) funded my master's degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban in 2013, my doctorate at the UCT in 2015, and then my first postdoc at Rhodes University in Makhanda from 2019 to 2022. 

SARAO gave me this great opportunity, and it wasn't solely about my academic qualifications. I've been able to attend conferences around the world, which have given me a different mindset concerning how people do research, and also confidence in presenting my work. For example, at the SARAO Postgraduate and Postdoctoral Research Conference, the organizers, who include SARAO staff and researchers from universities across South Africa, guide us in how to present our work and interact with colleagues and experts.

Welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer, WIRED's, director of Business and Industry. Today on the show, we're bringing you five stories that you need to know about this week and later we'll dive into our main segment on how AI chatbots like ChatGPT tend to ignore the context of the information they're absorbing. This has led some chatbots into very, very strange places like suggesting demonic rituals to users. I'm joined today by WIRED's Senior Business Editor, Louise Matsakis. Louise, welcome to Uncanny Valley.

Louise Matsakis: Hi Zoë.

Zoë Schiffer: So our first story is one that you and I have been pretty deep in on. It's about the AI talent wars. Mark Zuckerberg and Meta have lagged behind most of their smaller and equal sized competitors in the AI race, and lately Mark has been going kind of all out to recruit top researchers from competitive labs and kind of bring them over to Meta by offering wildly high salaries. We're talking like reportedly over $300 million over four years, although Meta has disputed these numbers. But this week we noticed that he'd set his sights on a smaller lab and that is Thinking Machines.

Louise Matsakis: Yeah, so Thinking Machines is the startup founded by Mira Murati, who's the former Chief Technology Officer at OpenAI. And I think it's notable here that there is no product at this startup yet. The startup has done nothing thus far, and the people who work there are already getting offered hundreds of millions of dollars.

Zoë Schiffer: Louise, that is not an issue in AI. I feel like this is a field where the narrative matters a lot, but these researchers are obviously extremely valuable. One thing that I heard from sources when we were reporting this out was that they've been going through the process with Meta almost to test their market value. Even if they're not serious about joining Meta, it's like, ""Well, how much am I worth?"" And the answer is hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases.

Louise Matsakis: I honestly don't understand how these calculations are being made and I don't get what makes one of these researchers worth 300 million versus 500 million? How much of it is them negotiating? And I think it violates a lot of the things that I thought I knew about how AI innovation happens. It's often a group of really passionate people, they're often pretty young. A lot of the most famous papers were written by people who are under the age of 25 or at least under the age of 30. And so now I'm just kind of like, I don't know, you published one hot paper and now you're worth 500 million.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, I talked to someone who was pretty intimately involved and they were like, ""Look, on paper, we're allowed to offer this much. But the reality is when you're talking about an AI researcher at this point in time, the sky is the limit. There's literally nothing we cannot offer them."" I mean, it's so interesting. I do feel like what you're saying makes sense on the individual level. It's just totally baffling. You're like, how could this 23, 24-year-old possibly be worth this much? But I think if I had to put myself in Mark Zuckerberg's shoes, this is an existential crisis for the company. He perhaps feels that Meta is being totally left behind and that the company, even though it's making all of this money, even though its other products are wildly successful usage in some areas is on the decline. There's only so far you can go with stuffing more ads in the existing product pipeline. And so what wouldn't you do to ensure that your company can stay on the cutting edge?

Louise Matsakis: Totally. I guess I think the strategy is just kind of backwards. I guess I'd rather hedge my bets and hire 600 new PhDs for a million dollars a year or $500,000 a year. Maybe that's not enough these days. Maybe that's not possible, but give them $10 million a year and see where they go versus getting these big stars. I think it just comes across as very desperate and trying to reverse engineer something that I'm not sure you can reverse engineer.

Zoë Schiffer: No, for sure. I mean, that is completely the strategy. Our latest round of reporting showed that in some cases top, top researchers, and it's worth saying this isn't the number that's being thrown around for everyone by any means, but was more than a billion dollars. And that's over a multi, multi-year span. So it's not to say you're getting that upfront by any stretch of the imagination, but still, I mean, that's just generational wealth that is being promised. And some of the other offers were between 200 million and 500 million, but so far at Thinking Machines at least, not a single person appears to have taken one of these offers, which is kind of fascinating.

Louise Matsakis: Yeah, I think it sort of shows that at a certain level, these numbers become meaningless. If you're going to make $100 million versus 200 million, I'd rather be happy and probably doing something that I want to do because money can't really buy much above that unless you're super into super yachts, I guess.

Zoë Schiffer: Planes.

Louise Matsakis: Yeah, so I think it maybe says something about the culture at Meta and do you think there are specific things that are giving people trepidation or is it just people are loyal to Mira and these other startup founders?

Zoë Schiffer: I think the loyalty is a big thing. People who believe in Mira seem to really, really believe in her, and that seems obviously true from investors as well as employees. But I've heard two things with Meta that really stuck out to me. One is that Mark Zuckerberg recruited Alexandr Wang, who's the co-founder of Scale AI, which is kind of a data labeling startup to lead or co-lead the new Meta Superintelligence labs. And people have very polarizing views on Alexandr. Some people obviously do want to work for him and have gone over to Meta. A lot of people have told me they're not interested for various reasons. So that's one thing I'll just put out there. The other, and I haven't fully reported this out, but I've heard it enough times that it seems just worth saying is that some people feel like Mark Zuckerberg's rightward turn and hyper-masculinity bent that he seems to be on has been a turn-off for more of the academic quiet researcher types.

Louise Matsakis: I mean, I think that that makes a lot of sense. He also doesn't have a background in academia or in research. I don't think he necessarily understands the incentives of a place like that. And it's also probably worth just saying that Alexandr is I think 27 and that the AI data labeling industry is kind of regarded as the underbelly of this industry. So I think that maybe that's also part of it is like, do we really want to work for the guy who's like best known for having an army of underpaid people around the world who are labeling pictures for self-driving cars?

Zoë Schiffer: Totally. OK. So shifting gears to a story that many of us I think can relate to. A new scientific study published this month in the Nature Communications Journal shows the pandemic may have accelerated brain aging even for people who never got COVID, which is wild. WIRED contributor, Javier Carbajal reported that the study's researchers based in the UK compared a ton of MRI brain scans from before and after the pandemic, and they found that the difference between our chronological and actual brain age is about five and a half months higher after the pandemic.

Louise Matsakis: Oh my god, half a year. That is a deal, baby. That sounds great.

Zoë Schiffer: They also think stress and isolation contributed to it, which I think seems true. I think the implications were worse for people who had a lower socioeconomic status and older men in particular. So that tracks with other things that we know. Staying in the UK for a little bit, our next story is about the age verification laws that went into effect in the country this past Friday. Our colleagues, Lily Hay Newman and Matt Burgess reported that the UK's Online Safety Act went into effect last week, which requires porn websites and other adult content sites to implement age verification features. I'm so curious to hear your take on this because I feel like age verification is one of those things where the top line thing that you think you believe is exactly reversed when you start to look into it.

Louise Matsakis: Oh, totally. I mean, so a few years ago when a lot of lawmakers in the US were talking about this, they were specifically referencing China and they were like, ""Oh, China has age verification and meanwhile in the US we're letting this Chinese company, TikTok, poison our youth or whatever."" And so I looked into how China does age verification, and it's exactly what you said. From the ground up, it's a surveillance architecture. They had to literally brick by brick build their internet to have this surveillance in every sort of layer, and then on top of it all, it doesn't work. If you go anywhere in China, you will see toddlers looking at TikTok because they're just logged into their parents' account. It's like, I just think this is such a parental rights and it should be something that is personal and decided in your own home. I just don't think the government needs to be the one overseeing this.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, I mean, this is exactly what we've seen in the UK, which is that the use of VPNs which allow you to access websites without some of your information being tracked have spiked wildly since this rolled out, and it's only been a handful of days.

Louise Matsakis: All I can say is look to rural China where there is an epidemic of what looks like grannies who are spending all this time on TikTok, and it's actually just their grandchildren logged into their accounts.

Zoë Schiffer: I mean, ultimately, only time will tell how effective these age verification measures will actually be. Moving on to the basketball court, this is a real pivot. Did you play sports in high school college?

Louise Matsakis: No, I played no sports. I could not be more unathletic. I enjoy various forms of exercise, but none of them I would call competitive sports. Did you?

Zoë Schiffer: No, absolutely not. And every time Andrew, my husband, tries to toss me a ball or play anything, he's like, ""Wow, you just really never played a video game or sports. I've never seen someone with so little hand-eye coordination."" Now when I watch my daughter run, I'm like, ""She got that from me. She looks like that's not going to be a skill."" But OK. This is kind of the WIRED angle on sports, which WIRED contributor Ben Dowsett reported that there's a smart basketball being developed and tested that could make its way into the NBA. The ball is called the Spalding TF DNA, and it tracks incredibly granular, detailed information during play, not just makes and misses, but the angle and spit of the shot and how long it takes a player to release the ball, which could be useful for players as they train or deciding things during the game, but it still needs the player's approval. And the NBA has been hesitant when a previous version of the ball was tested because they found that the sensors added weight to the ball, which you might expect, and it was just a trade-off that didn't make sense for them.

Louise Matsakis: I think that this is so fascinating. One aspect of sports that makes zero sense to me and I find really creepy is how much professional sports players are surveilled now. There's so much data on how fast was their pitch, exactly how many runs they got, exactly how many points they've scored in their entire career, and let's plot that over time. We know how much they weigh, exactly how tall they are. I just think being under that kind of surveillance is so stressful, and I know these people are highly compensated, but I don't get why it doesn't take out some of the magic. I think part of it is because of the rise of sports betting. I think the people who are betting want to have as much data as possible, and they're looking for, everyone on this team is half an inch taller, whatever it is that they think is going to be the edge. And I don't know, I just find it, the datification of sports is strange to me. I say ban the ball.

Zoë Schiffer: I'd be curious to hear it from listeners if this is actually something that people want. I did just read Andre Agassi's memoir, because I found it in a free library, and one of my main takeaways from the book, other than his whole hair saga, which was a big part of it, was that at one point his brother, I think signed a deal with a new tennis racket company and switched up his racket without telling him, and he was completely unable to play. It was a whole thing, and I was like, “OK, people really, really care."" The minute details obviously really matter at this level. Our last story before we go to break is about how an entire country's population is preparing to migrate. WIRED contributor Fernanda Gonzalez reported last week that the Pacific Island nation of Tuvalu could be submerged in 25 years due to rising sea levels. So the plan is being implemented to relocate the entire population to Australia.

Louise Matsakis: I got to say, I think calling this a migration is maybe underselling it. This is an evacuation, no? I find this sad in a lot of ways just because I remember when Tuvalu was kind of the poster child for climate change, and it was like, we have to save places like this island nation, and it just sort of feels like, I think practical and understandable and humane, but also, I don't know, an indication that we're giving up and that there's sort of defeat of we're actually just going to move people. I don't know. What do you think?

Zoë Schiffer: No, I mean, I completely agree. I also remember this story evolving over time, and it feels like with so many things with climate change will have the big headline, ""We have to do X by this year or this other thing will happen."" And we've just again and again and again been like, “OK, that didn't happen."" And so we're accepting that floods are going to happen, or rising sea levels are going to damage this area or whatever and now we're on to dealing with the fallout from that.

Louise Matsakis: Yeah, and even in this case, I think the agreement that Tuvalu has with Australia is less than 300 people can move a year and be evacuated as I'm going to keep using that word. And that's still not that many. There's still going to be people on this island as the seas rise.

Zoë Schiffer: I mean, yeah, it's not the only thing that Tuvalu has done since 2022. The country has been trying to undergo this ambitious strategy to become the world's quote, unquote, ""first digital nation"", which included 3D scanning of the islands to digitally recreate them and preserve parts of the culture and moving government functions to a virtual environment, which makes sense. But yeah, I mean, I think the reality is a lot is going to be lost in this process. And like you said, the number of people that they're able to move every year is less than 300, so it's going to be slow, and I think painful in some ways.

Louise Matsakis: Totally.

Zoë Schiffer: Coming up after the break, we dive into Louisa's story on how ChatGPT's tendency to ignore the context of the information it absorbs is showing up in extremely weird ways. Stay with us. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer. I'm joined today by WIRED's Louise Matsakis, who recently reported on how a lack of context is becoming an increasingly alarming problem for ChatGPT and other chatbots. Louisa's reporting explores why ChatGPT went into demon mode when it was speaking with Atlantic staffers recently. Last week, an editor at the Atlantic reported that ChatGPT started praising Satan and encouraging ceremonies that involved various forms of self-mutilation. So Louise, what the hell is going on?

Louise Matsakis: So the Atlantic reported this story that basically made the case that know ChatGPT has these safeguards against things like self-harm, but there's all these edge cases that suddenly send the chatbot into kind of a role-playing mode. And so they were like, ""Hey, can you make a ritual for Molech, which is this ancient God that shows up in the Bible that's associated with child sacrifice?"" And ChatGPT saw that word and immediately went into this role-playing game where it started talking about things like deep magic experience called the Gate of the Devourer. It asked the Atlantic journalists if they wanted something called a reverent bleeding scroll. And so all that sounds like really bizarre, and you might think like, oh, there's a lot of content on the internet about demonic rituals. Satanists are everywhere, especially online. That's probably what's going on here. But when I looked into it, all of this lore and jargon actually comes from a game called 40,000 Warhammer, which is this tabletop war playing game that you play with these little figurines, and it's been around since the 1980s. People who love this stuff love it. And they are online, the Reddits are popping off all days of the week. There's so many science fiction books, there's so many... I honestly struggle to think of deeper lores than this game. And as a result, ChatGPT ingested all that information. And when the Atlantic used the word Molech, which is a planet in the universe of this game, it immediately just sort of assumed that this was another Warhammer fan who wanted to go into role-playing or get into the fantasy world of this game.

Zoë Schiffer: And the PDF thing seemed one major signal that perhaps this wasn't ChatGPT just randomly deciding to be a satanist but actually was regurgitating parts of the gameplay or the norms associated with the game.

Louise Matsakis: Yeah. So when you have this much lore, the company that owns the Warhammer franchise very regularly, they put out guidebooks, they change the rules so that if new characters are introduced or there's some major development in this universe, you know what's going on. And you need that information in order to play the game with your friends. But if you're buying rule books left and right, Zoë, that can get expensive. And so on Reddit and other Warhammer forums, a lot of players often say like, ""Yo, do you have a PDF of the latest rule book?"" And so that was a total dog whistle to me when ChatGPT was like, ""You want a PDF of the reverent bleeding scroll? Like, girl, I got you.""

Zoë Schiffer: Let's talk about why this distinction matters because it's really important. You wrote a whole article about it, but I could see a lay person being like, why do I care if ChatGPT is talking about demonic rituals because of this game or because it's become a satanist during this conversation? Why is the context important?

Louise Matsakis: So I think when people say, ""Oh, context is important. Context is important."" That sounds vague. And it's like, of course that's the case. If I ask, ""How are you doing today, Zoë?"" And you had a really bad day yesterday, that's the context. Versus, ""How are you doing today, Zoë? Haven't talked to you in a while."" The way we respond, even if the language is the same, is about the context around it. And I know that that probably sounds obvious, but I think we're in this moment where people are looking at things like ChatGPT and they're seeing them as a source of ground truth. They're seeing it as a source of objective truth, and that just isn't the case. It's not a primary source. You're not able to see why is it giving you this type of answer. Even if it cites its sources, you don't know necessarily why it is using that adjective to describe a historical figure or why it's talking about demonic rituals with this type of language. You don't have the ability to actually see where that came from. It's essentially just ever shifting encyclopedia. And if you want to know the capital of Japan, it's probably fine, but if you want to actually get deeper understanding about something, you have to know why this is its boiled down answer.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. I also think it's really important that we understand and continue to highlight how these chatbots actually work, because I think when they're emergent behaviors as they're called, or when they start seemingly really going deep on satanic rituals or whatever, it can lead people to be like, I think more into the belief that there's something sentient, that there's something alive about the model. It's like doing this that's unexpected and weird and unnerving. When you realize that there are all of these very robust online fandoms that provided a ton of training materials to the model, and the model has a lot to draw on, if you mention a specific word or set of phrases, it becomes a little less spooky, I think, and that's actually important for our digital literacy here.

Louise Matsakis: I think a lot about, did you get told in school you can't use Wikipedia all the time?

Zoë Schiffer: Oh, yeah, for sure.

Louise Matsakis: I think it's a good analogy. Now we're like, ""Oh God, Wikipedia is the only source of truth that we have. Dear Lord, it's so much better."" But the problem with Wikipedia is that it wasn't a primary source. It was somebody in a Wikipedia editor summarizing an actual original reporting or a study or whatever it is, or a photograph, primary source documents. But at least those citations were there. But I think we have to come back to that and remember that it's kind of a sketchier Wikipedia.

Zoë Schiffer: Stay with us. Louise, thank you so much for joining me today.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Gaming Your Way to Sharper AI Prompts","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/gaming-your-way-to-sharper-ai-prompts-179852.html","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 17:48:00 GMT","

A common sentiment that AI evangelists have expressed to me is their eagerness to outsource their day-to-day communications to it. I am not about to state that this is always a mistake. Certain missives are so rote and return so little for the invested effort that it's hard to justify composing them from scratch. We've all sunk time into sending formulaic emails, which could have been better spent doing almost anything else.

But here's the catch: if you want AI to do its best work, you have to stay sharp yourself. These tools are only as strong as the thinking and language you bring to them.

What I suspect yields the best long-term utility is to do some portion of your language composition completely unassisted. I don't advance this out of some metaphysical concern for preserving the human soul (though it can double as that in a pinch), but as an appeal to the practical pursuit of conjuring the best AI output possible.

Just as Formula 1 drivers physically condition to better handle their finely tuned machines, practicing language skills without AI augmentation hones your ability to wield AI deftly. In this article, I offer three activities — really, two warm-ups and a high-intensity workout — that help extend what you can elicit from AI and cultivate your self-expression.

To start, do some writing without AI. Most of the time, our thoughts crest and subside in unpredictable waves. This rhythm can surface profound realizations, but inconsistently so. Focused, linear thinking counterbalances the mind's tendency to spontaneity with structure. By directing attention to one thought and playing it forward from there, you can pull at one of the innumerable threads lying all around us.

Writing is the documentation of this cognitive exercise — it's like taking photographs as you follow your thoughts. The same sequential progression of reasoning at the heart of good writing is what organizes your instructions to the AI. As much as AI hype-chasers glorify what I just described as “prompt engineering”, it's actually good, old-fashioned articulateness.

Once you've checked that box, start talking to people about things they understand but you don't. Learning about something by discussing it with an expert is a kind of language puzzle, because you have to figure out how to figure out what to ask. You are prodding into the unknown. Without subject matter knowledge, you don't know what rocks to look under.

But this is a conversation: you get the chance to iterate. If you hit a dead end, you change tack. When you find one breadcrumb, you're closer to finding a loaf. Practice formulating the right diagnostic questions, and you get faster at discovering the tailored questions that unlock more arcane knowledge. Those opening questions are the trickiest, but once you get familiar with them, you will open doors you didn't even realize were there.

Now that you've gotten the hang of those, you're ready to sit down and play an old-school tabletop role-playing game (RPG). It was only a matter of time until I worked this pastime of mine into one of my articles, but I can't imagine a more fitting pretext.

For those unfamiliar with the genre, a tabletop RPG is a game in which one player, usually referred to as the “game master” or similar appellation, creates and administers an imaginary game world, and the other players each have a character that they use to interact with everything in that game world.

All players are free to attempt any activity they can think of, and if it is within the capacity of their characters, they usually carry out that activity. When the success of an activity is not guaranteed or there are irreconcilable conflicts between players (especially, and typically, with the game master), dice and character statistics are used to resolve the interaction.

The game interface is purely verbal: the game master describes the environment, the other players articulate what they want to do, and the game master pronounces the outcome of the players' decisions.

The archetypal example of a tabletop RPG is Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). However, while entries in the genre are commonly likened to board games, the comparison is inapt. Board games rely on fixed visuals like boards, cards, and pieces, whereas tabletop RPGs need little more than character sheets and conversation. If visuals are needed, players can improvise with whatever helps everyone share a clear picture of the scene.

Moreover, while board game rules exhaustively prescribe the available (and unavailable) activities in the respective game, tabletop RPG rules are merely a framework for evaluating the success of player actions. Players may do anything, even what is not explicitly sanctioned by the rules — the rules just explain how to determine the result of their actions.

So what does it mean for an RPG to be “old-school” then? To condense what could easily be a PhD thesis into a brief primer, the main difference between modern tabletop RPGs and “old-school” RPGs is that while the former emphasizes character statistic optimization and rolling high, the latter focuses on player ingenuity and creative utilization of resources.

Whereas disarming a mechanical trap in an abandoned tomb in a modern game may simply be a matter of declaring the use of the character's “Disarm Trap” skill (providing a numerical bonus) and rolling a high number, doing so in an old-school game would consist of describing your character's technique for defeating the mechanism — provide enough detail, and outline a thorough procedure, and success may be assured without rolling dice.

What makes a stellar tabletop RPG player is a synthesis of the linguistic tools developed by the aforementioned warm-up routines. You start by “interrogating the fiction,” being curious enough not to take the scene at face value. Then you ask for more information about what's around your character. You might learn even more by experimenting with the objects in your environment. Make no assumptions about what you think you know. That plain-looking bowl on the table could have magical properties.

Then, you engineer a path to your goals based on your observations. You are equipped to go further than merely stating the desired end goal — which can get your character killed when the stakes get moderately high — by expressing a procedural solution. If you outline a set of steps, including interventions for possible contingencies that can arise from the present game scenario, which would succeed without a doubt, then how could you fail?

You can employ the old-school RPG problem-solving technique with minimal modification when crafting large language model (LLM) prompts.

In both exercises, the surest route to success requires conceiving your goal in the minutest detail, establishing relevant roles (what do you think “role prompting” is?), listing all the steps to be taken, providing examples, and defining exigent circumstances and your prescribed reaction to them.

It should come as no surprise that technology pioneers like Steve Wozniak and Peter Norvig were avid D&D players — their respective corpus of work was largely before generative AI. Still, their accomplishments reflect mastery of the skills that D&D demands.

The order of the above exercises is deliberate. I sequenced them in order of fewest to most required players and lowest to highest difficulty of execution. There are fewer adept conversationalists than articulate writers, and even fewer stellar RPG players than engaging conversationalists. Each step builds the mental agility needed to frame better AI prompts and get more meaningful results.

With that in mind, especially if these are new to you, I encourage you to progress through these exercises in order. Not only can you practice each one without an internet connection to a billion-parameter model, but (even better) they're fun.

In the age of AI, sharpening your communication skills is still the most powerful way to make the machines work for you.

A new round of layoffs has hit Seattle laser engraver maker Glowforge.

Co-founder and CEO Dan Shapiro told GeekWire that the startup merged its sales and marketing teams.

“As part of that process, over the last three weeks we added three folks and sadly said goodbye to five folks from that team,” Shapiro said.

Shapiro did not provide details on which positions were impacted, but posts on LinkedIn from affected employees show that at least one longtime marketing leader at the company was let go.

Senior executives and members of the company's customer care team were also laid off, according to a person with knowledge of the cuts.

In April, Shapiro said that Glowforge employed just over 90 full-time and contract employees. 

Shapiro founded Glowforge in 2015 with fellow startup veterans Mark Gosselin, the current CTO, and Tony Wright, who left the company in 2017. Shapiro previously sold the startup Sparkbuy to Google, and he created Robot Turtles, a coding board game for kids that was one of the most successful campaigns ever on Kickstarter.

Glowforge, which has raised $183 million to date and is No. 125 on the GeekWire 200 startup index, went through a rough patch in 2023 and 2024, laying off employees after a funding round fell through.

The company gave up on existing headquarters space in Seattle's SoDo neighborhood to consolidate steps away in a warehouse building on Occidental Avenue South.

In that space, the company recently moved production of its highest-end machines from Mexico back to the United States and was employing 15 production workers to assemble them.

Now the coffee giant is ditching pickup-only stores.","https://www.geekwire.com/2025/starbucks-pioneered-mobile-ordering-now-the-coffee-giant-is-ditching-a-pickup-only-store-concept/","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 13:38:24 GMT","

I stopped by one of Starbucks' mobile-focused pickup-only locations in Seattle this week after the company announced that it was sunsetting the small-format stores. 

My experience was quick, seamless, and convenient — and perhaps that's the problem. 

In a call with investors on Tuesday announcing the news, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol described the pickup-only stores as “overly transactional and lacking the warmth and human connection that defines our brand.”

Niccol, the former Chipotle CEO who joined Starbucks last year, is leading an overhaul under a plan called “Back to Starbucks” in a bid to boost slumping sales. The Seattle coffee giant just reported its sixth-straight quarter of declining same-store sales.

Part of that strategy is to re-center stores as a place where customers spend more time — the “third place” concept championed by former longtime Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.

Moving away from the tech-driven pickup stores is a notable shift for a company that once leaned heavily into its technology as a competitive advantage.

Starbucks was early to mobile ordering, launched its own digital wallet long before Apple Pay took off, and has one of the most popular loyalty apps in the food and beverage industry, with nearly 34 million active users. 

Mobile orders represent nearly a third of total transactions at U.S. company-operated stores.

Niccol said he thinks Starbucks can thread the needle between convenience and coziness. 

“We have a strong digital offering and believe we can deliver the same level of convenience through our community coffeehouses with a superior mobile order and pay experience,” he said Tuesday.

Starbucks is still leaning into technology under Niccol's leadership, including a new “Smart Queue” order sequencing algorithm built to help improve mobile ordering — which has been a sore spot for the company given how it creates congestion inside stores. 

Niccol also said the company is working on what he calls the “coffeehouse of the future,” including a new prototype store design with 32 seats and a drive-thru, and a smaller version with 10 seats.

The CEO said he hopes the changes can help reestablish “that moment of connection between a barista and their customer, bringing back warm and welcoming coffeehouses with great seats, delivering drinks in four minutes or less in the cafe and drive-thru while bringing order to mobile order…”

The move away from mobile-focused stores comes as Starbucks' techie rival Luckin — which operates cashierless, app-only stores — just opened its first U.S. locations in New York City after overtaking Starbucks in China. 

I was in New York City in 2019 when Starbucks first debuted the mobile order and pick-up only concept. I had a pretty similar experience back then — convenient and fast. 

During my quick stop at the pickup store in Seattle this week, I saw six or seven other people come through in a 5-minute span, at 5:45 p.m. on a Thursday evening. They walked in, grabbed their drink, and left — a grab-and-go, frictionless experience that Starbucks once imagined.

Now, though, that friction — seats in a store, a brief chat with a barista, your name on a cup — might be the feature, not the bug.

Nintendo is raising the prices of its original Nintendo Switch game consoles, the company announced on Friday. The price increases, which are taking effect on August 3, are due to “market conditions,” Nintendo says.

The company's reference to “market conditions” likely hints at President Donald Trump's tariffs. 

The affected products include the Nintendo Switch — OLED Model, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite, and select Nintendo Switch accessories. Other Nintendo products, including certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select amiibo, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo, will also see price increases.

It's not yet clear what the new prices will be. Currently, the original Nintendo Switch retails for $299.99, while the OLED model costs $349.99.

Nintendo said it isn't ruling out a future price hike for the Nintendo Switch 2, which retails for $450.

“Pricing for the Nintendo Switch 2 system, physical and digital Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 games, as well as Nintendo Switch Online memberships, will remain unchanged at this time,” Nintendo wrote in its announcement post. “However, please note that price adjustments may be necessary in the future.”

Earlier on Friday, Nintendo reported its fiscal first-quarter earnings and shared that sales of the Switch 2 console have reached 5.82 million units since its release on June 5.

Nintendo transferred most of its production from China to Vietnam in the past to avoid tariffs. However, Trump this week announced changes to reciprocal tariffs, which extend to Vietnam.

With search today so full of AI slop and sites spamming SEO tricks, it's not unusual for people to append “reddit” to their queries in hopes of finding useful answers to their questions. Google has tried to integrate results from Reddit in its search interface, and taking notice of the trend, Reddit has been experimenting with its own AI search as well. But the company has loftier ambitions: It wants to become the go-to search engine people use.

Reddit's CEO Steve Huffman said as much during its second-quarter conference call on Thursday: “Reddit is one of the few platforms positioned to become a true search destination. We offer something special, a breadth of conversations and knowledge you can't find anywhere else.”

Huffman noted that Reddit's search function has more than 70 million weekly users, and its AI-powered Q&A product, Reddit Answers, is now used by 6 million people.

Reddit Answers is currently available in a dozen countries, and the company plans to expand it globally, as well as give it prominent placement in the site's interface. The company eventually wants to unify the core search function with Reddit Answers, and redesign its app to have the search box be more prominently visible.

“We're unifying those [Reddit search and Reddit Answers] into a single search experience, and we're gonna bring that front and center in the app. So, whether you're a new user opening the app for the first time or a returning user opening the app, that search box will be present immediately,” Huffman said on the call.

People are increasingly being presented chat-styled search interfaces from products like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google's new AI mode. Reddit understandably believes that tapping its rich trove of user posts and comments to help people find answers will help make its search function more useful.

Reddit reported a positive second quarter, with revenue jumping 78% to $500 million from a year earlier. The company launched two new ad tools, which let marketers use Reddit data to spot trends and leverage comments about brands in their campaigns.

TikTok is launching a new version of its app called “TikTok Pro” in Germany, Portugal, and Spain. The app features TikTok's new “Sunshine Programme,” which allows users to support charitable organizations. 

Users can earn “virtual sunshine” by inviting others to join and by interacting with charity-related content, such as liking or reposting videos, following charity accounts, or searching for charitable causes. They can then use this virtual sunshine on a charity, after which TikTok will make a donation to the organization.

It's worth noting that the content on TikTok Pro is the same as that on the regular TikTok app, as reported by Social Media Today. The difference between the new app and the standard app is that TikTok Pro doesn't have any livestreams, shopping features, or ads.

TikTok says the idea behind the new app is “to enable people in Europe to support charitable organizations while discovering engaging and entertaining TikTok content.”

The actual PBS and NPR shows you're familiar with are generally developed and produced privately, and then purchased by local PBS stations (streaming access to PBS content runs through ""Passport"", which is a mechanism for getting people to donate to their local PBS station even while consuming that content on the Internet). This (and other streaming things like it) is how most people actually consume this content in 2025. If your local PBS affiliate vanishes, you as a viewer are not going to lose Masterpiece Theater or Nova, because you almost certainly weren't watching those shows on linear television anyways.The cuts are bad, I just want to make sure people understand what CPB ceasing operations actually means.

ABC/NBC/CBS/Fox/Etc are big corporations that produce (or commission/license, it gets...weird) shows to be distributed on their affiliates, that, depending on the city you are in, can be owned by the network OR another company that operates it like a franchise.  Their affiliate agreement governs how much of the network programming they play -- though there are other agreements for non-network programming -- Jeopardy/Wheel of Fortune, for example, are syndicated and NOT network.PBS on the other hand is more of a consortium of public TV stations around the country.  Shows that you might think of as ""PBS Shows"" are actually produced by these individual stations and then distributed to other stations that want them.  Even PBS Newshour and Washington Week are produced by WETA in DC.Radio gets even more complicated.  Many of the shows I've seen referenced on this thread aren't even necessarily NPR.  Marketplace, for example, is American Public Media, which is sort of an outcropping from Minnesota Public Radio.So funding going to ACTUAL PBS is a tiny part of this.  What happens to the money going to various stations?  What happens to the grants to produce and run these stations, especially in rural areas?

Sometimes streaming isn't an option. When Helene hit WNC we lost power, cell, internet, and water all at the same time. The local NPR stations were the only ones broadcasting updates on a regular cadence so we could learn what in the world was going on.

I think it's, quietly and slowly, the thing that's going to doom our country to decline if something else doesn't get us first (which, there are certainly some things giving this one a run for its money). The Internet killed a pillar of democracy, replaced it with nothing that serves the same role, and we didn't even try to keep it from happening, so here we are, we doomed ourselves by embracing the Internet quickly and not trying to mitigate any harm it causes.

The federal money goes to member stations which then hands it right over to NPR to pay for programming, I believe it's $500 per hour. It's 1 layer of indirection but no one seemed to mention this in all of the reporting

That's a nice chunk of change, though low enough that a few friendly billionaires could put some pocket change into a trust today and make up for this funding in perpetuity.

If that was true, losing the CPB would be a travesty. But as a loyal NPR listener for decades, I've found their stuff lately to be unlistenable. It's Fox, but for the Left, and with a bit more of an intellectual spin. What makes it most annoying is their utter blindness to their own bias. The Fox hosts know that they're taking one side of a story. I've never gotten the impression that any of the NPR hosts are even that self-aware.

There was a distinct shift to the right at NPR when Obama took office, and by the time he took his second term, NPR News' social media was posting clickbait trash instead of real headlines. ""The liberal media"" is an irrational boogeyman used to whip ownership in line. Everyone who complains about ""bias in the media""  is arguing in bad faith while they continue to turn a blind eye to the overwhelmingly dominant conservative slant of the 21st century American media.

NPR has turned rightward. The entertainment shows are, without a doubt, liberal, on the American political spectrum.

Pay attention to how many segments—even that are sort-of connected to an actual news event, which, many aren't—revolve around political strategy, poll numbers, and (in season, which is now like three years out of four) electoral race polling.It's, like... a lot of them, outside the human-interest and arts coverage stuff. They consistently divert into talking about political media messaging strategy and poll numbers and crap, and they do it so very much that it's got to be something they're doing on purpose. This isn't news reporting, it's lazy, safe (because you don't have to engage with substantive questions of policy and outcomes, nor even questions of fact) horse-race bullshit. It's a complete waste of the listener's time, if they're there for actual news reporting.On the flip side, though, I'm not seeing a lot of ""sink or swim in the market"" US media doing much better, so I wouldn't bet on them shifting to anything better (though shift they might).

PBS Newshour is pretty much the best/balanced news programming on US TV at this point. They take deeper dives into issues than most of the other shows out there.

This is funny because BBC is a prime example of being a propaganda channel for the government of the day.

of _course_ there is bias at the BBC. But to comparing it to Fox is uncharitable at best.

The thing is, though, there are a few components here: there's level of favorability toward a certain kind of politics, which some barely-popular left-leaning outlets roughly match Fox News on, plus propensity to lie and exaggerate. And there's reach.Nothing left-partisan in the US that I'm aware of touches Fox on either of those latter fronts—propensity to just make shit up, and (certainly not) reach.Nobody's putting Democracy Now! on in waiting rooms. Hell IDK maybe at Planned Parenthood, never been, wouldn't know, but not at a dentist's office or at the auto shop or what have you.There are equivalents to Fox News on the Left (Fox News viewers think it's MSNBC because that's what Fox News and AM radio told them, LMFAO, no) in the US, in terms of level of commitment to supporting partisan causes. There's nothing like it as far as willingness to deviate from reality to do so, nor in reach. Nothing remotely close.

I'm not a fan of the continued reification of ""left"" and ""right"". I have heard conservatives lament that MAGA isn't truly conservative. I've heard economic reformers lament that liberal social policies are sucking the oxygen out of the room for real structural reform. In both cases the idea of a single ""left"" and ""right"" as a group, or even worse as the two sole options on the menu of how to think, is severely damaging to productive political dialogue.Framing everything as left-vs-right is like doing PCA and taking only the first principal component - sure it might be contain some signal, but it flattens any nuance. Critically, it also pre-frames any debate into competing camps in a way that harms rather than serves. I would challenge groups like Ground News to offer other framings - why not ""owners vs workers""?  Why not ""rural vs urban""?  We should ask why they chose the framing they do. I have my own cynical opinion but I'll refrain from sharing.

All national media services have their own bias and propaganda, but if you switch them up it becomes obvious very quickly. It also means that I miss out on most of the US political noise [1], which is a benefit to my mental health [2].[0] Hot/lukewarm take: ""consuming news"" is a waste of time, and should be minimized. This really hits you like a brick to the head when you see the stuff that foreign countries are obsessing about, and how tiny it feels to you.

You're probably in a bubble, and an ""international perspective"" is something that most NPR listeners claim to value. Removing US media from my life eliminated a huge source of angst (particularly after 2016), and revealed that all of the major US media sources are various forms of hyper-polarized clownery.

Indian media is broadly worse if anything, latin american media is a trip if you have any understanding of the complicated political landscape, Aus is central to the Murdoch news dynasty, and East asian media has lots of famously partisan organizations. Maybe middle eastern media, explicitly funded for soft power political goals or African media, which span the gamut from bloodthirsty factional rags to leftover colonial institutions to tightly controlled extensions of the state apparatus?They're differently biased, but you can't escape consuming media critically. ""Averaging"" by listening to a lot of different perspectives is 1) a lot of effort and 2) also something that can (and is) manipulated by making sure there's lots of ""both sides"" messaging present.

I went out of my way to head off this exact criticism, but I guess I didn't put it in blinking, bold, 30 point font.Again: every national media outlet has bias (indeed, every media outlet has bias). My experience is that it's pretty easy to notice when you switch your sources regularly.It doesn't take me any effort to do this, and even if I hear a hyper-partisan take, it doesn't melt my brain. I go ""oh weird, so that's what the Indian government thinks"" -- which is still vastly preferable to hearing what some reporter at NPR or CNN or whatever thinks about what India thinks.

How is it not neutral ? I follow some of the news. They've criticized both Conservative and Labour governments. Of course there are problems like the whole Martin Bashir thing but recently I've seen the BBC be more self-critical than other private TV channels. If we're comparing mistakes from the past then in the 90s, Roger Ailes was molesting women behind locked doors. Lewd comments were the norm across several news rooms. Doesn't mean that all private media is bad.

Right now I'm drinking out of my NPR mug that I pay $12/month for. I've been a daily listener since college, it's my default radio station in the car, and when I road trip I like searching for the local station. But I disagree with this. There are a number of nationally syndicated shows (at least, in all the markets I've lived in) that I'd put in this category. 1A just off the top of my head. Reveal is another, but that's because their mission is to find things that need to be revealed and they're usually pretty upsetting.

The local stuff though was quite questionable.  For example they'd support different causes or efforts by referencing a single poorly supported research paper.  Usually those research papers supported some narrative.  It could be homelessness, drug treatments, etc., however there was little if any scrutiny of the paper the whole effort or narrative was based on.They also had annoying presenters like Kai Ryssdahl.  He was insufferable but hardly the only one.Also, despite being a public system, individual comp is high relative to their listeners', I'd say[1].  I'd guess most listeners would not imagine their comp being as high as it is, for example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Public_Radio[1] In addition, those at the top enjoy perks like being invited to elite events, and the perks of schmoozing for donations.

There is a degree of quasi-political messaging in PBS children's shows. I can say this because I've watched more hours than I'd like of several of them, but I'd like to focus on on Molly Of Denali. It's a good children's show about an inuit girl who lives in Alaska and teaches children general good morals and specifics of inuit and Alaskan culture.When I say it's political, I mean that it makes points without nuance  on historical and current issues which range from widely accepted and important ideas (example: They didn't let Native Alaskan People vote in the past, so it's important to exercise the right to vote now), to what I would consider less widely agreed upon and important ideas, such as it being deeply upsetting and disrespectful for a ""white"" teacher to call a native child ""T"", because she had trouble pronouncing his native name. Another example is them introducing the importance of ""land acknowledgements"" in a children's show. A final example is the ""clueless white"" trope wherein the offensive rude white visitor has to be educated by the wise natives over and over and over.I'm not trying to say that any of these examples are ""right"" or ""wrong"", but they do represent ""politics"" in the mind of wide sections of the population.This said I like the show and of course we need to fund public broadcasting, I would just prefer if we did our best to keep the most controversial stuff for when the kids are a bit older to make it a smaller target for outrage (from the right or left).The most jarring part, to me personally, is the drastic shift in tone and presentation for injustices with wildly different levels of impact. Perhaps rudely, I think to myself in the voice of the Inuit grandfather from the show ""The white man took me from my family, did not allow me to speak my language, beat me and did not allow me to vote, and worst of all...... He did not let me smile in photos""I don't mean any of this as racist or disrespectful and I hope this is a nuanced comment for consideration and not a kneeejerk reaction or evidence of my subconscious biases run wild.

Offensiveness of difficultly in pronouncing native Alaskan name - I believe this would be grouped under the umbrella of something like ""linguistic imperialism"" by people of particular political bents, which is an issue that at least heavily relates to politics.Land acknowledgements - As far as I can tell, these have always been politicized because they originated ""with indigenous Australian political movements and the arts"" at least according to Wikipedia. I don't know much about the subjectRude clueless white trope - I think this is to some extent a ""positive"" inversion of the ""noble savage"" trope, which Wikipedia tells me was historically political.

They have several shows that depict interracial marriages, while some people might try to take this as a political statement, most of us would not see it that way.In a similar vein, I don't see how pronouncing names correctly could be a political issue.

reply

I would also agree with you that pronouncing names generally is not (and largely probably should not be) a political topic, but that it necessarily is in this context because of it being included in a show about native Alaskans. If the teacher were inuit, or the student also white, or it was presented a simple misunderstanding  along the lines of ""can I call you T"" ""No please don't"" ""okay sorry I'll do my best"" it would not be ""political"". Because it's in this show in this context and explicitly connected to previous abuses of native people being made to use ""white names"", my contention is that the creators of the show intend for it to be political .

reply

Imagine not finding it disrespectful for your teacher to just completely ignore and disrespect your heritage and you're expected to just accept it and be totally OK with it.IMO kids should be taught to be proud of their names. Apparently, that's a political stance.I have many coworkers who I have trouble saying their names. I try as best as I can to say their names and be as respectful as possible.

I find, if we strip this from the colonial context, or remove it from the racial context entirely (this is now a conversation between two Han Chinese people of the same social class, for example) there is some relationship between what I  perceive to be an increasing focus on the critical importance of a child being called their exact name and no abbreviation, mispronunciation, standard nickname, or contextually assigned nickname, to be a symptom of an American hyper individualism and ""rights culture"".As an aside I have been told by more than one person with a foreign name before even attempting their name that they would prefer I just call them and Americanized abbreviation of their name for convenience. Obviously I want to try to do what they would like, but if they were to insist on a name I struggled with, I would consider them to be a generally annoying person.

I disagree that this is a useful or accurate way to engage in discussion about an entirely different and specific subject in an entirely different context. The only way they are related is with this ""chain of social progress"" framework, and even within that framework, they are not the same issue.I perceive it to be a dismissive approach which shuts down conversation, and I think it's clear when viewed plainly in the opposite direction: ""If you have concerns with any of the political messaging in children's shows, you would not allow a person of a different race into your swimming pool"", or in a slightly different way, ""If you have concerns about this you are explicitly the ""bad guy"".

Where I might disagree with you, if I understand you correctly, is in how applicable your comment is as a response to my mine. At the outset I attempted to communicate that some of the things that the most likely to be outraged people would take issue with (the importance of exercising the right to vote - especially if your ancestors didn't enjoy the right) are pretty universally accepted and even presenting it without nuance inside of a children's show is acceptable because it is done so with a positive focus (be involved in the democratic process).If I misunderstood you I apologize.

And I'll be the first to admit that NPR has completely lost its mind, it's losing its listenership, and it needs to be humbled a bit. But audio is much cheaper than video and NPR's remaining listeners will easily be able to make up the shortfall. Meanwhile we're going to see PBS, whose news coverage mostly avoided the pitfalls NPR fell into and who run a lot more non-news programming, take a huge funding hit and resort to even more pledge drives and reruns, while local affiliates in large swaths of the country have to close entirely.This is throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and not even throwing out the bathwater.

These attacks are not unique to the United States; there is a coordinated effort across many countries by public policy groups and private interests. The United States are highly visible due to their ownership of global media, but the Republican party has been pursuing these objectives publicly and clearly for more than 30 years, and has made incremental progress to the point where they were able to re-engineer the Supreme Court and lower courts, as well as elect far right politicians who would tear up the rules to make it happen.This is the sharp upwards curve of increase in velocity that is the result of sustained accelleration over the last few decades.

Some things (defense, diplomacy) perhaps can only be done through the federal government. But so many things (national weather service operations, HUD housing assistance, grants for local PBS stations, SNAP benefits) have a largely local or regional benefit. Rather than disassembling these things entirely, why not allow them each to be run by and for a coalition of states (or even cities?) which opt to participate?

reply

You should look up which states/regions/counties provide the funding and which states/regions/counties receive the benefits, it's disproportional. Unironically, unbundling HUD, SNAP, and NWS would probably cause famine in Mississippi.

reply

But it's pretty messed up that presently the places that _were_ willing to pay for these things are deprived of the benefits. If instead we kept things alive on an optional basis, the participating states might get _better_ services and outcomes for a while because some poor red state communities would not be a sink for funds. But also, if the political pendulum swings the other way in a future election cycle, and more places opt-in, then having kept these programs alive in a reduced form would put them in a better position to resume activity.

Still, it's nice that there are third spaces like libraries in the community where you can go and aren't expected to have to engage in any commercial activity. That requires buildings. Our library hosts all manner of groups & activities. I went to a seminar on seed-saving the other day at our library, for example. I've gone to others on the art of making Japanese tea, candidate debates for local races, local author book fairs, Taiko drumming, etc. All of that requires some kind of physical infrastructure.

That's why this careless crusade against governmental institutions is so horrific. Institutions with decades of history are being destroyed, and it would take years to decades to spin up something even close to equivalent, in an insane political environment where every public institution is framed as horrible socialism.

Conservatives have wanted to defund public broadcasting for decades. What made it finally possible was that public broadcasting made their bias obvious and undeniable. Over the past 10 years, the stark shift leftward has been undeniable — they became what they've been accused of being for a very long time.

Turns out that was perhaps an incomplete argument.

However, NPR also receives funding from member station fees, and those member stations typically get about 13% of their budgets from the federal government.Putting it all together about 10% of NPR's budget comes from the federal government.For PBS about 15% of their budget comes from the federal government. Some local PBS affiliates, especially in rural areas, get up to 60% of their budgets from the federal government.

To me the bright line of ""Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech"" is crossed at least in spirit when the state seizes a dollar from a taxpayer and spends it on speech, because that abridges the taxpayer's resources for speech by a dollar. ""You have free speech but I can take the money you use to be heard to speak against you"" is a big loophole.

El Salvador's Legislative Assembly approved changes to the country's constitution on Thursday that will extend presidential terms from five years to six and abolish term limits. That means President Nayib Bukele, a far-right crypto enthusiast who's allied with President Donald Trump, could potentially stay in power for the rest of his natural life.

First elected in 2019 on a promise to crack down on gangs, Bukele was supposed to be prohibited from running for re-election in 2024. But the country's Supreme Court of Justice ruled in 2021 that one of the articles in El Salvador's constitution allows a president to run for re-election once. Bukele's New Ideas Party removed magistrates in the Supreme Court who had opposed the president, clearing the path for Bukele to rule the country with an iron fist and make any constitutional changes necessary to remain in power indefinitely.

Bukele was re-elected in 2024 under those extremely dubious circumstances, and his term was scheduled to end on June 1, 2029. But lawmaker Ana Figueroa from the New Ideas Party has suggested moving up Bukele's re-election to June 1, 2027, to put it more in line with congressional elections, according to the Associated Press. With the new changes and Bukele's popularity, it would presumably allow the president to consolidate even more power now that he could be re-elected again and again, both without term limits and for a longer term each time.

The vote to strip term limits for the president and extend the length of each term passed by 57 to 3. And one of the three dissenters, Marcela Villatoro of the Nationalist Republican Alliance, warned that democracy would be weakened with the changes, according to the AP.

“You don't realize what indefinite reelection brings: It brings an accumulation of power and weakens democracy … there's corruption and clientelism because nepotism grows and halts democracy and political participation,” Villatoro is quoted as saying in an English language translation.

Bukele, a fan of Elon Musk and frequent user of X, hasn't tweeted about the changes yet. But guys like Musk and Trump are no doubt excited that their buddy in Central America is going to get even more power. Trump met with Bukele in the White House back in April when the U.S. president was shipping migrants to the U.S. to El Salvador's torture prison. The men sent there, some of whom have been released into Venezuela, have told horror stories about being beaten, given dirty water, and sexually assaulted.

Bukele rode into office and remains popular because he promised to crack down on gangs. But recent reporting from the country's El Faro news outlet claims Bukele's government signed a secret pact in 2019 with gang leaders to dial back violence in the country. Part of the deal, according to the news outlet, was providing financial incentives. Bukele has taken credit for reducing violence by insisting it's all part of his brutally violent crackdown.

Bukele has invested his country's money heavily in crypto, holding nearly $550 million of its foreign exchange reserves in bitcoin, according to Reuters, which amounts to about 15%. And while that may seem like a fine thing to do when bitcoin is soaring, it's extremely risky for any government when the price of crypto is so volatile. Bukele's government made reassurances to the International Monetary Fund that it would scale back its crypto project in exchange for a $1.4 billion bailout from the IMF. But as the Council on Foreign Relations pointed out in May, the country is still buying bitcoin.

As CoinTelegraph reported in June, El Salvador has added at least 240 BTC since Dec. 19, 2024, right after the agreement with the IMF was announced. That's more than $27 million at the current bitcoin price, which is hovering around $114,500, near the record high of about $123,000. It's not clear what the IMF may do since El Salvador violated its agreement, but whatever happens, the government needs to hope the price doesn't plummet.

The situation surrounding Trump tariffs hasn't eased its pressure on Nintendo. Even as the Switch 2 has become one of the fastest-selling consoles ever, the Mario maker said that select Switch 2 accessories may see price “adjustments” starting Aug 3. Not only that, but the original Switch and Switch OLED could cost more going forward. I guess we shouldn't say we told you so, but even we didn't expect to witness original Switch models selling for $40 or $50 more than before.

In a news post, Nintendo said U.S. customers can expect certain accessories, select amiibo, and the cute Alarmo bedside clock to all get more expensive in the next few days. After Nintendo fully revealed the Switch 2 in May, the company delayed preorders for North American customers and blamed the wide-reaching tariffs for the issue. While the console maker decided not to hike Switch 2 prices, it raised prices on the Switch 2 Pro Controller, Joy-Con 2 split controllers, and the official Switch 2 Camera peripheral by $5 each. We can expect some console extras to cost more, but we'll have to see which amiibos Nintendo decides to hike. We can assume the DK and young Pauline figurine for Donkey Kong Bananza is first in line.

Nintendo said its games shouldn't cost any more after Aug. 3. That's not much of a relief considering the company is already pushing some titles for $70 or as much as $80. If some gamers were already suffering consternation surrounding the Switch 2's $150 jump from the original Switch to the Switch 2, the divide is already starting to shrink. Digital deals hunter Wario64 spotted that Target had already increased prices for the 8-year-old console. A Switch Lite went from $200 to $220. The original Switch now costs $40 more at $340. The fan-favorite Switch OLED, which was priced at $350 on launch, now sells for $400. Target later reversed those prices, which could be an indicator the big box store was early to the party, or the pricing was inaccurate to what we'll see on Aug. 3. Gizmodo reached out to Target for comment, and we'll update this post if we hear back.

Nintendo Joy-Con 2 (L)/(R) Light Blue/Light Red currently $94.99 (will increase to $99.99 this weekend according to Target)

Target prices indicate the Switch 2 Pro Controller won't get a price hike, but both the Joy-Con 2 and the original Switch Joy-Con controllers will now cost more at $100 and $90, respectively. Alarmo will now cost $110, while prices on accessories, like the original Joy-Con charging stand, will go up by $5.

The price hikes come on the heels of Nintendo declaring the Switch 2 had sold more than 6 million units globally in the first seven weeks after release—around July 24. The company said in its latest financial results that it sold nearly as many copies of Mario Kart World, though that includes the software downloads from the $500 Switch 2 and Mario Kart bundle. Nintendo didn't offer nearly as much data on its peripheral sales, though original Switch sales were already declining before the Switch 2 release. A more expensive console won't do Nintendo's older systems any favors. Either way, if you still had plans to grab a few Switch 2 accessories, you best do so now before they cost you even more.

You're better off getting a Nintendo Switch 2 at these prices.

Nintendo just announced a price hike for the U.S. that will hit all original Switch / Switch 1 handheld consoles, select Switch 2 accessories, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo. According to its announcement, the company made these adjustments “based on market conditions,” and they will take effect starting August 3, 2025. Thankfully, the cost for the Nintendo Switch 2, game titles for both Switch 1 & 2, and Nintendo Switch Online memberships remain the same. However, the gaming giant also said that “price adjustments may be necessary in the future.”

This is unusual, as most companies typically drop the prices of their old models after launching next-gen products. And Nintendo has just released the Switch 2, which has been quite successful and is projected to beat the original Switch. However, it seems that these price hikes are driven by economics, especially given the uncertainty of the tariffs that President Trump applied the U.S.'s trading partners. We can't directly blame tariffs for the increasing costs of these consoles, though, as Canada was also affected by these price increases.

The price increases vary between $30 and $50 for the Switch 1 consoles, bringing the cheapest Nintendo handheld to $230 and the most expensive Switch 1 option to nearly $400. At this price, you're better off spending $50 more and getting the Nintendo Switch 2, which starts at $449.99. This will give you much better performance and a larger screen, although you'll be missing out on the OLED display. You can also install more games on the new handheld because it uses microSD Express cards. Although these cars are more expensive and harder to find (if you don't know where to look), they offer better performance and allow you to load games directly from the expansion slot.

More importantly, the Switch 2 is now readily available. This isn't like the PlayStation 5 launch fiasco, where scalpers made a ton of money buying up Sony's consoles because it had little to no supply. So, as long as you know where to buy it, you can easily pick up a Nintendo Switch 2 console at any time.

The world of 3D printing has opened us up to an entirely new era of manufacturing. We can print objects at home using the best budget 3D printers and it's amazing how far we've come yet you'll still be hard pressed to find examples of 3D printing in space. This is mainly due to the volatility of 3D printed materials and a need for extreme reliability in aerospace. But, Horizon Microtechnologies, has recently passed testing standards, put in place to ensure the reliability of materials used in the space industry — bringing us one step closer to introducing more 3D printing components in space.

The 3D printed materials were put through outgassing tests. The materials must meet specific requirements to be cleared for space travel in accordance with ECSS-Q-ST-70-02C, a material screening standard set by the European Cooperation for Space Standardization.

""This Standard describes a thermal vacuum test to determine the outgassing screening properties of materials proposed for use in the fabrication of spacecraft and associated equipment, for vacuum facilities used for flight hardware tests and for certain launcher hardware.""

The company accomplished this impressive feat by coating the 3D printed components.



Horizon Microtechnologies CEO Andreas Frölich expressed enthusiasm for the successful results, remarking at the significance of their development. The coating process ensures the 3D printed structures are able to meet the rigorous standards put into place to ensure safety during space travel.

The outgassing testing process in particular is used to determine how much, if any, volatile material is released and/or reabsorbed by the given component being tested. This testing process is also looking out for any cross contamination with nearby items that might be able to absorb any released particles.

By coating their 3D printed components using its own purpose developed coating method, Horizon Microtechnologies was able to successfully pass the standard requirements for the outgassing tests. This means we'll likely see more 3D-printed hardware in wide variety of future space technology, including vessels, satellite hardware and more. Recently, tests were carried out on the International Space Station (ISS) which saw astronauts on the ISS 3D print objects in micro-gravity. This uses low-temperature plastics instead of traditional filament, as all sources of heat and fire are strictly controlled on the ISS. The benefits of 3D printing in space are chiefly the ability to fabricate a part without the expense of a launching a rocket to the station. Just open up a spool of filament, load up your slicer and print that vital part.

Apple is playing catch-up with AI


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Being considerably behind other major high-tech companies with its artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, Apple is open to acquiring third-party companies to accelerate its AI roadmap as its management gets that gradual expanding its internal AI initiatives won't cut in to become competitive with Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, or xAI.

""We are very open to M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions) that accelerates our road map,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook during the company's earnings call with financial analysts and investors, when asked about possible acquisitions of AI companies. ""We are not stuck on a certain size company, although the ones that we have acquired thus far this year are small in nature. But we basically ask ourselves whether a company can help us accelerate our roadmap and if they do, then we are interested. But we do not have anything to share specifically today.""

During the call, Cook confirmed the company is increasing spending and reorganizing teams to address expansion of its AI initiatives. Apple is moving a significant number of employees to AI-related work and these teams are tasked with developing new features that leverage machine learning and related technologies across Apple's hardware and software ecosystem.

""The way that we look at AI is that it is one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime, and I think it will affect all devices in a significant way,"" Cook said. ""We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments. Apple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone, and that is at the heart of our AI strategy.""

Cook stated that Apple intends to grow its AI investment substantially, which is proven by the company's increased CapEx (more on this later). This includes not only organic growth of the Apple's existing teams and efforts, but also acquisitions of other companies of different sizes. In fact, the company has already made around seven takeovers this year, though not all were related to AI, according to Cook.

Historically, Apple has made numerous high-profile acquisitions that either expanded its market presence, or strenghtened its vertical integration.

Apple's most notable acquisition remains Beats Electronics, purchased in 2014 for $3 billion. This transaction brought both the popular Beats headphone brand and the Beats Music streaming service, which became the foundation for Apple Music. For now, the Beats-branded portfolio clearly helps Apple to maintain the No.1 position on the market of wireless headsets and justifies development of custom silicon for these devices.

Other acqusitions were mostly focused on enhancing the company's vertical integration.

In 2019, Apple expanded its hardware capabilities by acquiring Intel' smartphone modem business for $1 billion, gaining key patents and over 2,000 employees to accelerate the development of its own 5G modems in a bid to reduce dependence on Qualcomm. This year the company finally released its first smartphone with its in-house developed modem inside and said that eventually it would use its own modems inside its devices.

Earlier, in 2018, Apple spent $600 million to acquire a portion of Dialog Semiconductor, including licensing power management technologies and hiring over 300 Dialog engineers, helping Apple bring more of its chip design in-house. In the early 2010s, the company broght Anobit Technologies to bring development of NAND controllers in house; fingerprint sensor company AuthenTec (Touch ID), and 3D sensing designer PrimeSense (Face ID).

Despite this renewed focus on AI, Apple's infrastructure spending remains modest compared to other major high-tech companies. Apple allocated $3.46 billion on CapEx in Q3 FY2025, a rise from $2.15 billion in the same period last year. So far this fiscal year the company has spent $9.473 billion on 'acquisition of property, plant, and equipment,' which is how it calls its capital expenditures. Even if the company spends another $3.46 billion in Q4 FY2025 (which ends on September 29), its CapEx for the fiscal year 2025 will total $12.933 billion. If we annualize Apple's CapEx to calendar year, its spendings will be between $13 billion and $14 billion, which is far behind Google's $85 billion forecast for fiscal 2025, Meta's projected $72 billion, and Microsoft's $80 billion for calendar 2025, according to CNBC estimates.

Apple posted total revenue of $94.0 billion for the third fiscal quarter ending June 28, 2025, a 10% increase from the $85.8 billion reported a year earlier. Net income for the quarter reached $23.4 billion, an increase from $21.4 billion in the third quarter of 2024. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 46.5%, compared to $46.27 billion last year.

As for product categories, iPhone remains the company's No. 1 product with $44.6 billion in revenue, a notable rise from $39.3 billion at the same quarter last year Sales of Mac PCs generated $8.0 billion, compared to $7.0 billion last year. iPad revenue was $6.6 billion, slightly down from $7.2 billion in the prior year, which is a surprise as the company introduced an inexpensive iPad earlier this year. The Wearables, Home, and Accessories category brought in $7.4 billion, a decline from $8.1 billion in Q3 2024. Meanwhile, Services revenue continued its upward trajectory, reaching $27.4 billion, up from $24.2 billion in Q3 FY2024.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","The vicious circle of aging and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250801/The-vicious-circle-of-aging-and-metabolic-dysfunction-associated-steatotic-liver-disease.aspx","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 13:27:00 GMT","

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly NAFLD) and aging are locked in a vicious circle: senescence of liver cells accelerates fat accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis, while chronic steatosis in turn hastens hepatic decline. Up to 38 % of adults worldwide have MASLD, and prevalence, severity and mortality all rise with age. Ageing livers shrink by ~30%, clear lipids and glucose less efficiently, and regenerate more slowly after injury. Lipid deposition is driven by falling β-oxidation, leptin resistance and the GPCPD1-glycerophosphocholine pathway; glucose intolerance emerges from insulin resistance linked to visceral obesity and telomere-p53 signalling. Senescent hepatocytes, endothelial cells, stellate cells and Kupffer macrophages each contribute distinct pathologies, but their shared secretion of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) propagates damage throughout the organ.

Hepatocytes are the first responders. In aged or obese mice, 60-80 % of hepatocytes display p16, p21 or β-gal positivity; enlarged nuclei, reduced smooth endoplasmic reticulum and fewer mitochondria accompany metabolic reprogramming that favours lipogenesis. SASP cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α recruit macrophages, perpetuate inflammation and can either restrain or promote hepatocellular carcinoma depending on context. Selective insulin resistance within senescent hepatocytes diverts incoming fatty acids to triglyceride droplets, fuelling steatosis.

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) undergo ""pseudocapillarization"" with age: thickness increases, fenestrae decrease and basement membranes form. Loss of fenestrae impedes insulin uptake and lipoprotein exchange, aggravating systemic dyslipidaemia and hepatic fat overload. Senescent LSECs secrete CXCR4 ligands that polarise macrophages toward an M1 phenotype, amplifying fibro-inflammatory signalling. Conversely, restoring C-kit-positive LSECs or activating SIRT1 via Notch inhibition reverses these changes and improves steatohepatitis.

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) paradoxically assume a less fibrotic yet senescent state. They lose lipid droplets, produce fewer extracellular-matrix proteins but secrete matrix metalloproteinases that degrade existing scar tissue. p53-dependent IGF-1 signalling and IL-22-STAT3 activation drive this anti-fibrotic senescence, rendering senescent HSCs targets for NK-cell elimination. However, transient persistence of senescent HSCs after partial hepatectomy releases IL-6 and CXCR2 ligands that stimulate compensatory hepatocyte proliferation, illustrating the dual roles of cellular senescence.

Kupffer macrophages accumulate with age and shift toward an M1 pro-inflammatory profile. Autophagy declines, ROS rise and IRF5-mediated transcription of TNF-α and IL-1β intensifies. These macrophages amplify steatohepatitis by recruiting monocytes via CCR2-CCL2 and CXCR3-CXCL10 axes. Depletion of Kupffer cells in mouse models blunts progression from MASLD to MASH, confirming their pathogenic centrality.

Given the intertwining of ageing and steatosis, interventions that target senescence are emerging. Senolytic cocktails—dasatinib plus quercetin, Bcl-2 inhibitors navitoclax or ABT-737, and senolytic vaccination against glycoprotein GPNMB—selectively eliminate p16-high cells, reduce hepatic triglycerides and restore insulin sensitivity in mice. Small-molecule vorapaxar blocks thrombomodulin-PAR1 signalling in senescent hepatocytes, diminishing inflammation and fibrosis. Genetic modulation of BMP4-Gremlin1 or PLA2R1 likewise mitigates steatosis and cellular senescence.

Lifestyle measures complement pharmacology. Exercise and calorie restriction restore AMPK-mediated autophagy, lower hepatic fat and improve glucose tolerance in rodents and humans. The key challenge is to distinguish beneficial, transient senescent cells—needed for wound healing and tumour suppression—from chronic, pathogenic ones. Future trials must therefore refine cell-type-specific senolytic strategies, validate biomarkers and balance efficacy against the physiological roles of senescence in liver homeostasis.

Goalkeeper Matt Turner has returned to the New England Revolution on loan from French Ligue 1 club Lyon, it was announced on Friday.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. – Goalkeeper Matt Turner has returned to the New England Revolution on loan from French Ligue 1 club Lyon, it was announced on Friday.

The U.S. men's national team keeper will be on loan with the MLS side through June 30, 2026, with an option to purchase.

Turner will be a Designated Player on the Revs' roster for the remainder of this season and will be a TAM-eligible player in 2026.

The U.S.'s starting goalkeeper at the 2022 World Cup, Turner has recorded 29 wins and 27 clean sheets in his 52 senior caps with the USMNT. He leads all USMNT goalkeepers for the most clean sheets (14) through their first 20 caps, and became the first American goalkeeper to save a penalty kick in his international debut. At the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup, Turner registered five shutouts in six starts, taking home Golden Glove and Best XI honors. That same year, he finished as runner-up to Christian Pulisic for 2021 U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year.

“It is a privilege to return to the club that launched my career,” Turner said in a statement. “The club that helped me discover who I am as a professional, the club that has always felt like a home away from home. To have the chance to play in front of the Revolution supporters once again is a priceless feeling and one I've never taken for granted. My family and I have felt their unwavering support throughout these last three years, and I can't wait to wear the Revolution crest again at Gillette Stadium. I am grateful for this opportunity to earn my place on the field and look forward to winning many more games with the Revolution.”

Before departing for Europe in June 2022, the Park Ridge, N.J. native spent seven seasons with New England, joining the club in 2016 as an undrafted free agent out of Fairfield University. In his last full season stateside before transferring to Arsenal, Turner won 2021 MLS Goalkeeper of the Year and MLS Best XI honors, took home the MLS All-Star Game MVP Award, and helped lead the Revs to their first Supporters' Shield title. In MLS regular season and postseason action, Turner has recorded 108 regular season starts with 23 clean sheets, with four penalty saves on 11 attempts faced.

“When the opportunity arose to bring Matt Turner back to the Revolution, we were glad to act swiftly to welcome one of the most talented players ever to represent the club,” Revolution sporting director Curt Onalfo said in a statement. “Matt's talent and leadership will make our squad stronger now and in the future. We look forward to having Matt and his family back in New England.”

While on loan to Crystal Palace during the 2024-25 Premier League campaign, Turner served as the backup goalkeeper for South London side during the club's run to the FA Cup title, its first major trophy. He made his debut for Palace on Oct. 30, 2024, posting eight saves in the Eagles' 2-1 victory over Aston Villa in the EFL Cup Round of 16.

Turner totaled 21 starts for Nottingham Forest, including 17 appearances in the 2023-24 Premier League campaign. During his first stop in England at Arsenal FC, Turner started five times in the Gunners' 2022-23 UEFA Europa League play and twice in 2023 FA Cup action.

“I look forward to welcoming Matt back to the Revolution and I am excited for this opportunity to work with one of the best goalkeepers our league has produced,” Revs head coach Caleb Porter said in a statement. “Matt holds himself to an extremely high standard that has led him to success at the international level, in Europe, and of course, in MLS. Matt's shot-stopping quality and overall character and mentality make him a tremendous addition to our goalkeeping corps.”

Turner will begin training with New England next week and will be eligible to feature in the Revolution's next match on Saturday, Aug. 9 vs. D.C. United. The home contest at Gillette Stadium, also the club's first “Alumni Night” celebration, kicks off at 7:30 p.m. ET.

Jeff Stelling has shockingly declared that Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca is under ‘pressure' heading into the new Premier League season.

Maresca has worked miracles since replacing Mauricio Pochettino last year, helping the Blues win the Conference League and Club World Cup.

The Italian boss also guided Chelsea to a fourth-place Premier League finish last season, with the west London club making a return to the Champions League after they ended up 12th and sixth in 2023 and 2024.

But football pundit Stelling has fired a massive warning to Maresca if Chelsea suffer a poor start to the 2025-26 campaign.

In a talkSPORT YouTube video titled ‘Maresca and Amorim are in BIG DANGER of getting sacked if they have POOR starts, claim Jeff & Gabby!', Stelling said: ‘You might not agree with this – and sorry Chelsea fans.

‘Club World Cup winners and spending a fortune, Enzo Maresca needs to deliver. He's now under pressure because there's expectation on him.

‘They have four London derbies in their first four games and then Manchester United away, Brighton at home, Liverpool at home and Nottingham Forest away.

‘It's a tough, tough start and they've not had much of a break [over the summer].

‘If they start poorly, I think people will be saying, ‘We expect more than that' – because people do expect more of Chelsea now.

‘As Club World Cup winners, going out there and doing brilliantly… Chelsea will be expected to produce in the Premier League and so will Maresca. 

‘I'm not saying he's going to be sacked after eight games and in actual fact they might have a terrific start.

‘They could win them all – but if they don't – I'm just saying he'd be under pressure.'

Speaking in May, Maresca revelled in Chelsea's Champions League qualification, telling those who have doubted him and his side to ‘f*** off'.

‘I didn't have any doubts about the players,' the Chelsea head coach said. ‘The doubt was from outside. All the ones that have the answer and the truth, they were saying we were too young, we were not good enough.

‘They were saying we were not able to win on this pitch because we were too young and not experienced.

‘Unfortunately for them they are all wrong, all the ones who have the truth and the answer for everything. So in English, I will say ‘eff off' to all of them.'

Ligue 1 reduced from 20 to 18 clubs ahead of the 2023/24 season

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

The Premier League will not bow to pressure to reduce in size from 20 to 18 clubs, says chief executive Richard Masters.

The new season kicks off on 15 August, just three weeks on from Chelsea's victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final as tensions continue to boil over the congested football calendar.

The Blues played almost a year of continuous football before the end of their 2024/25 season gave them a long-awaited reprieve, but will have to do it all over again with 11 months of competitive action culminating back in the United States for the World Cup - the final of which takes place on 19 July in New Jersey.

Complaints over the over-packed schedule have been rife, with Manchester City midfielder Rodri warning last September that players are “close” to going on strike because of the increase in games. He said this just 10 days before being ruled out for the domestic season with an ACL injury.

France's Ligue 1 made the decision to reduce from 20 to 18 teams for the 2023/24 campaign, in part so to lighten the fixture load.

However, Masters has stated that the Premier League should not be “forced” to follow suit.

""I don't think we should be forced into that decision,” he told BBC Sport.

""I am all for the growth of the game and the exciting competitions our clubs can participate in - but not at the expense of domestic football.""

This comes in the midst of a long-winded dispute between Fifa and FifPro - the world's main union for footballers - over the congested calendar and its impact on player welfare.

FifPro general secretary believes it is difficult for players to make their voices heard, remaining fearful of speaking out on the heavy workload because of the impact it could have on their careers.

“I was speaking to some of the top stars that were going to play in the Club World Cup, and they were saying that they hadn't had a rest for X amount of time,” Phillips said. 

“One of them even said, ‘I'll only get a rest when I get injured'. Others were resigned actually, and cynical about speaking up.

“Then you see some of the same players two weeks later having to record social media videos saying ‘we think the Club World Cup is great' because their employers are telling them to do it.

“That's why unions do exist, partly, to be their voice, because they are in an invidious position. They can't speak. They can't say exactly what they think – well, they can do, but that may have consequences.”

Breaking News, Podcasts and Analysis Serving People who Organize, Manage and Host Sports Events

Demand to attend the 2026 FIFA World Cup throughout North America via hospitality packages has led to what On Location is calling an “unprecedented” deposit campaign as details emerge about a variety of high-end options that will be available before the general ticket sales phase begins.

Related Stories

Alicia Falken, On Location's general manager for FIFA World Cup 26, called next summer's tournament “one of the largest hospitality events ever” as FIFA announced its latest set of hospitality offerings recently with options for single matches, the ability to follow a specific team through the Round of 32 and a venue series with a variety of high-end offerings that come in at hefty price tags.

“I think we have price points for everybody,” Falken said. “There's different levels of hospitality and different products that we offer to create sort of a something-for-everyone kind of menu. Whether you buy a Follow My Team series or suite or are looking for more of a fan-based experience such as our pavilion, I really do think there's something for everybody.”

On Location recently released several sets of packages including a venue series for one stadium, single-match packages through the Round of 32 and a Follow My Team packages that guarantees tickets and hospitality for a team's group stage and potential Round of 32 game should their team advance past the group stage.

As for the question of what a fan would do if their team advances past the Round of 32, “I'm fairly certain we'll change our bundling structure by the time that the draw happens,” Falken said. “Once we understand where the teams are playing, there'll be opportunities and there'll be hospitality available,” Falken said.

The cheapest group stage hospitality ticket is $1,350 for a game on June 16 in Kansas City while the most expensive is $2,100 for group stage games on June 14 and June 27 in Dallas. Within the Round of 32, the cheapest ticket is $2,025 for a June 29 match in Houston and the most expensive is $2,600 for a July 2 match in Inglewood, California.

Falken said factors that went into the pricing include operating costs, the various destinations and the international demand as well.

“We obviously strive to ensure that experiences are priced fairly and then we have a range of products available,” she said. “There's a lot of factors that go into something like that. It would be hard to roll it into one concise answer. There's factors in terms of venues in the local market and the expectations of teams and a lot of different factors that would go into that. Obviously there's varying interests across the different follow my teams packages as well.”

The cost for most Follow My Team packages are in the range of either $6,750 or $7,200. There are a few countries that stick out — none more so than Colombia with a price tag of $13,500, significantly more than any other country. The next three most expensive packages are for Spain, Germany and France. One country whose packages are not available is England. Those packages are not currently available because of high demand during the initial launch in May although options may be available at a later date.

The Follow My Team packages include a FIFA pavilion area with preferred seating, pre- and post-match hospitality service and other amenities including a beverage program, culinary offerings, “gourmet street eats,” entertainment and a commemorative gift.

Pitchside Lounge packages include “premium seats located along the sidelines” along with a dedicated guest relations area plus exclusive beverage and culinary options. VIP packages include seating “offering an enhanced view of the match in most venues” while Trophy Lounge package seats are “combining comfort and convenience with excellent views and easy access to amenities.” The Champions Club is much like the Trophy Lounge in offerings. The FIFA Pavilion has preferred seating options.

The FIFA Pavilion packages for a Venue Series are the cheapest for each stadium and range from $8,275 for Bay Area Stadium to $25,800 for New York/New Jersey. The most expensive of any package is $68,150 for a Pitchside Lounge package at New York/New Jersey stadium, which includes the final.

“FIFA has a really well-thought out standard in terms of hospitality,” Falken said. “They've been doing this a long time and you've got an existing stadium in this sense, it's different than Qatar when it was all purpose-built stadiums specifically for the World Cup. In this case we're looking at stadiums that are already built, so how does the space fit the product requirements and determine what makes the most sense, (and) the alignment of seating to those hospitality spaces to make sure that we're creating the unparalleled experience that customers are getting what they pay for? The experience that they want is very important.”

Falken said the packages are also designed so fans have options to either follow a team or just see games at one stadium that they're close to regionally. On Location is also working to try and make each stadium's hospitality as locally relevant as possible.

“Something we're working through right now, and that this is the most fun to me, is creating something that is city-specific, but then also that you feel like you're at a World Cup across the board,” she said. “It's also an international event. So how do you mix those international flavors with local flavors — there's the food, there's the design, there's gifting. There's the entertainment, there's all these different aspects of that guest experience that you can use to create that look and feel of this space that's uniquely World Cup and unique to that host city but also create a thread across every venue in every space. And that's the neat part.”

When asked what the revenue targets or goals for the hospitality packages were, Falken said that because On Location is part of TKO Holdings, which is a publicly traded company, “I don't believe I can speak to revenue targets and forward-looking things.”

The application period for the first general ticket draw for the FIFA World Cup will open on September 10 and fans should visit FIFA.com/tickets to register interest and create a FIFA ID if they have plans to attend.

There will be several ticket sales phases from the start of sales in September. Each phase may differ in purchasing processes, payment methods and ticket products. Dynamic pricing for general ticket sales has also been discussed, according to The Athletic.

Falken said since On Location is the hospitality provider but not the ticketing provider, “any questions related to general ticketing need to go to FIFA because we're not supporting the general ticket launch.”

FIFA this week said those who enter the Visa Presale Draw between September 10 and September 19 can apply for a chance to purchase tickets in the first phase of ticket sales. To participate in the Visa Presale Draw, Visa cardholders must log into their FIFA account using their FIFA ID and complete the application form at any time during the ten-day application period for their chance to purchase tickets.

Following a random selection process, FIFA will notify successful cardholders by email beginning no earlier than September 30. These cardholders will be assigned a date and time slot in October during which they will be able to visit to purchase tickets (subject to availability).

FIFA also took pains to point out this week “a match ticket does not guarantee admission to a host country, and fans should visit each host country's government website today for entry requirements.”

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Top half fourth-round matches feature the two remaining ATP 1000 Canada champions, with No. 1 seed Alexander Zverev (2017) trying to post his first-ever win against Francisco Cerundolo, while the winner from last year, Alexei Popyrin, comes up against Holger Rune. Casper Ruud and Karen Khachanov are meeting for the first time since their 2022 US Open semifinal. Who do you think will reach the last eight at ATP Toronto?

Head-to-head: 1-1

The two friends from their junior days will face each other for the third time on the pro circuit. Alex Michelsen won in Houston on clay, but Learner Tien got their hard-court meeting at the Next Gen Finals. It's tough to predict this as they know each other's games so well, and surprisingly, the opponent might not be possible. Tien can unload Michelsen's power effectively on hard, but the conditions could support the 20-year-old a little bit. Maybe this time, he refrains from going for a frontal attack, which would be for the best for him.
Prediction: Michelsen in 3

Head-to-head: Rune 1-0

Alexei Popyrin is defending the title from last year, but with the yearly Montreal/Toronto switch-up, he has to do it at a different venue. Nonetheless, defeating Daniil Medvedev in the third round was a big result, and Popyrin seems to be stepping up to the challenge. But Holger Rune might be a difficult opponent for him. The Dane isn't consistent, but when he locks in, he's got the all-around set of skills to make his opponent's one-dimensional aggressive play suffer.
Prediction: Rune in 2

Head-to-head: Ruud 2-0

This isn't the part of the season that Casper Ruud is known for, but let's remember he has a couple of deep Canada runs in his resume and a US Open final in 2022. After suffering from a knee injury during the clay season and having to skip the grass, he seems to be pretty hungry to compete this week. It's been a while since he last played Karen Khachanov, but usually, he was able to go after his forehand pretty aggressively in this matchup. His ceiling might just be higher than the Russians', too.
Prediction: Ruud in 3

Head-to-head: Cerundolo 3-0

Alexander Zverev has been struggling against Francisco Cerundolo, but this is the first time they'll be competing on hard courts. The passive game plan of the World No. 3 allowed Cerundolo too much offensive freedom when they played in Madrid (twice) or in Buenos Aires. But here the serve of the Argentinian will pale in comparison to Zverev ‘s and he might be punished for his often sloppy footwork more than on the dirt. If the No. 1 seed loses to Cerundolo again, he'll develop a bit of a mental block.
Prediction: Zverev in 3

Building on their NFT-focused collaboration around the 2024 ATP Finals, the ATP Tour and digital memorabilia vendor Trace are launching a new fan engagement program called “Collect,” which will run across multiple tournaments through the end of the 2025 tennis season.

Collect will allow fans to claim digital “credentials” for events (which look like virtual press passes) and pieces of digital artwork that commemorate individual matches within those events, including the scoreline and participants. 

The program launches in time for the quarterfinals of the ongoing National Bank Open in Canada and will be available from the quarterfinals on for the upcoming Cincinnati Open and Rolex Shanghai Masters, as well as the entire year-end ATP Finals in Turin.

Continuing a successful collaboration

Last ATP Finals, the ATP and Trace piloted a different program, branded “Momentum,” which featured 24-hour windows for fans to collect NFTs designed using data from 15 matches. The program recorded 75K fan registrants, who collected digital tokens of 770K matches in eight days (averaging more than 10 per user). 

ATP Director/Comms & Web3 Mark Epps said those new registrants increased the tour's “directly known audience” (i.e., fans subscribed to the tour's marketing correspondence) by 25%, marking enormous successes in fan acquisition and engagement.

“That laid the foundation for, ‘What do we do next?'” Epps said. “The answer for us was, let's see if we can serialize this thing over multiple tournaments and prove that what we achieved in Turin [in 2024] is repeatable.”

Similar to Momentum, fans who participate in Collect will be able to claim collectibles during the day matches take place, local time. The assets are then distributed the following day and stored in individualized digital “vaults.”

New features, fan-centric touches

The ATP and Trace have also made conceptual adjustments, some based on feedback collected through fan feedback forums, surveys and Zoom calls. One is addition of physical giveaways of items such as tournament-specific hats, towels and signed memorabilia.

“We have been very deliberate in not putting [the giveaways] front and center, because we don't believe that this is the reason a fan is going to want to join the experience -- and it almost shouldn't be,” Epps said. “We view these [giveaways] as little surprise-and-delight moments. A way of saying thank you.”

Collect's event-level digital credentials and match-level artwork will also have a different feel than Momentum, leaning on the marketing colors of each tournament and match-specific wrinkles (e.g., Epps said a hypothetical piece on Carlos Alcaraz's quarterfinal win over Alexander Zverev in 2024 could have included bees, given a swarm of them interrupted that match).

And for the combined ATP/WTA National Bank Open and Cincinnati Open, the ATP has partnered with the WTA to promote and provide collectibles for women's matches as well. The tours will co-market the Collect initiative across their apps, email lists, social media channels and websites.

“It was actually one of the key pieces of feedback,” Epps said. “We had fans at the [ATP Finals] saying, ‘Where are the WTA matches?' despite it being an ATP-only event. Point taken. Fans want both.”

The ATP and Trace's ongoing partnership speaks to the tour's emphasis on fan acquisition and engagement, which Epps noted is underscored further by the fact that Collect is also being used as a platform to begin rolling out a single sign-on product called “Tennis ID.” At first, fans will only be able to use this login to participate in Collect, but it could eventually facilitate access to future digital initiatives.

Collect is also a means for the tour to better learn fans' tournament, match or player preferences, and potentially treat them to long-term rewards such as gated commerce or real-life experiences (although no plans are finalized there as of now). Eventually, it could serve as a platform to integrate corporate partners in as well.

And, importantly, the hope is it keeps fans coming back to tennis-related content.

“There's an underlying thesis here, that Trace is built on, that it's worth knowing your true fans are and giving them an identity artifact that they carry,” said Trace co-founder and CEO Tareq Nazlawy. “If fandom is so central to identity, for us as people, then there should be a digital artifact which is reflecting that.”","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Flavio Cobolli on Novak Djokovic: 'Wimbledon felt different, I believed'","https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/ATP_Tennis/158134/flavio-cobolli-on-novak-djokovic-wimbledon-felt-different-i-believed-/","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 15:04:14 GMT","

Flavio Cobolli has reached a new milestone, climbing to a career-high 17th in the ATP rankings. Flavio has won two ATP titles this season and backed them with his first Major quarter-final at Wimbledon.

The 23-year-old Italian reflected on his recent progress following the second-round victory in Toronto. In addition, Flavio shared thoughts on facing his idol, Novak Djokovic in two contrasting matches.

The young gun met his idol in Shanghai last year and claimed only three games after staying on the court for just over an hour. Flavio could not find his rhythm and hold nerves.

However, he was ready to challenge his idol at Wimbledon a couple of weeks ago. Embracing his deepest run at Majors, Cobolli challenged Djokovic for over three hours in a 6-7, 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 loss on Centre Court.

More composed and confident, Flavio pushed himself to play freely on one of tennis' grandest stages. The Italian delivered what he described as one of his finest performances despite the defeat.

The young gun struggled behind the second serve and got broken six times. On the other hand, he seized both break points to push the seven-time champion to the limits. 

Despite giving his everything, Flavio admitted it was tough to challenge Novak at Majors. Beyond that memorable duel, the 23-year-old credited his resurgence in 2025 to mental and tactical changes following a tough injury period.

Flavio has been training harder, trusting his father and embracing a renewed mindset. The effort has paid off, pushing him into the top-20 and making him a contender for notable titles in the future.

""Novak has been my idol since I started to play tennis. We played in Shanghai last year, and it was a disaster, as I lost 6-1, 6-2 in 45 minutes. I was nervous during that match, and I had more confidence when we met a few weeks ago at Wimbledon.

I believed in myself and tried to play my game and be happy on the court. It was one of my best matches ever. I did not win, but it's never easy against Novak at Majors.

I'm happy with my Wimbledon run and my results in 2025, especially after it started tight due to my injury. I changed my game and mind, and now I'm thrilled to compete at this stage.

I'm training harder than before and listening to what my coach says, which has led to improvements,"" Flavio Cobolli said.

Frances Tiafoe has always brought electric energy to the Tour, but the ATP Masters 1000 stage holds a special meaning for the American.

From partying in Madrid with footballing icons to dreaming of lifting the trophy in his girlfriend's hometown of Toronto, these tournaments blend competition with culture in a way that fuels his game. Tiafoe, who notably reached his first final at that level in Cincinnati last year, recently sat down with ATPTour.com to open up about his favourite ATP Masters 1000 memories.



What's your favourite ATP Masters 1000 host city and why? 

Madrid is fire, I love Madrid. I'm cool with some guys at Real Madrid, I like to hang out with those guys, that's cool. The food is great there, the people are so nice. Partying is fire, nightlife is great. The city itself is cool. I like places where you can walk around: There's a lot of good dining, there's a good energy around. Going to Real Madrid matches is nice.

What's your favourite match win at a Masters 1000? 

Against Rune to make the finals in Cincinnati last year, it was a crazy match. Obviously making my first final at a Masters series, that was big.

Tiafoe saves two match points vs. Rune to reach Cincinnati 2024 final:

Do you remember your main-draw debut at a Masters 1000 event? 

Yeah, I played Fritz! I just remember thinking: ‘What are the chances? We're both young, coming up'. He was actually doing well, in the Top 100, I was just outside. I was playing really well and I remember a lot more people thought he was going to win, and then I came out and won. I was pretty pumped.

Which Masters 1000 would you like to win the most? 

I would take any of them, but if I had to pick one, probably Toronto with my girl being from there. Toronto would be sick. Also any of the ones in the States, they would be great.

Do you have a dream opponent to beat in the final? 

Any of the best ones: Sinner, Alcaraz, Zverev, Nole [Djokovic]. In the final, you want to beat one of the best players in the world, no question. In Cincinnati, I played Sinner in the final. If you win that, you feel super fulfilled. You can't run away from the battle.

What's your favourite court at a Masters 1000? 

Indian Wells centre court, it's sick.

Were there any big Masters 1000 matches that stood out when you were younger?


Rafa-Novak, Madrid ‘09. Rafa was down match points, he hit a crazy forehand inside-in to save match point… It was an absolute war. That's one that stands out.

Any matches from recent times that have stood out? 

Alcaraz-Sinner, Miami 2023, the level they were playing at was just insane. One of my favourite all-time matches at a Masters 1000, right now, is actually an old school one: Kyrgios-Federer, Miami 2017. The level… Crazy.

The two have played twice. Both matches were this year, on hard courts at the Australian Open and Miami. Somewhat surprisingly, at least to me, Raducanu won in straight sets both times.I would have thought this matchup would favor Anisimova's superior baseline power, and that Raducanu's ground strokes would feed into Anisimova's. In reality, Raducanu has been the more proactive player of the two in both of their meetings, attacking Anisimova's second serves and using her speed to successfully counterpunch in rallies.I wondered how Anisimova would look after her double-bagel loss at Wimbledon, but she seemed fine in her Montreal opener. I also wondered if Raducanu would have a letdown after a hot week in D.C., but she looked good, too. Maybe the difference in this one will be motivation. No. 7 can't lose to No. 33 three times in one season, can she? Winner: Anisimova

'All my laps have been decent' - Norris fastest in both practice sessions

Aston Martin reserve driver Felipe Drugovich will take Fernando Alonso's place for the opening session at the Hungaroring.

Aston Martin have announced that Fernando Alonso is to sit out Friday's opening practice session for the Hungarian Grand Prix due to a muscular injury in his back.

Alonso was present at the Hungaroring for Thursday's media duties and pre-event preparations, some 22 years on from his maiden F1 victory around the Budapest venue.

However, with the first on-track session approaching, a statement from Aston Martin confirmed the Spaniard would play no part in FP1 due to a lingering injury.

Aston Martin's test and reserve driver, former F2 champion Felipe Drugovich, has been called up to take Alonso's spot for first practice, with further updates on the plan for the remainder of the weekend to follow.

“In the days following the Belgian Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso has been managing a muscular injury in his back,” read the team's note.

“As he continues with treatment this morning, he has chosen to sit out of FP1. Felipe Drugovich will drive in FP1 alongside Lance Stroll.

“A decision will then be made on Fernando's participation in FP2 and the remainder of the weekend in due course.”

In a later update issued between practice sessions, Aston Martin confirmed that Alonso would return to action for FP2.

'All my laps have been decent' - Norris fastest in both practice sessions

Lando Norris made it a clean sweep of Friday practice sessions by topping FP2 at the Hungaroring.

McLaren driver Lando Norris set the pace during Friday's second practice session for the Hungarian Grand Prix, leading the way from team mate Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, while Max Verstappen is set to take a trip to the stewards after a strange on-track moment.

Held in partly cloudy but warm conditions, FP2 offered drivers another chance to get a feel for the revamped Hungaroring circuit and fine-tune their set-ups, with cars quick to head out when the green light switched on at the end of the pit lane at 1700 local time.

That flurry included Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, who sat out FP1 to nurse a muscular injury in his back, and Gabriel Bortoleto, who had given his Kick Sauber car to Paul Aron for the former F2 racer's second Friday on loan from Alpine.

It did not take long for the first talking point to emerge, with Nico Hulkenberg running wide at Turn 12 and flicking some gravel onto the track – Haas driver Esteban Ocon and Alpine's Franco Colapinto both asking their teams to check for potential damage after running through it.

There was also an early moment for Piastri at Turn 4, where the McLaren challenger stepped out during the high-speed entry, while George Russell and Ollie Bearman got close to each other through Turn 9 as their early running converged.

Once all 20 drivers had got laps on the board, Norris held the provisional P1 spot with a time of 1m 16.525s on medium tyres, 0.172s clear of championship-leading team mate Piastri, and almost half a second faster than Leclerc's Ferrari.

Further back, Red Bull were enduring a difficult start to the session, with Yuki Tsunoda reporting over the radio that “the balance is so messy” and Verstappen lamenting problems at the “front and rear” – adding that “it's like driving on ice”.

As the halfway mark approached, teams gradually swapped their medium and hard rubber for softs to get some Qualifying simulations in, bringing another wave of purple and green sector times and giving a hint at what's to come on Saturday afternoon.

McLaren maintained their superiority across this phase, thanks to Norris producing a 1m 15.624s and Piastri clocking a 1m 15.915s – despite the former backing out of his first lap with a wide moment at Turn 2 and later going off at the final corner, and Piastri hitting a bunch of traffic.

Aston Martin drivers Lance Stroll and Alonso pulled out impressive-looking laps to end the session in fourth and fifth respectively, just behind Leclerc, while the other Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton rounded out the top-six places.

Russell was the fastest Mercedes driver in seventh, followed by Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar and Tsunoda, with team mate Kimi Antonelli completing the top-10 over Haas pair Bearman and Ocon and Hulkenberg's Sauber.

Verstappen finished the session all the way back in 14th position amid further balance complaints – the stewards also summoning him after a peculiar incident at Turn 3, where the Dutchman slowed his Red Bull to a crawling pace and appeared to throw a towel out of the cockpit.

Next up was Liam Lawson in the second Racing Bulls machine, taking 15th over Williams duo Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon and Sauber man Bortoleto, with Alpine drivers Pierre Gasly and Colapinto bringing up the rear of a field covered by 1.5 seconds.

Drivers and teams will now regroup in the Hungaroring paddock to dig through the data and prepare for Saturday's running – FP3 due to begin at 1230 local time and the all-important Qualifying session following at 1600.

Yuki Tsunoda's future at Red Bull is far from assured, but the Japanese racer's performance in Spa offered some encouraging signs.

""I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong to be honest. I have to look harder. It's really, really hard to find the reason for what I'm doing so wrong to drive this slow.""

That was Yuki Tsunoda after he finished last in the Austrian Grand Prix earlier this month. Up until that point, the Japanese racer had shown flashes of pace, like his P6 in the Miami Sprint, but his best finish for Red Bull in a Grand Prix  since stepping in for Liam Lawson from Suzuka onwards is P9.

In that same period, his team mate and reigning world champion Max Verstappen had secured two wins and two second places.

TECH TALK – Final updates before summer

'All my laps have been decent' - Norris fastest in both practice sessions

After a difficult run of races, Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli is hoping to get some confidence back at this weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix.

Kimi Antonelli has revealed that his Mercedes will be running the old suspension at this weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix as the teenager looks to rediscover his confidence following a difficult run of races.

After a decent start to his rookie campaign, Antonelli has faced a more challenging sequence of late, having recorded just one points finish – his maiden podium in Canada – across the last seven rounds.

Now, as F1 arrives at the Hungaroring for the final race before its traditional summer break, the 18-year-old is feeling in a good mindset as he tries to end the first half of the season on a positive note.

Explaining how he has spent his time since last weekend's Belgian Grand Prix – a race that he finished down in 16th place – Antonelli said: “I definitely tried to rest and reflect on the previous races, and trying to understand where I could have done better and how.

“But also, I took time for myself. I did fun activities such as driving my remote control car, and all activities that help the mindset and help to get back even stronger on the track.

“I've definitely been also trying to prepare for the weekend in the best way possible, and now I feel happy. I'm really happy to be here and I'm ready to give my best before heading to the summer break.”

Following a tough Qualifying at Spa-Francorchamps, Antonelli is hoping for a better Saturday this weekend after Mercedes opted to revert to the suspension previously used on the car.

Pushed on his realistic expectations for the session, the Italian responded: “First of all, we're going back on the old suspension, so hopefully it will bring the good feeling back, and the goal is really to deliver a good Qualifying and try to drive at my best.”

Antonelli went on to explain why the change to the W16 contributed to his loss of confidence across recent races.

“Since we went on the new suspension, the car was a bit trickier to drive, especially on tracks where there was high-speed context, so high-speed corners, high-speed combined,” the Silver Arrows driver reflected.

“Also, because of my driving style, I was making the car even more unpredictable, and that killed a bit my confidence.

“I struggled to adapt as well a little bit to the car, and that is why I couldn't extract the best out of it. George [Russell], I think, with his experience, he adapted much quicker and better, and he was able to extract each weekend the maximum out of the car.

“It's something I've been really trying to do, that I've been struggling with, but hopefully, going back to the old suspension, it will bring back that feeling that I had prior to the European season.”

On the other side of the garage, Russell also acknowledged ahead of the upcoming weekend in Hungary that the squad have been trying to understand what has contributed to their step back in performance during the last few weekends.

“Clearly, our performance as a team has gone backwards in the last six or seven races, and we're trying to unpick why that may have been,” said Russell. “I think there's a number of factors at play.

“Obviously, we struggle in the hotter conditions – Spa wasn't hot, but generally we struggle in the hotter conditions. We brought some things with updates, and we think that may not have been performing as we had hoped, so we'll revert back on some small items.

“I think we potentially just lost our way slightly, so we're going to go back to basics, focus on the main parts of the car, and see where that takes us.”

Sharing more detail about the challenges of driving the car during recent race weekends – and on Antonelli's loss of confidence – Russell added: “Without doubt, it has been harder to drive in these last races than it was at the start of the season.

“But when you look at our performance collectively, we've just both gone backwards. Kimi had an unfortunate weekend in Spa, but his pace, if anything, was closer to me than it was in races at the start of the year.

“The difference was that at the start of the season, I was qualifying second or third or pole in Canada, and Kimi was in fourth, fifth or sixth. Whereas now, I'm qualifying in sixth, seventh or sometimes out in Q2.

“We're closer to the midfield, so I don't think he has anything really to worry about, and it's just a bad run of form for us.”

Lando Norris completed a clean sweep of practice sessions on Friday at the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Lando Norris ended Friday Practice at the top of the timesheets, completing a clean sweep on Friday at the Hungarian Grand Prix.

The top three positions remained unchanged from the opening session of the weekend, with Norris leading McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri by 0.291s, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in third place.

After sitting out FP1 with a muscular injury in his back, Fernando Alonso returned to action in FP2 and rounded out the top five, with Lance Stroll fourth in the sister Aston Martin.

But Red Bull face a busy evening, with neither Yuki Tsunoda nor Max Verstappen happy with the performance of the RB21 - Tsunoda the faster driver as the pair finished in ninth and 14th places respectively.

'All my laps have been decent' - Norris fastest in both practice sessions

Kimi Antonelli and team mate George Russell enjoyed a positive Friday with Mercedes ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Kimi Antonelli has claimed he is ""getting the confidence back"" with his Mercedes car after a positive Friday for the team ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend.

The Italian rookie has endured a difficult spell recently in his maiden Formula 1 campaign, which has included just one points finish in the last seven races and he failed to make it beyond the first segment of Qualifying for both the Sprint and Grand Prix last time out in Belgium.

Mercedes has reverted to an older specification of suspension for the race in Budapest, with the change seemingly producing an upturn in form for Antonelli as he claimed seventh ahead of team mate George Russell in FP1, before finishing 10th fastest later in the afternoon.

""Today was nice. I'm pretty happy because I'm getting the confidence back with the car,"" said the 18-year-old.

""Still missing a little bit to the guys in front but I think we're working well, we've been changing the car a lot because obviously it felt like a big step with the old suspension.

""The car was completely different and we're just trying to rebalance the car. Long run was good in FP2, just the soft I had a bit of traffic last sector and the lap was not super clean but good feelings ahead of tomorrow.""

Russell claimed seventh in the second session and was also pleased with the step that the Silver Arrows had made after struggling in Belgium.

But the Briton claimed that they still lacked pace compared with the leading teams on the grid and that more work was needed ahead of Sunday's 70-lap race.

""It always feels good when you're a bit higher up the leaderboard,"" said the 27-year-old, who has taken one win this season in Canada.

""Bit of a strange day, obviously the Aston Martins looked unusually fast today, they seemed to make a decent step forward. McLaren are obviously in a league of their own.

""We just need to find that last little bit for it to start clicking again for us. Today it wasn't a breakthrough but it wasn't like we were expecting it to be a breakthrough. We've just to keep on chipping away.""

'All my laps have been decent' - Norris fastest in both practice sessions

After Lewis Hamilton's charge from the pit lane to P7 in Belgium, we take a look at why drivers sometimes start from the pit lane, and how they can turn a setback into a brilliant comeback...

It had been a tough and eventful weekend for Lewis Hamilton in Belgium by the time the Grand Prix was due to get underway on Sunday. The latest instance of misfortune was during Saturday's Qualifying session, when the Ferrari driver was knocked out of Q1 after his lap time was deleted for going off the circuit.

Due to start P16 on the grid for the Grand Prix, Ferrari opted to make a change to the number 44 car post-Qualifying, meaning Hamilton  would have to start from the pit lane. However, with masterful overtakes in the wet, and perfectly timed strategy to change from intermediate to medium tyres on Lap 11, Hamilton finished an impressive P7 to end the arduous weekend on a high.

Starting from the pit lane, the very back of the pack, is often a frustrating position to be in for teams and drivers. However, sometimes this can provide the seeds for tactical masterclasses and mind-blowing moves up the order. That's exactly what Hamilton showed us in Belgium.

Here's a breakdown of everything you need to know about pit lane starts, why they happen, and most importantly, how a driver can make the most of one to move through the field...

Simply put, a pit lane start is when a driver does not line up on the grid for the start of the race along with the rest of the field. Instead, they start from the pit lane – which is usually alongside the start/finish straight.

Cars starting from the pit lane can join the track once the race has started and the entire field has passed by the end of the pit lane.

Starting from the pit lane does not mean a driver can set off at the same time as those on the grid. After the lights go out to start the race, the driver remains idle at the end of the pit lane until after the last car on the grid has passed by the pit exit after the start of the race. The driver is then indicated to join the track by the green light appearing at the pit exit, and their race can begin.

Starting from the pit lane tends to be either an enforced or tactical decision, often resulting from rule violations or strategic gambles...

The most common reason for a pit lane start is due to a rule-breaking change to the car whilst in “parc fermé” conditions. At the start of Qualifying on Saturday, all cars enter 'parc fermé' (French for 'closed park') conditions, a period where teams cannot make major set up changes without receiving a penalty.

If a team makes unauthorised changes to one (or both) of the cars under parc fermé conditions (such as altering suspension, rear wing, or floor settings), the driver(s) must start the race from the pit lane.

Power unit or gearbox penalties

Similarly, the sporting regulations limit the number of engine and gearbox components each driver can use per season. Exceeding these limits will automatically trigger grid penalties, sending the driver further back on the grid from where they had originally qualified.

If penalties mean starting towards the back of the grid anyway, sometimes teams will opt for a pit lane start so they can made additional set-up changes to the car.

Damage in qualifying

If a car is heavily damaged in Qualifying from a crash and cannot be repaired in time ahead of Sunday morning's scrutineering, teams may need to continue to fix and modify the car overnight, forcing a pit lane start.

Formation lap issues

If a driver has a delayed formation lap (due to stalling the car for example) and cannot make it to the starting order in time, the driver must enter the pit lane and complete a pit lane start.

Starting behind the rest of the grid means a driver must successfully navigate through backmarkers and the midfield if they're to score points. Drivers negotiating a pit lane start need to pass cars early on where possible or risk their competitors pulling away.

Starters from the pit lane can face strategy constraints for their race. Teams might need to use different tyre strategies, or even gamble on factors outside their control, such as a Safety Car intervention or drastic weather changes.

However, starting in the pit lane can also be an opportunity to reset post-Qualifying and fine-tune the car specifically for the race. Teams usually head into each race weekend having to balance the set-up of the car to get the most performance in both Qualifying and the Grand Prix. There can often be a trade-off between different set-up preferences.

Despite starting behind the other competitors and facing the challenge of new strategies, some drivers and teams have been able to turn the ‘disadvantage' of pit lane starts into some magical on-track moments...

Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) - Abu Dhabi 2012

After originally qualifying third around the Yas Marina Circuit, championship leader Sebastian Vettel was disqualified from Qualifying due to officials being unable to extract a one-litre fuel sample required for analysis. The stewards allowed Vettel to start the race from last place on the grid, but Red Bull opted to make set-up changes to his gearbox, suspension, and aerodynamics (to help with overtaking) before the race. This violated parc fermé conditions, leading to the German having to start from the pit lane.

The race was chaotic, with a number of cars making contact (including Vettel himself!), causing multiple retirements, and Safety Car deployments. These instances - along with his skilful driving and the set-up changes made ahead of the race - helped the Red Bull racer through the field to a podium position in P3. It was a fantastic recovery drive to secure much needed points. With just two races of the season left, the result was pivotal in Vettel securing the hotly contested Drivers' Championship that season.

Sergio Perez (Red Bull) - Australia 2023

Sergio Perez was unable to set a lap time in Qualifying down under after getting beached in the gravel during Q1, but was later given permission by the stewards to start the race at the back of the grid. Instead, Red Bull decided to make some alterations to Perez's car whilst in parc fermé conditions and he therefore had to start from the pit lane.

After making up some positions within the first lap of the Grand Prix, the race was soon red-flagged due to debris on the track that needed to be cleared. With another two red flags and a Virtual Safety Car, Perez moved up the order to finish an impressive P5 and hold on to second place in the Drivers' Championship.

Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) - Monaco 2010

With its tight and winding roads, crashes are not uncommon around the streets of Monaco, as Fernando Alonso illustrated in 2010 during third practice. After the session, his team at Ferrari judged the damage to his car to be too extensive to repair in time for qualification. This forced the Spaniard to revert to a spare chassis and start from the pit lane for the Grand Prix.

With overtaking so difficult, pit stop timing is crucial in Monaco. So, when a Safety Car was deployed on the first lap, Ferrari made the call to bring in Alonso for his mandatory pit stop in the hope he would gain track position later on. Managing some impressive overtakes in the process, the undercut ultimately worked fantastically, and Alonso finished a commendable P6.

The 'Peaky Blinders' creator is also known for 'Spencer' and Jason Momoa's 'See.'


							By 

	Aaron Couch


Film Editor


Steven Knight is the latest bold faced name to join the James Bond creative team.


	Knight will write the script for filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, who is directing the next 007 film for Amazon MGM Studios and producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman.




	Knight's hiring marks an end of an era for the Bond franchise, at least in terms of its writers. Actor Daniel Craig said goodbye to the character with 2021's No Time To Die, which also was the last Bond movie to be shaped by longtime scribes Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who worked on the franchise beginning with 1999's The World Is Not Enough.

	Knight is a respected scribe, who is working on a Peaky Blinders film and whose past work includes the 2002, feature Dirty Pretty Things, for which he earned an original screenplay Oscar nomination, Eastern Promises and Spencer, as well as creating the Jason Momoa Apple series See.


	His lengthy list of TV credits also include Taboo, Rogue Heroes, A Thousand Blows, This Town, The Veil  and All the Light We Cannot See. On the film side, he's written projects ranging from Tom Hardy's Locke to a stint writing Daisy Ridley's upcoming Star Wars movie, before exiting.


	This next Bond movie will be the first without longtime franchise stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, who in February reached a deal to allow Amazon creative control over the franchise.  


	Knight is repped by CAA, United Agents and Davis Law Group.

The recently signed tax cut and budget bill took back $1.1 billion in previously approved funds.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which directs federal funds to local public TV and radio stations, says it will shut down after having those federal dollars taken away.


	The decision comes a few weeks after Congress passed a bill that included Trump administration priorities of tax cuts, cuts to Medicaid, increased spending for defense and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, among many other things. The bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4, also included the rescission of $1.1 billion in previously approved funding for CPB.

	The CPB said on Friday that it will lay off the majority of its staff by the end of its fiscal year on Sept. 30, with a “small transition team” remaining through January 2026 to finish winding down operations and ensuring final distribution of CPB funds to local stations.


	“Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,” CPB president and CEO Patricia Harrison said in a statement. “CPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care.


	“Public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country. We are deeply grateful to our partners across the system for their resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication to serving the American people.”

	











	Money from the CPB has provided partial funding to PBS TV stations and National Public Radio outlets, though the majority of most stations' budgets come from donations and corporate grants. It is the largest single source of funding for research, technology and program development for public radio and TV stations. CPB also funds documentary filmmakers through ITVS.


	“These cuts will significantly impact all of our stations, but will be especially devastating to smaller stations and those serving large rural areas,” PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger said in July. “Many of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead.”

The vice president weighed in on controversy surrounding the actor's viral denim marketing campaign. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	JD Vance is sounding off about the somehow-still-going controversy surrounding Sydney Sweeney‘s American Eagle jeans ad. 


	The vice president appeared on Friday's episode of the Ruthless podcast — a new discussion program hosted by Republican staffers — and was asked about the uproar over the Euphoria star's sultry ad, which makes a play on words comparing the sex symbol's “genes” with the word “jeans.” The ad has been slammed by some online as a Nazi-like pro-eugenics racist propaganda, while others have cheered the company and actress for refusing to apologize in the wake of social media outrage, which many view as a bad-faith take on something that's meant to be playful.

					Doja Cat Mocks Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle Ad Amid ""Genes"" Versus ""Jeans"" Controversy		
			









	“My political advice to the Democrats is continue to tell everybody who thinks Sydney Sweeney is attractive is a Nazi,” he said. “That appears to be their actual strategy. I mean, it actually reveals something pretty interesting about the Dems though, which is that you have a normal all-American beautiful girl doing like a normal jeans ad. They're trying to sell jeans to kids in America and they have managed to so unhinge themselves over this thing. And it's like, you guys, did you learn nothing from the November 2024 election?” 


	Concluded Vance: “I actually thought that one of the lessons they might take is ‘we're going to be less crazy.' And the lesson they have apparently taken is we're going to attack people as Nazis for thinking Sydney Sweeney is beautiful. Great strategy, guys! That's how you're going to win the midterm! Especially [with] young American men. So much of the Democrats is oriented around hostility to basic American life. So you have a pretty girl doing a jeans ad and they can't help but freak out. It reveals a lot more about them than it does us.” 

	











	While Vance's comments were targeted towards Democratic leaders who want to win the midterm elections, CNN noted in its coverage, “No prominent Democratic Party leaders or officials have commented on the ad.” So it seem like Vance is taking generic progressive online uproar and trying to attach it to elected officials who haven't actually said such things.   


	Earlier this week, The Late Show host Stephen Colbert also weighed in on the ad, with comments that suggested people protesting the ad might have overstepped a bit. 


	“I don't want to alarm you, but the internet is mad about something,” Colbert said. “This time, it's a commercial from American Eagle Outfitters starring Sydney Sweeney … Just like Sydney Sweeney, I also carry the gene for sexy commercial scratchy voice. I get it from my uncle on my mother's side … Now, some people look at this and they're seeing something sinister, saying that the genes-jeans denim wordplay in an ad featuring a white blond woman means American Eagle could be promoting eugenics, white supremacy and Nazi propaganda. That might be a bit of an overreaction — although Hitler did briefly model for Mein Kampfort Fit Jeans.” Colbert added: “How do you say ‘badonk' in German?”


	Neither American Eagle nor Sweeney have commented on the backlash.

The release of the beloved ""Like a Virgin"" track is dedicated to the memory of Barbie doll designers and Madonna superfans Mario Paglino and Gianni Grossi, who died this week.

Madonna continues to be in a reflective, dance floor-ready mood. A week after finally dropping the long-rumored Ray of Light remix album Veronica Electronica, the singer was back in the groove on Friday morning (Aug. 1) with a 40th anniversary celebration of her beloved Like a Virgin single “Dress You Up.”

	The final single from the diamond-certified 1985 album is bundled in a three-song digital drop featuring a bouncy official remix and a nearly six-minute “12” Formal Mix” that includes an funky, extended bass-slapping, bell-ringing midsection of the song produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, who also plays iconic chicken scratch guitar on the track. The final version is a four-and-a-half minute “Casual Instrumental Mix” that strips away the vocals to focus on the song's insistent, hypnotic melody.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Nancy Meyers' beloved movie The Holiday is getting a TV treatment. Apple TV+ has in the works a limited series adaptation of the 2006 romantic comedy, which starred Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law and Jack Black, sources tell Deadline. It reboots the premise of the film with new characters.


	Krissie Ducker (Sweetpea) is writer/executive producer for The Holiday series, produced by Left Bank Pictures, with Rob Delaney (Catastrophe) also brought on as a writer. Meyers has no involvement in the project, I hear. 


	The limited series keeps the setup of the movie about a single American and single British woman living very different lives who swap their houses for the holidays and find love in the process.

	Search is underway for well-known actresses to play the leads, with the first offers sent out on both sides of the Atlantic. If/when stars are locked in, the limited series, which comes from Apple TV+'s UK team, is expected to get a green light.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The 2006 movie, written, directed and produced by Meyers, revolved around Amanda (Diaz), a Los Angeles movie trailer company owner, and Iris, a London newspaper columnist who exchange their houses on a whim after each suffers a heartbreak. Amanda meets Iris' widower brother (Law) while Iris meets an associate of Amanda's, a film composer (Black). 


	Released during the 2006 holiday season, The Holiday was a box-office success and, almost two decades later, it remains a Christmas staple (despite Meyers never intending for it to be a Christmas movie). 

	











	Actor-writer Delaney co-created and starred with Sharon Horgan on the acclaimed Channel 4 comedy series Catastrophe. This marks his return to Apple TV+ where he starred in Season 1 of Bad Monkey. He was most recently seen in the FX limited series Dying For Sex and the movie Deadpool & Wolverine. 


	Ducker, who worked as a writers assistant on Catastrophe, has served as writer/co-executive producer on Sweetpea and writer/executive producer on The Assassin.

EXCLUSIVE: The big-eared, noise-sensitive aliens are invading Earth again with John Krasinski announcing A Quiet Place Part III, which is scheduled to hit theaters on July 9, 2027.


	The fourt-time Primetime Emmy-nominated multi-hyphenate just revealed the news on social media that he's back to direct, write and produce the fourth film in the Paramount series. No cast is confirmed at this time, with the story being kept secret.


	Krasinski and Allyson Seeger's Sunday Night Productions are producing with Platinum Dunes. Sunday Night has a first-look deal with the studio.


	The A Quiet Place franchise has grossed over $900 million worldwide across its three films, which is comprised of John Krasinski's A Quiet Place and A Quiet Place Part II, and the Michael Sarnoski-directed spinoff A Quiet Place: Day One.

	The first A Quiet Place took off like a rocketship at SXSW in 2018, leading to an overindexing $50.2 million opening weekend, and a near $153M domestic and $341M global take. The pic, which starred Krasinski, wife Emily Blunt, Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds, received an Oscar nomination for Sound Editing.


A Quiet Place Part II, which saw its release pushed due to Covid, brought the box office back alive during Memorial Day weekend 2021 with a $57M four-day start, ending with a $160M domestic and $297.3M global haul. Blunt, Jupe and Simmonds returned for the sequel, which nabbed a BAFTA nomination for Best Sound.


	Last summer, A Quiet Place: Day One, a prequel set in an apocalyptic New York City ravaged by the aliens and starring Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn, debuted to $52.2M and legged out to $139M domestic and $262M global.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","JD Vance wants people to keep talking about Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle ad","https://www.avclub.com/jd-vance-sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad","Fri, 01 Aug 2025 16:20:00 GMT","

JD Vance is a big fan of Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle campaign. At this point, we've likely all seen it—as well as the wave of backlash it received almost immediately after it was released. In one ad, Sweeney zips up a pair of jeans and, in a tone that's meant to be seductive but seems a bit more like she's getting over a cold, says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring… My jeans are blue.” In another, she stands in front of a billboard that reads, “Sydney Sweeney has great genes,” but the word “genes” is crossed out and replaced with “jeans.”

Some people on the internet were not happy with the campaign. Or, in Vance's words on a recent episode of the right-leaning Ruthless podcast (via Variety), “My political advice to the Democrats is continue to tell everybody who thinks Sydney Sweeney is attractive is a Nazi… That appears to be their actual strategy.” The thing is, the people Vance are mocking don't hold any governmental power at all. According to CNN, “no prominent Democratic Party leaders or officials have commented on the ad,” at least as of this writing.

Non-elected critics of the campaign have claimed that there are eugenicist undertones to the ad's focus on Sweeney's genes. People have also decried its apparent male-focused marketing and characterized it as a white supremecist dog whistle that holds up Sweeney's white skin and blonde hair as a beauty ideal. This view is, unsurprisingly, a little too socially conscious for Vance, who couldn't help but use it as an example of Democrats' “hostility to basic American life.” 

“I actually thought that one of the lessons [Democrats] might take is we're going to be less crazy. And the lesson they have apparently taken is we're going to attack people as Nazis for thinking Sydney Sweeney is beautiful,” the vice president continued. “Great strategy, guys. That's how you're going to win the midterm, especially young American men.”

While he, again, isn't a Democratic party leader, Stephen Colbert did touch on the controversy a bit in a monologue earlier this week. While he said the backlash “might be a bit of an overreaction,” he mostly used the segment to poke fun at Donald Trump Jr., who responded to the controversy by posting an AI picture of his dad in the same outfit as Sweeney on Instagram, along with the caption, “Um, Donald is so hot right now!!!”

“Let me get this straight, Don Jr.. You look at Sydney Sweeney, and your first thought is, ‘She's hot like my dad'?” Colbert riffed. Now that's something we can keep talking about.

Okay, Mandy Moore just gave us all the family vibes with a new beach photo that's equal parts adorable and chill. She's rocking a swimsuit alongside her husband Taylor Goldsmith and their three kids (August “Gus,” 4, Oscar “Ozzie,” 2, and Louise, 10 months) looking like the ultimate squad goals. It seems like the kind of family snapshot that's totally real; no fuss, just good times and sun-soaked memories.

A post shared by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm)

The whole gang is clearly having a blast if the photo slideshow above is anything to go by. But what about Mandy's caption? Well, it gives a shoutout to her friend Gaby, making it clear this trip wasn't just about beach days but hanging with some of her closest pals too. She also calls out the Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita, saying “What an epic few days… we can't wait to come back.” And apparently, little Gus hasn't stopped talking about the trip, so you know it was epic.

It seems like Mandy and Taylor are nailing that tricky balance of parenting three kids while still making time to relax and have fun. Honestly, it's the kind of family vibe that's equal parts chaotic and heartwarming; and we're here for it.

Back in 2024, after the birth of their third child Mandy even told Today, she was “Endlessly grateful for our family of 5 (and our very own big three) and soaking in every moment of this special time.”

What makes these photos stand out isn't just the sunshine or the happiness; it's how real it feels. Mandy's family pictures always have this easygoing, no-frills energy that's a nice break from the usual polished celeb shots. It seems like she's really owning the ups and downs of family life, and honestly, it's refreshing to see someone so famous just enjoying the everyday moments with their kids.

“Being a mom is the single greatest gift of my life and while you're never off the clock worrying or stressing or planning, the quiet, unmistakable joy triumphs over everything else,” the actress told People earlier this year.

“I'm endlessly grateful to the moms in my life who model what it takes, lend an ear, make the best suggestions, and generally make me feel less alone on the journey,” she explained.

And if this pic has you wishing you were at the beach too, we feel you too. Because sometimes, all you really need is good company, sandy toes, and a little sunshine.

Just as early 2000s films “Freaky Friday,” “The Devil Wears Prada,” “Bend It Like Beckham,” and “The Princess Diaries” are receiving franchise sequels, Nancy Meyers' beloved “The Holiday” is getting the TV treatment.

Yes, the 2006 film “The Holiday” is being reimagined by “Catastrophe” co-creator Rob Delaney and “Sweetpea” writer/co-executive producer Krissie Ducker for Apple TV+. The duo previously worked together on “Catastrophe,” as Ducker was a writers' assistant on the series.

Deadline first reported the project, and cited that “The Holiday” writer/director/producer Meyers “has no involvement” in the revival limited series. The show will also center on different characters than the film did, with a casting search underway.

“The Holiday” originally centered on Los Angeles-based movie marketing executive Amanda (Cameron Diaz), who swaps homes with Iris (Kate Winslet), a London newspaper columnist. Both women ease their heartbreak with new men on opposite sides of the world: Amanda finds love with Iris' brother (Jude Law) while Iris connects with a film composer (Jack Black). The film takes place in December, making it a de facto Christmas movie. As Deadline cited, the series will “reboot the premise of the film with new characters.”

 










“The Holiday” was rumored for a sequel in 2022. The Sun falsely reported from an unnamed source that production would be starting in early 2023 with the original cast. However, Meyers shut down the claim at the time. “So many DM's about this,” Meyers captioned on Instagram. “Sorry but it's not true.”

Actress Winslet's representative further confirmed to IndieWire that no plans for a “The Holiday” sequel were in the works at the time. Winslet told People magazine of the rumored film, “I read something about that, but it's the first I've heard of it. I promise you, not an agent or a representative or anyone from the first one around has had any conversation with me about that. Hand on heart, that's never come up.”

Her co-star Law later shared how “The Holiday” is one of his most enduring films. “They asked the audience who has seen ‘The Holiday' or who watches it every year,” Law said during a career tribute at the 2024 Mill Valley Film Festival. “Ninety percent of the audience put their hand up. It's a delightful thing what this movie has become.”

							By 

	Michael Embrich



	President Donald Trump's administration keeps denying that the Department of Veteran Affairs is headed toward privatization — just like it couldn't stop denying that mass layoffs of 80,000 employees wouldn't impact veteran care. But facts have a way of catching up. 


	After intense pressure from veterans' groups and Congress, the administration was forced to walk back its plan — cutting 30,000 jobs instead. Already, though, the VA has lost thousands of health care staff since January — including 688 physicians and 1,882 registered nurses — while still claiming its services remain unaffected.


	The budget numbers don't lie — even if Trump and Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins do. 


	This year, the Trump administration requested a record-breaking $441 billion VA budget for fiscal year 2026. That's a 10 percent increase over last year and, in theory, should be good news for veterans and the people who care for them. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Yet, buried in the fine print is a deeply concerning contradiction: Even with the budget expansion, the VA plans to eliminate nearly 3,000 jobs, including over 2,000 from the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), which handles disability claims, education benefits, and more.

	











	In other words, the VA is spending more money — just not on the people who keep the system running. Some are forced to work out of closets due to untenable working environments, while others are being overworked or incentivized to find work elsewhere. 

	











	While the administration claims it's focused on “eliminating waste” and “empowering local leaders,” in reality, it is hollowing out the VA's internal capacity. VA staff are being stretched thin, even as more veterans enter the system. 


	Instead of hiring more nurses, claims processors, or crisis responders, the administration is pushing billions of dollars into the private sector via expanded community care programs. This seems less like reform, and more like privatization by attrition.

	In the House of Representatives, where the Veterans Affairs Committee advanced the Veterans' ACCESS Act, the path toward privatizing veterans' health care becomes clearer. Framed as a way to reduce wait times and empower veterans through online self-scheduling, the bill would expand veterans' ability to seek care outside the VA system. 


	No one denies that veterans deserve choices in their health care. But choice without access to quality, specialized care isn't really a choice at all. Long-term cuts to Medicaid — totaling more than $1 trillion — will inevitably force the closure of many rural hospitals that veterans depend on. And with a hollowed-out or dismantled VA system, these veterans will be left sicker, poorer, and without access to the care they've earned.


	The VA's own internal analysis, the “Red Team” report from May 2024, has been removed from the VA.gov website. It warned that rising costs of private-sector care — $30 billion in FY2023 alone — are threatening to “materially erode the VA's direct-care system.” This erosion isn't hypothetical. It's happening. Staffing shortages are so severe that 82 percent of VA facilities report critical nurse vacancies — and now even more jobs are being cut.

	Rather than fix the staffing crisis, the Trump administration is shifting resources away from VA hospitals and clinics and into for-profit care. For example, funding for in-house VA medical services is being cut by 17.4 percent, even as the Community Care budget jumps 50.7 percent. What message does that send?


Combined with cuts to food assistance that many veterans rely on, reductions in federal agency staffing where one in three employees is a veteran, cuts to housing programs that prevent veteran homelessness, and deep cuts to Medicaid — on which over a million veterans depend — it has never been more clear: Trump and the GOP hate taking care of the veterans.

Donald Trump has heralded a “Golden Age” of the United States, and he's determined to do whatever it takes to project a gilded image — including cleansing the government of anyone who dares report the reality of what his policies are doing to the economy.


	The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday that job growth had stagnated throughout the country in the month of July. The economy only added 73,000 new jobs last month, far less than expected. Meanwhile, unemployment rose to 4.2 percent, and the job growth estimates for May and June were revised down by a combined 258,000 jobs. 


	Trump is not happy that the job market is slowing, and rather than consider that his flailing, impulsive economic policies and on-again, off-again tariffs might be part of the problem, the president has fired the commissioner of Bureau of Labor Statistics, which released the report.


	“I was just informed that our Country's ‘Jobs Numbers' are being produced by a Biden Appointee, Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, who faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory,” Trump alleged baselessly on Truth Social, hours after the numbers were released.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,” the president added.

	











	NBC News reported shortly after Trump's post that McEntarfer was indeed fired from her post. The Senate confirmed McEntarfer in 2024 by a vote of 86-8. CNN's Phil Mattingly notes that Vice President J.D. Vance, then a senator from Ohio, was among those who favored her appointment.


	Trump continued to insist on Truth Social that the economy is “BOOMING under ‘TRUMP,'” despite his accusations of sabotage against the Federal Reserve, which refuses to lower interest rates at Trump's direction.

	“Jerome ‘Too Late' Powell should also be put ‘out to pasture,'” Trump wrote of the chairman of the Fed, who he has been suggesting should be fired for months. He continued to bash Powell in another post conspiracy theorizing about the jobs numbers later on Friday.

	“In my opinion, today's Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad,” he wrote. “Just like when they had three great days around the 2024 Presidential Election, and then, those numbers were ‘taken away' on November 15, 2024, right after the Election, when the Jobs Numbers were massively revised DOWNWARD, making a correction of over 818,000 Jobs — A TOTAL SCAM. Jerome “Too Late” Powell is no better! But, the good news is, our Country is doing GREAT!”


	Trump has been dragging the nation into the pits of authoritarianism for years now, but to have the president fire the head of an independent agency for reporting statistics that don't conform to his delusions is another step into an abyss the nation is going to have a hard time pulling itself out of.

The Warrens were never boring: the married team of a demonologist and psychic arguably did more to bring belief in the demonic back into the public eye than anyone else in the 20th century. They did it by making themselves accessible academically, to the media, and most importantly, helping folks out of impossible situations where the supernatural had curbstomped all other hopes of freedom. The reality of what they accomplished during their lifetime is impressive. But Hollywood went and gussied it up, nonetheless. The Conjuring movies have been all about the Warren's relationship. But, they've also been all up in the jump scares, gore, and crazy supernatural set pieces. It makes for good entertainment. 

In the fourth installment of The Conjuring films, the husband and wife demon hunters, played by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, come up against an old enemy that knows them too well for comfort. You'll be able to see how it plays out on September 5th.

It's been over a year since Psychic Fever from Exile Tribe dropped their hit song Just Like Dat, and AsiaOne recently caught up with the Japanese boy band to find out how their journey has been since.

The Just Like Dat music video, which premiered in January 2024, has amassed over 20 million views on YouTube and youngest member Weesa, 21, said they didn't expect the virality.

""It made us happy to see it create buzz on social media platforms like TikTok. When we went overseas, we were really happy fans could sing along to our song,"" he added.

The song was well-received internationally and on TikTok, netizens covered the song under the hashtag #JustLikeDatChallenge.

 

@psyfe_official #JustLikeDatChallenge #JustLikeDat 🙌 #PSYCHICFEVER #99_9_Psychic_Radio #99_9MHz ♬ Just Like Dat feat. JP THE WAVY - PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE

 

Formed in 2019, the seven-member group - consisting of Tsurugi, Ryoga Nakanishi, Ren Watanabe, Jimmy, Kokoro Kohatsu, Ryushin Handa and Weesa - had a few pre-debut releases before their official debut in July 2022 with the album P.C.F.

Ryoga, 27, recalled how they spent six months training in Thailand right after their debut.

""We faced many challenges there but it was a valuable experience for us. We learned a lot of things which helped us go global,"" he said.

J-pop has been having a resurgence of sorts in recent years, and when asked how they felt being part of this new wave, Kokoro, who turns 25 in November, added how they debuted with the main goal of going global.

Now that they have - the group has toured Asia, Europe and the US the past year - he said they hope to become a leading music group while preserving their individual styles.

The group recently released their EP Psychic File III, and while the title track Gelato is a catchy summer tune, it's only a peek at what Psychic Fever has to offer.

""In this EP we have four songs and each one is in a different genre, so I think it can be enjoyed by people of all ages,"" said Ryushin, who turns 24 in Deccember.

The song he recommends? Reflection.

""It has our usual style but also a different way of expression. Please pay attention to the lyrics and choreography as well,"" he added.

Meanwhile, Tsurugi's pick is Evolve.

""When you listen to this track, you can really feel the energy we bring to our live shows. More than anything, it excites me everytime I hear it, so it's definitely one of my favourite songs,"" said the 28-year-old.

Having spent so much time touring the past year, we wanted to know what they've learnt about each other.

The question though, was met with seven loading buttons.

At one point, Ren, 25, seemed to be thinking up an answer and after a few minutes of the members waiting for his thoughts, he gave up and facepalmed.

Ever-so-motherly Ryoga stepped up with a response: ""We spent a lot of time together during our US tour and I got to see who wakes up the earliest and how a member eats their breakfast.

""Through spending more time together, I was able to see how they motivate themselves for the live shows.""

When there's a mix of introverts and extroverts in the group, one person would usually take the lead and initiative. For Psychic Fever, that's 25-year-old Jimmy.

""He's usually the one who does research about the places we want to go to,"" shared Ryoga.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Milwaukee man who killed a 19-year-old college student on their first date and spread her body parts around the area was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

A jury convicted Maxwell Anderson in June of first-degree intentional homicide, mutilating a corpse, arson and hiding a corpse in connection with Sade Robinson's death last year. He maintained his innocence throughout the trial.

During a sentencing hearing that was by turns somber, emotional and horrifying, Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Laura Crivello repeatedly questioned how Anderson could commit such a heinous crime. Prosecutors related details of how Anderson cut up Robinson's body and dumped one of her legs near a playground.

Robinson's mother, Sheena Scarbrough, said Anderson “messed the entire community up” and deserves no protection in prison. 

“Judge, I'm asking this demon be respectfully returned back to hell as soon as possible,” Scarbrough said. 

Robinson's father, Carlos Robinson, suggested to the judge that someone dismember Anderson.

“Everything that he did should be done to him,” he said. “No man should be able to live after what he did. That's just how I feel. I can't get past this. I can't.”




First-degree intentional homicide in Wisconsin carries a mandatory life sentence. The only question for Anderson was whether the judge would allow him to seek parole.

Anderson's attorney, Tony Cotton, asked the judge to make Anderson eligible for parole after 25 years. He argued that Anderson served in the U.S. Navy and suffers from obvious mental health issues. 

Cotton acknowledged that Anderson has been convicted of multiple misdemeanor disorderly conduct counts in connection with domestic violence but they're not significant offenses compared to most homicide defendants. He added that he has concerns about Anderson's safety in prison.

“That is a real consideration,” Cotton said. “At the end of the day, there is not mob justice in this country.”

Anderson told the judge that he's innocent and plans to appeal his convictions. He didn't elaborate, although Crivello later noted that Anderson had told an investigator that some stranger must have kidnapped Robinson after she left his apartment following their date.

“I hope true justice will be delivered,” Anderson said Friday.

Crivello refused to offer Anderson a chance at parole. She dismissed Anderson's claims of innocence, saying his view of reality “differs from the rest of the world.” Trailing off at times and shaking her head, she said he's irredeemable, called his crimes “unconscionable” and likened the case to something out of a horror novel.

“It's beyond imaginable to not know whether your child is dead or alive, and then learn they're dismembered and disgraced, is beyond understanding,” she said. 

She also sentenced Anderson to 7 1/2 years on the dismemberment count and a year and a half on the arson charge. Online court records indicate she dismissed the fourth count of hiding a corpse on Friday after Cotton argued Anderson can't be convicted of both mutilating and hiding a corpse.

Anderson and Robinson, a student at Milwaukee Area Technical College, met at a bar in March 2024 a week before her death. Surveillance video and cellphone text and tracking records show they spent the late afternoon and early evening of April 1 drinking at two bars before heading back to Anderson's apartment.

Photos on Anderson's phone show Anderson groping Robinson as she lay face down on his couch. Prosecutors have argued she was incapacitated and couldn't resist.

Surveillance video shows her car leaving his apartment early on the morning of April 2 and arriving at a park along the Lake Michigan shoreline. Prosecutors maintain that's where he cut her body into pieces. He later burned her car behind an abandoned building and took a bus home.

Searchers discovered one of Robinson's legs in the park and her other leg and a foot near a playground close to where he burned the car. A human torso and an arm believed to be Robinson's remains washed up on a beach in suburban South Milwaukee. 

Her head is still missing.

Seventeen Democratic officials accused President Donald Trump's administration of unlawfully intimidating health care providers into stopping gender-affirming care for transgender youth in a lawsuit filed Friday.

The complaint comes after a month in which at least eight major hospitals and hospital systems — all in states where the care is allowed under state law — announced they were stopping or restricting the care. The latest announcement came Thursday from UI Health in Chicago.

Trump's administration announced in July that it was sending subpoenas to providers and focusing on investigating them for fraud. It later boasted in a news release that hospitals are halting treatments.

The Democratic officials say Trump's policies are an attempt to impose a nationwide ban on the treatment for people under 19 — and that's unlawful because there's no federal statute that bans providing the care to minors. The suit was filed by attorneys general from 15 states and the District of Columbia, plus the governor of Pennsylvania, in U.S. District Court in Boston.

“The federal government is running a cruel and targeted harassment campaign against providers who offer lawful, lifesaving care to children,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.

Trump and others who oppose the care say that it makes permanent changes that people who receive it could come to regret — and maintain that it's being driven by questionable science.




Since 2021, 28 states with Republican-controlled legislatures have adopted policies to ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have a right to enforce those laws.

For families with transgender children, the state laws and medical center policy changes have sparked urgent scrambles for treatment.

The Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, the biggest public provider of gender-affirming care for children in teens in the U.S., closed in July.

At least seven other major hospitals and health systems have made similar announcements, including Children's National in Washington D.C., UChicago Medicine and Yale New Haven Health. 

Kaiser Permanente, which operates in California and several other states, said it would pause gender-affirming surgeries for those under 19 as of the end of August, but would continue hormone therapy.

Connecticut Children's Medical Center cited “an increasingly complex and evolving landscape” for winding down care.

Other hospitals, including Penn State, had already made similar decisions since Trump returned to office in January.

Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA, an organization that advocates for health care equity for LGBTQ+ people, said the health systems have pulled back the services for legal reasons, not medical ones.

“Not once has a hospital said they are ending care because it is not medically sound,” Sheldon said.

Trump devoted a lot of attention to transgender people in his campaign last year as part of a growing pushback from conservatives as transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance on some fronts. Trump criticized gender-affirming care, transgender women in women's sports, and transgender women's use of women's facilities such as restrooms.

On his inauguration day in January, Trump signed an executive order defining the sexes as only male and female for government purposes, setting the tone for a cascade of actions that affect transgender people. About a week later, Trump called to stop using federal money, including from Medicaid, for gender-affirming care for those under 19.

About half of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of transgender issues, an AP-NORC poll found. But the American Medical Association says that gender is on a spectrum, and the group opposes policies that restrict access to gender-affirming health care.

Gender-affirming care includes a range of medical and mental health services to support a person's gender identity, including when it's different from the sex they were assigned at birth. It includes counseling and treatment with medications that block puberty, and hormone therapy to produce physical changes, as well as surgery, which is rare for minors.

In March, a judge paused enforcement of the ban on government spending for care.

In April, Attorney General Pam Bondi directed government investigators to focus on providers who continue to offer gender-affirming care for transgender youth. “Under my leadership, the Department of Justice will bring these practices to an end,” she wrote.

In May, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a report discouraging medical interventions for transgender youth and instead focusing solely on talk therapy. The report questions adolescents' capacity to consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility. The administration has not said who wrote the report, which has been deeply criticized by LGBTQ+ advocates.

In June, a Justice Department memo called for prioritizing civil investigations of those who provide the treatment.

In July, Justice Department announced it had sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics involved in gender-affirming care for youth, saying they were part of investigations of health care fraud, false statements and other possible wrongdoing.

And in a statement last week, the White House celebrated decisions to end gender-affirming care, which it called a “barbaric, pseudoscientific practice”

Kristen Salvatore's 15-year-old child started hormone therapy late last year at Penn State Health. Salvatore said in an interview with The Associated Press before the lawsuit was announced that it was a major factor in reduced signs of anxiety and depression. Last month, the family received official notice from the health system that it would no longer offer the hormones for patients under 19 after July 31, though talk therapy can continue.

Salvatore has been struggling to find a place that's not hours away from their Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, home that would provide the hormones and accept Medicaid coverage.

“I'm walking around blind with no guidance, and whatever breadcrumbs I was given are to a dead-end alleyway,” she said.

The family has enough testosterone stockpiled to last until January. But if they can't find a new provider by then, Salvatore's child could risk detransitioning, she said.

Constitutional Accountability Center President Elizabeth Wydra and constitutional attorney Mark Smith weigh in on how the Supreme Court limiting nationwide injunctions on federal judges will impact the birthright citizenship ruling.

A federal appeals court will hear oral arguments Friday afternoon in a challenge to President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship in the U.S., one of several lower court cases that took shape after the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in June. 

The three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit agreed this summer to hear arguments in two consolidated cases centered on the matter, O. Doe. v. Trump, and the State of New Jersey v. Trump, joining several other appeals courts in reviewing the legality of Trump's executive order.

The hearing comes roughly five weeks after the Supreme Court partially sided with the Trump administration in a case centered on the birthright citizenship order. Justices narrowed when lower courts can issue so-called ""universal injunctions"" blocking the president's orders from taking effect nationwide. 

Trump signed his birthright citizenship executive order on his first day in office. It seeks to clarify the 14th Amendment, which states, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""

NINTH CIRCUIT REJECTS TRUMP'S BID TO REINSTATE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP ORDER

Instead, the language put forth by the Trump administration, and subsequently blocked, would have clarified that individuals born to illegal immigrant parents, or those who were here legally but on temporary non-immigrant visas, are not citizens by birthright.

The Supreme Court declined to rule on the merits, instead giving the Trump administration 30 days to outline how it would enforce the order — effectively punting the issue back to the lower courts. So far, the administration hasn't found much success there.

A federal judge in New Hampshire issued a nationwide injunction last month blocking Trump's order from taking force, and certified as a class all infants born in the U.S. who would be denied citizenship under the order. 

Arguments before the First Circuit come just one week after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals also blocked Trump's birthright citizenship order from taking force nationwide. 

Judges on the Ninth Circuit voted 2-1 to block the order, siding with the Democratic-led states in ruling it unconstitutional.

They also ruled it ""is impossible to avoid this harm"" caused by the order ""absent a uniform application of the citizenship clause throughout the United States,"" prompting them to issue the nationwide injunction. 

""The district court below concluded that a universal preliminary injunction is necessary to provide the states with complete relief,"" U.S. Circuit Judge Ronald Gould, writing for the Ninth Circuit majority, said in the ruling.

""We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a universal injunction in order to give the states complete relief.""

It's unclear how judges on the First Circuit will rule. But their oral arguments come days after the Trump administration detailed new specifics on how it plans to enforce its order in question. 

Guidance from roughly half a dozen U.S. agencies outlines these new requirements for parents. One document published by the Social Security Administration outlines new requirements parents will need to meet to prove their child is a U.S. citizen at birth.  

""With respect to citizenship, an SSN applicant may currently demonstrate U.S. citizenship by providing a birth certificate showing a U.S. place of birth,"" a document from SSA said. 

""Once the EO takes effect, a birth certificate showing a U.S. place of birth will not be sufficient documentary evidence of U.S. citizenship for persons born after the EO takes effect.""

The policy, which remains halted by the lower courts, is widely unpopular. 

More than 22 U.S. states and immigrants' rights groups have sued the Trump administration to block the change to birthright citizenship, arguing in court filings that the executive order is both unconstitutional and ""unprecedented.""

And to date, no court has sided with the Trump administration's executive order seeking to ban birthright citizenship, though multiple district courts have blocked it, including in wake of the Supreme Court ruling, from taking effect.

Former President Joe Biden appeared to slur and stumble through multiple parts of his speech July 31, 2025, in Chicago.

Former President Joe Biden touted appointing Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court, during a slur-filled speech at the National Bar Association's 100th annual gala at the Hyatt in Chicago Thursday evening — just hours after one of his top aides testified before the Republican House Oversight Committee for their investigation into the former president's fitness for office. 

Biden slurred on multiple occasions during the night, including while discussing serving as the vice president to the first Black president, former President Barack Obama, and selecting Kamala Harris as his vice president. Harris was the first woman of Black and South Asian heritage to serve in the role. 

Likewise, Biden said he also selected demographically diverse judges during his administration.

Former President Joe Biden said he also selected demographically diverse judges during his administration. 

""I promised to have an administration that looked like America and appoint a bench that looked like America,"" Biden said. ""And I kept my promise. I appointed the most demographically diverse … slate of judges ever in the history of the United States of America. The top of that list, one of the greatest lawyers I've ever met, Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman on the United States Supreme Court.""

""Justice Jackson, as you witnessed earlier this week, has proven herself to have the wisdom and the character that I saw in her when I nominated her. Appointed 13 Black women to the Courts of Appeals of the United States Federal Court, more than every other president in American history combined,"" he said. ""For other historic firsts as well, for historic, for Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, Muslim Americans, by the way, I didn't just appoint Ivy League judges.""

The National Bar Association originally formed in Iowa before Black attorneys were permitted to join the American Bar Association, and is now made up of 66,000 members working in law who advocate for civil rights and diversity. 

Those who attended the event included Jackson, as well as Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, MSNBC pundit Joy-Ann Reid and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

Biden and his allies have faced allegations of concealing the truth about Biden's mental fitness while in office, following his debate performance against President Donald Trump on June 27, 2024 in Atlanta, where Biden struggled to answer seemingly basic questions.

Multiple books have been written in 2025 detailing Biden's final days in office, his deteriorating mental faculties and challenges within the Democratic Party as a result of his decision to withdraw from the election. 

Additionally, several investigations are ongoing on Capitol Hill concerning Biden's mental decline. For example, the House Oversight Committee is examining the cover-up of Biden's cognitive decline and potentially unauthorized executive actions taken during his presidency.

Earlier Thursday, longtime Biden aide Michael Donilon appeared before the House Oversight Committee and told lawmakers that he could have raked in a total of $8 million if Biden had won re-election in 2024, Axios first reported. 

Fox News Digital reached out to Biden's spokesperson for comment and has not yet received a reply.

The people caring for others in Gaza are hungry too.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

George Anton is hungry, but he's become used to the sensation—the urgent, aching feeling in his stomach, the heaviness of his limbs. He hardly has time to acknowledge the discomfort, given all the work he has to do. He is the operations manager for an aid-distribution program operating through the Holy Family Catholic Church in Gaza City, the sole remaining Catholic church in Gaza.

Anton lives at the church in a single room that he shares with his wife and three daughters. Four hundred people are sheltering there, he told me; it was once a sanctuary from the war. Recently, however, the fighting has come to encircle it. An Israeli tank shell struck the church early last month, killing three people there, according to a statement by the patriarchate.

This week, daily pauses in the fighting have calmed the neighborhood somewhat, but not enough for the church to resume aid programs: food hampers, a communal laundry, psychosocial support programs and clinics. Some of these functioned even before the current war. But these days, the church has nothing to distribute. Its food pantry is empty, and supplies have run out. When I reached Anton by phone on Wednesday, he was busy looking for a way to bring more food to the church's pantry.

Anton is one of hundreds of Gazan aid workers—affiliated with religious, international, and local organizations—who are trying to find and distribute supplies to keep others alive. Complicating their work is their own hunger and exhaustion, as well as the paucity of food coming into the territory altogether. An alert on Tuesday from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, an organization made up of United Nations agencies and aid groups, noted that the “latest data indicates that famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City.”

The people sheltering at the church have, in the absence of communal supplies, begun to ration their own small stashes of food items, mostly gathered from the markets when the situation was stable enough for them to venture out. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has become the official mechanism for dispensing food aid, has very few distribution points, all in areas far from the church. Many Gazans fear visiting these sites: According to the UN, more than 1,000 people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking assistance from GHF, the UN, and other aid convoys. (GHF has called these numbers “false and exaggerated statistics.”)

Read: Food aid in Gaza has become a horror

I spoke with one Palestinian aid worker who did try to get food from GHF. In early June, Youssef Alwikhery, an occupational therapist with Medical Aid for Palestinians, hadn't eaten for close to a week. Several of his brothers, uncles, and cousins had tried to get food from GHF before—30 attempts altogether, he estimated—but only one had succeeded in bringing a box back. So Alwikhery rose one morning at 3 a.m. and made his way to Salah al-Din Street in central Gaza, a main thoroughfare leading to a distribution point that was a little over a mile from his home. He saw thousands of people. Some started running toward the distribution point, and he ran too. “It was like a game, like a death game,” he told me. Soon came the sound of shots and explosions. Alwikhery turned back. “It's not help. It's like Russian roulette,” he said. “If you want to run, you might die, or you might get injured. You might get a box. This is the formula. This is the point.”

Alwikhery now pays exorbitant prices for small amounts of food at the market, and he eats just one meal a day. He lives with his parents and his brothers' families, including 9- and 11-year-old children. They, too, eat only one meal a day, usually around four or five in the evening, and if a family member needs to cook, they burn whatever they can, because the price of fuel is high. One photo Alwikhery sent me shows his occupational-therapy textbook being used as kindling.

I first met Alwikhery in the summer of 2022, at Al-Awda Hospital in the Jabalia refugee camp in the northernmost part of Gaza, when we worked with the same international medical organization. He specialized in helping patients with congenital disabilities carry out their daily activities. Israel ordered the closure of Al-Awda in May, and now Alwikhery works in Medical Aid for Palestinians' emergency clinic in central Gaza. He told me that he finds the state of his pediatric patients disturbing; he described children with cerebral palsy who couldn't move their bodies to do simple exercises because they were so calorically deprived.

My call with Anton was at 9 p.m. on Wednesday, and so far that day, he told me, he had consumed nothing but coffee and tea. He rises early, at 6 a.m. The first thing he does is check to make sure the church's solar panels, water tanks, and piping are still functioning and did not sustain any damage overnight. Then he reads the news, goes to morning prayers, and calls his colleagues in Jerusalem for updates on when food trucks might reach Gaza and how they will be secured.

Around 4 p.m. the day we spoke, his wife and three daughters, ages 9, 11, and 14, had shared one can of tuna with some bread. In recent weeks, his girls have taken to spending much of their time in the family's room, sleeping and reading to conserve their energy. The oldest and youngest used to enjoy soccer and basketball, but now they don't feel safe going out, and anyway, they're too tired. Anton told me he encourages them to pretend they're fasting, as though for Lent.

Photos: Starvation and chaos in Gaza

Sometimes, fellow aid workers or journalists tell Anton about families on the brink, and he gathers any extra supplies he can from the families sheltering in the church to deliver by foot. Recently, a journalist told him about a father of six who used a wheelchair and could not access income or aid. This man had no extended family nearby to share resources. Anton was able to gather only enough food to last the family approximately one week. When conditions were safe enough last Saturday, he delivered the food to the family's tent. The children, two boys and two girls, were “really suffering,” he told me. “They're like skeletons, you know.”

Families such as that one, where one or more members have a disability, or whose kinship networks are small or nonexistent, are among those hardest hit by starvation, both Anton and Alwikhery told me.

Anton's day would not finish after we spoke. He said he would try to find himself some bread later in the night. He and some other people sheltering at the church would stay up to monitor the hostilities in the neighborhood, tend to anyone needing help or comfort, and assist some of the elderly to use the communal bathrooms in the dark.

“We're trying to do the best we can before we die, you know,” he told me. “Because I'm telling you, if this situation will last for a longer time, all of us will die hungry.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler announced Friday she is stepping down from her role at the central bank, creating an important vacancy at a time when President Donald Trump is pushing for lower interest rates.

In a letter addressed to Trump, Kugler, 55, did not state a reason for her decision to leave, only noting that she will be returning to Georgetown University as a professor in the fall.

""It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,"" Kugler wrote. ""I am especially honored to have served during a critical time in achieving our dual mandate of bringing down prices and keeping a strong and resilient labor market.""

Kugler's term was set to expire at the end of January 2026. A Biden nominee, she joined the Board of Governors in September 2023, filling the unexpired term of Lael Brainard, who left to serve as an Biden economic advisor. As a governor, Kugler was a permanent voter on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.

Her resignation now paves the way for Trump to put his own nominee in for the board. Two of his prior appointments, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, voted against the decision at Wednesday's meeting to hold the Fed's key rate steady, instead indicating they wanted to lower. Kugler was absent for the vote.

Kugler of late has expressed generally hawkish views, expressing support for holding rates steady until the impact Trump's tariffs are having on inflation becomes clearer.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell wished Kugler well, saying ""She brought impressive experience and academic insights to her work on the Board.""

In this article

A jury in Miami has determined that Tesla should be held partly liable for a fatal 2019 Autopilot crash, and must compensate the family of the deceased and an injured survivor damages of $329 million.

The payout includes $129 million in compensatory damages, and $200 million in punitive damages against Tesla. Attorneys for the plaintiffs had asked the jury to award damages of around $345 million. The trial in the Southern District of Florida started on July 14.

The suit centered around who shouldered the blame for the deadly crash in Key Largo, Florida. A Tesla owner named George McGee was driving his Model S electric sedan while using the company's Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system.

While driving, McGee dropped his mobile phone that he was using and scrambled to pick it up. He said during the trial that he believed Enhanced Autopilot would brake if an obstacle was in the way. His Model S accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 miles per hour, hitting a nearby empty parked car and its owners, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle.

Naibel Benavides, who was 22, died on the scene from injuries sustained in the crash. Her body was discovered about 75 feet away from the point of impact. Her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, survived but suffered multiple broken bones, a traumatic brain injury and psychological effects.

""Tesla designed Autopilot only for controlled access highways yet deliberately chose not to restrict drivers from using it elsewhere, alongside Elon Musk telling the world Autopilot drove better than humans,"" Brett Schreiber, counsel for the plaintiffs, said in an e-mailed statement on Friday. ""Tesla's lies turned our roads into test tracks for their fundamentally flawed technology, putting everyday Americans like Naibel Benavides and Dillon Angulo in harm's way.""

Following the verdict, the plaintiffs' families hugged each other and their lawyers, and Angulo was ""visibly emotional"" as he embraced his mother, according to NBC. 

Tesla told NBC that it plans to appeal and said, ""Today's verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla's and the entire industry's efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology.""

The verdict comes as Musk, Tesla's CEO, is trying to persuade investors that his company can pivot into a leader in autonomous vehicles, and that its self-driving systems are safe enough to operate fleets of robotaxis on public roads in the U.S.

Tesla shares dipped 1.5% on Friday and are now down 25% for the year, the biggest drop among tech's megacap companies.

The verdict could set a precedent for Autopilot-related suits against Tesla. About a dozen active cases are underway focused on similar claims involving incidents where Autopilot or Tesla's FSD— Full Self-Driving (Supervised) — had been in use just before a fatal or injurious crash. 

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration initiated a probe in 2021 into possible safety defects in Tesla's Autopilot systems. During the course of that investigation, Tesla made changes, including a number of over-the-air software updates.

The agency then opened a second probe, which is ongoing, evaluating whether Tesla's ""recall remedy"" to resolve issues with the behavior of its Autopilot, especially around stationary first responder vehicles, had been effective.

The NHTSA has also warned Tesla that its social media posts may mislead drivers into thinking its cars are capable of functioning as robotaxis, even though owners manuals say the cars require hands-on steering and a driver attentive to steering and braking at all times.

A site that tracks Tesla-involved collisions, TeslaDeaths.com, has reported at least 58 deaths resulting from incidents where Tesla drivers had Autopilot engaged just before impact.

DISCLOSURES August 01, 2025  

With the ongoing obesity epidemic, researchers are constantly looking for strategies that optimize weight loss while minimizing associated side effects. One strategy currently gaining interest is the use of weighted vests— form-fitting garments into which weights are sewn or carried in pockets, enabling the wearer to add or remove them as needed. In theory, this offers a nonpharmacologic way to induce weight loss without the side effects of medications or weight-loss surgery, but with potential bone-sparing effects. The latter is important because even modest weight loss can reduce bone density and strength, increasing the risk for fracture.

Weight loss — particularly when induced by caloric restriction — is associated with bone loss, especially at the hip. This is a consequence of loss of muscle mass and an unloading of bones from the decrease in body weight. Even modest diet-induced weight loss results in small but significant reductions in hip bone mineral density (BMD), with less consistent changes at the spine or whole body. These skeletal losses may increase fracture risk, particularly in older adults, and are more pronounced when weight loss occurs in the absence of exercise. Resistance training or combined aerobic-resistance exercise mitigate but do not fully prevent this bone loss.

Weighted vests can be used to preserve muscle mass during periods of caloric restriction. This is achieved by increasing gravitational loading and placing mechanical stress on weight-bearing tissues. Local fat mass is theoretically reduced by the work required to wear the weighted vest. Preservation of muscle mass has the dual benefit of preserving bone mass and maintaining resting metabolic rate (RMR). This is important because weight loss typically results in a lower RMR, which makes subsequent weight loss more difficult.

Although using weighted vests does not lead to the same degree of weight loss reported with GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide, or GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptor agonists such as tirzepatide, the data demonstrate benefits of this strategy. For example, 5 weeks of high-load vest use (11% of body weight worn 8 hours per day) vs a low-load vest (1% of body weight) reduced fat mass and waist circumference with no significant change in overall body weight. Loss of fat mass and a reduction in waist circumference are not inconsequential outcomes. Fat distribution (particularly an excess of visceral fat with an increased waist circumference) is a major driver of many metabolic morbidities associated with obesity. In fact, newer definitions of preclinical and clinical obesity emphasize body fat distribution and waist circumference, rather than absolute body weight.

The impact of weighted vest use on skeletal health is inconclusive at this time. Snow and colleagues reported preservation of hip BMD over a 5-year period in older, postmenopausal women when weighted vest use was combined with jumping exercises. However, a randomized controlled study from Wake Forest University (INVEST in Obesity) involving 150 older adults with obesity did not find a bone-protective effect of weighted vest use or resistance training following intentional weight loss. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact on BMD of varying durations of vest use and varying weights of the vest.

In conclusion, studies thus far have not demonstrated a significant impact of weighted vests for total weight reduction, although reductions in local fat mass and waist circumference may confer some metabolic benefit. These vests may provide mechanical stimuli that support musculoskeletal integrity; however, further research is necessary to prove this point and data available thus far are conflicting.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Let's talk today about how exercise can be viewed as a type of vaccine. 

With a traditional vaccine, there is a controlled exposure to something harmful, which is typically a viral particle. That exposure, though, allows the immune system to be prepared to deal with that virus if it sees it again later on.

Exercise also has the appearance of harm on the surface. It doesn't always feel good in the moment. The whole body is working harder to meet the demands of the exercise. As a result of that extra stress during the exercise activity, the body is then better prepared to deal with stress that can occur from disease processes later on. 

As a result of the aging process,organ systems are going to decline a little bit in function, and exercise is the best way to combat those declines. Let's think about something like pneumonia, where somebody might have a fever; they're going to be breathing heavy, and their heart's going to be working harder. For someone who's been exercising on a regular basis, their organ systems are better prepared to meet the higher demands associated with a disease process such as pneumonia.

In contrast, for someone who has not been exercising frequently, their organ systems have declined in function, and then as a result, they're more likely to be overwhelmed during the disease process. Someone might need medications to support their blood pressure during a pneumonia situation. Someone else might need a mechanical ventilator.

In this way, you could view exercise as training for the worst day of your life from a medical perspective. You want to make sure your organs are equipped to deal with stress when it's occurring in an uncontrolled environment, like from an infection such as pneumonia. 

Vaccines may be a controversial topic for some, but I think exercise is one type of vaccine whose benefits we can all agree upon.

United States women's national team forward Ally Sentnor has joined the NWSL-leading Kansas City Current from the Utah Royals, sources confirmed to ESPN.

Utah will receive $600,000 in transfer funds in return, setting a new intra-league record for an NWSL transfer, according to multiple sources familiar with the deal. There is also a 20% sell-on clause for the Royals, a source confirmed to ESPN.

The Royals will not receive any players in return, according to multiple sources.

Kansas City will pay Utah over multiple years to spread out each team's hit on the NWSL's net transfer threshold, a source confirmed to ESPN.

Utah entertained trade conversations for Sentnor with several NWSL teams this summer, according multiple sources.

The Athletic first reported Sentnor's move to Kansas City.

Sentnor has 12 goals in four appearances for the USWNT. She was named the 2024 U.S. Young Female Player of the Year.

- Trinity Rodman vows to be same player after injury return

The Utah Royals selected Sentnor No. 1 overall in the 2024 NWSL Draft, which ended up being the final draft before the league's new collective bargaining agreement abolished drafts.

Sentnor has one goal and one assist this season for the last-place Royals. She has started all 13 games for Utah, which has just one victory.

Kansas City, already loaded with attacking talent, sits in first place in the NWSL, eight points clear of the second-place Orlando Pride.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

It didn't take long for history to be made in the 2025 Leagues Cup. 

On Thursday night, the Seattle Sounders demolished the reigning Concacaf Champions Cup winners, Cruz Azul, 7–0, taking no mercy in their tournament-opening performance, with shell-shocking moments until the final whistle. 

Six different players hit the scoresheet, all tallying in the second half after the match was scoreless at halftime against the same opponent that the Sounders had fallen to in the Champions Cup last16 earlier in the season.

Yet, while Yeimar, Obed Vargas, Jesús Ferreira, Osaze De Rosario, Nouhou and Pedro De La Vega will remember their moments, none stood out as much as De La Vega's perfectly hit volley, which could contend for the FIFA Puskas Award for the world's best goal in 2025. 

OMG PEDRO DE LA VEGA #LeaguesCup2025 pic.twitter.com/T3iow4fAu7

At the same time, the seven-goal margin broke the record for the largest ever victory by an MLS club over a Liga MX side in any competition. It also marked the widest winning margin in any competition for the Sounders since joining MLS in 2009. 

The result also brought MLS to 10 wins in 18 matches in the 2025 Leagues Cup, and has the American first division outscoring its Mexican counterpart 40-30 in those combined contests. 

“We knew that this was going to be a rematch from Concacaf. They were a very good team; they're a team that eliminated us,” Ferreira said. “We wanted revenge...we came in with the mentality that we are a good team.""

While the Rave Green cruised over La Maquina, who beat Vancouver Whitecaps FC 5–0 in the Concacaf Champions Cup final, it was just the continuation of their stellar form since competing in the FIFA Club World Cup. 

Since falling out of the group stage against Atlético Madrid, Botafogo and Paris Saint-Germain, the Sounders have gone undefeated through seven games in MLS. Now, they are in a prime position to advance from Phase One in the Leagues Cup. 

“I didn't actually know what I was going to say to them in the locker room because it was such a tremendous win for the club,” said Sounders head coach Brian Schmetzer after the match. “In this club's history, it ranks right up there with all of the big wins that we've had. It's not a championship match, so I would probably temper it with that, but it certainly was a hell of a performance.”

Meanwhile, the continued form of De La Vega is an inspiring sign, after the young Designated Player struggled to find his consistency since joining the Sounders in 2024. In recent weeks, though, he has been one of the club's best players and is up to seven goals and three assists, with Thursday's strike the latest showcase of his abilities. 

“The execution, the technical ability, the ball that Alex [Roldan] plays. I mean, it's way up,” Schmetzer said of the goal and assist from Alex Roldan. “That was an unbelievably technically challenging finish, and he made it look easy.”

With the win, the Sounders can look ahead to their next matches against Santos Laguna and Club Tijuana, as they hope to qualify for the tournament's quarterfinals. 

“[The players] are driving us,” added Schmetzer. “That group in there is completely together, motivated. They know they're a good team.” Cruz Azul will also be painfully aware of that fact.

Taylor Townsend etched her name in the record books this week, officially becoming the 50th player to reach WTA doubles world No.1.

The American only needed to reach the semifinals in Washington, D.C. to overtake regular doubles partner Katerina Siniakova atop the rankings. Instead, Townsend rocketed to her third doubles title of 2025 alongside first-time partner Zhang Shuai, adding to her Australian Open and Dubai 1000 triumphs.

Townsend also excelled in singles competition on home soil, advancing to the quarterfinals after recording wins over Tatjana Maria and Sofia Kenin.

“It's super special for me,” she said after winning back-to-back Washington Open doubles titles. “Being able to clinch the No.1 doubles spot in the world and then come back and get the trophy again today in the fashion that we did – being able to play at the quality and level we played – I hold it near and dear to my heart.”

Storm Hunter is one of the other 49 players to become WTA doubles world No.1. Like Townsend, the Australian achieved the feat by advancing to the semifinals of a tournament, doing so at the 2023 WTA Finals in Cancun.

As a guest on The Tennis podcast this week, Hunter discussed the unpredictable nature of new world No.1s emerging.

“Tennis is such a unique sport – the rankings are based on a 52-week cycle, so your points from each tournament last a full year. At any moment, someone could become the new world number one,” said Hunter, who held the No.1 doubles ranking for 12 weeks.

PODCAST: Listen to the latest episode of The Tennis

“She said publicly that she went to D.C. with the mission to become world No.1, which I thought was pretty cool. It just shows how much achieving that goal and that dream meant to her.

“It's something that no one can ever take away from you… and even to this day, I sometimes pinch myself and think, ‘Wow, I can't believe at one point I was literally the best in the world at what I do.'”

Alongside Hunter, Townsend joins the likes of Martina Navratilova, Martina Hingis, and Sam Stosur in achieving world No.1 status. However, Townsend stands alone as the only player to do so as a mother.

The 29-year-old gave birth to her son, Adyn, in March 2021 and returned to the court in April 2022. Since then, she has won a combined 13 titles across singles and doubles competition and reached a career-high singles ranking of world No.46 in August 2024.

“This has honestly been a dream come true on so many levels, and for [Adyn] to be here – I tell him all the time, even after Wimbledon last year when I left, I said, ‘I'm going to bring you back a trophy,'” Townsend said. “I've envisioned having moments like that since he was born. I didn't know when, how, or where it would happen – but I dreamt of it. It's very special to me.”

Hunter added: “She's spoken very publicly about how much strength and motivation he gives her – that she's doing this for him. For her to achieve that ranking in D.C., with her friends, family, and Adyn there, it was just a magical moment.

“She's such a hard worker. That's something I've noticed on tour – she's always out on the court trying to get better in singles and doubles.

“I always loved watching her play. Don't necessarily love competing against her – she makes it very difficult on court.”

Taylor Townsend isn't the only American flying the flag in preparation for the US Open later this month.

Six American women are still in contention at the WTA 1000 tournament currently underway in Montreal. World No.32 McCartney Kessler joins Coco Gauff in the fourth round after she upset No.4 seed Mirra Andreeva on Thursday (local time).

Jessica Pegula, Madison Keys, Amanda Anisimova, and Caty McNally seek to reach the final 16 on Friday. 

In Toronto, Alex Michelsen and Learner Tien are through to the fourth round, while Frances Tiafoe, Brandon Nakashima, and Ben Shelton have the chance to join them. 

It follows a strong campaign for American men in Washington, where Ben Shelton, Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe, and Brandon Nakashima all advanced to the quarterfinals.

Ferrari Executive Chairman John Elkann reflects on team's ‘rough' season

TECH TALK – Final updates before summer

Carlos Sainz has reflected on a tough season so far with Williams ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Carlos Sainz has admitted that his 2025 campaign with Williams up until now ""has been incredibly frustrating and very disappointing"" due to a lack of results.

The Spaniard joined Williams this year having been forced out of Ferrari, where he spent four seasons and won four races, due to the arrival of seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton.

While showing flashes of speed with Williams' FW47 in the opening 13 races, results have been difficult to acquire for the 30-year-old and include just six points finishes in Grands Prix, with a best result of eighth in Saudi Arabia.

It leaves his points total at 16 in comparison to the 54 scored by team mate Alex Albon, and speaking to the media ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix this weekend, Sainz admitted that his season so far had been a frustrating one.

""Plenty of positives in terms of what I've found in the team with the ambition and the way we're moving forward,"" he said.

""All the work that is being done in the background for next year and even on this year's car, development and everything.

""But everything that has happened on track in terms of results has been incredibly frustrating and very disappointing because I expected, after a good adaptation period with the car, to start getting results pretty quickly given how competitive and how fast I've been this year.

""But for certain reasons, results are not coming and that frustrates me but I'm sure it will come at a point in the season.""

He added: ""Athletes in their careers go through better years and worse years, it happens to golfers, tennis players. You have years that everything seems to fall into a good side and years that everything seems to fall in the bad side.

""It's been a very challenging year in that sense to me, very difficult to gather any kind of momentum. Always different things happening.""

Williams brought several upgrades to Belgium last weekend, which Sainz used to score his best result in a race during Saturday's Sprint.

With practice limited and the race held in the wet, he believes this weekend will be crucial to get a better understanding of the newer package.

""I think it's a weekend that is a good track to test, a track that all teams know very well,"" he said.

""Running the upgraded car has also led us to maybe different set-up directions for the future so it's important this weekend that we get to understand those.

""As we saw from the Sprint to the race [in Belgium], we did a few set-up changes that didn't do what we expected to the car and now we need to keep understanding that.""

Ferrari Executive Chairman John Elkann reflects on team's ‘rough' season

TECH TALK – Final updates before summer

Ferrari have confirmed that they have renewed Team Principal Fred Vasseur's contract with the squad ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Ferrari have handed their Team Principal Fred Vasseur a multi-year contract, which the team say ""reflects Ferrari's determination to build on the foundation laid so far"".

Vasseur joined the Italian squad ahead of the 2023 Formula 1 season and, under his watch, the team challenged McLaren for the 2024 Teams' Championship until the last race before finishing just 14 points behind the champions.

While they trail McLaren by a mammoth 268 points as the sport approaches the summer break this year, Ferrari are still P2 in the Teams' Championship, fending off rivals Mercedes and Red Bull.

On the eve of the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend, Ferrari announced they have renewed Vasseur's contract.

""His ability to lead under pressure, embrace innovation and pursue performance aligns fully with Ferrari's values and long-term ambitions,"" the team said in a statement.

""Under Fred's leadership, Ferrari is united, focused and committed to continuous improvement. The trust placed in him reflects the team's confidence in its strategic direction and reinforces a shared determination to deliver the results that Ferrari's fans, drivers and team members expect and deserve.""

Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said: ""Today we want to recognize what has been built and commit to what still needs to be achieved.

""It reflects our trust in Fred's leadership – trust rooted in shared ambition, mutual expectations and clear responsibility.

""We move forward with determination and focus, united in our pursuit of the level of performance Ferrari has to aim for.""

Vasseur, who joined Ferrari having previously been in charge of Sauber, added: ""I'm grateful for the trust Ferrari continues to place in me.

""This renewal is not just a confirmation – it's a challenge to keep progressing, to stay focused and to deliver.

""Over the past 30 months, we've laid strong foundations and now we must build on them with consistency and determination.

""We know what's expected, and we're all fully committed to meeting those expectations and taking the next step forward together.""

Ferrari's decision to extend and announce Vasseur's contract extension brings to an end speculation surrounding the Frenchman's future at the team.

The 57-year-old was angry and irritated during the Canadian Grand Prix weekend in June when media reports in Italy suggested he was at risk of losing his job.

He said at the time that such reports were ""disrespectful"" and were ""clearly hurting the team"".

One of Vasseur's key strengths is his ability to shield and protect his team from external factors and promote a strong, supportive culture internally.

Despite the uncertainty and speculation, he's managed to do just that – with the team keeping their heads down and securing an upturn in form since Canada.

They've secured two podiums in the last three Grands Prix courtesy of Charles Leclerc, with seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton starting to find his feet, too.

There is still plenty of work to do, mind. The gap to McLaren is huge, with the reigning Teams' Champions overwhelming favourites to retain their title.

The new deal will help restore a greater sense of calm among the team and allow them to focus on trying to take advantage of sweeping new chassis and power unit regulations for 2026.

But now that Vasseur's immediate future has been secured, Ferrari senior management will expect him to lead the team to respond well to those rule changes and challenge for both championships next year.
