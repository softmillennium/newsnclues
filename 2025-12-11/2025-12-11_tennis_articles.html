                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton is one of the ATP Tour's most entertaining and magnetic figures. Whether it's his blistering serve, infectious energy or his bright personality, the American has a way of connecting with fans. Now, the 23-year-old is inviting fans an even closer look at his life. On Wednesday, Shelton launched his own YouTube Channel and released an 11-minute episode titled, ‘The Long Game', which provides behind-the-scenes footage of the lefty at the US Open and his debut appearance at the Nitto ATP Finals. “I'm really excited to show you guys the behind the scenes of my life, on the court, off the court, unedited, unfiltered,” Shelton said in an intro video posted on his channel. He finished the season with a 40-24 match record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. A post shared by Ben Shelton (@benshelton) © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
