Croatian goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic has been told he will never play for Spanish side Girona again Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Girona coach Michel has publicly criticised Croatia goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic, stating the player will not feature for the club again after allegedly refusing to play due to personal ambitions. Michel revealed on Thursday that the reserve goalkeeper declined to participate in a recent fixture, prioritising his World Cup prospects with Croatia, who are due to face England in their first match, and a potential move to another team. The 30-year-old Livakovic, currently on loan from Fenerbahce, reportedly informed Michel he wished to remain eligible for a transfer to a different club. Football regulations stipulate that players can only represent two teams in a single season, and Livakovic has already played for Fenerbahce. This refusal forced regular starter Paulo Gazzaniga to play a Copa del Rey match earlier this month despite suffering from the flu and a high fever. "Right now, I only have one goalkeeper available," Michel explained. Until the winter transfer window, I know we have a problem. And I am not defending my position but defending the goalkeeper who has been here for three years, which is Gazzaniga." Gazzaniga himself has endured an inconsistent season, marked by several errors, including two that led to Elche goals in a recent match.

Previously it had been optional to provide the information. Freedom of expression and the right to privacy are universal human rights. No football fan surrenders those rights just because they cross a border. “This policy introduces a chilling atmosphere of surveillance that directly contradicts the welcoming, open spirit the World Cup is meant to embody and it must be withdrawn immediately.” The proposal follows an executive order from Donald Trump in January which seeks “to ensure that all aliens seeking admission to the United States, or who are already in the United States, are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible”. A spokesperson for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said: “Nothing has changed on this front for those coming to the United States. This is not a final rule, it is simply the first step in starting a discussion to have new policy options to keep the American people safe. “This new proposal is in line with the January 2025 Executive Order 14161 to vet those who are coming into this country using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (Esta) by allowing CBP to collect additional information from non-US citizens applying through the visa waiver programme from eligible countries.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hotels across North America have begun hiking prices to astronomical levels as they prepare for the FIFA World Cup in 2026. Next year's World Cup will take place in host cities in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. With the tournament's first matches set to begin in less than six months, hotels are trying to take full advantage of one of the world's largest sporting events. A Wednesday report from The Athletic detailed just how outrageous the price increases have been: It is not unusual for hotel prices to rise around mega events. At the Paris Olympics in 2024, the French capital saw a year-over-year room rate increase of 141 per cent during the Olympic event period, according to Smith Travel Research. For late May 2026, the hotel is charging $157 per night. Just a few weeks later when the tournament begins, that rate jumps up to a mind-boggling $3,882. Have a tip or story idea?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Star-Studded Moroccan Squad With One Big Question Hosts Morocco have officially revealed their squad list for AFCON 2025, assembling one of the most talented and well-balanced teams in the tournament. Hakimi's participation became uncertain after suffering a severe right ankle sprain from a tough tackle by Luis Díaz during PSG's Champions League match against Bayern Munich. Forced off the field on his 27th birthday, he underwent medical tests that confirmed he would require two weeks of total immobilization followed by at least four weeks of rehabilitation—a timeline that jeopardized his availability for Morocco's AFCON group stage. The injury also came at a moment when PSG had multiple players sidelined, but Hakimi's case was the most delicate due to what he represents for his country and the level of physical demand expected at AFCON. Even while injured, Hakimi reached a milestone in his career by winning the 2025 CAF African Player of the Year award. It was the culmination of an extraordinary season at PSG, where he played 55 matches, scored 11 goals, delivered 14 assists, and helped secure a historic treble: Ligue 1, Coupe de France, and Champions League. His leadership was just as crucial in guiding Morocco to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, solidifying his status as one of Africa's greatest modern football icons. But at the awards ceremony in Rabat, he appeared wearing a protective boot on his injured foot—a symbolic reminder that his availability for AFCON was still in doubt.

So… Is Achraf Hakimi Included in Morocco's AFCON Squad? After weeks of speculation, medical updates, and hopeful projections, Morocco settled the debate: yes, Achraf Hakimi has been officially called up for AFCON 2025. However, his physical condition remains the key variable. Morocco will handle him carefully, knowing that having him fully fit could be the difference between a deep run and falling short at home.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supporters following their team at the 2026 World Cup will find that ticket prices have rocketed Supporters hoping to attend next year's World Cup final face paying vast prices, with tickets in the 'supporter value tier' starting at £3,119 ($4,185). Fans' group Football Supporters Europe has said it is "astonished" by Fifa's "extortionate" pricing strategy. The high prices for group games and the final have been leaking out on Thursday as Fifa informs national associations of their allocations. The lowest-priced tickets on open sale in Qatar were £450. BBC Sport understands tickets for the 'supporters standard tier' are £4,162 ($5,560), compared with £747 in 2022. There are about 4,000 tickets for each game available through the official supporters' groups. All other tickets are allocated through the random ballot process, other than those held back by Fifa for corporate partners. In a departure from recent tournaments, group stage games are being priced based on their attractiveness, rather than at a flat rate. In Qatar, group stage fixtures had set prices of £68.50, £164.50 and £219. Yet for England's match against Croatia on 17 June, tickets cost £198, £373 or £523. England fan Luke Buxton told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It is absolutely outrageous. It's a big betrayal to the most dedicated fans of every nation that's following their side at the World Cup next summer. Ideally the round of 16 but it may be too expensive. "However, with these ticket prices coming today, I am not sure I am going to make the knockout stages at all now." Scotland's first two group games are cheaper than England's. Against Haiti the prices will be £134, £298 or £372, with Morocco set as £163, £320 and £447. Scotland fan John Wallan told BBC Radio 5 Live: "I am going, that is definite. They are 19 and 12, so everything has been ramped up. I would love to take the kids because it may not happen for another 30 years. We are still deciding if it is one, three or four of us that go." There are no category four tickets available to fans, though this was also the case in 2022 when they were reserved exclusively for residents of Qatar. Each household can request up to four tickets per match and a maximum of 40 across the tournament It said Fifa should "immediately halt PMA [Participating Member Association allocation] ticket sales, engage in a consultation with all impacted parties, and review ticket prices and category distribution until a solution that respects the tradition, universality, and cultural significance of the World Cup is found". It continued: "In the price tables gradually and confidentially released by Fifa, tickets allocated to National Associations, which typically distribute them via official supporters' groups or loyalty programmes to their most devoted fans, are reaching astronomical levels. "For the first time in World Cup history, no consistent price will be offered across all group stage games. In 2022, it would have cost £1,466, £2,645 or £3,914, though that was for seven games rather than eight. It is not yet clear if fans who are successful in their application for 'follow your team' tickets will have the whole amount taken off their credit cards in January. There will not be any dynamic pricing in this sale, but prices are likely to be considerably higher if fans try to buy off Fifa's resale site following this phase.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The entire women's soccer audience is keeping an eye on the free agency race for Trinity Rodman. The NWSL's Board of Governors is in advanced talks to approve a new financial mechanism, per ESPN. In a dramatic policy shift crafted to retain the Washington Spirit forward, and other star players, from fleeing to lucrative overseas offers, this would allow teams to pay higher salaries beyond the league's strict salary cap. The potential new mechanism wouldn't be the first of its kind in American pro soccer, but would be new to NWSL. Unlike MLS' designated player rule, the proposed concept would not allow teams to offer unlimited funds to any player. Each club would have a set amount of money beyond the current cap to spend on star players that meet specific criteria, and funds could be used on multiple players. While rumors of overseas offers are nearly a month old now, there's still time for anything to happen, including a stateside offer from the USL Super League. As the contract saga continues, we're here to help you keep up with the biggest offseason story of the year, with a look back at key points of Rodman's career, with a helpful timeline of events that have led up to the final month of 2025. She also won U.S. Soccer's Young Female Player of the Year and was voted on the 2021 NWSL Best XI First Team. The club pivots to new ownership, with new executive leadership, after multiple rotated head coaches between 2022 and 2023,  and finally looks primed to clinch a postseason birth. USWNT Head Coach Emma Hayes has only 70 days to build toward the Olympics and quickly solidifies her top attacking line for the tournament with Rodman, Sophia Wilson, and Mallory Swanson. They go on an attacking spree, scoring 10 of the USWNT's goals, and are dubbed "Triple Espresso." Though the post-Olympic grind catches up to Rodman as she tries to manage the fatigue and back injury, her minutes are shortened ahead of November, but she plays two 120-minute playoff matches before going a full 90 minutes in the NWSL Championship, where she continues to play through her injury. Rodman begins her contract year, and clubs overseas are already "monitoring her situation" ahead of the NWSL season. She also begins her long absence from the U.S. women's national team. Her 2025 starts with extensive time off to manage a back injury. NWSL teams meet the hard deadline to start preseason training camps by Feb. 5, as per collective bargaining agreement rules, clubs must allow for a five to eight-week preseason before competitive matches. Rodman was with the club for preseason training, though the expectation was that she would gradually work her way into form. Rodman begins her NWSL campaign after time away from U.S national team camps. The winger slowly built up her minutes during the regular season and played 45 minutes to an hour prior to April. Rodman also mentions in an interview that she's not sure her back "will ever be 100 percent," and that it's a matter of "when she plays in Europe." Rodman made the USWNT game day roster for April friendlies against Brazil after increased minutes for the Washington Spirit. USA coach Hayes and the Washington Spirit staff confirm that Rodman would go to Europe to work with team doctors on managing her back injury. Rodman made a triumphant return to the pitch and scored in her first club game since April. She increased her minutes load in NWSL regular-season matches toward the end of August. Rodman returned to playing full 90-minute games and regained form. She scored three goals and notched two assists, and her performances earned her multiple honors, including spots on Attacking Third's Team of the Week and NWSL Player of the Month for September. Elsewhere, Chelsea FC signed U.S. women's national team winger Alyssa Thompson on a transfer from Angel City, and the move fueled more of the "USWNT players leaving NWSL" discourse among women's soccer faithful. The WSL club is no longer named in reports as a club interested in Rodman's services at this time. Rodman's second-half season surge continues and shows no signs of slowing down. She plays more fully fit matches and continues her goal scoring as the season approaches the final stretch. The Washington Spirit staff and head coach Adrian Gonzalez, to this point, have done a respectable job of rotating a heavily injured Spirit roster, with several players managing respective injuries. Rodman sustained a knee injury during the match against Monterrey on Oct. 15 and was later diagnosed with a grade 1 MCL sprain and withdrew from the October international window with the USWNT. Rodman reported for training wearing a leg sleeve and no brace, and participated in light, no-contact training, ahead of the quarterfinal. She was available and dressed for the first playoff round but did not play any minutes in the Spirit's quarterfinal win over Racing Louisville FC. She played only one minute, but in four touches, recorded a dangerous shot on goal. Throughout the NWSL playoffs, Rodman's contract status was a key storyline as each game that passed was viewed with uncertainty on whether these were her final games in an NWSL jersey. NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman was questioned about the league's salary cap amid Rodman's status, in light of a new deal being offered by a rival league in the United States, and Berman responded that the NWSL "will fight to keep" Rodman in the league. It was her most increased minutes load since Oct. 15. The attention around Rodman's contract status remains at an all high, and despite a year of injuries and setbacks, she is the high-profile player on the free agent market. She was transparent with the media throughout NWSL Championship week about making no decisions ahead of the final, and how she tried to block out the contract "noise." Carter's hiring announcement came just hours before new reports emerged that Rodman and the Washington Spirit had reached a deal, but it was vetoed by NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman. Berman's reasoning for turning down the contract was that "it went against the spirit of the league rules," though no specific rules were violated and not cited in further reporting. The new deal reportedly contained new-to-the-league mechanisms in paying a player, and a timeline that would crossover into future revenue growth options related to potential broadcast rights deals. In response, the NWSL Players Association filed a grievance on behalf of Rodman, which was reviewed by CBS Sports, and states that the league penalized Rodman's free agency rights and accused the player of "salary cap circumvention." The grievance also points out that the league violated multiple free agency protections previously negotiated in the CBA, including Section 13.6, which states a player's free agency rights "supersede any other inconsistent NWSL rules, regulations, handbooks, or competition guidelines." It also notes the league is unable to reduce player benefits: "Nothing in this Section shall be construed to give the NWSL the right to limit or reduce benefits in any other part of this Agreement or any Standard Player Agreement." If no response is given, a two-person committee with one league and one PA representative would review the contract situation. If no resolution is met, the dispute heads to arbitration. The league and its player association navigate uncommon territory as Rodman's contract situation continues to unfold. "Our goal is to ensure that the very best players in the world, including Trinity, continue to call this league home," the NWSL said in a statement to CBS Sports. "We will continue to do everything we can, utilizing every lever available within our rules to keep Trinity Rodman here." "Trinity Rodman agreed to a compensation structure in good faith that would allow her to remain loyal to her first professional club, consistent with both the CBA and NWSL Competition Rules," the NWSLPA said in a statement to CBS Sports. As both sides try to navigate at a rapid pace, Rodman's representation is back to work for the player. "We worked really hard to put together an agreement that we felt complied with the CBA (and) would keep Trinity in the league for the foreseeable future," Rodman's agent, Mike Senkowski, said on "CBS Mornings." "The NWSL doesn't have a certain way at the moment to pay her fair market value." The NWSL doesn't “have a certain way at the moment to pay [Trinity Rodman] her fair market value,” the global star's agent, Mike Senkowski, exclusively told @nateburleson.Rodman, who was offered a new four-year deal that her agent says complies with the league's collective… pic.twitter.com/nAnkeQqEAG No new clubs have been named as suitors in the Rodman free agency market saga, though Senkowski did make it a point to note that he was doing his interview while in Madrid, Spain. Rodman recently uploaded a holiday video blog that details her time in Spain. She recorded her flight and discussed participation in a marketing shoot. She also includes a clip of her agent off camera and jokingly says, "Currently my agent is raging about, ya know. December 11, 2025: The NWSL's Board of Governors is in advanced talks to approve a new financial mechanism. The proposal framework would allow each team to have a set amount of money beyond the current salary cap to spend on star players who meet certain criteria, and those funds could be used on multiple players. The proposal still needs to pass with a vote. While no current European clubs have reportedly thrown out their bids, Rodman's agent also reminded "CBS Mornings" that she has offers with more money on the table, and alluded to the offer that D.C. Power made during the NWSL postseason. There is no gambling offered on this site. This site contains commercial content and CBS Sports may be compensated for the links provided on this site.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The final pre-World Cup friendly is set. When U.S. Soccer announced the pre-World Cup slate of friendly matches for the United States Men's National Team back on December 2nd, there was one match on May 31st in Charlotte that was without an opponent. Today, U.S. Soccer revealed that Senegal will be the opponent for that match as the two teams meet up in the Continental Clásico at Bank of America Stadium. First reported two days ago by Steven Goff of Yahoo! Sports, the Senegal match will be the first of two “send-off” matches for the USMNT during the June window that takes place to allow teams to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, which begins on June 11th in Mexico City. It will be the first time the USMNT has ever faced Senegal, ranked 19th in the world and one of Africa's strongest teams. Senegal went unbeaten in World Cup qualifying to win their group and qualify for the 2026 World Cup. They were drawn into Group I during the FIFA World Cup Draw last Friday, where they will face France, Norway and the FIFA Playoff 2 winner (Iraq, Bolivia, or Suriname) in the group stage. “We are so happy to have such a great team in Senegal as our fourth opponent in the matches leading up into the tournament,” head coach Mauricio Pochettino said in a statement. “In the year leading up to the World Cup, we will have played at least one team from five different confederations which is incredibly valuable for our preparations. We are looking forward to an amazing crowd in Charlotte.” This match will be a huge test for the USMNT as they cast aside the traditional setting up of non-World Cup opponents for their send-off matches. They will face Belgium and Portugal during the March window at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. After the Senegal match in Charlotte on May 31st, they will head to Soldier Field in Chicago to face Germany in their final match before they open up World Cup group play against Paraguay on June 12th.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After previously announcing friendlies against European powers Belgium, Portugal and Germany in the two windows that will precede next summer's competition, U.S. Soccer revealed Thursday that Mauricio Pochettino's side will be facing African giant Senegal to fill the last open date on the calendar. “We are so happy to have such a great team in Senegal as our fourth opponent in the matches leading up into the tournament,” Pochettino said in a statement. “In the year leading up to the World Cup, we will have played at least one team from five different confederations which is incredibly valuable for our preparations. We are looking forward to an amazing crowd in Charlotte.” Based on his previous comments, which are subject to change, he expects to name his final team before the camp that includes the Senegal friendly and send-off match in Chicago vs. Germany before going straight into the World Cup. “I think it's difficult when you bring more than 26 [players], and then you need to tell [a player], on the last day, ‘You are out,” Pochettino said in November. “I prefer … to bring the 26 that you believe are going to be in the squad, and if something happens, you call someone (else).” September friendlies against Japan and South Korea were followed by October dates with Ecuador and Australia. If Turkey is to get through, then the U.S. will have played all three of its group opponents (Paraguay, Australia being the others) in the year leading into the World Cup. Senegal, which reached the 2022 World Cup round of 16 and is paced by former Liverpool star Sadio Mané, went unbeaten in Africa's World Cup qualifying competition (seven wins, three draws). At the World Cup, Senegal is in a difficult Group I, which features France, Norway and a qualifier to-be-determined from the March intercontinental playoffs. The team will first be competing in the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations, headlining a group with DR Congo, Benin and Botswana later this month. If the U.S. wins its group, it will be paired with a third-place finisher from one of five groups, and Group I is among that mix. Conversely, if Senegal wins its group, it'll be matched with a third-place finisher from one of five groups, and the U.S.'s Group D is included in that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff Carlisle recaps Folarin Balogun's big night for Monaco in the Champions League. Some competitions -- like the Premier League -- power through the festive period, while others are about to take a short break. Meanwhile, Major League Soccer has gone into hibernation, with Liga MX about to conclude its Apertura campaign. There is no rest, however, for the players, especially with a certain AC Milan attacker showing not even the flu can slow him down. When the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise. The past few months have been a bit stop-start for Pulisic. There was the hamstring injury in October that saw him miss about a month, as well as another muscle injury that forced him to miss the 1-0 win against Lazio on Nov. 29. Then there was his recent illness, which Pulisic said left him feeling "dead" just a day before Monday's match with Torino. Pulisic went on to deliver his own version of the "Flu Game," albeit one without as much at stake as the Michael Jordan-inspired version. He then tallied the game winner 10 minutes later to lead Milan to a 3-2 win and move back atop the Serie A standings, and Pulisic's seven goals in 2025-26 are tied with Inter Milan's Lautaro Martínez for the most in Serie A. The impulse to protect Pulisic in bubble wrap between now and June is strong, but so long as he maintains his current health and form, USMNT fans will be content with him tearing it up for Milan. Through it all, it's fair to say Banks has become a mainstay in the Augsburg lineup, having started the club's past nine league matches. How does all of this factor into the USMNT picture? Banks is certainly helping his cause, and while the Bundesliga's winter break is slated to begin on Dec. 21 and last until around Jan. 9, he'll have plenty of opportunities to impress prior to the next international window in March. Banks will have some players to climb over, even with Celtic's Cameron Carter-Vickers sidelined with an Achilles injury, but Pochettino is known to be an admirer, meaning Banks' window of opportunity remains slightly open. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Some good news has finally made its way to Sargent. The Norwich City striker scored on a fantastic diving header against Watford. Although the Canaries ended up losing, 3-2, it was Sargent's first goal since an Aug. 30 brace against Blackburn Rovers. This comes on top of Sargent notching an assist in the previous week's 3-1 win over Queens Park Rangers, breaking a 13-match winless streak. To be clear, Sargent's dry spell means he remains in the basement when it comes to the USMNT depth chart. The likes of AS Monaco's Folarin Balogun, PSV Eindhoven's Ricardo Pepi, Coventry City's Haji Wright, and Derby County's Patrick Agyemang are all positioned above Sargent at the moment (more on that in a moment). History was made in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday. He now has 10 goals on the season for club and country. Pepi also scored, albeit in a losing effort as PSV fell to Atlético Madrid, 3-2. While the competition for spots on the USMNT remains fierce, Balogun continues to keep his competitors at arm's length, and his work rate and mobility -- in addition to his finishing -- should help him stay there. When it comes to Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie, you can count his club manager, Luciano Spalletti, among the converted. McKennie has this attitude, this way of meeting you halfway, like he's saying: 'You ask, I'll do,'" Spalletti said prior to last weekend's match against Napoli. Some of that was down to McKennie's inability to maintain the requisite fitness, but this campaign has seen him conquer those concerns. He remains Juventus' Swiss Army knife, and even popped up for the opening goal in Juve's 2-0 win over Pafos in the Champions League. He's logged plenty of minutes at wing back for Juve this season, but that position is relatively well stocked for the U.S., with Sergiño Dest, Tim Weah, Alex Freeman and Max Arfsten all vying for minutes. That leaves either the central midfield role alongside Tyler Adams, or does he occupy one of the more attacking midfielder spots in tandem with Pulisic? While he is definitely a two-way player, his skill set tilts more on the attacking side of things, and he showed well alongside Malik Tillman in the 1-1 draw against Ecuador last October. In addition to Tillman, there is Borussia Mönchengladbach's Gio Reyna, América's Alejandro Zendejas and Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna all competing for time. Much will depend on how aggressive Pochettino wants to be in a particular match going forward. If he opts for a more defensive stance, Tanner Tessmann could be the man to partner Adams with McKennie further forward. What's known is that McKennie's performances at club level have him firmly in the World Cup roster mix.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's fast becoming yet another flashpoint ahead of next year's already controversial World Cup and one which is likely to test FIFA's credentials again. Seattle is one of the 16 host cities for next year's World Cup. Earlier this year, local organizers had decided that the match at Lumen Field on June 26 was to be included in Pride celebrations, due to it falling at the start of Seattle's Pride Weekend. After the World Cup draw last Friday and the match schedule being revealed on Saturday, FIFA decided Egypt vs. Iran would play that game in Seattle. Meanwhile, group rivals Belgium and New Zealand will play at the same time in Vancouver. Homosexuality is still illegal in Iran and punishable by the death penalty. While homosexuality isn't outlawed in Egypt, members of the LGBTQ+ community can be prosecuted for violating public decency laws. Taj added that Iran would bring up the issue during a FIFA Council meeting next week. In a statement sent to CNN on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Seattle's organizing committee said the planned activities will still be going ahead, adding that it was SeattleFWC26's role to “prepare our city to host the matches and manage the city experience outside of Seattle Stadium.” “Football has a unique power to unite people across borders, cultures, and beliefs,” Hana Tadesse, vice president of communications for SeattleFWC26, said. “The Pacific Northwest is home to one of the nation's largest Iranian-American communities, a thriving Egyptian diaspora, and rich communities representing all nations we're hosting in Seattle. Meanwhile, local groups have said they are working with the organzing committee to ensure everyone stays safe during Seattle's Pride weekend “It could be a good spotlight on how welcoming Seattle is to all people, but there are concerns within the community about safety during the World Cup,” Seattle PrideFest, an organizer of the event, said in a statement on Facebook. “Just know that LGBTQIA+ orgs (including PrideFest) are working together and with the local organizing committee to try to address those concerns in advance of the tournament.” This, though, is another situation which will test the governing body's ability to handle such topics. At that tournament, FIFA also said it would “impose sporting sanctions” against captains who wore the “OneLove” armbands – part of a campaign to promote inclusion and oppose discrimination. Qatar is also set to play in Seattle two days before Egypt and Iran's fixture, against one of Italy, Northern Ireland, Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina. Notably, Seattle was also one of the cities that US President Donald Trump threatened to take World Cup hosting duties away from. Trump, though, has not weighed in on the issue as of yet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has issued a passionate defence of under-fire manager Xabi Alonso following the club's 2-1 Champions League defeat to Manchester City. The atmosphere at the Santiago Bernabeu was tense on Wednesday night as Real Madrid suffered their second home defeat in the space of just three days. After falling to a 2-0 domestic loss against Celta Vigo over the weekend, the Spanish giants were beaten 2-1 by City in Europe, a result that has increased the scrutiny on manager Alonso. Goals from Nico O'Reilly and Erling Haaland overturned Rodrygo's opener to hand victory to the Premier League side in the league phase encounter. The final whistle was met with frustration from sections of the home support, but Thibaut Courtois stepped forward in the mixed zone to offer a defiant message regarding the dressing room's relationship with their head coach. Speaking to reporters after the match, Courtois rejected any suggestion that the players had lost faith in Alonso's methods or that the squad was fractured. Madrid have managed just two wins in their last eight matches across all competitions, a streak that has seen them slip to second in La Liga and seventh in the Champions League table. The match itself saw Madrid start brightly, with Rodrygo ending his long drought to put the hosts ahead after 28 minutes. However, City responded quickly through O'Reilly, before Haaland converted a penalty just before half-time after Antonio Rudiger was adjudged to have fouled the Norwegian striker.

"I understand the anger after a run of matches like this, but I think we reacted on the pitch, we did everything possible and we lost against a very good rival," the Belgian explained. City, who sit fourth in the Champions League standings on 13 points, controlled significant portions of the game. The goalkeeper himself was called into action to make a double save to keep the score at 2-1, denying City a third goal that would have killed the game off earlier. "Everyone here will support the coach with all our heart," Courtois stated. This public backing comes at a critical time for Alonso, who took charge earlier in the year. The defeat leaves Madrid on 12 points in the Champions League league phase, still inside the top eight automatic qualification spots but with a reduced margin for error heading into the final fixtures against Monaco and Benfica in January. The squad situation has been complicated by fitness issues, with Kylian Mbappe remaining on the bench throughout the match due to a knee concern, forcing Alonso to rely on a front line of Rodrygo, Vinicius Junior and Gonzalo Garcia.

"It is by winning on Sunday that we will change this dynamic," he added. Real Madrid currently trail league leaders Barcelona by four points in the domestic table. The focus now turns solely to Sunday as the squad attempts to turn their "wholehearted" support into three points.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soccer fans eager to catch the FIFA World Cup opening matches next year will be hit with sky-high costs, as hotels in the 16 host cities across the United States, Canada, and Mexico hike rates by more than 300% — with one city topping $3,000 a night, a new report found. Room rates at 96 Marriott and Hilton hotels skyrocketed after FIFA unveiled the 104-match schedule Saturday, with the average per-night rate around an opening game hitting a whopping $1,013 – up from $293 just 21 days earlier, according to an analysis by The Athletic. Rooms at the Marriott resort Le Meridien Mexico City Reforma, located near Azteca Stadium, surged 2,372%, reaching a staggering $3,882 per night, the report showed. Just weeks prior, in May, the same hotel's nightly rate will be about $157. Six Mexico City hotels are averaging $1,572 per night for the opening match – up a jaw-dropping 961% from rates listed three weeks earlier, according to the analysis. Among 78 games across US cities, hotel rates surged most in Houston (457%), followed by Kansas City (364%), Atlanta (344%), and the San Francisco Bay Area (342%) compared to respective rates in late May. The average nightly rate across six hotels in New York City and New Jersey climbed 228% for a two-night stay around Brazil's June 13 match against Morocco at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, according to the report. The same Garden State Marriott hotel will jump to a whopping $3,066 per night around the July 19 World Cup final at MetLife Stadium, with nearby Hampton Inn Carlstadt charging $3,518 and the Moxy Times Square in Midtown climbing over $1,000 per night. The average tab of a two-night stay hit $487, slightly up from $267 three weeks prior. Marriott and Hilton did not respond to the outlet's questions about how they determine their rates.</p>
