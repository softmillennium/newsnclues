                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Erika Kirk has one word for Candace Owens, who has been peddling conspiracy theories about her late husband, Charlie Kirk: "Stop." In a town hall set to air Saturday at 8 p.m. ET, CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss asked Charlie Kirk's widow what she wants to say to Owens and others who are making unfounded claims about his assassination: Owens used to work for Turning Point USA, the conservative youth organization founded by Charlie Kirk. The two were generally considered friends, with Owens describing their relationship as akin to that of a "brother and sister." A day after his assassination in September, she posted a nearly 25-minute video, saying she wanted him to be remembered for his career and ideas. But in the months since, Owens has pushed conspiracy theories about his murder and made unfounded fraud allegations about the finances at Turning Point, which Erika Kirk now runs. And in this case, it's hideous that malicious lies and smears obligated [Erika Kirk] to make the request," a senior Treasury official told CBS News. Erika Kirk talks more about her husband, her journey through faith and grief, and the state of the American right in a CBS News town hall. It will air just days after Charlie Kirk's book, "Stop, in the Name of God: Why Honoring the Sabbath Will Transform Your Life," was posthumously released. Watch the one-hour town hall Saturday at 8 p.m. ET/CT on CBS. ET, and will be available on CBS News' YouTube channel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LENGBY, Minn. — Wally Nelson opened his front door on the morning of Dec. 20, 1990 and saw a 19-year-old woman lying in the snow, just feet from his home. “Her face was ghost-like,” Nelson told The Associated Press in 1990. Nelson recognized the young woman: Jean Hilliard, a family friend. Unbeknownst to Nelson, her vehicle veered into the ditch, miles away. A cold snap had hit Minnesota that evening, with temperatures dipping below 22 degrees Fahrenheit, according to newspaper accounts from the time. "I knew he lived down the road and had a pickup truck, so he could pull me out," Vig said. Yet as Vig set off on foot — dressed in cowboy boots, jeans and a snowmobile jacket — she began to realize Nelson's home was farther away than she anticipated. So I'd get over a little hill thinking his place was going to be there, and then I'd get there and it wouldn't be." “You could also see where she had fallen three or four times from the mailbox, one-eighth of a mile down the road.” The tracks kept going, indicating she crawled across his yard and up onto his doorstop, where she collapsed. She spent roughly six to seven hours passed out in the below zero temperatures. Hilliard's body was frozen stiff when Nelson picked her up and placed her — diagonally — in the backseat of his car that morning. He raced to the hospital, hoping for a miracle. When they arrived at the hospital, her temperature didn't register on a standard medical thermometer. Medical staff also weren't able to insert any needles as her skin remained frozen. Her eyes weren't responding to light, either. They would have considered her deceased — if they hadn't heard the faint gurgling sounds that resembled a form of breathing. "They couldn't get a pulse right away, but then they heard a gurgle like through my nose and determined that I was somehow breathing," Vig said. Hospital staff wrapped Hilliard's body with water-based heating pads. Her breaths per minute — one to two — were far below the normal rate of 12 to 20 per minute. As the day progressed, she gradually began to wake up. By that afternoon, her cognitive ability was back to normal. When awake, Vig could see the black blisters on her toes. It was a concerning sign for her medical team. Yet as Vig later learned, just hours before she was fully awake, her doctors informed her family that if she did make it, she could have to have both legs amputated, too. She walked away from the near-death experience without any long-term side effects. "I got calls from reporters and from magazines, so it didn't really go back to normal for quite some time." It didn't take long for her story to spread throughout the country. Newspapers from Fargo to California carried the story, with headlines that read, “Woman survives six-hour exposure to sub-zero weather” and “Woman comes to life from out of the cold.” Her recovery was considered a medical mystery — and miracle. She was frozen stiff, literally,” her physician, Dr. George Sather, M.D. Just as news coverage reached all corners of the country, Vig learned that she had been at the center of many prayer group and churches, who took an active interest in her recovery. "I do think it was a miracle," she said. "I found out later just how far the prayer chain spread. So, I had a lot of people praying for me." I mean it could be something as simple as my kids or my grandkids ... something special in their life." Vig went on to live a relatively normal life. It was during that time when her story resurfaced. In 1996, her story was featured on Unsolved Mysteries. Vig is happy to answer questions and share her experiences — especially around Christmas. "People are looking for miracles and the good that has happened." There are a few questions Vig commonly fields regarding her survival, one of which addresses any possible health issues she has from her time as a human ice cube. She now prefers cold weather over the heat. "So, I'm not I'm not one of those that wants to go to Florida or Arizona in the winter."</p>

We investigate the microlensing detectability of extraterrestrial technosignatures originating from Dyson sphere – like structures, such as Dyson Swarms surrounding primordial black holes (PBHs).

These hypothetical swarms consist of stochastically varying, partially opaque structures that could modulate standard microlensing light curves through time-dependent transmission effects.

We introduce a probabilistic framework that includes a stochastic transmission model governed by variable optical depth and random gap distributions. We perform a parameter scan and generate heatmaps of the optical transit duration. We study the infrared excess radiation and peak emission wavelength as complementary observational signatures.

Additionally, we define and analyze the effective optical depth and the anomalous microlensing event rate for these stochastic structures. Our findings provide a new avenue for searching for extraterrestrial advanced civilizations by extending microlensing studies to include artificial, dynamic modulation signatures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the vast landscape of Twitch, where gaming, reaction content, and livestream entertainment shape the digital world, there is one creator whose presence stands apart: Giuseppa Salinas Gomez Gomez, better known as JuXinaaa or La Madrina. With a life marked by intuition, spiritual sensitivity, and profound personal experiences, she has built a unique space where the paranormal, the mysterious, and the deeply emotional intertwine with humor, community, and curiosity. Her streams invite viewers into an atmosphere that feels both intimate and electric — a place where energy is analyzed as closely as evidence, where intuition is treated as a compass, and where science and the supernatural sit at the same table. Together with her devoted community, the “Kiddos,” Juxinaaa explores paranormal videos, documentaries, investigations, and experiments, reacting not just with commentary but with a sensitivity shaped by her own real-life encounters. In this exclusive interview, she shares her origins, her spiritual lineage, the night that changed everything, and how she brings authenticity into a world where belief and skepticism collide. How did you first come into contact with the paranormal, and what motivated you to turn it into Twitch content? In my family, there were several tragic events — including murders — and every time, someone would feel this deep intuition that something was about to happen. Authenticity and energy are everything to me. If something feels energetically genuine, I'll react to it. Was there a paranormal experience in your own life that strongly shaped how you see all of this? Yes — the night my friend was murdered. On the morning of the day it happened, I had this deep, unsettling feeling in my stomach. It wasn't fear, just a knowing. Later that day, we were at his parents' house, and suddenly men broke in. I had a package with me that he asked me to leave behind, but my intuition said, “Take it.” I still don't know exactly what was inside — but my gut told me it mattered. That moment defined my relationship with intuition forever. That sudden energetic shift is the foundation of my spiritual worldview. How do you handle it when scientific explanations and supernatural interpretations collide in your community? For me, science and the supernatural aren't enemies. Science explains a lot — but not everything. I keep both sides open, neutral, and even humorous. My streams are a dialogue: I show scientific reasoning respect, but I also acknowledge the experiences that don't fit into that box. What's the most surprising or disturbing investigation you've ever reacted to on stream? Some investigations shake people because of the atmosphere — strange sounds, sudden shifts in energy, or visuals that just don't sit right. My community often picks up on details immediately. For me, it's rarely fear — but sometimes a case has a heaviness that even I can't ignore. Do you ever experiment with occult methods or paranormal tests live on stream? If so, what have your experiences been like? When I experiment with energetic or spiritual methods on stream, I stay very calm, clear, and grounded. Some moments have been intense for viewers, though — certain sounds or atmospheres can feel unsettling to the community, even if I'm completely steady. How do you evaluate the authenticity of paranormal clips? Do you have any red flags or analysis techniques? Some of my biggest red flags are: • shadows that make no sense, • timing that's off, • atmospheric inconsistencies, • lack of real emotional response, • and energy that simply feels wrong or forced. I react only to clips that feel energetically real. How does your community influence the flow of your streams, especially when it comes to spontaneous reactions and interpretations? They notice tiny details, they catch things I might miss, and together we break down the energy of a moment. Has there ever been a moment during a stream when you were truly scared or something unexplainable happened? Fear isn't something I operate with. But yes — there have been moments when something shifted suddenly, energetically, and everyone felt it at the same time. What future projects or paranormal topics do you want to explore more deeply on Twitch? There's so much left to uncover — deeper analyses, new investigations, more spiritual experiments, and exploring the line between intuition and energy on an even higher level. My goal is always the same: to bring my community with me into these experiences so we can explore the unknown together. ... [Trackback] [...] Here you will find 4922 additional Inf... ...

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Saving people, hunting things, the family business" is a quote that has become synonymous with Supernatural, but no other season encapsulates this feeling like Season 1 of Supernatural does. Before the horror show fell into overarching storylines that lasted seasons, it was known for its snappy monster-of-the-week format, where Sam and Dean Winchester hunted down a different demon in every episode and actually saved countless lives while doing so. While the Winchesters were tracking down paranormal absurdities across the country, they were also rebuilding a bond that they had lost for many years. In Season 1, Episode 5, "Bloody Mary," Supernatural was at its finest, terrifying viewers with a familiar monster, while also giving them much-needed emotional payoff. The legend of Bloody Mary is one that has been worn thin over the past few decades, especially through email forwards that simplify it to the point where it ceases to be scary. According to the lore, if one faces a mirror and says "Bloody Mary" thrice, a woman will kill them instantly through the reflective surface. The episode begins as the scariest stories do: at a slumber party where three teen girls are playing sleepover games. Charlie and Jill dare Lilly to go to the bathroom mirror and say "Bloody Mary," which she does, but nothing happens. As Sam and Dean descend on Toledo, Ohio, for another monster-of-the-week case, Jill decides to repeat the phrase "Bloody Mary" jokingly into a mirror, and soon sees the same dark figure and suffers the same agonizing death as Steven. Trying to find a pattern, Sam and Dean inspect the mirrors that the two victims died in front of, and found the names of Steven's wife and a little boy who had died in a hit-and-run case, whose car details matched Jill's. Sam and Dean find a vengeful spirit named Mary Worthington, who had been killed in front of a large mirror when she was a teenager, and when her murder was not solved, she started attacking those whom she thought had secretly killed other people, the way she had been. The mirror found its way to Toledo, and the brothers then worked towards saving Charlie, who was being followed by Mary because she once had a boyfriend who died by suicide when she left him. Supernatural could have taken the easy route and had Mary kill the people who summoned her, but writers Eric Kripke, Ron Milbauer, and Terri Hughes Burton chose to add layers to a story that had been done to death. They refreshed it by giving Mary an origin story; she used to be a young girl whose life was ended in an untimely manner. So, she made it her afterlife's purpose to avenge those who had killed people and gotten away with it. Mary Worthington's crusade for justice matched Sam Winchester's own guilt about his girlfriend, Jessica's death. Mary Worthington's spirit tried to attack Sam, and he, too, bled from his eyes, but the key lay in Sam finally trusting himself and his brother that he did not kill anyone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>St. George might see some out-of-this-world visitors this Sunday as aliens are set to make an appearance at Pioneer Park. “It is all about trying to make the world a better place and trying to live in harmony with all conscious beings throughout the universe.” Guy said the Alien Contact event will begin with humans making friends before any extraterrestrial introductions. Guy said the goal is to bring people together in friendship regardless of differences, including religious beliefs or political convictions. The evening will move into a guided astral projection meditation designed to help participants reach out to any visiting beings and offer an open invitation for contact. Attendees at the Alien Contact event gather in hopes of encountering extraterrestrial beings, location and date not specified. “Psychic people will see them standing around trying to support what we are doing. Occasionally, we will see alien craft in the sky flying above us.” St. George is one stop on what Guy said will be a more than five-month Alien Friendship Contact Tour across the country. The tour began Nov. 30 in Bakersfield, California, and is scheduled to continue through Fresno and Sacramento before making six stops in Nevada, including Area 51. After St. George, the route moves to Page, then travels through New Mexico, Oklahoma, Missouri, Indianapolis, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama, with a tentative finale planned in Arkansas. He planned the tour to cover as much of the United States as possible, estimating it would span 40-45 states. A possible extraterrestrial craft is captured over an Alien Contact gathering, location and date not specified. At the first two events of his 2025 tour, Guy said attendees reported seeing black streaks darting through the air nearby. Around the same time, a member of his online group described receiving a “download” from alien beings and began noticing similar black streaks in her vision. Intrigued by the phenomenon, Guy attempted to connect with the streaks to discover who or what they might be. “We always reach out to beings with love in our hearts and friendly intentions,” he said. “It turned out that these black streaks identified themselves as positive, friendly beings who had a message for us.” Guy said that when participants communicated telepathically with the beings and asked for a message, three people in three different locations reported the same vision: Guy standing in a forest clearing, surrounded by a large group of nonhuman beings. He said the consistency of the visions across separate observers serves as logical proof of a genuine psychic telepathic message. He said he does not know when or where the vision will manifest, but it seems to serve as a notification or invitation to the forest clearing gathering. He hopes the meeting will take place during his tour. Rupert Guy, founder of Alien Contact, leads a U.S. tour designed to help humans connect with each other and extraterrestrial beings, location and date not specified. Guy said everyone can experience paranormal or alien encounters, but an open mind is key. He cared so deeply for people, animals and the planet that he could not watch the news because it was too painful. If aliens were real, he wanted them on his side or anyone working to protect the planet. He began exploring aliens, paranormal phenomena and religions alongside scientific study. “I ended up with a pretty clear picture of scientific realities, but also alien, paranormal and spiritual realities,” he said. “I now teach people about these realities and try to elevate people's understanding of reality, but also morality to alien levels.” Rupert Guy, founder of Alien Contact, leads a U.S. tour designed to help humans connect with each other and extraterrestrial beings, location and date not specified. Guy is a retired space scientist and science teacher who calls California home but travels the world. He founded the group Alien Contact five years ago and has led about 10 tours since then. This is his first time hosting an event in St. George. “I have spent my entire life reaching out to aliens and spirits in peace, trying to establish friendly, constructive relationships with them,” he said. Join the Alien Contact event at Pioneer Park on Sunday, Dec. 14, from 7-9 p.m. Early birds can arrive at 6 p.m. to mingle in a friendship circle before the cosmic adventure begins.
