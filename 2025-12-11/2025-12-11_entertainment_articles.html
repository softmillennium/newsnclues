Kate Winslet's “Goodbye June” — a terminally cozy Netflix Original that she directed from a script written by her 21-year-old son Joe Anders as part of his coursework at Britain's National Film and Television School — isn't the least bit shy about the extreme privilege that went into its production, and all things being equal, that's probably for the best. Saccharine and schematic as the movie turned out to be in the end, it might have felt more dishonest if she hadn't crammed her filmmaking debut full of her famous actor friends, or cashed in her kid's accrued nepotism (his dad is Sam Mendes!) Related Stories ‘Supergirl' Teaser: Maybe a Superhero Can Be Dark and Still Have Some Fun ‘Silent Night, Deadly Night' Review: Rohan Campbell Slays Nazi Scum in Twitchy Killer Santa Remake More to the point, whatever sweet and errant truths are buried within this glossy tale of a cancer-ridden Christmas can be found in — and stem from — its recognition of the privilege at its core. It's the privilege of being able to receive death as a gift in disguise. There are only 16 shopping days until Christmas, but poor June (Helen Mirren) probably isn't going to make it for the festivities this year. She's been sick with cancer for long enough that her scattered family has come to think of it as the status quo, but the whole brood is forced to constrict back to Cheltenham after June's son Connor (a moppy, hyper-sensitive Johnny Flynn) finds her lying on the floor one morning. First up is Julia (played by Winslet herself), a put-together human pantsuit whose professional veneer and upwardly mobile ambition mask her struggle to be warm and present for her three kids, one of whom has special needs. She's a natural foil for prickly middle child Molly (Andrea Riseborough), whose entire character — best as I could tell — is that she married tall (Stephen Merchant) and is very serious about only eating organic. That might still be enough, however, to give her the edge over June's oldest daughter Helen (Toni Collette), a flighty new age breathing instructor who lives abroad and was recently impregnated by a random Greek stranger who knocks people up for fun and money. All summoned home with their clashing baggage in tow, these people are absolute models of complexity when compared to their doddering father Bernie, whose denial over June's condition is so complete that he barely seems to know where he is half the time. Like most of the roles in this movie, Bernie would be an insufferable caricature if not for the skill and humanity of the actor playing him; contrived as it is to see him disassociate for comic effect (“Simon Cowell?” he responds to a doctor named Simon Khal) and mutter on about his “jerkin” before coming to terms with the imminent reality of June's death (a sudden awakening worthy of Oliver Sacks), a giant like Timothy Spall can't help but invest a rich history of love and loss into Bernie's pre-grief process. Mirren, at least, is heartrendingly believable as a sick woman on her way to repose, despite the fact that her hospital room is blasted with enough beatific white light to make it look like she's halfway to heaven already. That's par for the course in a facility where all of the nurses are angels (Fisayo Akinade's diabolically endearing Nurse Angel in particular), and nobody else seems to be sick. And, by extension, the way that feeling pain allows them to be present. Equal parts noxious and comforting in the tradition of wounded holiday movies like “This Is Where I Leave You” and “The Family Stone,” Winslet's directorial debut may grovel for your sympathies, but at least it knows that bitterness, loss, and regret are what really makes the Christmas season so magical, and that we should all be so lucky to share them with each other in person. Netflix will release “Goodbye June” in limited theaters on Friday, December 12. It will be available to stream on Netflix starting Christmas Eve.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Say Nothing star Lola Petticrew has been tapped as the co-lead opposite Toby Wallace in Netflix's Assassin's Creed live-action series, based on Ubisoft's best-selling video game franchise. Assassin's Creed is a high-octane thriller centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions — one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters — said to be different from the games — across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny. Jennifer Garner To Star In & Produce Netflix Comedy 'One Attempt Remaining' From Kay Cannon 'Goodbye June' Review: Kate Winslet's Fine Directorial Debut With Helen Mirren And Top British Cast Is Sad, Funny, Hopeful, And A Holiday Gift Details about Petticrew's series regular role are being kept under wraps. Roberto Patino and David Wiener serve as showrunners on Assassin's Creed, which stems from a deal Netflix signed with Ubisoft in 2020. They executive produce with Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, Genevieve Jones for Ubisoft Film & Television, and Matt O'Toole. With more than 230 million units sold, the Assassin's Creed franchise is one of the best-selling series in video game history. For their starring role in FX's limited series Say Nothing, Petticrew was just nominated for an Independent Spirit Award in the Best Lead Performance In a New Scripted Series category and previously won the Irish Film & Television Award for Best Lead Actress and received a Best Actress BAFTA Television Award nomination. Petticrew recently played the lead in Channel 4's series adaptation of Louise Kennedy's novel Trespasses, starring opposite Gillian Anderson, and is wrapping production on Liz Meriwether's upcoming Hulu series Furious (aka Black Widow). Petticrew, whose break came playing the title role opposite Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the 2023 indie Tuesday, is repped by CAA, Range Media Partners, UK's B-Side Management and Sloane Offer Weber & Dern.

In Heated Rivalry, Storrie plays Ilya Rozanov, a Russian-born hockey player who meets his professional rival, Shane Hollander, portrayed by Hudson Williams, at the age of 17. By the age of 18, the pair, now professional hockey players, begin sleeping together on and off for years throughout their career, growing from teens to men. Andrea Yates Case: ID Docuseries Claims Cult Preacher Influenced Mother Who Drowned Five Children (Exclusive) The actor, perfectly cast even though he himself didn't see it at first, not only had to learn hockey but an entirely new language, as his character spends a considerable amount of time each episode speaking Russian. Hearing Storrie, a West Texas native, speak in his normal accent is jarring, in a genuinely impressive way. “I used to write monologues, and I would just put it into Google Translate and memorize it in different languages.” Below, Storrie chats all about his breakout role in Heated Rivalry, how he learned Russian so quickly, the pressures of adapting a beloved character and what's next. How are you doing with this instant love from the internet? We all know the internet can be really ruthless, especially Twitter. For every negative comment, I feel like there's a billion good ones, so I feel like the pros far outweigh the cons. Also, I think being from this day and age, I'm very aware of the presence of social media. I'm aware of how connected you are to the people who are watching it, so that's prepared me to really engage with people. My head hasn't exploded yet, so we're doing good. In the past, people didn't have that instant access to every creative person to share such quick feedback. No, I think if you think on it too much, it can stress you out a little bit. We're in a really cool circumstance where the people who are interacting with this are just so enthusiastic and positive. I think that's because Jacob [Tierney, show creator] created something really cool and because Rachel Reid [author, Heated Rivalry] spoke to a community and a group that really loves her work. Before the show even came to be, the fandom was already so positive and warm and enthusiastic. It just means it doesn't speak to every single person, every single thing, given this speaks to a lot of people. In taking on this project, how much did you know about it? What were you thinking when it came your way? When I got the breakdown, it was like 6'3, native Russian speaker, hockey player. Usually [the requirements are] a little less specific than that. With that being so specific, I didn't think this was going to be me. The breakdown also said that it was a book. I remember looking up the book, looking up the fan art and reading about it online. All of the fan art was this ginormous guy with brown eyes and scruff. As an actor, especially at the phase I was at before Heated Rivalry, you audition for things all the time that are such a shot in the dark and are such a long shot, but you want to act and work, so you give it a shot. I thought this was special and cool from the jump, but definitely did not think it was going to be me. I used to write monologues, and I would put it into Google Translate and memorize it in different languages. Looking back on it, the pronunciation was horrible. How long did you have to prepare that? The timeline's kind of spotty because I'm pretty sure I didn't get the actual call that it was 100 percent a go until, I want to say, a week before we left, which isn't super-duper abnormal. But it's kind of crazy to have to learn how to skate, play hockey, speak Russian and do the accent and you don't even know until a week before. They hooked me up with my awesome dialect coach, Kate Yablunovski, who was based in Montreal. We started doing three, four-hour Zoom sessions every single day. Again, every single day — five, six, seven days a week, we would talk on the phone and go over the Russian. Then the hockey of it all, that's another element. How into sports were you before this? I'm from West Texas, so the tumbling, gymnastics [and] competitive cheerleading thing is pretty big out there. I skated a little bit growing up. I remember recreationally skating with my cousins and stuff. One time, there was this Russian lady who actually came up to me. This Russian lady came up to my mom and was like, “You have to let me train him.” I remember the next day I came back and there was no one in the skating rink, and she skated backwards and made me do these little — they call them C-cuts in hockey. Yeah, never saw her again, but my mom said she really wanted to make me her little prodigy. I'm good at anything that has to do with control. With hockey, I can do the skating, but once they drop that puck and they give me the stick, I'm out. It seems like you were able to film most of this show in a bubble, which I assume was nice. There were built-in fans, but I imagine this rollout has been more than anyone imagined. There's two parts of that for me. On one hand, when I signed up for this, it was a Canadian television show that was getting put up on Crave, which is a strictly Canadian streamer. I was still super excited about that because to me, that meant we were going to do a limited series in a more independent way. Sometimes, that's where a lot of magic can happen. Maybe it'll have some sort of international distribution at some point, but at the end of the day, I was excited to work. I got to get out of my country for a few months. I got to speak a different language. If it never got seen, and if it never got finished, I would still have been ecstatic just to have that experience. Getting that next level of distribution, it's the dream. As an actor, you just always hope that things pop off. In the span of a week, essentially, you go from just doing your job as an actor to having a lot of people on the internet talking about or weighing in on you. I don't know how to say this without sounding like an asshole, but I think as an actor, I've always wanted to work at a really high scale. If you want to be an actor, on some level, I think there's something about wanting what you do to be seen and be exposed and reach people. For it to finally manifest, and to be reaching people in that way… This is what I wanted, so can't really be too shocked when it happens. As for people addressing me specifically online, rather than just the work that I do, I just see it as part of the territory. I think it comes with the territory of wanting to work on the level that I'm really excited to work on, and I hope that continues to grow, and I get to do more stuff and work with other cool people that inspire me. There's been a lot of conversation online about who the character is. I didn't read the second one just because I didn't want to play [him] with the end in mind. But it's funny, I think that at first I remember thinking that people loved him because of the bad boy sort of archetype. Me as a person, I don't always find that charming, endearing, funny, because I see it as a shell. I was like, oh, here we go. [I'm] going to play the bad boy. He's playing at being a grouch sometimes. He's playing at being a flirt sometimes, but underneath it, without revealing anything for the plot for the people who haven't read the books, he goes through a lot. He goes through some shit, and that's why people like him. We feel for people that go through stuff. I mean, it's so easy to engage with someone who tries to wink his way through all of that. He feels it a hundred times bigger than most. Jacob has spoken about the fact that he wanted to take this material seriously. Did you feel more pressure in that sense? Pressure is an interesting thing in that — to be completely honest — I don't really feel a lot of pressure as an actor, and it doesn't mean that I'm always confident. I doubt certain choices or putting on an accent as hyperbolic as Ilya's is not always a comfortable, easy decision. But I'm very much of the mindset that with art — and today's world pushes this all the time — you do something, you give it 100 percent, and eventually it'll move on, and we'll watch it, appreciate it and then we'll move on to the next thing, which I don't think is a bad thing at all. Because you're right, a story like this, I think a lot of other directors and writers would've tried to adapt something like this and could've fallen into a few pitfalls, kind of what you said, tried to feed into a really watered-down idea of the female gaze, and Jacob didn't do that. Reading that, instantly a lot of my fears went away because I think the only time that you can really hesitate is if the foundation isn't strong. What do you, as an actor, hope comes next after this experience? I'm still very much in the beginning stages of my career. I think it's cool to be transparent about that because when you talk to actors a lot, or when you read or watch interviews, it feels so distant from you. I just feel really lucky and so blessed right now to be doing the thing that I've always wanted to do. Really, honest to God, all I want going forward is to keep having opportunities to work and be on set and enjoy the people and the experiences along the way. It sounds so cheesy, and I was not of that mindset up until eight months ago, but it really is just about being inspired and being with cool people. I just feel so blessed to be doing the thing that I've always wanted to do with my life. How long that lasts, what that looks like, who I get to work with, the ups and the downs, I don't know, but all I can do is be thankful for right now and hope that those fruits continue to grow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: The 2026 Sundance documentary lineup will feature a royal flourish. Deadline has learned the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – Prince Harry and Meghan – will executive produce Cookie Queens, “a coming-of-age story about the joys, pressures, and pain points woven into one of America's most cherished rituals: Girl Scout Cookie season.” Alysa Nahmias (Art & Krimes By Krimes, Unfinished Spaces) directs the film, producing alongside Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw (The Truffle Hunters, Gaucho Gaucho), and Jennifer Sims. Dogwoof Acquires World Sales Rights To 2026 Sundance Competition Doc 'Sentient' Documentary Super Directors, Super Producers Book Passage To Final Sundance In Park City; Brittney Griner, Billie Jean King Also Courted By Festival “Captivating, candid, and full of heart, the film follows four girls ages five to twelve and their families as they navigate the annual whirlwind of selling, striving, and succeeding,” notes a description of Cookie Queens. “For these Girl Scouts, selling cookies isn't just about Thin Mints and sisterhood – it's a crash course in entrepreneurship. Nahmias crafts a bold, vibrant, observational portrait that honors the girls' perspectives and illuminates the emotional and intellectual stakes of their experiences.” “As a former Girl Scout myself, with my mom as my troop leader, I have a personal affinity for this film and am proud that all our conversations and collaboration have led to Archewell Productions partnering with this award-winning team to executive produce this incredibly captivating documentary,” Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, shared. In a statement, she said, “When we first viewed the early footage of this documentary, it was immediately something we wanted to be involved in. No word yet on whether Meghan and Harry plan to attend Sundance. “I'm proud and excited to be premiering Cookie Queens at the Sundance Film Festival – which has been a north star along my creative path – and to share that Prince Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and the Archewell Productions team are partners in this project as we introduce the stories of these remarkable girls with the world,” director-producer Alysa Nahmias said in a statement. “From our very first conversation, their enthusiasm was unmistakable – Meghan has a deep personal connection to our film's community as a Girl Scouts alumna, and the Archewell Productions team understands how this coming-of-age tale goes beyond the cookies to resonate not only with the world's 50+ million Girl Scouts, but audiences everywhere. Cookie Queens is a Beautiful Stories & AJNA Films Production in association with Archewell Productions, Artemis Rising Foundation and Good Gravy Films. Along with Prince Harry and Meghan, the film is executive produced by Chanel Pysnik and co-produced by Qadriyyah Shamsid-Deen for Archewell Productions. Executive producers also include Regina K. Scully, Hallee Adelman, Ann Lewnes, Stephen G. Hall, Ruth Ann Harnisch, Geralyn Dreyfous, Tegan Acton, Emma Pompetti, James Costa, Trevor Burgess, Sheri Sobrato, Jamie Wolf, Nathalie Seaver, Andrea van Beuren, and Jennifer Pelling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nothing says summer fun like a successfully paper-trained pup. Picking up where her Superman cameo left off, Supergirl zooms around the galaxy, enjoying the loosened inhibitions effects of being far from Earth's yellow sun. More surprisingly, Supergirl more closely recalls James Gunn's sci-fi exploits on Guardians Of The Galaxy than last year's Man of Steel reboot. Nevertheless, 2025's favorite CGI cutie, Krypto, links us to the previous film's misfit sensibility while Alcock drinks her way into the role. As to why Gunn is following Superman with Supergirl rather than a straight-ahead sequel, he says it came down to the script. “When Ana Nogueira wrote the Woman Of Tomorrow script, it was fantastic,” Gunn said at Supergirl‘s virtual press conference on Sunday. I said, ‘Have you seen this book by Tom King, Woman Of Tomorrow?' And I said, ‘You know who would be great? If you've seen that little blonde girl in House Of The Dragon, I think she would be great because it's a rock and roll Supergirl.

Superheroes have been through it in recent years, and plenty of blockbuster films have made it a habit to reflect that same emotional ethos. And while the returns have been mixed, from the dramatic highs of Christopher Nolan's “Dark Knight” franchise to the decidedly downbeat lows of Zack Snyder's own Batman stories, it seems that audiences are eager to get a little more lightness in their comic book tales. Could someone perhaps tap into both the darkness of being an all-powerful being in a wacky world and the relative fun of, well, that exact same thing? Consider Craig Gillespie‘s “Supergirl,” which is attempting to bridge both of those elements. Yes, being a superhero can be strange, but surely it's also fun? Milly Alcock stars in the titular role, as Kara Zor-El (aka Supergirl), who fans first got a glimpse of at the end of James Gunn's “Superman” earlier this year, where her existence as an unreliable party girl was teased in the film‘s post-credits. Related Stories ‘Goodbye June' Review: Kate Winslet's Directorial Debut Is a Star-Studded Christmas Weepie About How Death Can Bring a Family Back Together ‘Silent Night, Deadly Night' Review: Rohan Campbell Slays Nazi Scum in Twitchy Killer Santa Remake While her cousin Clark (aka Kal-El) loves to see the good in people, Kara is more prone to seeing the truth. No wonder their approach to the world is so very different, with Clark's Superman leaning hard into saving the world, while Kara seems intent on tuning it out. At a weekend event held in New York City, Gunn, Gillespie, and Alcock debuted the film's first trailer to an eager crowd, a first-look that provided both a bigger sense of Kara's world (yes, she's still partying pretty hard, but that looks less fun than it sounds, the whole thing screams “coping mechanism!”) and a better look at Alcock's flinty, funny performance as the reluctant superhero. This one, Gunn told the crowd is “different,” a standalone story about a truly messy female superhero that will stand on its own merits. Gillespie directs the film from a screenplay by Ana Nogueira. Alcock stars alongside Matthias Schoenaerts, Eve Ridley, David Krumholtz, Emily Beecham, and Jason Momoa. Warner Bros. will release the film in theaters and IMAX across North America on June 26, 2026. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The DC Studios co-chief spoke to influencers and media at a New York event ahead of the teaser trailer's drop Thursday Shit,” said Zor-El, as given human form by Milly Alcock. Supergirl has had a long flight to the present, having begun development in 2018, gotten postponed amid the pandemic in 2020, scrapped by new Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav in 2022 and then retooled as part of James Gunn's transitioning of the DCEU to the DCU in 2023. Hollywood Labor Comes Out Swinging Against Warner Bros.-Netflix Deal: "This Merger Must Be Blocked" That honor belonged to Sasha Calle, who even appeared in 2023's The Flash. But with Alcock and the directorial hand of Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) on board and the film now shot, Supergirl could finally begin its slow marketing rollout ahead of its theatrical release on June 26. In this incarnation, according to a teaser trailer showed at the hotel event and dropped online Thursday, Kara Zor-el is a universe-hopping party girl in her early 20s thrown into some intergalactic battles after a particularly self-pitying solitary birthday binge; she is on a mission of vengeance on behalf of the alien girl Ruthye and gets in deeper than she realizes. Ana Nogueira's script, inspired by the comic-book miniseries Supergirl: Women of Tomorrow by Tom King and Bilquis Evely, leans hard into the character's messiness. She's got a lot of demons, a lot of baggage coming into this, which is very different forms where superman is in his life,” Gillespie told the New York crowd. “Like male superheroes have been allowed to be for a while.” Only three days earlier its CEO Zaslav said Warner Bros. would be sold to Netflix, and the day after the event Paramount owner David Ellison would launch a hostile takeover bid for the studio, making the room feel a little like a bar mitzvah whose guests had just been told an asteroid was heading toward earth; sure, the world may end tomorrow, but tonight can't we just hang out and do the Dougie? And so more important matters were at hand: getting a new movie off on the right boot. But Gunn and Safran think a whole new day dawns. Safran believes the franchise is in a much different position than even six months ago, too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Love letters to cinema” are often so poisonously sweet they might as well be written in antifreeze. So when a deadly bitter streak administers Narcan to the film-addicted work of Chinese writer-director Bi Gan, it's invigorating—a blast of human frailty revitalizing his intoxicated ode to the movies. Bi believes in art, it's people he's not so sure about. Through five enrapturing and escalating chapters loosely based around the five senses, Resurrection strips its audience down and builds them back up again, revealing how we change the art we make, and how it changes us in turn. Since Kaili Blues, Bi has been using crime stories as backdrops for his more abstract interests in time, images, and the unconscious. A narrator (Shu Qi) takes us through this Deliriant's various imaginations, beginning with evocative silent pictures and evolving into flashily modern single-take wonders. It starts with the Deliriant in his most monstrous, garish form—a pitiable Lon Chaney creation built to stalk the German Expressionist shadows of an opium den—and culminates with his slickest—a lovestruck hoodlum slinking around a jaw-dropping oner on the cusp of a new millennium. Between are a washed-out, Dark City-like oddball noir obsessed with diegetic sound, which tears its way into Resurrection like color flooding Dorothy's arrival in Oz; a toothache-stricken ex-monk, left alone by looters in his old monastery, living through a frigid ghost story; and a lush con-artist drama, hinging upon lies you can smell. The narratives all give way to their tangible focus—ironic, considering this isn't shot in Smell-O-Vision and William Castle is long dead. Divided yet compounding as the totality of Resurrection unfolds, our sharpened senses catch onto the details of Bi's work, our awareness heightened around how many ways we can engage with the film in front of us, and movies in general. It's an ambitious undertaking, and one so single-mindedly obsessed with its medium that, like those “love letters,” it's inherently in danger of industry schmaltz or arthouse inscrutability. Minimal handholding sets this up, and the fable framework only adds another layer to chew on. And yet, Resurrection also tells one of the year's best fart jokes. Bi finds plenty to laugh at, mourn, and admire in his card sharps, disgraced holy men, grotesques, and gangland losers. It all comes to a head with that dockside delinquent meet-cute, New Year's Eve, 1999. Drenched in rain and the red light of its shady city district, Apollo (Yee) and Tai Zhaomei (Li Gengxi) traipse through their own hyper-ambitious version of Before Sunrise, naturally adding in some karaoke and bloodshed for good measure. As this showboating take unfurls, incorporating time-lapse footage before jolting back into normal speed, we get our biggest secondhand buzz from Bi. Resurrection separates out the ways we can love the movies, dividing its audience out into cinematic canopic jars, then reassembles us into a glorious whole for a finale that revels in our totality. Bi knows that, but he's also got faith that there are still a few dreamers out there willing to do things the hard way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Season 49 “Survivor” contestant Sophie Segreti has spoken about her close friendship with fellow player Sage Ahrens-Nichols and how the pair have mended their relationship since leaving the island. Sophie was speaking after being voted off the show and explained that she could have been more ruthless if it wasn't for the fact that she liked Sage so much. As part of her exit interview with Parade following her elimination from “Survivor,” Sophie discussed her friendship with Sage — something that had been noted by other contestants and many viewers. She revealed that the pair bonded quickly and became close, something that may well have affected how she played the game as it meant she was not willing to necessarily put her own needs above Sage's. Because if you remember that episode where Jawan goes home, I am kind of the one who is deciding between Jawan and Sage,” she reveals. I was playing a little bit with my heart, not gonna lie. However, Sophie admitted this may have been a problem as it meant that Sage was particularly upset by what she saw as a betrayal when Sophie voted to eliminate Jawan — the other person that Sage had developed a strong friendship with. Because, in doing so, because we had that close bond, in breaking her trust, it was so much worse. Whereas I feel like, if I betrayed Jawan, we didn't have as much capital in our relationship. And so it might not have hurt us badly.” Speaking about the relationship the pair now share since filming for the reality series ended, Sophie explained that they are “great now.” She also discussed how interesting it is to watch Sage play “Survivor” so well from the audience's perspective. “It's been so fun getting to watch her game on TV, because she is playing such an amazing strategic game,” says Sophie. “And I think because she really dances to the beat of her own drum, you can almost forget how strategic she is. She continued, “And so that's been lovely to see. I had to do a little bit more damage control when we all were back in the States. She really spearheaded ‘Operation Kick Sophie to the Curb.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aspiring country singer Alexis Wilkins has been outfitted with an elite SWAT security detail and enjoyed a romantic “date night” with Patel on taxpayers' dime. Now, new streaming data obtained by Rolling Stone shows significant boosts to her streams whenever Patel is making headlines. And whenever Patel finds himself at the center of a news cycle, there's a corresponding surge of people tuning in to Wilkins' music, according to music data provider Luminate and viewed by Rolling Stone. Patel has praised his girlfriend as a “country-music sensation” and justified the highly unusual move to provide security to a non-spouse of a government official by claiming Wilkins has faced hundreds of death threats related to her newfound publicity. The couple met three years ago in Nashville, with Wilkins telling Megyn Kelly that she was drawn to the then-director of Trump Media & Technology Group's integrity and honesty. Patel, 45, has similarly heaped praise on his “partner in life,” calling her a “true patriot.” After a string of singles, she released her first EP, Grit, through Saddle Up Records in April 2023. A few years later, she began giving away Constitutions for the Fourth of July, became a contributor to the conservative nonprofit group PragerU, spoke about the RNC for Newsmax, opened a show for Trumpworld favorite Lee Greenwood, and started singing at Turning Point USA-affiliated events. In late 2023, she stopped posting music to her Rumble account — except for her single “I Want My Country Back” — and pivoted to political commentary. But Wilkins has been simultaneously pushing her music career, which hit new levels this year — 508,000 streams across all online platforms to date versus 343,000 last year, according to Luminate — coinciding with Patel's public-facing role in the administration. Typically, Wilkins hovers between 4,500 and 7,000 weekly listeners, or a median of 6,300 streams each week, according to Luminate. But after a beaming Wilkins stood beside Patel at his swearing-in ceremony in February, that number skyrocketed to 105,300 streams, dovetailing to 17,400 and 10,600 streams in the following two weeks. Wilkins' numbers plateaued between 6,000 and 7,000 streams until around July 4, when Patel was scrutinized for a joint DOJ and FBI memo saying there was no evidence of a “client list” in the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein files. Online social media accounts began amplifying baseless conspiracy theories that Patel was compromised, accusing Wilkins of being a Mossad “honeypot” to manipulate Patel. Philo Is Quietly One of the Best Deals In Streaming (and It's Discounted Right Now) Apple TV's Black Friday Deal Gets You a Subscription for 54% Off Working with Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, she sang an a capella rendition of “God Bless the USA” at the University of Minnesota. Wilkins' weekly listeners dropped to some of their lowest numbers until November, when it was revealed Patel used a $60 million tax-funded private jet for a “date night” with Wilkins in late October. Not only had Patel made the trip during the 43-day government shutdown, but he had also repeatedly decried his predecessor for his private-jet use. (FBI Assistant Director for Public Affairs Ben Williamson said criticism was “disingenuous and dumb.”) Patel came under fire a few weeks later when it was reported he had assigned a SWAT security detail to protect Wilkins, allegedly screaming at a commander when agents left an assignment accompanying Wilkins to an NRA event early after determining the location was secure. It is unprecedented for a director's girlfriend to receive their own FBI security detail, both MS Now and The New York Times have reported. Taylor Swift's Last Album Sparked Bizarre Accusations of Nazism. And last weekend, MS Now reported that on at least two occasions, Patel ordered an FBI security detail to escort one of Wilkins' drunk friends home from the bar — a serious break from what is within the scope of a service members' duties.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The official trailer for The Moment, the new A24 movie starring and conceived by Charli XCX, is here. Following last month's teaser, the trailer further explores the movie's light satire of the Brat era, in which Charli clings to reason amid a whirlwind of bad advice and unscrupulous interlopers. Among them are a goofball live-show director played by Alexander Skarsgård—at one point, he instructs her to hide inside a giant lighter while the crew maintains a wide perimeter—as well as various friends, suits, and influencers, played by the likes of Kylie Jenner, Rachel Sennott, Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant, Hailey Benton Gates, and Jamie Demetriou. Watch the trailer below. Directed by Aidan Zamiri, The Moment is one of three Charli XCX films showing at Sundance Film Festival, which runs from from January 22 to February 1, 2026. (The other two are Olivia Wilde's The Gallerist and Gregg Araki's I Want Your Sex.) The Moment hits theaters everywhere on January 30. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift dropped by The Late Show to discuss her very good year — getting engaged, reclaiming her masters, releasing a new album, etc. The singer sat on Stephen Colbert's couch for the first time to promote her upcoming The End of an Era tour documentary as well as The Final Show concert film, both of which will land on Disney+ this Friday. “You've been so supportive over the years, even very early in my career, you would just say the nicest things,” Swift told Colbert. Colbert, who's leaving The Late Show in six months after almost 11 years, then asked Swift how she “comes down” following the lengthy Eras Tour. So I'm bread girl now, or ‘This isn't gonna cross-stitch itself.' “Getting engaged to the love of my life, getting all my music back, those were two things that just never could have happened. Both of those things could have just never arrived in my life, and I'm so grateful for both of those things happening.” The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time Colbert then told Swift about how John Fogerty, now 80, just reclaimed his Creedence Clearwater Revival masters, and how much it still meant to him. “It's the same feeling for me,” Swift said. “I used to have this very strange, conflicted feeling, like I'd hear the song ‘Ready for It,' and I'd be like, ‘Man, this song goes so hard,'” before crying to it. I don't want evidence that a music person lives here, except for my piano and my guitar, but the guitar's not hung in a prominent place,” Swift said. ‘Special day today, gonna go to the studio. Finally, Swift wrapped up her multi-segment interview by giving some thought to her own personal list of the Top Five Taylor Swift songs.

How Did 50 Cent Get That Sean Combs Footage? “This is so much pressure,” Swift said. “I'm gonna need some time to get back to you on all the five… I think Number One is ‘All Too Well' the 10-minute version… Somewhere on this list is gonna be a song called ‘Mirrorball' from the Folklore album.” Swift then said she'd come back after thinking on it and deliver her Top Five. “You have all the time between now and May,” Colbert quipped, referring to his Late Show exit. Swift then promised to appear on his inevitable podcast. Send us a tip using our anonymous form. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift was dressed in her festive best for a visit to “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” Wednesday night to promote her upcoming Disney+ docuseries, “The End of an Era.” The “Life of a Showgirl” singer wore a burgundy velvet David Koma dress with a sculptural off-the-shoulder silhouette, along with matching Aquazzura pumps in the same lush fabric. Swift kept the cranberry color palette going with her elegant diamond-and-ruby necklace, and finished her late-night look with a delicate opal bracelet. The superstar's latest outfit is right in line with her “Showgirl” aesthetic, marked by luxe materials and Vegas-worthy sparkle. Whether in the spotlight to promote her own projects or in the stands cheering on her fiancé, NFL tight end Travis Kelce, Swift is dressing to impress and inspire. On Sunday, the “Honey” singer wore a holiday-ready herringbone Miu Miu jacket to cheer on the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. While the team ultimately lost to the Houston Texans, Swift and her longtime “squad” members, Selena Gomez and Lena Dunham, were on hand to provide moral support to the Kansas City crew. As for what's next in Swift's wild week? But there's no sleep for Swifties this weekend — and that includes your favorite Page Swift editors, too. Here's hoping “Colbert” helped the singing superstar warm up for this busy weekend of revelry — and that Swift has time to rest up for her big, bridal year in 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Dancing with the Stars” Season 33 alum Jenn Tran, who competed alongside professional dancer Sasha Farber, shared a glimpse into what she has been up to these days, and she looks incredible! Tran posted several photos on Instagram showing her at events, eating tasty food, attending conferences, and getting glammed up by a makeup team. She also posted several other pictures of this dress, so fans can see it from all angles. The comment section has come alive and fans have been eager to share their thoughts. “Jenn tran has never owned a bad dress in her life,” another person shared. Other reactions include, “Love your dress that you wore at the Nylon party!! She is not only fashionable but daring, and at times, she has opted for dresses and tops that look like they could easily slip down, like many of the dresses she wore on “The Bachelor” season starring Joey Graziadei, and later her own “The Bachelorette” season. Interestingly, Tran and Graziadei were on DWTS at the same time, and while she placed seventh, he went on to win the Mirrorball Trophy in Season 33. She discussed her outfits in an interview with Parade in August 2024, and revealed how she avoided wardrobe malfunctions by using “so many different boobage [aids]” and noting that for each dress, “you accommodate accordingly.” When starring on “The Bachelorette,” Tran had wowed with her gorgeous dresses, and she is definitely a fan of dressing up. “My closet is full of dresses that I probably have never worn. She continued, “It's really nice because my friends come over and they always have a dress for whatever occasion that they need.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift either has too many, or not enough songs. With that quiz, Swift joined the esteemed company of Dolly Parton, Elton John, Paul Simon and Bruce Springsteen. For Swift, it's just a matter of time before she gets the Rock Hall call. Therapy, Meds and Visits to the Beach: Comeback Kid Lewis Capaldi Talks Lifestyle Changes Taylor Swift Says 'Hey Stephen' to Colbert in Cute Backstage Video Ahead of 'Late Show' Visit “This is so much pressure,” she told the Colbert. Party pooper alert: the “Shake It Off” singer requested a “little time to get back to” Colbert for the definitive list. “Because I don't have enough, see,” she continued. “I think I require a little bit of time to like, appreciate my work in a way… and it's constantly changing, right. Swift was able to select her first choice, “All Too Well,” the 10-minute version, which was released as part of the re-recorded Red (Taylor's Version) from November 2021. Swift also selected “Mirrorball” from 2020's Folklore album, but admitted she “can't really do any of the others.” Colbert, with the type of delivery that was so sharp and fast, he could hurt a person, remarked: “You've got all the time you need between now and May.” That timeframe is a firm one, after which the award-winning host is set to be taken off CBS' airwaves. Watch Taylor Swift's top 5 challenge with Stephen Colbert below. For her first return to The Late Show since 2021, Swift made an adorable TikTok video with Colbert backstage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Swift last appeared on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert in 2021. The jangly country-pop song was never released as a single, but it did crack the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. “Don't flatter yourself,” she quipped at the time, going on to joke that it was actually about author Stephen King. And don't even get me started on his short stories.” In fact, Swift has previously confirmed that the titular love interest was Stephen Barker Liles from country duo Love and Theft, who opened for her in 2008, even spelling out the name of his group in the Fearless liner notes as further proof.
