                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And  thanks to a study published in Heritage Science, we now know a little bit more about the secrets of one alchemist in particular. It turns out that Tycho Brahe, mostly known for his study of astronomy, had his own basement laboratory for mixing medicines—including some particular elements. But recently, a team of researchers from the University of Southern Denmark and National Museum of Denmark analyzed five shards rescued from what would have been the site's old garden between 1988 and 1990. It's believed those shards came from the basement alchemical laboratory. The authors examined cross sections of the shards for 31 trace elements using mass spectrometry by converting sample molecules into charged ions. While there was plenty of the expected elements on the shards (four of which were glass and one of which was ceramic)—including nickel, copper, zin, tin, antimony, gold, mercury, and lead—there was one find that surprised the experts: tungsten. “Tungsten is very mysterious,” Kaare Lund Rasmussen, archaeometry expert at the University of Southern Denmark, said in a statement. “Tungsten had not even been described at that time, so what should we infer from its presence on a shard from Tycho Brahe's alchemy workshop?” Rasmussen said that while tungsten does occur naturally in certain minerals, and could have made its way into Brahe's laboratory that way, there's another plausible theory: Brahe had a secret substance to help create his medicines for Europe's elite. Not classified as an element until the 1780s, tungsten likely first popped up in German chemistry as ‘Wolfram,' and Brahe's medicine were known to have German influence. “Maybe Tycho Brahe had heard about this and thus knew of tungsten's existence,” Rasmussen speculated. “But this is not something we know or can say based on the analyses I have done. It is merely a possible theoretical explanation for why we find tungsten in the samples.” “Most intriguing are the elements found in higher concentrations than expected,” Rasmussen said, “indicating enrichment and providing insight into the substances used in Tycho Brahe's alchemical laboratory.” The business of creating medicines was a secret one. “It may seem strange that Tycho Brahe was involved in both astronomy and alchemy, but when one understands his worldview, it makes sense,” said Poul Grinder-Hansen, senior researcher and museum curator at the National Museum of Denmark, in a statement. In this thinking, gold was a common ingredient for medicines of the day, including ones Brahe took. Where tungsten fits into the mix, however, isn't clear.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Carolina is the epicenter of what state officials call an “accelerating” measles outbreak. Hundreds of people are in quarantine, and the outbreak has sickened at least 111 individuals, most of whom—105—were not vaccinated against the disease. Each of these outbreaks has brought the country ever closer to losing its measles-free status after more than 25 years. At least two children have died of measles in the current outbreaks. Measles vaccines are generally given as part of the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot, two doses of which are 97 percent effective against the disease.

As part of that effort, the MMR vaccine is required for children to attend public school throughout the country, but many states offer parents the choice to exempt their child for religious or personal reasons. In a media briefing yesterday, South Carolina's state epidemiologist Linda Bell said that vaccination levels there were simply “lower than hoped for.” The state has seen vaccination rates of its schools' students decline from almost 96 percent in 2020 to 93.5 percent in 2025—for context, robust herd immunity from measles requires about 95 percent of the population to be vaccinated, according to the World Health Organization. Both Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and President Donald Trump have criticized the shot, suggesting it should be broken up into separate jabs and linking it, without evidence, to autism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a rate of mutation 35 percent higher than random chance, this previously unknown weakness could be a major vector for inherited disease. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Mutations, malformities, and strange fusions can cause a variety of birth defects and other kinds of biological strangeness (such as chimerism). “Finding a new source of mutations, particularly those affecting the human germline, doesn't happen often.” This is similar to chimerism in some respects, but mosaic mutations occur from a single zygote, whereas chimerism  typically involves the fusion of two fertilized eggs that create different cell lines. While chimera cells are typically present throughout the entire body, these mosaic mutations are not as evenly distributed, which is why they've remained undetected until now. However, if offspring inherit these genetic changes, they can carry over to every living cell and cause a variety of health issues and defects. To uncover this well-hidden vulnerability, scientists relied on the Genome Aggregation Database (which gathers genomic data from a variety of human sequencing projects) and the U.K. Biobank to create a pool of some 225,000 transcription start sites. This data was then cross-referenced with eleven family studies that provided details about mosaic mutations specifically. Within these vulnerable TSS regions, researchers found mutations in the starting regions of genes impacting cancer, brain function, and abnormal limb development. Rare variants of mutations (typically indicating a recent genetic change) contained a particularly strong concentration of mutations, but those changes lessened in more common variants. This suggests that natural selection slowly removed these mutations, and over generations in particular families, they eventually disappeared entirely. This research could help improve the challenging study of mosaic mutations, which are hard to pinpoint compared to mutations present in every parent cell. “If a model doesn't know this region is naturally mutation-rich, it might expect, say, 10 mutations but observe 50. If the correct baseline is 80, then 50 means fewer than expected and is a sign harmful changes are being removed by natural selection,” Weghorn said in a press statement. “You would completely miss the importance of that gene.” A zygote's first moment of existence is one of chaos and a building pressure to grow, divide, and grow again. While cells can often repair errors that pop up, some mistakes get left behind. Divers Couldn't Believe a Lost Shipwreck's Age Why One Side of Earth Is Rapidly Getting Colder</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The discovery's highlight was a 247-pound cannon from the Ming dynasty, but archaeologists also found remains of crops and turquoise pieces. This formidable weapon shows the military focus of the Great Wall while also offering insight into how ancient Chinese and Europeans traded military know-how. A brick-by-brick restoration of the wall offered an opportunity to excavate the Jiankou section, which spans across a mountainous region near Beijing. Archaeologists excavated three watchtowers and the connecting walls, all of which held remnants of both military and daily life from China's past. The most distinct find, according to Shang Heng, associate research fellow at the Beijing Institute of Archaeology, was a Ming Dynasty-era cannon likely from 1632. “This provides crucial physical proof of Chinese-Western military technology exchange,” Heng said, according to the Global Times. Beyond the cannon, crews also uncovered storage rooms used by troops stationed on the wall, including a heated brick bed and stove in Watchtower 118 which demonstrates how soldiers would have lived. Watchtower 117 featured an immigration monument dated to 1573 C.E., giving a construction date for that section. Two bricks included inscriptions noting weight specifications, upending previous beliefs on how Ming-era brick kiln operations occurred. Investigations into the lime mortar showed a high-magnesium lime mixture with plant fibers to help with adhesion, further defining Ming-era construction techniques. The third brick inscription wasn't so much about construction techniques but living conditions. The words, translated as “nothing but alcohol or worry; three years of toil turned my hair white,” were likely inscribed by a wall builder. “These findings transform the Great Wall from a cold military structure into a living historical landscape integrating defense, cultural exchange, and daily life,” Heng said. The excavations offered more than just weapons and other staples of military life. Crews discovered 28 turquoise artifacts, according to the People's Daily. Within one of the most famous fortifications in the world were remnants of lives lived long ago, and further excavations may offer even more insights. “The Great Wall's landscape and geography have barely changed,” Heng said, “making it ideal for time-travel-style restoration research.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

Young people in Australia can no longer use popular social media platforms.Credit: David Gray/AFP via Getty This week, Australia became the first country to ban children aged under 16 from using most social media platforms. Other countries including France, Denmark and Spain have introduced social media restrictions for young people, or announced plans to, but no policy is as far reaching as Australia's. The government there says social media is harming young people's mental health, causing teens to lose sleep because of addictive design features, and exposing them to harmful content. Researchers say the evidence that social media causes harm is mixed. They'll also be surveying the children's parents about problematic internet and social media use. Another research collaboration between The Kids Research Institute Australia, The University of Western Australia and Edith Cowan University, all in Perth, will also examine whether the new laws are presenting new parenting challenges, and what family conflicts have arisen as a result. But she says it might be hard to tell whether any changes following the ban are a direct result of the policy or other policies designed to make the internet safer, such as new industry standards for technology companies to prevent exposing children to sexually explicit or violent content on the internet, which will start later this month. These measures are about keeping children on social media and ensuring they have positive experiences. Zareh Ghazarian, a political scientist at Monash University who studies role of social media in young people's political development, says online platforms can be an important way young people engage with politics. Now that the ban is in place, he plans to interview teachers to find out how it is affecting students' political knowledge, and what alternate platforms they are turning too. “Part of education is to be able to engage with issues and ideas that may not be covered in the classroom – and that was the benefit social media was bringing,” he says.

But until now, models have sometimes struggled to forecast extreme weather events that they've never seen before, but that are happening more frequently as the planet warms. One new approach that's showing success combines an AI model with a conventional climate model, plus mathematical tools that describe rare events, to forecast weather extremes more effectively. In early tests, this hybrid approach simulated the probabilities of extreme heatwaves as accurately as the older, non-AI method, which takes much longer to run1. Extreme weather can be particularly dangerous when it goes beyond what people usually experience. AI models might be working with only 40 years of training data but need to forecast a weather extreme that happens just once every 1,000 years. They were surprised and impressed to find that one of them, the GraphCast model developed by Google DeepMind in London, would have accurately forecast the event eight days before it occurred2. But things didn't work as well when the scientists looked at tropical cyclones. A different AI weather model, FourCastNet, developed by NVIDIA in Santa Clara, California, struggled to forecast the strongest tropical cyclones when it had no extreme storms in its training set3. That seemed like bad news, but the researchers did spot a glimmer of hope. It could basically improve its regional forecasts by translating information to different parts of the globe. The scientists combined it with a physics-based global climate model, plus a mathematical method for analysing the statistics of rare events, to see whether they could predict mid-latitude heatwaves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Their work shows that the ability to connect cues with rewarding outcomes can be strengthened or weakened when this protein becomes more or less active. "Our ability to link certain cues or stimuli with positive or rewarding experiences is a basic brain process, and it is disrupted in many conditions such as addiction, depression, and schizophrenia," says Alexey Ostroumov, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacology & Physiology at Georgetown University School of Medicine and senior author of the study. By interfering with this mechanism, addictive substances can hijack the learning process." When KCC2 levels are reduced, dopamine neurons fire more rapidly, which encourages the formation of new reward associations. To better understand this relationship, researchers studied rodent brain tissue and monitored the behavior of rats during Pavlovian cue-reward tests. Beyond analyzing how KCC2 affects the pace of neuron firing, the investigators discovered that neurons firing in a coordinated pattern can amplify dopamine activity in a surprising way. "Preventing even relatively benign drug-induced associations with situations or places, or restoring healthy learning mechanisms, can help develop better treatments for addiction and related disorders." The researchers also examined whether drugs that act on specific cellular receptors, including benzodiazepines such as diazepam, could alter learning processes. The current study adds another layer to this understanding by showing that neurons do more than increase or decrease activity. The team found that diazepam can support this coordinated activity in their experiments. Methods and the Importance of Using Rats for Behavioral Tests "To reach our conclusions, we combined many experimental approaches, including electrophysiology, pharmacology, fiber photometry, behavior, computational modeling, and molecular analyses," says the study's first author Joyce Woo, a PhD candidate in Ostroumov's lab. She explained that rats were chosen for the behavioral portion of the research because they typically perform more consistently than mice on longer and more complex tasks. Their reliability in reward-learning experiments allowed the research team to gather more stable and informative data. "We believe these discoveries extend beyond basic learning research," says Ostroumov. "They reveal new ways the brain regulates communication between neurons. And because this communication can go wrong in different brain disorders, our hope is that by preempting these disruptions, or by fixing normal communication when it's impaired, we can help develop better treatments for a wide range of brain disorders." Additional Georgetown contributors include Ajay Uprety, Daniel Reid, Irene Chang, Aelon Ketema Samuel, Helena de Carvalho Schuch and Caroline C Swain. Ostroumov and his co-authors report having no personal financial interests related to the study. Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.
