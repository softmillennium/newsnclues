                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dec 11 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan said on Thursday that it issued a U.S. commercial paper for Galaxy Digital Holdings on the Solana blockchain, ​marking an important step in the broader institutional adoption of digital assets. Cryptocurrency ‌exchange Coinbase Global and investment management firm Franklin Templeton purchased the commercial paper, a short term and ‌unsecured debt instrument. The deal is among the earliest that uses blockchain for the issue and service of securities, which J.P. Morgan called a "global milestone", as traditional finance begins to intersect with the new technology. Blockchain ‌platforms, such as Solana which was founded in 2017 and launched its mainnet three years later, have seen a keen interest from ‍the legacy finance institutions due to their high speed and low transaction costs. The "landmark transaction is an important step toward building the future of finance, demonstrating institutional adoption of digital assets ​and our capability to securely bring new instruments on-chain in a complex legal ‌and regulatory environment via Solana," said Scott Lucas, Head of Markets Digital Assets at J.P. Morgan, in a statement. Prior issuances on J.P. Morgan's private, permissioned blockchain platform include a municipal securities offering for the City of Quincy in April 2024 and a U.S. commercial paper issuance for Oversea‑Chinese Banking Corporation in August 2025. "In the ⁠first half of next year, we intend to ​build on this momentum by exploring how this ​structure and J.P. Morgan's role in it can be expanded, not just in terms of the investor and issuer base but also security ‍type," Lucas said. Both the issuance and redemption proceeds will be paid in USDC, ⁠a stablecoin issued by Circle. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to track the value of a real‑world currency, typically ‌the U.S. dollar.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When businesses decide to engage with crypto, they quickly discover the landscape is fragmented across numerous blockchains. If they want to move assets between different chains, they must often rely on a technology called bridging that can prove insecure and expensive. Philipp Zentner, cofounder and CEO of LI.FI, created his company to address these issues. The startup provides businesses with price comparisons of exchange rates and bridging fees. It also aims to find businesses the most efficient and cost-effective pathway for each transaction. “[We're] a competitive price comparison and transaction pathfinding for businesses in crypto finance.” The businesses that LI.FI partners with are fintechs, brokerage apps, trading desks, wallets, and neobanks. The startup has more than 800 partners, including Robinhood, Binance, and Kraken. The company says that its value proposition is that its service allows companies to go to market faster and saves them time on research, integration, and maintenance. It has $8 billion in monthly transaction volume as of October, which is about seven times more than its monthly volume from a year prior. “As crypto trading becomes a core feature inside mainstream fintech apps, the hardest problem is…making fragmented blockchains, liquidity, and execution work seamlessly together,” said Spencer Applebaum, investment partner at Multicoin Capital, in a statement. Zentner says with the new capital he also aims to hire more employees. FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is important for your customers to receive timely and relevant information to support decisions about their finances, while having their direct marketing preferences and data protection rights respected. Under the framework set out in the FCA's policy statement (PS25/22), authorised firms would be able to offer a new type of help called ‘targeted support' and make suggestions to an individual based on them being in a group of consumers with common characteristics. These could include customers who may be currently drawing down on their pension unsustainably, not saving enough for retirement, or who could be in a position to invest some of their cash savings. Targeted support aims to help consumers navigate their financial lives and tackle some of the difficult financial decisions we all face: how to save; invest; and prepare for a comfortable retirement. Data protection law enables people's personal information to be used in ways that empower and benefit them, while safeguarding their rights. The ICO's regulatory approach supports this, seeking to create an environment in which people are protected, while ensuring that organisations which process personal information can operate and innovate efficiently and responsibly 1. ICO guidance explains how the soft opt-in can be used to send marketing by electronic mail. Under the soft opt-in you can only send electronic mail marketing about similar products and services that people would reasonably expect to receive. When a message is not direct marketing, it can be communicated to all customers, including those who have opted out of direct marketing, not consented, or when no ‘soft opt-in' opportunity was available. You can engage with your customers about targeted support, so that customers can find out how you support effective decision making and better financial outcomes, while ensuring the UK GDPR, the Data Protection Act 2018 and PECR are complied with. You can promote targeted support to all of your customers in ways which are not covered by direct marketing rules and PECR. These types of messages can be broadcast to all customers and can be promotional and marketing material so long as the messaging is not directed at any one particular individual. When customers are seeking to give or change their direct marketing and/or targeted support permissions, they must be given clearly communicated options, which may cover the different types of processing and messages you envisage. You can also remind people about their direct marketing and targeted support preferences, if the reminder forms a minor and incidental addition to a message that you are sending anyway. The content must be for another purpose and not include marketing material. For example, an annual statement that includes a message at the end saying how a customer can update their preferences for direct marketing and targeted support (but not encouraging them to change their mind). For some customers, you may already have appropriate direct marketing permissions to send targeted support messages. As this is a new processing activity, you will need to consider how you comply with data protection requirements such as having an appropriate lawful basis for the underlying processing of personal data (likely consent or legitimate interest), provide clear information about the processing and give customers a way to opt out. Engaging customers who have not provided permission to receive  electronic direct marketing Where customers have not consented to receiving electronic direct marketing, and the soft opt in does not apply, you must respect the direct marketing preferences of your customers. You could do this by sending a message (eg an email) to customers which doesn't constitute direct marketing but ensures customers are aware of your targeted support authorisation from the FCA so that the customer can choose, if they wish, to be part of it. The ICO and FCA have previously produced joint statements 3 on examples of messages which are important for supporting all customers along their financial journey, such as: 1 The ICO will take fair, proportionate and timely regulatory action to protect people's information rights. When considering whether a regulatory response is necessary, we will take into account any steps organisations have taken in good faith to comply with the law and to protect people from harm. While every case is different, the ICO will always use its powers in a robust, targeted and proportionate manner, ensuring that organisations are not concerned that the ICO may impose disproportionate sanctions. We have called for urgent improvements across UK local authorities and Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland after warning that people trying to access their own care records are being let down. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a series of enforcement notices and practice recommendations to several public authorities after identifying significant failures to comply with the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 2000. But our goal is always broader: to raise standards across entire sectors. That means choosing the right regulatory tools to hold decision-makers accountable, set clear expectations, and secure lasting improvements. We have issued an enforcement notice to South Wales Police (SWP) over serious delays in handling subject access requests (SARs). We have fined Carmarthenshire sole trader Bharat Singh Chand £200,000 for sending almost one million spam texts about debt solutions and energy saving grants.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We have fined password manager provider LastPass UK Ltd £1.2 million following a 2022 data breach that compromised the personal information of up to 1.6 million of its UK users. There is no evidence that hackers were able to unencrypt customer passwords as these are stored locally on customer devices and not by LastPass. The incidents occurred in August 2022 when a hacker gained access first to a corporate laptop of an employee based in Europe and then to a US-based employee's personal laptop on which the hacker implanted malware and then was able to capture the employee's master password. The combined detail from both incidents enabled the hacker to access LastPass' backup database and take personal information which included customer names, emails, phone numbers, and stored website URLs. However, as is clear from this incident, businesses offering these services should ensure that system access and use is restricted to ensure risks of attack are significantly reduced. “I call on all UK business to take note of the outcome of this investigation and urgently review their own systems and procedures to make sure, as best as possible, that they are not leaving their customers and themselves exposed to similar risks”. Our investigation found no evidence that encrypted passwords and other credentials were able to be unencrypted by the hacker. We urge organisations to ensure internal security policies explicitly consider and address data breach risks. Where risks are identified access should be restricted to specific user groups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Norges Bank pauses Norway CBDC launch, citing a strong digital payments system while keeping options open amid Europe's crypto shift. The bank said its infrastructure serves consumers and banks without major gaps, so a digital currency is not required for now. It added that ongoing work will still examine how a CBDC could support financial stability, privacy protections and settlement efficiency if future needs arise. Norges Bank emphasized that payments in Norway already rely heavily on electronic rails, which reduces the urgency to introduce a digital alternative to cash. Officials noted that the system handles both retail and interbank transactions with high reliability, so any shift must offer clear benefits. The decision lands as crypto adoption widens across Europe and regulators weigh the role of public digital money alongside private tokens and stablecoins. Norway's move signals that strong domestic systems can delay CBDC rollouts even as neighboring countries advance pilots. Norges Bank said it will monitor how digital assets, stablecoins and cross-border settlement tools evolve under European rules. The bank also plans further studies on tokenization and resilience in case private digital money gains more traction. This update positions Norway as a cautious participant in the wider shift toward blockchain-based financial infrastructures, while keeping open the option of a future CBDC if market conditions or technology change.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Large cryptocurrency mines consumed 14.7 million megawatt hours of electricity in 2024, according to public records obtained by SAN. Proponents say Bitcoin mine “flexibility” helps the grid, but some experts believe the industry's growth is a factor in higher consumer costs. A Straight Arrow News investigation found that in 2024, large cryptocurrency operations in Texas consumed more electricity mining virtual currencies such as Bitcoin than residential utility customers in the cities of San Antonio and El Paso combined. That corresponds to about 3% of all electricity produced on the state's power grid in 2024. Download the SAN app today to stay up-to-date with Unbiased. Insiders from the Bitcoin industry told SAN it is misleading to compare their electricity consumption to Texas cities because cryptocurrency mines turn off when electricity prices are high. But not all electricity market analysts outside the cryptomining industry are convinced; some said Bitcoin is a factor in rising consumer prices. Texas has become a major hub of the Bitcoin mining industry, and the state government has even purchased $5 million of Bitcoin. However, as the industry has grown, so too have concerns among residents and state lawmakers over rising demand on the power grid. SAN's analysis found that the amount of electricity consumed by cryptocurrency mines is equal to residential utility customers in the city of San Antonio, the El Paso area and another mid-sized Texas city, such as Garland, where residents consumed over 908,000 megawatt hours of electricity in 2024. While megawatt hours measure how much electricity is consumed over time, megawatts show how much power a facility can consume in an instant. In the next two years, it's expected to rise another 20%. In 2024, cryptocurrency mines in Texas consumed more than 14.7 million megawatt hours of electricity, enough to power over a million homes for a year. The Texas legislature passed Senate Bill 1929 in 2023, requiring virtual currency mining operations with a capacity of 75 megawatts or more to file registration forms with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUC). SAN filed another public records request seeking totals from all registered facilities, foregoing information on specific cryptocurrency mines or companies. That request yielded the electricity consumption data reported in this investigation. As part of this investigation, SAN contacted several of the largest known cryptocurrency companies in the state, including Riot Platforms and MARA, formerly Marathon Digital Holdings. Daniel Batten, a Bitcoin investor and advisory board member for MARA, told SAN that without context, the comparison of Bitcoin mining consumption to various Texas cities is “highly misleading.” “Bitcoin mining is by economic necessity a non-rival consumer of energy,” Batten said. Cryptocurrency mining is “flexible” and can turn its energy consumption up or down depending on economic factors, given the price of electricity and the price of Bitcoin. Through this flexible operation, Batten said cryptocurrency mines “not only help stabilize the grid, they also provide additional revenue for renewable energy operators, which has been shown to accelerate the green energy transition.” Spencer Marr, co-founder and president at Sangha Renewables, a company launching a 20-megawatt Bitcoin mine that will consume excess solar power behind-the-meter at a facility near Odessa, said “Bitcoin mining operations tend to concentrate where there is an oversupply of power.” Some studies have shown that cryptocurrency mining can incentivize renewable energy development, while others have demonstrated the potential for large flexible loads to help stabilize the grid. Critics, however, view those programs, which pay cryptocurrency companies a premium to participate, as exploitative rather than beneficial. Very little real-world data exists to demonstrate the extent of voluntary cuts to power consumption outside of organized ERCOT demand response programs. That applies to cryptocurrency miners on the ERCOT grid,” said Ed Hirs, an energy economist and lecturer at the University of Houston. “Any cryptocurrency miners on ERCOT using electricity are market demand over and above that of regular Texans.” Hirs told SAN that without Bitcoin on the grid, overall electricity demand would be lower, as would reliance on some of the power plants that currently operate day in and day out. “Any cryptocurrency miners on ERCOT using electricity are market demand over and above that of regular Texans,” he said. Daniel Cohan, a professor at Rice University who has researched energy policy, said the electricity consumption data shows crypto mines are “likely propping up wholesale prices and natural gas use on mild days.” Cohan said more precise data would be needed to estimate the exact price impact for consumers. While some Bitcoin companies like Sangha Renewables are co-located with solar power, others like MARA's facility in Hood County are co-located with natural gas power plants. Rising electricity use by cryptocurrency mining operations in Texas is impacting the state's power grid and raising questions about consequences for consumers and infrastructure planning. Large-scale Bitcoin mining in Texas is using more electricity than entire cities, influencing overall grid demand and prompting debate over the associated economic and infrastructure costs. Industry representatives argue flexible mining operations can help stabilize the energy grid, while critics and analysts highlight potential pressures on market prices and grid reliability, impacting utility costs for consumers. Recent regulatory efforts in Texas to track and disclose cryptocurrency mining operations reflect concerns over transparency, security, and the need for informed energy policy as the sector grows.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Norway is hitting pause on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and I have to say, it actually makes sense. They're not diving headfirst into the digital currency pool just because everyone else is doing it. Norges Bank, Norway's central bank, is saying that their current payment systems are already reliable and speedy enough. So, they don't feel the need for a digital krone, at least not right now. This is their way of saying that they want to make sure whatever new technology they adopt is stable and secure. To break it down: - No Rush: They don't see an urgent need for a CBDC, given their existing systems work just fine. - Wait-and-See: They're taking their time, unlike Sweden and the European Central Bank. Debit cards, mobile wallets, and bank-driven payment channels are everywhere. But there are risks involved if they decide to go for it. Like, what if all deposits move from banks to a CBDC? And, think about bank runs—converting deposits into digital currency would be way too easy. Norges Bank isn't completely done with digital currency. They're planning to publish a technical report about their research on things like tokenization frameworks and alternative settlement layers. This just shows that there's still room for innovation while keeping the current systems functional. Fintech startups need to ask themselves if their products are really filling gaps in the market. As digital finance changes, CBDCs aren't just about cash. They should build things that make systems stronger and think about backup plans for digital payments. Norway's cautious research-first approach is a great lesson for fintech startups. Startups should think about how CBDCs can work with their products to make payments better for everyone. By using CBDC platforms to innovate, they can keep things competitive and stop a few big players from taking over. Norway's measured pace on CBDCs shows that it's wise to be careful rather than hasty. For startups, it's a matter of focusing on real needs, following the rules, and being open to innovation in a traditional banking world.

By using the ISO 20022 messaging standard, the partners say they can make tokenised deposits interoperable with legacy systems

Ant International, HSBC and Swift have successfully tested cross-border transfers of tokenised deposits using an international financial messaging standard, in a move that could streamline global blockchain-based payments and corporate treasury management.

The milestone, announced on Thursday, marked the first case leveraging the Swift network and ISO 20022 as a messaging standard in cross-border payments using tokenised deposits.

The standard is a universal language for exchanging electronic data in financial business transactions.

In the test, Singapore-based Ant International and HSBC connected Ant's blockchain infrastructure to Swift's network, allowing real-time cross-border treasury management between HSBC Singapore and Hong Kong through the bank's tokenised deposit services.

Meanwhile, Swift and HSBC introduced a common protocol that removed the need for Ant International to establish individual bilateral arrangements with banks.

“[This] ISO 20022-enabled solution allows blockchain interoperability on Swift's network, using Ant International's technology and HSBC's Tokenised Deposit Service,” the three firms said in a joint statement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>December saw another great leap forward for the UAE's growing status as a global Digital Asset Hub with the announcement of Crypto.com's Strategic Partnership with Sirius International Holding (SIH), the technology investment arm of International Holdings Company (IHC). Their shared aim will be building and enhancing the digital asset/tokenization ecosystems in both areas. Sirius International Holding, founded in 2022 and headquartered in Abu Dhabi, has positioned itself at the forefront of the UAE's digital transformation initiatives. Crypto.com, Binance, and Bybit received UAE licenses due to the country's zero personal income tax, attractive corporate tax rates, and transparent regulatory structure. Analysts believe the tokenization business is valued at $30 trillion with institutional adoption growing rapidly in advanced financial hubs. Sirius International Holding has taken sovereign blockchain and digital finance as an integral part of our investment strategy. The company channels resources into infrastructure that transforms how governments and enterprises handle digital transactions. Sirius gets access to one of the world's largest cryptocurrency platforms, Crypto.com, with its large user base and technology infrastructure. Sirius operates in an ecosystem comprising over fifty government and industry efforts in 20 countries, ranging from real estate tokenization to blockchain banking. This partnership announcement coincides with what industry observers are calling a blockbuster month for cryptocurrency activity in the UAE. In December 2025, Emirates held more than 50,000 international guests at 8 key crypto conferences and summits, allowing key industry executives, institutional investors and policymakers to network as never before. Recent market data indicates that stablecoins account for over 90% of crypto payments to professionals in the region. Sirius International Holdings and Crypto.com have partnered to accelerate the movement of the Middle East from a largely retail-driven crypto marketplace to one that is based on institutional-level infrastructure. This collaboration seeks to leverage Crypto.com's established global presence and technological capabilities with Sirius' connections to government and sovereign digital infrastructure development to promote widespread adoption of blockchain technology within both governments and large enterprises. Partnerships such as this show how the UAE's legislative and regulatory framework is supporting bridging the gap between blockchain technology and conventional financial institutions. This approach is supporting the growth of an institutionally built, and vibrant, digital asset marketplace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and top altcoins suffered a harsh reversal today, Dec. 11, as concerns about the Federal Reserve forward guidance resumed. BTC dropped below $90,000, erasing some of the gains made earlier this week. Similarly, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, and Chainlink prices were down by over 3% in the last 24 hours. Also, the market capitalization of all coins dropped by 2.64% to ~$3.02 trillion. The main reason why Bitcoin and altcoins like Solana, Dogecoin, XRP, Cardano, and Chainlink are going down is the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, which happened on Wednesday. On QE, the bank will start buying short-term government bonds worth $40 billion a month, a move that will lead to more liquidity in the market. However, the bank's dot plot pointed to just one interest rate cut in 2026, which was lower than what analysts were expecting. Indeed, Donald Trump is interviewing candidates for the Fed Chair role this week, with most analysts favoring Kevin Hassett. Hassett has insisted that rates needs to go down substantially. Bitcoin and most altcoins were up earlier this week as investors waited for the upcoming Fed rate decision. Top altcoins like XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, and Chainlink are dropping today as demand for these tokens wanes. The index has dropped as most altcoins have plunged, with the top laggards being DoubleZero, Story, MYX Finance, Pudgy Penguins, Celestia, Ethena, Worldcoin, and Pyth Network. The performance is a sign that investors are favoring Bitcoin, while demand for altcoins has tumbled in the past few months. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that Bitcoin positions worth over $175 million were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Some of the other top liquidated tokens were XRP, Dogecoin, Chainlink, and Zcash. In line with this, Bitcoin and most altcoins dropped as the futures open interest dropped by nearly 1% in the last 24 hours to $132 billion. Looking ahead, there is a likelihood that these altcoins will rebound as the post-Federal Reserve drop was likely a knee-jerk reaction from investors. Besides, a look beneath the surface shows that altcoin ETFs have continued to accumulate assets in the past few days, with Chainlink adding $2.5 million and Solana funds adding $4.85 million.

An early Bitcoin investor nicknamed “1011short” has expanded an Ethereum long position to 120,094 ETH, valued at $392.5 million, on Hyperliquid, according to data tracked by Lookonchain.

The position faces liquidation at $2,234 per ETH. The trader has been actively trading Ethereum in recent months and recently bet on renewed upward momentum.

Ethereum was trading at around $3,260 at press time, down from its daily high of $3,400, per CoinGecko. The decline extended following the Fed's decision to lower interest rates by 25 basis points.

Analysts suggest, however, that the pullback may reflect a sell-the-news reaction, given that markets had widely anticipated the rate cut.
