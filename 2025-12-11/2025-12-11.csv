            • Venezuelan opposition leader speaks: María Corina Machado said the US helped her get to Norway to receive her Nobel Peace Prize. It comes as Washington exerts pressure on the authoritarian government of President Nicolás Maduro.
    


            • Vow to return: Machado, who had been in hiding in Venezuela, said that her country will soon be “democratic and free.” She also spoke of her “duty” to return to her country with her award, no matter who is in power.
    


            • Tanker seized: Machado spoke a day after the US seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, ramping up a campaign that has included moving troops into the Caribbean, strikes on suspected drug boats and threats against its leader. She called US President Donald Trump's actions “decisive” in weakening Maduro's regime.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call with his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolás Maduro today, in which he expressed solidarity with the Venezuelan people and reaffirmed his support for Maduro's policies, according to a Kremlin readout.
    


            The Kremlin also said that the two leaders expressed an intention to carry out various “joint projects” related to the economy, trade and energy.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Venezuelan government for comment on the call.
    


More background: Russia and Venezuela have long had close ties, and the phone call comes after the United States seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela yesterday, escalating US pressure on Maduro's regime.
    


            Last week, US President Donald Trump confirmed he had spoken with the Venezuelan leader on the phone. “I wouldn't say it went well or badly. It was a phone call,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when asked whether the call had taken place.
    


            María Corina Machado has held two news conferences in Oslo, Norway, telling journalists that it was her “duty” to receive the prize and take it back to Venezuela.
    


            “We're going to show the world that we do not only deserve this Nobel Prize, but that this generation will outlast what is going on,” she added.
    


            Machado, who has been in hiding in her home country, also said that she received “support from the United States government” to travel to Norway, declining to elaborate.
    


            “I cannot give details, because these are people that could be harmed,” Machado said of those who aided her travel.
    


                    “Certainly, the regime would have done everything to prevent me from coming. They did not know where I was in hiding in Venezuela, so it was hard for them to stop me.”
                





            Asked for her reaction to the US seizure of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela yesterday, Machado said she supports global actions to cut off sources of revenue flowing to Venezuela's oppressive government.
    


            “They use those resources to repress and persecute our people,” she said.



            Machado added that she believes US President Donald Trump's actions have been “decisive” in weakening the regime of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.
    


                    “The regime previously thought that they could do anything, anything. They felt they had absolute impunity,” Machado said. “Now, they start to understand that this is serious and the world is really watching.”
                





            The opposition leader also said that she has received “quite a few invitations” to meetings during her trip to Norway.
    


                    “I'll be back in Venezuela, I have no doubt,” she added.






            Although the US and Venezuela enjoyed strong relations during the late 20th century, with US companies key investors in Venezuela's massive oil sector, friction started to develop following the election of leftist leader Hugo Chávez in 1999.
    


            These tensions increased as Chávez tightened his grip on power amid deepening authoritarianism and strong relations with communist Cuba, a sworn enemy of the US, and have deepened under Chávez' chosen successor Nicolás Maduro.
    


            Since taking over as Venezuelan president in 2013 following Chavez' death from cancer, Maduro has overseen a further slide into dictatorship, manipulating election results and violently repressing protests as he has fought tooth and nail to stay in power, as well as deepening relationships with Washington's geopolitical rivals of China, Russia and Iran.
    


            During his first term in office, President Donald Trump used economic sanctions and support for Venezuela's political opposition to exert pressure on Maduro, who nonetheless has remained in power.
    


            Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has accused Maduro of flooding the US with drugs and criminals. His administration has also designated Venezuelan criminal groups Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles as foreign terrorist organizations in an apparent move to justify military action against the Venezuelan government.
    


            At the same time, Trump envoy Richard Grenell has maintained contact with Venezuelan officials and met with Maduro several times earlier this year, and the US president himself spoke with his Venezuelan counterpart by phone in November.
    


            Despite maintaining diplomatic contact, the US has continued to build its military presence in the Caribbean, conducting military strikes against alleged drug trafficking vessels and threatening to attack cartel infrastructure in Venezuelan territory, and Wednesday's seizure of an oil tanker carrying Venezuelan crude is the latest escalation in Trump's campaign to finally remove Maduro from power.
    


            Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has developed a knack for succeeding against the odds, with few predicting his rise to the presidency nor his continued ability to remain in power.
    


            The son of a political activist from a traditional Venezuelan party, Maduro joined the Socialist League as a student and began working as a bus driver for the Caracas Metro.
    


            He then became a union leader before entering the National Assembly when his political mentor Hugo Chávez was elected president in 1999.
    


            Maduro rose through the ranks of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), serving as foreign minister and vice president during Chávez' time in office.
    


            He was one of a raft of potential candidates to take over the presidency as Chávez' health declined following a cancer diagnosis, but Chávez moved to tamp down internal disputes and picked him as his successor in December 2012.
    


            Since taking over the top job in 2013, Maduro has faced mockery of his eccentric public pronouncements and criticism of his electoral system, as well as a succession of protests, sanctions, arrest warrants, possible rebellions and international isolation.
    


            Nonetheless, he has been able to head off crises despite mounting international criticism of his government and the fact that millions of Venezuelans have fled the country amid deepening poverty and political repression.
    


            Excessive force, arbitrary detentions of protesters and opposition leaders, sexual violence, torture and extrajudicial executions are all part of Maduro's toolkit for managing dissent, according to UN reports.
    


            Now, however, Maduro appears to be facing his toughest moment yet, with President Donald Trump ratcheting up the pressure on his government and opposition leader María Corina Machado, who was named this year's winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, attempting to drum up international support for a change in government.
    


            Venezuela has said it “strongly denounces” the US seizure of an oil tanker off its Caribbean coast, describing the move as an “act of international piracy.”
    


            A statement from the Venezuelan government said the move, along with previous comments from US President Donald Trump, made it clear that Washington's policy toward Caracas is part of a “deliberate plan to plunder our energy resources.”
    


            “In these circumstances, the true reasons for the prolonged aggression against Venezuela have finally been revealed. It is not migration. It is not drug trafficking. It is not democracy. It is not human rights. It has always been about our natural wealth, our oil, our energy, the resources that belong exclusively to the Venezuelan people,” it said.
    


            Venezuela said it would appeal the seizure to “all existing international bodies.”
    


            María Corina Machado said she doesn't yet have plans to visit other European capitals or the United States, but the Venezuelan opposition leader said has received “quite a few invitations” during her time so far in Norway.
    


                    “To be absolutely honest, I'm taking one day at a time,” Machado told reporters at a news conference in Oslo, where she arrived late last night. “There was great uncertainty if I was able to come, so I had not made many plans.”
                





            “Now that I'm here, I certainly want to spend a few hours with my colleagues, friends and my children,” she said, adding that she also has some doctors' appointments and meetings to attend after being in hiding for the last 15 months.
    


                    “There are some meetings that I believe could be very useful that I do before I go back home,” Machado said. 
                





            Machado narrowly missed the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony yesterday, and instead her daughter accepted the award on her behalf.
    


            “I'll be back in Venezuela, I have no doubt,” Machado also said during the news conference.
    


            María Corina Machado said she believes US President Donald Trump's actions have been “decisive” in weakening the regime of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.
    


                    “I believe every country has the right to defend themselves, and in our case, I believe that President Trump's actions have been decisive to reach the point where we are right now, in which the regime is weaker than ever,” Machado said.
                





            “The regime previously thought that they could do anything, anything. They felt they had absolute impunity,” Machado told a news conference in Norway. “Now, they start to understand that this is serious and the world is really watching.”
    


            She added that the costs for Maduro staying in power needed to be raised, and the costs of leaving power lowered: “That's where we're moving towards right now.”
    


            “I'm not going to speculate on strategies or measures to be carried out by foreign countries in terms of foreign policy,” she said in response to a different question about the United States' actions and unconfirmed speculation about whether the US have given Maduro a deadline to leave power.
    


                    “I don't know the intentions of other foreign countries. I don't know if they have a deadline. We don't have any deadlines. We're going to continue to the very end,” Machado said.
                





            Asked for her reaction to the Trump administration's seizure of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado reiterated that she supports global actions to cut off sources of revenue flowing to Venezuela's oppressive government.
    


            “The regime is using the resources — the cash flows that come from illegal activities, including the black market of oil — not to give food for hungry children, not for teachers who earn $1 a day, not to hospitals in Venezuela that do not have medicine or water, not for security. They use those resources to repress and persecute our people,” Machado said in a news conference in Oslo.
    


                    “So yes, these criminal groups have to be stopped, and cutting the sources of illegal activities is a very necessary step to take,” she said in English, without referencing the United States directly.
                





            “We know that our regime is supporting itself thanks to other authoritarian regimes. We need the support of all democracies in the world,” Machado said. “That's why we are certainly asking the world to act.”
    


More background: Yesterday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the seized oil tanker had been sanctioned by the US for multiple years “due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,” including Venezuela and Iran.
    


            María Corina Machado said she got “support” from the United States to travel to Norway to accept the Nobel Peace Prize this week, but declined to elaborate.
    


                    Asked about the circumstances in which she left Venezuela and whether she benefited from help from US authorities, the opposition leader responded: “Yes, we did get support from the United States' government.”
                





            “I cannot give details, because these are people that could be harmed,” Machado said of those who aided her travel. “Certainly, the regime would have done everything to prevent me from coming. They did not know where I was in hiding in Venezuela, so it was hard for them to stop me.”
    


            Machado left Venezuela on a fishing boat, after slipping through military checkpoints wearing a wig and a disguise, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person close to the operation. She then took a private jet from Curaçao to Norway, which made a pit stop in the United States, according to the WSJ. CNN has not independently confirmed the details of Machado's travel.
    


            Earlier, a representative from the Nobel committee said Machado had “undergone quite some strain” to get to Oslo.
    


This post has been updated with additional details.



            Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel laureate María Corina Machado said she will be back in Venezuela very soon, speaking in Spanish during a Thursday press conference organized by the Nobel committee in Norway.
    


                    “My duty was to come here and take this Nobel Prize, to take it back to Venezuela, and I'll be back very soon,” Machado said.
                





            “And I know that you will also be back in Venezuela very soon, we're going to show the world that we do not only deserve this Nobel Prize, but that this generation will outlast what is going on,” she added.
    


            The government of Nicolás Maduro warned she would be considered a “fugitive” by authorities should she leave Venezuela.
    


            Machado said that she has met many Venezuelans on the streets in Oslo on Thursday, including people who told her “they are preparing their bags to come back home to build a nation that will be so proud.”
    


            María Corina Machado is holding a second news conference in Oslo, organized by the Nobel committee. It is expected that she will speak in both English and Spanish.
    


            We'll bring you any more updates as we get them.
    


            The Trump administration's seizure of an oil tanker off Venezuela is one of the most dramatic twists yet in a military pressure campaign against leader Nicolás Maduro.
    


            The boarding of a foreign ship is unusual and expands a US operation already highlighted by strikes against more than 20 boats in the Caribbean and Pacific  that the administration claims carried drug traffickers.
    


            While the tanker might not have been directly related to the showdown between Trump and Maduro, its interception will be seen in the context of a US naval buildup in the Caribbean, part of an apparent attempt to force Maduro out of power or to convince his subordinates to oust him.
    


            Millions of Venezuelans would welcome Maduro's departure after grim years under an authoritarian regime that has impoverished the country, imposed repression and forced millions of people to flee poverty and persecution.
    


            So, the Washington controversy over Trump's intentions in Venezuela is less about whether Maduro's exit after ignoring his loss in a democratic election would be beneficial and more about whether the US president is acting legally. Critics fear Trump is preparing to embroil America in another pronged foreign policy misadventure as he again seeks to flex unchecked executive power.
    


            Legal questions are most acute over the strikes against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean that have killed 87 people. The administration insists at it is justified in using legal military force against what it brands as narco-terrorists that threaten American national security. But Venezuela is not regarded as a major fentanyl trafficking route into the US as the administration insists.

            Retired US Air Force Col. Cedric Leighton told CNN that the US forces involved in seizing an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela yesterday were from an elite unit of the US Coast Guard.
    


            “These are basically the Coast Guard's version of special operations forces,” Leighton told CNN's Kaitlan Collins.
    


            Asked by Collins to explain what is happening in a video of the moment the oil tanker was seized, which was posted by Attorney General Pam Bondi, Leighton said:  “They're fast roping down from the helicopter onto the deck.”
    


            He went on to describe how the units immediately entered “the pilot house, where the captain of the ship, the skipper of the ship, is actually steering it.”
    


            “They take that over first basically to control the ship,” said Leighton.
    


            On Wednesday, US forces seized an oil tanker named The Skipper off the coast of Venezuela.
    


Here's what we know about the ship:



            The Skipper, previously named the Adisa, was sanctioned by the US in 2022 for facilitating oil trades for Hezbollah and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.
    


            The ship was carrying Venezuelan crude and was headed to Cuba. It was ultimately destined for Asia after being brokered through Cuban sellers, a senior US official said.
    


            On November 18, the Skipper was seen on satellite imagery docked around seven miles from the coastal Venezuelan city of Barcelona, according to a satellite image provided by Planet Labs. But at the same time, the ship's Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponder was indicating it was located around 560 miles away, off the coast of Georgetown, Guyana.
    


            Analysts say oil tankers sometimes “spoof” their AIS location in an attempt to hide questionable or illegal activities.
    


            The tanker was flying a Guyana flag, despite not being registered in Guyana, the country's Maritime Administration Department said in a statement posted to Facebook.
    


            Prior to arriving in Venezuela, the Skipper docked in Egypt, the UAE and Hong Kong, according to shipping data. In early July, it appeared to loiter less than 15 miles off Iran's coast for several days.

            Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed that her country would soon be “bright, democratic and free,” in her first news conference since arriving in Norway after narrowly missing the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony.
    


            Machado, who has been in hiding for a year following the disputed election of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, also committed to returning to her country, whether or not Maduro is still in power.
    


                    “Peace, ultimately, is an act of love,” she said, adding that courage to fight for freedom increases when the things you love are in danger. “I am very hopeful Venezuela will be free, and we will turn the country into a beacon of hope and opportunity, of democracy.”
                





            Asked by CNN if the Venezuelan government knows where she has been in hiding, Machado responded: “I don't think they have known where I have been, and certainly they would have done everything to stop me from coming here.”
    


                    “I want to take advantage of your question to thank all those men and women that risked their lives so that I could be here today,” she said. “I think it's worthwhile being here with you, telling the world what's happening in Venezuela.”
                





Asked if she would support US military intervention in Venezuela, Machado skirted the question, instead calling on the international community to help stop the violence and sources of funding that sustain the Maduro government, without directly naming the US or commenting on the Trump administration's recent actions in the Caribbean.
    


            Machado also said Venezuela has already been “invaded” by Russian and Iranian agents, terrorist groups, and Colombian drug cartels that operate with impunity and fund the regime.
    


            Her remarks come as the United States is escalating pressure on Maduro's regime, seizing an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela on Wednesday.
    


What to watch next: The Venezuelan opposition leader concluded by saying that she would soon speak to more reporters in Spanish.
    


Listen to what Maduro said about the Nobel Peace Prize:



            Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel laureate María Corina Machado vowed to go back to Venezuela to “be with my people,” whether or not the government of Nicolás Maduro is still in power.
    


            It's not clear exactly how she made the journey to collect the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway, which Nobel organizers previously said “involved extreme danger.”
    


                    “When I go back, the regime will – well, there are two possibilities certainly [for] where the regime will be. But if it's still in power, certainly, I will be with my people,” Machado told CNN's Pau Mosquera at the press conference in Oslo.
                





            “And they [the Maduro government] will not know where I am. We have ways to do that, to take care of us,” Machado added.
    


            Maduro's government has warned she would be considered a “fugitive” should she leave Venezuela.
    


            María Corina Machado said she doesn't think the Venezuelan government knows where she has been in hiding, telling CNN's Pau Mosquera in Oslo that “certainly they would have done everything to stop me from coming here.”
    


                    “I want to take advantage of your question to thank all those men and women that risked their lives so that I could be here today,” she said. “One day I will be able to tell you, because certainly I don't want to put them in risk right now.”
                





            “It was quite an experience, but I think it's worthwhile being here with you, telling the world what's happening in Venezuela,” Machado said of her journey to the Norwegian capital.
    


            The opposition leader has been in hiding after the Venezuelan government moved to crush dissent following last year's disputed election, resurfacing only once in January at a protest against President Nicolás Maduro being sworn in for another term. Maduro's government has warned she would be considered a “fugitive” should she leave Venezuela.
    


            “When you fight for freedom, you're fighting for humanity. And when we win – because we will – this will be an extraordinary example for those countries that today do not have freedom,” she added.
    

Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado was asked by CNN if the Venezuelan government knew about her whereabouts as she went from hiding in the country to visiting Oslo after winning the Nobel Peace Prize. CNN's Pau Mosquera reports from Oslo.


            Asked if she would support US military intervention in Venezuela, María Corina Machado said only that she is asking the international community to help stop the violence, repression and sources of funding that sustain the regime of President Nicolás Maduro.
    


                    “Some people talk about invasion in Venezuela, the threat of an invasion in Venezuela – and I answer, Venezuela has been already invaded. We have the Russian agents. We have the Iranian agents. We have terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas operating freely in accordance with the regime. We have the Colombian guerrilla the drug cartels,” the opposition leader responded.
                





            “This has turned Venezuela into the criminal hub of the Americas, and what sustained the regime is a very powerful and funded, strongly funded repression system,” Machado said, claiming that the regime obtains funding through the oil market, arms trafficking and human trafficking.
    


            “So, we ask the international community to cut those sources, because the other regimes that support Maduro and the criminal structure are very active and have turned Venezuela into the safe haven for their operations,” she added.
    


            In her response, Machado did not name the United States or directly express support for the Trump administration's recent actions in Venezuela.
    


            Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel laureate María Corina Machado said on Thursday that Venezulea will soon be a “a bright, democratic and free country.”
    


            “I long for that day, and we will host all of you in a bright, democratic and free country – and it's going to be soon.,” Machado said in a press conference in Oslo, speaking alongside Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.
    


            “You cannot have democracy without freedom,” she said.
    


                    “I believe there's no other generation in the history of Venezuela that that loves more, freedom and family and….the possibility of actually being in your homeland, of moving freely in your homeland, because we have lost that.”
                





            Machado, 58, missed Wednesday's Nobel Peace Prize acceptance ceremony by just hours, arriving in Oslo in the middle of the night after her daughter accepted the prize on her behalf.

            Hot Stocks 





            Shortly after beginning his second term in January, US President Donald Trump launched a chaotic trade war, raising tariffs on scores of countries, then changing some and agreeing to a number of tentative trade deals.
    


            The average US import tax is now at its highest level since the 1930s, and there are signs the steeper tariffs are feeding through to higher prices for Americans.
    


            But they are also inflicting pain beyond US borders. Here are examples from around the world.
    


            The Swiss economy shrank in the third quarter at the sharpest rate since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The government attributed the contraction largely to a plunge in output from the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, noting recent volatility in foreign trade linked to new US tariffs.
    


            Over in Asia, Japan's economy also contracted in the third quarter. Drops in exports and private residential investment were the biggest drivers.
    


            And closer to the United States, Mexico's economy also shrank in the third quarter. Economists blamed the poor performance partly on Trump's erratic trade policy, which dampened business confidence and investment.
    


            The Canadian manufacturing sector has shed 36,500 jobs since the start of the year and now has the smallest workforce since September 2021, when the sector was still reeling from the pandemic, according to the official Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours.
    


            “Manufacturing has been among the hardest hit by US tariff actions,” Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters, an industry association, said in September, describing the sector as a key driver of exports.
    


            Between August and mid-November, Brazil's coffee exports to the United States were subject to a hefty 50% tariff. That tariff made it “practically impossible to export to that market,” Márcio Ferreira, president of exporter group Cecafé or the Brazilian Coffee Exporters Council, said in October.
    


            US coffee imports from the world's top producer more than halved in the August-November period compared with a year prior, based on the council's latest data. The drop contributed to a 32.2% fall in Brazilian coffee sales to the United States since the start of 2025, year-over-year.
    


            Despite the decline, the United States was the biggest importer of Brazilian coffee in the first 11 months of 2025. Coffee production and related activities account for up to 1.8% of Brazil's GDP, while coffee farming employs about 3% of the country's workforce, including seasonal and indirect jobs, Brazil's agriculture ministry told CNN.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","What Trump's latest dramatic Venezuela move means","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/politics/trump-venezuela-tanker-escalation","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 05:06:18 GMT","


            The Trump administration's seizure of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela is one of the most dramatic twists yet in a military pressure campaign against Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.
    


            The boarding of a foreign ship is an unusual step and expands a US operation already highlighted by strikes against more than 20 boats in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean that the administration claims carried drug traffickers.
    


            Early reports suggest the swoop by US Coast Guard personnel, with the backing of the Navy and law enforcement agencies, poses fewer legal and constitutional concerns than the campaign against the boats and Trump's imminent threats of military action on Venezuelan soil.
    


            The vessel, the Skipper, was seized in international waters and was carrying Venezuelan crude, a senior US official said. A federal judge had previously issued a warrant for its seizure because of alleged links to Iran-backed terror groups.
    


            Still, Trump's relish in announcing the take-over of the ship and Attorney General Pam Bondi's release of a video showing US personnel rappelling onto its decks from a helicopter underscore the political significance of the moment.
    


            With his characteristic flair for the dramatic, Trump announced to the press that the US had boarded a “large tanker, very large, largest one ever seized, actually.”
    


            While the tanker might not have been directly related to the current showdown between Trump and Maduro, its interdiction will be seen in the context of a massive US naval build-up in the Caribbean, which is part of an apparent attempt to force Maduro out of power or to convince his subordinates to oust him.
    


            Millions of Venezuelans would welcome Maduro's departure after grim years under an authoritarian regime that has impoverished the country, imposed repression and forced millions of people to flee poverty and persecution.
    


            So, the Washington controversy over Trump's intentions in Venezuela is less about whether Maduro's exit after ignoring his loss in a democratic election would be beneficial and more about whether the US president is acting legally. Critics fear Trump is preparing to embroil America in another prolonged foreign policy misadventure as he again seeks to flex unchecked executive power.
    


            Legal questions are most acute over the strikes against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean that have killed 87 people. The administration insists that it is justified in using legal military force against what it brands as narco-terrorists that threaten American national security. But Venezuela is not regarded as a major fentanyl trafficking route into the US as the administration insists. And rights groups warn that the boat attacks infringe on the due process of the victims and amount to state sanctioned murder by the administration.
    


            One of those strikes, on September 2, prompted Democrats and human rights groups to accuse the administration of a war crime, as it involved a follow-up strike that reportedly killed survivors of the initial US attack.
    


            Democrats are intensifying a campaign to force Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to turn over video of the attack to Congress. Trump had earlier said on camera he had no problems with such a step but later denied making the comment.
    


            News of the tanker seizure and deepening intrigue over the double-tap strike came as doubt still shrouded Trump's aims in Venezuela. The symbolic weight of the massive US naval force off the country, which includes the most advanced US aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford, means any resolution to the crisis that does not lead to Maduro's ouster would be a rebuke to US power and Trump's prestige.
    


            Trump has meanwhile repeatedly warned that strikes against what he says are drug trafficking sites on land could start soon. But in an interview with Politico this week, he declined to discuss military strategy and said opaquely that he wanted the Venezuelan people treated well and “to be respected.”
    


CNN reported on Wednesday that the Trump administration was working on plans for what would happen in Venezuela in the event that Maduro fell or left. Critics of the Trump approach have drawn comparisons to the US failure to prepare for regime change in Iraq in 2003 after the US invasion. Some analysts fear that Venezuela could descend into violence and instability if the Maduro regime falls, and that it could prompt a refugee crisis. But the situation there bears little comparison to post-war Baghdad.
    


            In another development that could increase pressure on Maduro's regime, Venezuelan Opposition leader María Corina Machado dramatically left hiding in the country and traveled to Oslo, where her daughter had earlier accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf.
    


            Maduro's government had warned she would be considered a fugitive should she leave Venezuela. But her emergence in the outside world may also present the Trump administration with new opportunities to highlight her cause.
    


            The US seizure of the tanker Skipper took place on the basis of a search warrant related to past activity transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran, Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on X. She said FBI, Homeland Security Investigations and the US Coast Guard were involved with support from the Department of Defense.
    


            The capture of the tanker is certain to be seen throughout the region as an implicit warning to other tanker captains of the risks in loading up in Venezuela and operating around its waters, as well as a blow to the shadow fleet of tankers that traffic sanctioned oil for nations like Iran.
    


            Venezuela has some of the world's biggest reserves of crude oil, and its illicit sales are a key source of income for its regime. The first and second Trump administrations and the Biden administration maintained multiple layers of sanctions against the Maduro regime for its suppression of democracy, including against the state-owned oil and natural gas company PDVSA.
    


            The government in Caracas condemned the seizure, arguing that it laid bare the true motivation of Trump's pressure campaign. “It is not migration. It is not drug trafficking. It is not democracy. It is not human rights. It has always been about our natural wealth, our oil, our energy, the resources that belong exclusively to the Venezuelan people,” a government statement said.
    


            But Beth Sanner, a former senior US intelligence official, told CNN's Jake Tapper that the seizure of a Venezuelan oil tankers was “absolutely normal” as part of an attempt to prevent the regime transporting sanctioned oil. “In the past, everybody has wanted to pick up these kinds of tankers, but we haven't had the assets in the region to do it,” Sanner said.
    


            Democrats on Capitol Hill are unwilling to take any of actions related to Venezuela at face value.
    


            Asked on CNN whether the US was now closer to a war with Venezuela, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, said, “How could we possibly not be closer when we are rappelling men and women from our military out of helicopters and descending on civilian tankers flying the flag of another nation? It is definitely escalatory; there is no other way to put it.”
    


            She added that if Trump's aim was regime change through military force, he was constitutionally required to get an authorization from Congress — although she believed that such a step was not in US interests.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer meanwhile told Tapper on “The Lead” that Trump's rhetoric was so unclear that it was impossible to know what his true intentions are. “President Trump throws out so many different things, in so many different ways, you don't know what the heck he is talking about,” Schumer said. “If Maduro would just flee on his own, everyone would like that.” But Schumer added: “You cannot say, ‘I endorse this, I endorse that' when Trump is all over the lot.”
    


            Like so much in Trump's second term, there is little public transparency about the president's goals that often seem to depend on his personal whims. Trump prizes unpredictability. He's thus made no attempt to explain to Americans why so many service personnel are on ships off the Venezuelan coast or what the expensive deployment is supposed to achieve.
    


            If the president were to successfully oust Maduro and transition Venezuela to democracy, he could claim a significant political win. He'd also cement his goal of exerting American power throughout the Western Hemisphere, an aspiration consistent with his recently unveiled National Security Strategy. This appears both an attempt to reshape Latin America in his own MAGA image and a more traditional US strategy to counter Chinese and Russian influence in the region.
    


            But history shows that even in extreme circumstances, dictatorial regimes constructed over decades are often more durable than outsiders believe. The Venezuelan government has been compared to a many layered criminal operation — with key members having huge financial stakes in perpetuating their own power. And while many outsiders hope that Trump's pressure will lead to the rise of the country's rightful democratic rulers, nothing is certain.
    


            But the seizing of the tanker cranked the pressure on Maduro up yet another notch. And it led Trump further down what is beginning to look like an inexorable path to a confrontation in which he is investing huge personal credibility.

The US House of Representatives has passed a defense spending bill that would provide $800 million in military aid to Ukraine through 2027.

The 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was approved 312-122 on Wednesday and will now advance to the Senate, where it is expected to receive bipartisan support, according to The Hill.

Some legislators objected to directing more taxpayers' money to help Ukraine fight Russia. “I thought we were getting out of Ukraine. I don't know why we still need to spend money there,” Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, said.

On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump slammed what he described as a “massive corruption situation” in Kiev, referring to the recently uncovered $100 million kickback scheme in the country's energy sector, which heavily relies on Western aid.

Prosecutors named Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky's longtime associate and former business partner Timur Mindich as the ringleader. Mindich fled the country to evade arrest after apparently being tipped off.

The scandal led to the resignation of two government ministers, and further anti-corruption raids prompted Zelensky to fire chief of staff Andrey Yermak last month.

Ukraine's military procurement system has also been shaken by several graft and embezzlement scandals, one of which led to the resignation of Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov in 2023.

The bill was approved as Trump has been pressuring Ukraine to sign a peace deal with Russia, with some reports suggesting that he hopes to reach an agreement by Christmas.

Russia considers Western military cooperation with Ukraine one of the root causes of the conflict and has listed ending foreign weapons deliveries as a condition for a ceasefire. President Vladimir Putin has argued that otherwise, Ukraine would use the pause in the fighting to rearm and regroup, as he says happened when Ukraine refused to implement the 2014-2015 Minsk agreements.

Russian forces have liberated the Donbass city of Seversk, the Defense Ministry in Moscow reported on Thursday. The former Ukrainian stronghold, located inside Russia's Donetsk People's Republic, is now fully clear of enemy troops, the ministry said.

The fighting for Seversk has gone on since 2022 with varying degrees of intensity. Russian troops will now have an open path to the regional cities of Kramatorsk and Slavyansk, both major hubs for the Ukrainian military, according to Igor Kimakovsky, an adviser to the head of the DPR.

The announcement was made by the chief of Russia's General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, during a high-level meeting with President Vladimir Putin on the status of Moscow's military operation.

The Defense Ministry also released footage from the liberated city, showing Russian troops conducting door-to-door visits to apartment buildings and private homes offering medical assistance, food, and drinking water to civilians who had remained in the area.



Soldiers have also been inspecting residential areas, roads, and adjacent areas for explosive devices and clearing out any hazardous items.

Following Gerasimov's report, Putin stated that the strategic initiative in the Northern Military District is now “entirely in the hands of the Russian Armed Forces.”

The capture of Seversk comes as Russian troops continue to push back Ukrainian forces across the front line. Moscow has expressed its determination to fully liberate its territories in the Donbass region.

Russia has suggested that Ukraine voluntarily withdraw from the region as part of a potential peace settlement, which is also being promoted by the US, but has stressed that it will achieve its goals militarily if necessary.

Kiev has rejected any territorial concessions.

Unease grows in Washington, including among some Republicans, over Trump administration's escalating military posture in the Caribbean

US politics live – latest updates

Senior Democratic lawmakers and at least one Republican have condemned Wednesday's seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker off the nation's coast, with one saying Donald Trump is “sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela”.

There is growing, at least somewhat bipartisan unease in Washington over the administration's escalating military posture in the region. Trump has accused Venezuela of facilitating drug trafficking, and increased the US military presence in the Caribbean to a level not seen in decades. The administration has also conducted a campaign of bombings of alleged drug boats, killing more than 80 people so far.

Trump confirmed the tanker seizure shortly after it occurred, telling reporters: “We've just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela – large tanker, very large, largest one ever seized, actually.” When asked what would happen to the oil, Trump responded: “We keep the oil, I guess!”

Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who serves on the Senate foreign relations committee, said the tanker seizure indicated the administration was being dishonest about its military operations in the region.

“This shows that their whole cover story – that this is about interdicting drugs – is a big lie,” Van Hollen said. “This is just one more piece of evidence that this is really about regime change – by force.”

Rand Paul, a Republican senator of Kentucky, told NewsNation that “seizing someone's oil tanker is an initiation of war” and questioned whether “it's the job of the American government to go looking for monsters around the world, looking for adversaries and beginning wars”.

Chris Coons, a Democratic senator, said he was also alarmed at the administration's actions, telling the station: “I have no idea why the president is seizing an oil tanker and I'm fairly gravely concerned that he's sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela.”

Mark Warner, also a Democratic senator, highlighted what he characterized as inconsistent priorities, posting on social media: “So they can seize an oil tanker, but not a drug boat?”

Chuck Schumer, when asked by CNN whether he opposed Trump's goal of regime change in Venezuela, refused to answer, saying Trump's erratic messaging made it impossible to know his true intentions.

“The bottom line is President Trump throws out so many different things in so many different ways, you don't even know what the heck he's talking about,” the Senate minority leader said.

“Obviously, if Maduro would just flee on his own, everyone would like that,” he said, but added the lack of clarity made it impossible to endorse specific policies.

The attorney general, Pam Bondi, said the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations and the Coast Guard had executed a seizure warrant for the vessel, which she said had been transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran for years as part of a network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.

Venezuela's government called the seizure “a blatant theft and an act of international piracy”, claiming it revealed that US aggression has “always been about our natural resources, our oil, our energy”.

Not all were opposed. When Ted Cruz, a Republican senator of Texas, was asked for his reaction on the oil tanker seizure, he deflected and said Trump was saving American lives by targeting drug smugglers.

In November, when Iran seized a Marshall Islands-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, US Central Command condemned it as a “blatant violation of international law” that undermined freedom of navigation and commerce.

Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator from California, called it a “very dangerous escalation and a prelude to potential conflict”. Last week he and Paul, along with fellow senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Schumer, filed a war powers resolution aimed at blocking the administration from military engagement with Venezuela without congressional approval.

The administration has deployed what it describes as the largest naval presence in the Caribbean since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, ostensibly to target what Trump has dubbed as “narco-terrorists”. But US drug enforcement officials noted in a May report that fentanyl primarily enters the US through Chinese producers and Mexican criminal organizations, while cocaine mainly comes from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Law passes despite fears it will ‘normalise Islamophobia' and fact it could be struck down by constitutional court

Lawmakers in Austria have voted overwhelmingly to ban headscarves in schools for girls under the age of 14, despite concerns the legislation will deepen societal divisions and marginalise Muslims. The law could also be struck down by the country's constitutional court.

The ban was proposed earlier this year by Austria's conservative-led government, which took office in March after a far-right party came first in the elections but failed to form a government.

Before Thursday's vote, Yannick Shetty, the parliamentary leader of the liberal Neos, the most junior party in the ruling coalition, defended the ban. He told the lower house: “This is not about restricting freedom, but about protecting the freedom of girls up to 14.

“It [the headscarf] is not just an item of clothing. It serves, particularly with minors, to shield girls from the male gaze. It sexualises girls,” he said.

The ban is expected to take effect at the start of the new school year in September, with families facing fines of up to €800 (£700) for repeated non-compliance. A soft launch of the legislation will begin in February as the new rules are explained to educators, parents and children.

Thursday's legislation marks the second time that a government led by the centre-right People's party (ÖVP) has set its sights on the headscarf. In 2019, as part of a coalition that included the far right, Austria introduced a ban on headscarves for girls under 10 years of age. The legislation was later overturned by the country's constitutional court, which described it as discriminatory in that it specifically targeted Muslims.

This time around, the government said it had worked to avoid the same outcome. Shetty recently told reporters: “Will it pass muster with the constitutional court? I don't know. We have done our best.”

Despite the uncertainty, lawmakers backed the ban by a large majority. The only party to oppose it was the opposition Green party, which argued that the law was unconstitutional.

In the lead-up to the vote, the bill was criticised by rights organisations, including Amnesty International, which said it would “not empower girls – on the contrary, it will add to the current racist climate towards Muslims”.

The official Islamic Community in Austria, the IGGÖ, said the ban would leave children “stigmatised and marginalised”. In a statement on its website, the IGGÖ added: “This is symbolic politics at the expense of those affected.”

Angelika Atzinger of the Amazone women's rights association, said the ban “sends girls the message that decisions are being made about their bodies and that this is legitimate”.

Others pointed to the broader picture. Farid Hafez, a senior researcher at Georgetown University, suggested the debate was being used strategically to distract from Austria's severe economic pressures, including a budget deficit of 4.7% of GDP. “In this context, debate over the hijab offers a convenient way to divert attention from deeper fiscal problems,” he wrote earlier this year.

While legal scholars have questioned whether the ban will hold up in court, Hafez noted that even if it were struck down, the damage had been done. “It sends a chilling message to young Muslim girls and boys: that their faith, and by extension their identity, is unwelcome in Austrian society.

“Austria's fixation on legislating against the hijab is not about safeguarding children but about entrenching exclusion, normalising Islamophobia as mainstream politics, and signalling to a new generation of Muslims that their place in Austrian society will always be precarious.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi was ranked third in the world's most powerful women, Forbes said on Wednesday.

In the list published on its website, Ursula von der Leyen, president of European Commission was ranked first and Christine Lagarde, president of European Central Bank, was second.

Forbes describes Japan's first female prime minister as “a hardline conservative who has often invoked ‘Iron Lady' Margaret Thatcher, a fellow female first prime minister, as a political role model.”

The U.N. General Assembly approved a resolution on Dec. 10 to boost international cooperation and reduce the impact of the Chornobyl nuclear disaster, with 97 countries voting in favor and eight against.

Russia, Belarus, China, North Korea, and the U.S. voted against the document. Thirty-nine countries abstained from voting.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said the resolution brings in the correct Ukrainian spelling — Chornobyl instead of the Russian-style Chernobyl — and ""draws attention to the aggressor's crimes against the Ukrainian people and threats to global nuclear security.""

According to the minister, Russia tried to use Belarus to hide its actions and push an alternative version that removed references to its attacks on Chornobyl facilities.

In February, a Russian Shahed-type drone struck the New Safe Confinement over Chornobyl's destroyed 4th reactor. The structure built to contain radioactive material was damaged, although no serious radiation leaks were caused.

Last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency said that the protective shield built to prevent radiation leaking from the Chornobyl plant ""lost its primary safety functions, including the confinement capability"" and needs to be repaired promptly.

The U.N. resolution points to the lasting consequences of the 1986 disaster and highlights the importance of supporting the affected areas. 

The U.S. stands out among the countries that voted against the document. This move comes as Washington and Moscow see improving ties, discuss renewed cooperation, and the Trump administration pushes Ukraine toward a peace deal with Russia, even if it doesn't fully reflect Ukraine's interests.

Washington's representative said the U.S. voted against the resolution not because it opposed nuclear safety measures, but because it objected to references to the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The European Commission and Kyiv have agreed on a 10-point action plan to tackle corruption and strengthen democratic institutions in Ukraine as part of its path to membership, EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos announced on Dec. 11.

The agreement is part of joint EU-Ukraine efforts to advance the technical side of the accession process while Hungary continues to block the formal opening of the negotiation clusters.

The current focus is on implementing and screening measures under the first, second, and sixth clusters, which relate to the rule of law and democracy, the internal market, and external relations, respectively, according to officials.

Priorities listed in the 10-point agreement, concluded on Dec. 10, ""all focus on strengthening the rule of law, fighting corruption, and building strong, accountable democratic institutions in Ukraine,"" Kos said at a press conference during an informal EU meeting in Lviv.

The Ukrainian government has committed to prioritizing these goals in the next year, for example, by ""expanding the jurisdiction"" of Ukraine's two key anti-graft bodies, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), she noted.

The list also includes reforms of the judiciary, the prosecutor's offices, and the State Bureau of Investigation, as well as ways to strengthen internal control systems against high-level corruption.

The news follows Ukraine's largest corruption scandal in recent years, in which NABU charged seven people, including President Volodymyr Zelensky's former business partner Timur Mindich, with a money-laundering scheme involving the state-owned energy company Energoatom.

Speaking beside Kos, Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Taras Kachka acknowledged that ""Ukraine is going through painful structural reforms and the most recent situation also could eventually cast a shadow on the adherence of Ukraine to anti-corruption reforms.""

This is why Kyiv focuses its efforts on ""reforms like amendments to the criminal procedure code or involvement of international experts in the reforms of institutions in the criminal justice,"" he said.

Ukraine and the EU initiated the accession process in 2024, but Hungary — widely seen as the most Kremlin-friendly government in the EU — has consistently blocked the opening of the six negotiation clusters.

Hungary's EU affairs minister, Janos Boka, has skipped the two-day meeting in Lviv, which was co-organized by Denmark and takes place in the last weeks of the Danish Presidency of the Council of the EU, a role that will pass to Cyprus in January.

""It is a disappointment for many of us that we have not been able to formally open Cluster One,"" Danish EU Affairs Minister Marie Bjerre said at the press conference.

However, the shift of focus on technical talks means that ""the enlargement process with Ukraine is not at a standstill,"" she said, noting that ""the Cyprus Presidency will be able to continue this approach.""

Bjerre also noted that all six clusters will be under consideration by the Council of the EU by the end of the year, meaning they can all be opened once a political consensus is reached.

In late September, the European Commission announced that Ukraine had completed a bilateral screening process, a major milestone toward accession.

""Reforms are at the center of this process, and nobody can veto Ukraine from doing these reforms,"" Kos commented in Lviv.

While Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has consistently obstructed aid to Ukraine and its path toward EU membership, he faces his greatest domestic political challenge yet in the upcoming parliamentary elections next spring, with Peter Magyar's opposition Tisza Party leading in most polls.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Bulgaria protests: Why did Gen Z turn out in record numbers?","https://www.dw.com/en/bulgaria-protests-why-did-gen-z-turn-out-in-record-numbers/a-75093957","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 06:32:40 GMT","

Bulgaria's Gen Z has been taking to the streets in unprecedented numbers since December 1, protesting corruption and a controversial budget. Its message to the government is clear: ""You angered the wrong generation.""

A contentious budget, endemic corruption and political arrogance caught on camera all combined to trigger mass protests.

On December 1, Bulgaria's Gen Z took to the streets in the largest nationwide demonstrations in decades, demanding that next year's budget be revoked and that the government resign.

Although the government responded to the protests by introducing a new draft budget that postpones tax and social contribution increases for two years, it is unlikely to be enough to quell Gen Z's frustration as it prepares to return to the streets again on Wednesday.

Indeed, the events of the past ten days have revealed a widening rift between the ruling parties and young people.

""The budget was the reason to protest, but the root cause is that we see no prospects for staying in Bulgaria, starting a business or building a family,"" said 18-year-old high school student Martin Atanassov, who joined the demonstrations.

Gen Z is the first generation in Bulgaria to have no personal memories of either the communist regime, which ruled the country from 1944 to 1989, or the hyperinflation crisis of the late 1990s.

In a country where turnout barely reached 39% in the last parliamentary election, young people have become increasingly engaged in politics since the mass protests began.

Their demands range from better healthcare to improved job opportunities.

""At its heart, Gen Z's political demand is for an end to corruption,"" said Mimi Shishkova, a publisher and influencer who has become a key figure for Gen Z, with many following her political explainers online.

Although Bulgaria's economy has grown significantly since joining the EU, the country ranks second-to-last in the bloc in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index 2024 — just ahead of Hungary.

Many protesters believe that two men in particular are responsible for the country's current predicament: Boyko Borissov, three-time prime minister between 2009 and 2021 and leader of the ruling GERB party, and oligarch Delyan Peevsky, who is sanctioned by both the US and the UK and whose DPS Novo Nachalo (New Beginning) party supports the current minority coalition in power.

Yet, as Shishkova told DW, removing them from power would only be one step in the broader fight against corruption. ""It cannot be the solution itself,"" she said.

""All Bulgarians have heard since childhood how corrupt this country is and what the model of Borissov and Peevsky stands for,"" Martin Atanassov told DW.

Atanassov is a student and youth leader who came to prominence for creating an interactive map of all road accidents in Bulgaria in an attempt to reveal structural issues relating to road safety. He believes that for many young people like him, two videos triggered the surge of frustration.

The first showed ruling politicians passing a law relating to the assets of Russian oil firm Lukoil in Bulgaria after sanctions imposed by the US. The law was passed in just 26 seconds, racing against the clock, in the absence of the opposition.

The second video showed a vote on the contested budget, which was held during the National Assembly's lunch break to avoid encountering protesters on their way out.

Both videos went viral and, says Atanassov, ""came to symbolize the conquered state.""

On the first night of peaceful demonstrations against the budget, many young people took to the streets for the first time and shared their experience with friends.

Online engagement around the issue skyrocketed. After the night of the December 1 protest, the number of users engaging with protest-related content on TikTok in Bulgaria reached 488,000 people — 70 times more than usual — according to the Balkan Free Media Initiative, which was cited by Bulgarian TV channel bTV.

The young people's message, which was used on many protest signs, was clear: ""You angered the wrong generation.""

""We find ourselves at a very difficult moment when one cannot afford not to talk about politics when so many people identify with you,"" said influencer Andrea Banda Banda, who works in lifestyle and entertainment but has been sharing political content for the past five years.

Between ads for fashion brands, banks and mobile phones, she also shares her thoughts on democracy and the rule of law with her nearly 100,000 Instagram followers.

Many of them told her they attended a protest for the first time in their lives because of her.

As users look for explainer formats, influencers often fill the gap in news consumption on social media, where the universal language of Gen Z is unfiltered humor.

Protest anthems targeting Peevski, memes of opposition leaders shouting ""Who ordered this outrage?"" during a budget commission hearing and banners like ""Take your girlfriend on a date at the protest"" help blend politics with pop culture.

""Ideally, it's much better to read a long analysis, but memes are a super quick way to get an idea across,"" Andrea Banda Banda told DW, adding that ""this is the first time so many influencers have gotten involved in talking about the protests.""

The new budget proposed by the government still envisions Bulgaria borrowing significant amounts of money and spending 45% of its GDP — an increase from around 40% in previous years.

Although the country has one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios in the EU, protesters fear that additional borrowing will enable the government to redistribute money unfairly toward the administration, hinder business growth and leave key sectors underfunded — particularly healthcare, where young doctors and nurses have been protesting for a wage increase all year.

According to Daniel Smilov, a political scientist and associate professor at Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski, tension had already been mounting, and the budget was the spark that fell on ""highly flammable material.""

While the government has tried to downplay the protests, labeling them as anti-euro ahead of Bulgaria's planned adoption of the currency in January 2026, the movement itself rejects that narrative.

The protests have brought together people from across the political spectrum, demanding the government's resignation. The cabinet now faces a no-confidence vote from the opposition PP-DB coalition later this week.

""Without elections it will be difficult to move forward,"" Smilov told DW, adding that going to the polls may ""not be immediate, but it will happen in the foreseeable future.""

Migrants could be sent to overseas ‘return hubs' under new reforms criticized by rights watchdogs. 

If you read Washington's latest security strategy slamming European migration policies and claiming the continent faces ""civilisational erasure,"" you might think the EU was throwing its borders wide open.

In fact, irregular migration to the bloc is falling, and EU states just advanced their most restrictive migration rules yet in a bid to make it easier for members to swiftly detain and deport rejected asylum seekers.

Denmark's Immigration Minister Rasmus Stoklund said new reforms would help fix a ""dysfunctional"" EU system and restore a sense of ""control."" 

But the moves have also drawn stark criticism from human rights watchdogs, with Amnesty accusing the bloc of mirroring the ""harrowing, dehumanizing and unlawful mass arrests, detention and deportations in the US."" 

The raft of reforms backed by EU home affairs ministers on Monday includes a legal rubber-stamp on the idea of so-called ""return hubs."" That could mean detention centers outside the EU where migrants may be sent to have asylum claims processed — or even as part of a one-way ticket out from Europe.

The rule rewrite, which still needs to be negotiated with the European Parliament, would allow individual EU governments to strike up deals with states beyond the bloc's borders and send migrants there — even if they have no ties to the country.

While Denmark began mulling ways to send migrants to Rwanda back in 2021, the first EU member to try it out in practice was Italy. It set up centers in its non-EU neighbor Albania last year, but Rome's hubs were beset by legal challenges and put on hold.

Italy's interior minister said on Monday that agreement among ministers leaves Albania-based centers well-positioned to become the first real-world example of an EU return hub and to ""resume"" operations.

But migration policy analyst Helena Hahn said the ""jury is still out"" on what return hubs could look like beyond Italy's model — and above all, which non-EU states would be willing to host migrants bound for Europe.

Charities and campaigners including Human Rights Watch and Oxfam have in the past slammed the EU for ""shirking responsibility"" by trying to outsource asylum processing.

""The EU is attempting to further push its responsibilities onto countries who already host the majority of refugees with often far fewer resources,"" dozens of NGOs said last year.

Their statement insisted EU pledges to uphold migrants' rights were ""empty words.""

Denmark's Stoklund pushed back on those accusations on Monday. ""If we send someone to a return center, we will be responsible for respecting their human rights,"" he told reporters after talks in Brussels.

EU states also backed new proposals designed to speed up deportations, with harsher penalties for migrants who ignore expulsion orders. That follows an earlier agreement on EU plans to downgrade trade ties with countries which fail to cooperate on deportations.

Ministers also gave a green light to a centralized list of ""safe"" countries which national authorities can use to fast-track decisions and deny residency to those least likely to be granted asylum.

Only around 4% of Bangladeshis seeking asylum in the EU last year were accepted, for example, and Bangladesh heads up the list of countries deemed safe by Brussels. Other states on the list include India, Colombia, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.

Ministers agreed EU candidate states such as Montenegro, Moldova or Serbia should also be deemed safe, except in cases of conflict or restrictions on fundamental rights.

EU states finalized one plan that analyst Helena Hahn sees as somewhat bucking the trend toward more restrictions.

The so-called ""solidarity pool"" will see member states from Europe's North and East either take in more migrants from Southern states where most asylum seekers arrive — or pay into a funding pot to support the likes of Cyprus, Spain, Italy or Greece.

Hahn describes this as ""a mechanism to organize and to coordinate responsibility sharing over asylum seekers amongst member states"" — and she thinks it's a ""big step.""

""Questions around relocations, quotas, the distribution of asylum seekers across Europe in a 'fair' way has always been — for the longest amount of time now — one of the main political sensitivities, in particular, that have plagued the implementation and functioning of the common European asylum system,"" she explained.

Details of which countries will pay what remain under wraps, but EU member Hungary has already vowed not to follow the rules — something which could tee up future legal clashes between Brussels and Budapest.

EU citizens often cite irregular immigration as one of their top concerns. Bloc-wide survey data from earlier this year saw people rank it second only to Russia's war in Ukraine in a list of the biggest challenges facing the EU — ahead of the cost of living, climate change, and security and defense issues.

Far-right parties which focus on anti-immigrant messaging are gaining popularity in many EU countries, with centrist forces trying to claw back votes.

""We are looking at a largely restrictive immigration agenda,"" researcher Helena Hahn told DW, noting more and more countries are trying to come up with so-called ""innovative solutions"" to deter, detain and deport migrants.

""But we have seen very few outcomes so far,"" Hahn explained. ""So that also, I think, speaks to the political feasibility of some of these ideas that seem to suggest that it would be quite easy to move people from A to B, without any particular kind of respect to political, diplomatic or practical considerations.""

US President Donald Trump announced the seizure of a ""very large"" oil tanker and said ""other things are happening"" off the coast of Venezuela.

US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the US has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.

""We've just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large, largest one ever seized, actually,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.

Trump said the tanker ""was seized for a very good reason.""

The US president added that ""other things are happening,"" without offering any additional details. Reporters asked Trump what would happen with the oil, he replied: ""We keep it, I guess.""  

Attorney General Pam Bondi posted a video to X that appeared to show US forces boarding the tanker. 

In response, Caracas accused Washington of ""blatant theft"" as the Venezuelan government vowed to ""defend its sovereignty, natural resources, and national dignity with absolute determination.""

A statement from the Foreign Ministry added that the Latin American country ""strongly denounces and condemns what constitutes blatant theft and an act of international piracy."" 

It added that they would denounce the seizure in front of international bodies.

The announcement marks the latest escalation between the Trump administration and the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and it comes as opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is believed to have left the country for Oslo.

In an interview with US news outlet Politico earlier this week, Trump said that Maduro's ""days are numbered,"" declining to rule out a US ground invasion against Venezuela.

The oil tanker seizure comes weeks after the Trump administration has dramatically increased US presence in the Caribbean, near Venezuelan waters, and conducted strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats originating from Venezuela. 

The US has been amassing a fleet of warships, including the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford.

Unnamed US officials said the tanker's seizure was led by the US Coast Guard and supported by the Navy. 

The New York Times and CBS News identified the tanker as a vessel called the Skipper. The New York Times said officials they spoke to said the vessel was carrying Venezuelan oil from the state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). 

But it is not yet clear which country's flag the vessel was flying.

The South American nation has the world's largest proven oil reserves and produces about 1 million barrels of oil per day.

But US sanctions on its oil industry have left Venezuela locked out of global oil markets, selling most of its output at a steep discount to refiners in China.

But despite the tensions with the US, Venezuela still managed to increase oil exports this year. Until now, Washington had not interfered with the country's oil flows. 

Instead, the US military had been targeting small boats they said were working out of Venezuela and trafficking drugs. Despite this, Trump pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez in early December, who had been convicted of drug trafficking during the Biden presidency.

Meanwhile, Maduro has criticized Trump's actions in the Caribbean, accusing the US of plotting regime change and seeking to seize Venezuela's oil reserves.

""From Venezuela, we ask and demand an end to the illegal and brutal interventionism of the United States government in Venezuela and in Latin America,"" Maduro told supporters in Caracas in response to the news about the vessel's seizure.

 ""We say no to interventionism, no to destabilization plans for regime change. Let the US government focus on governing its own country,"" Maduro added.

The Trump administration intends to pull four countries away from the European Union (EU), according to a leaked copy of the US National Security Strategy (NSS).

The official NSS, released on Dec 4, warned that Europe faced “civilisational erasure” if it did not cut migration and would be “unrecognisable in 20 years or less” if present trends continued.

But a longer version of the strategy, which was reportedly circulated before the White House unclassified the 29-page document, is more explicit about how the US can “Make Europe Great Again”.

The White House denied the longer version existed, calling reports “fake news”.

The NSS proposes that the US work on fostering relationships with European countries aligned with the Trump administration, according to Defence One.

The document reportedly lists Italy, Hungary, Poland and Austria as countries the US should “work more with... the goal of pulling them away from the [European Union]”.

Mr Trump has made no secret of his affection for Giorgia Meloni, Italy's conservative prime minister.

He described his Italian counterpart as a “fantastic woman” who had “taken Europe by storm” when she visited Mar-a-Lago ahead of his inauguration.

He further extended his praise to the Brothers of Italy leader during her Oval Office visit in April and praised her as “beautiful” during the Middle East peace summit in Egypt in October.

The US president has also had a close relationship with Viktor Orban, Hungary's prime minister, having welcomed him to the White House last month. Mr Trump has endorsed Mr Orban before the Hungarian elections next year, describing him as “fantastic” and handing Hungary an exemption on sanctions for buying Russian oil and gas.

The longer NSS is also understood to note that the US “should support parties, movements, and intellectual and cultural figures who seek sovereignty and preservation/restoration of traditional European ways of life…while remaining pro-American”.

This appears to build on the official document's focus on trying to “cultivate resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations”, eyeing potential allies in the “growing influence of patriotic European parties”.

The parties are left unnamed but presumed to include Marine Le Pen's National Rally in France, Vox in Spain, Reform in the UK, the AfD in Germany and Ms Meloni's Brothers of Italy.

Mr Trump this week condemned European leaders as “weak” for failing to end the war in Ukraine, and accused them of presiding over a “decaying” continent, diminished by illegal migration and political correctness.

On Tuesday, Pope Leo XIV criticised the White House's effort to “break apart” the US-European alliance.

Speaking to reporters after meeting Volodymyr Zelensky, the American Pope was asked about the US peace proposal and the seeming sidelining of European powers.

“Seeking a peace agreement without including Europe in the talks is unrealistic, given the war is in Europe,” he said.

“Guarantees are also being sought for security today and in the future. Europe must be part of this, and unfortunately, not everyone understands this, but I think there is a great opportunity for European leaders to unite and seek a solution together.”

Appearing to comment on the Trump administration's views on the US-Europe alliance, the Pope said what he had read would “make a huge change in what was for many, many years a true alliance between Europe and the United States”.

He said some comments from Mr Trump suggest “trying to break apart what I think needs to be an alliance today and in the future”.

As the US president's frustrations with Europe become more apparent, on Wednesday the House prepared to vote on the National Defence Authorisation Act, which would help limit how far US military presence on the continent can be pared back without Congressional approval.

The leaked version of the NSS also reportedly called for the creation of a new body of powers called the “Core 5”, which would be made up of the US, China, Russia, India and Japan.

Anna Kelly, a White House spokesman, said reports of the longer NSS were “fake news”.

“No alternative, private, or classified version exists. President Trump is transparent and put his signature on one NSS that clearly instructs the US government to execute on his defined principles and priorities,” she told The Telegraph.

“Any other so-called ‘versions' are leaked by people distant from the president who... have no idea what they are talking about.”

“Imagine if our government funded our communities like they fund war.”

That was Rep. Rashida Tlaib's (D-Mich.) response to the House's bipartisan passage Wednesday of legislation that authorizes nearly $901 billion in military spending for the coming fiscal year, as tens of millions of Americans face soaring health insurance premiums and struggle to afford basic necessities amid the nation's worsening cost-of-living crisis.

Tlaib, who voted against the military policy bill, had harsh words for her colleagues who “drool at the opportunity to fund war and genocide, but when it comes to universal healthcare, affordable housing, and food assistance, they suddenly argue that we simply can't afford it.”

“Congress just authorized nearly a trillion dollars for death and destruction but cut a trillion dollars from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act,” said Tlaib, referring to the budget reconciliation package that Republicans and President Donald Trump enacted over the summer.

“They're gutting healthcare and food assistance to pay for bombs and weapons. It's a sick vicious cycle,” Tlaib continued. “Another record-breaking military budget is impossible to justify when Americans are sleeping on the streets, unable to afford groceries to feed their children, and racking up massive amounts of medical debt just for getting sick.”

House passage of the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) came as Republicans in both chambers of Congress pushed healthcare proposals that would not extend enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year, resulting in massive premium hikes for millions.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that a Senate Democratic plan to extend the ACA subsidies for three years would cost around $85 billion — a fraction of the military spending that House lawmakers just authorized.

The NDAA, which is expected to clear the Senate next week, approves $8 billion more in military spending than the Trump White House asked for in its annual budget request.

According to the National Priorities Project, that $8 billion “would be more than enough” to restore federal nutrition assistance to the millions expected to lose it due to expanded work requirements included in the Trump-GOP budget law.

“Our priorities are disgustingly misplaced,” Tlaib said Wednesday.

“The best way to respond to fear and intimidation tactics is to just show we're not afraid. We're going to keep showing up. We're going to keep speaking out,” says musician Jocelyn Walsh, who is facing federal charges for protesting ICE activity in Chicagoland. In this episode of “Movement Memos,” Walsh and Chicago organizers Gabe Gonzalez and Rey Wences talk with host Kelly Hayes about what activists have learned from months of raids, repression, and escalating authoritarian violence.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos”, a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today we'll be talking with three Chicago organizers about what we've learned from two months of intense immigration raids, community defense, protest, and state repression. We'll be hearing from Rey Wences, the Senior Director of Deportation Defense at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights; Gabe Gonzalez, a neighborhood rapid response organizer, and Jocelyn Walsh, a frontline musician who's now facing federal charges. Jocelyn performs with a group called Songs for Liberation, whose music you will hear a bit of today. Our guests today are among the many Chicagoans who have shown up with courage and care over the last few months, and I am proud to have struggled alongside them. 

As raids expand to other cities and the Department of Homeland Security signals that Chicago may be hit even harder in the spring, these lessons feel urgent — both for our own preparation and for anyone, anywhere, who may find themselves facing what we just lived through.

KH: Welcome, friends. Could each of you take a moment to introduce yourselves and tell the audience a bit about the work that you do?

Rey Wences: Hi, everyone, and thank you for the invitation to join this conversation today. My name is Rey Wences. My pronouns are they/them, and I am currently working at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, or ICIRR for short. We are a coalition of member organizations and have been working on advocacy organizing for almost 40 years. I joined the team this past March in 2025, but I have known of the organization for over a decade.

Gabe Gonzalez: I'm Gabe Gonzalez, he/him. I live in Rogers Park, and I'm a founder of the organization Protect RP, which stands for Rogers Park, which is a rapid response and community defense organization on the North Side of the city of Chicago.

Joselyn Walsh: Hi, I'm Joselyn Walsh, she/her pronouns. And right now I'm very involved in organizing with Songs for Liberation and Nourish Community Co-op. Songs for Liberation is a collective for musicians and music lovers who create and share music in movement for liberation of all people. And we do our best to bring the power of song to protests and other public contexts whenever and wherever we can. And my work with Nourish Community Co-op, a worker and community-owned cooperative currently in formation, which will be less relevant to our discussion today, but I bring it up just because so much of my work with communities being targeted in Chicago right now has been not through singing, but through food mutual aid, which is often a less visible work that people do, but is a really essential part of building the networks of care we need to stay connected and grounded through these moments.

KH: I'm so grateful to the three of you for making time for this conversation today. I think we're all trying to catch our breath here in Chicago, after a two-month campaign of terror waged by the federal government against our communities. Each of you played a role in the struggle against that onslaught, within the broader ecosystem of resistance in this city. To start us off, can you talk a bit about how you entered this moment — what work you were doing, and how this crackdown first hit your world? Rey, could you kick us off?

RW: Yes, I can get us started. I entered the work back in 2024, I would say right after leaving the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Migrant and Refugee Rights. I was there for some time, and after leaving in October, transitioning out of that role in October of 2024, I decided to take some time to clear my head, and then also was paying attention to what was happening politically, and was very concerned about the potential of a second Trump administration. And so, I took November, December to also talk to, reconnect with many local and national organizers, and getting to hear how they were preparing and thinking about 2025, and so then by the beginning of the year, I ended up joining the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, or ICIRRR for short.

This is a coalition, right? So, I had known the organization before and decided to use my skills, and really also find a way within the role that I took on at this organization to continue working on building the infrastructure around deportation defense. I had already worked with organizers at OCAD, Organized Communities Against Deportations, on this during the first Trump administration. I think, after having seen the statements from Tom Homan in December of 2024, it was clear to me that this was going to be a different administration we were going to be facing. I think I landed in a place that has given me the opportunity to also have access to see how the crackdown has been evolving since day one. And so, while it's been a very heavy and busy year, it's also been a year full of lessons and collaboration, and I think a lot of reflection too, especially at the end of this year.

KH: Thank you for that. 

Gabe?

GG: So Protect RP was formed, it's an all-volunteer organization, and we were formed in 2017 in the first Trump administration in reaction to their rhetoric around [it] wanting to see a huge uptick in deportations. And we were active, but not at the same scale during the first Trump administration. And then when the pandemic hit, many of the folks who were active in Protect RP became part of mutual aid work that was being done here in Rogers Park, much of it through Alderwoman [Maria] Hadden's office.

Under the Biden administration, while there was a lot of problems at the border and a lot of over-enforcement, and there were obviously problems that were created by the sort of dumping of newcomers here in the city, it wasn't as deep, I don't think. And so the organization, while it still existed, was not as active. And then with the outcome of the election, we reconvened and recommitted ourselves to engaging in community defense work in… Actually, I think it was in December of 2024, because we knew that this time they were going to be a lot more active and a lot more serious about attacking people.

And yeah, and then that's pretty much what happened. So while we restarted the organization and began reorganizing, it was really not until the summer that it took off when we saw a number of invasions here and a number of kidnappings here in Rogers Park, and we saw a huge response from the people that live here because they don't stand for that stuff in Rogers Park. I mean, obviously that's true everywhere, but there's just been a really huge outpouring of activism and support on behalf of people that live here to fight back against ICE. And that's been pretty incredible to see.

KH: It really has been incredible to see, and to participate in. For our listeners who don't know the Chicago area, Rogers Park is an incredibly diverse neighborhood on the North Side of Chicago. It has a large immigrant population, a lot of students, working class families, artists, and highly politicized folks. And I remember, the first day when Rogers Park was heavily targeted by ICE, there were literally hundreds of us in the streets. We were all getting texts, early in the morning, and just running out the door to respond. I was wearing the clothes I slept in, when I rushed up Clark Street, toward Clark and Lunt, where two people had been abducted. When I got there, there were so many people showing up — some people I'd known for years, and a lot of people I had never met. And we were all sort of looking around, trying to figure out what we were supposed to do next. And there were Protect RP organizers there handing out orange whistles and giving us directions. I remember how those whistles helped bind us together as an organized force. Anyone moving down the Clark Street corridor, which was an area ICE would target heavily that day, and in the future, could see that this street was protected. I was really grateful for Protect RP's leadership that day, and also grateful to organizers on the Southwest Side, where immigrant communities had been under siege for weeks before the North Side was targeted, who were sharing their knowledge, and helping other communities prepare, while also defending their own streets. 

Jocelyn, I'm really interested in your perspective as someone who's played an artistic role in this struggle. How did you enter this moment?

JW: Well, Songs for Liberation actually first formed in October 2023 as Songs for Ceasefire. And we were very vocal and singing a lot of songs, coming to a lot of protests, singing about freeing Palestine and ending the Israeli occupation and the genocide going on there. And as time wore on and the genocide has continued, and we have seen that the meaning of “ceasefire” has changed a lot, and we also were starting to get pulled into different ongoing movements for liberation. And so we changed the name to Songs for Liberation and we're showing up at different places. And I feel like the way that I really entered this moment in the context of Songs for Liberation was when we first went to Broadview to sing.

And the level of militarization there was pretty shocking from the outset with the ICE agents all over the roof of the building, all around the building in full tactical gear. And having the experience of singing with this protest group for a few years, we weren't strangers to militarization of law enforcement at protests, but this immediately felt really amped up.

KH: Well, as someone who has had the privilege of protesting alongside Songs for Liberation during Palestine liberation protests, and at the Broadview ICE facility, I want to emphasize how important that artistic contribution has been to our struggles in Chicago — and I think this is always true of art, but I think it's important to emphasize here. During some of the uglier moments outside Broadview, when we were being gassed, and hit with pepper balls and foam baton rounds, you all kept playing and singing, and encouraging people to sing with you, and that music felt like a spiritual lifeline. There's actually an iconic photo that I took of Jocelyn, with her gas mask on, playing her guitar on the frontline, that I really think captures the spirit of that day, and those protests. Because the beauty and energy you all brought to those moments really helped us stay grounded in our love for each other and our neighbors while we were trying to take moral action. And I hold a lot of gratitude for that. Because, as you've said, those were some jarring moments of escalation.

Thinking about that escalation more broadly, I'm curious where each of you felt that shift into extremity. Because, in my experience, there wasn't a singular tipping point. There was a lot happening, on many fronts, across Chicagoland. So, when did the gravity of the situation really become evident, in your own work, and how did your groups and networks adjust?

RW: So in my role as the director of ICIRR's newest department, which is the Deportation Defense Department — just for some background, this new department manages the Family Support Network hotline, which, as ICIRR, we have been encouraging people to call to report ICE activity. And then that also plays a role in activating the teams that are part of the Rapid Response Network. And this infrastructure is something that, as Gabe was talking about, some of the teams got started in 2017 during the first Trump administration. And here in ICIRR's support in coordination and collaboration with OCAD, Organized Communities Against Deportation, that has been the focus in terms of building in that infrastructure. What are the tools that we have, the infrastructure, and then how can we connect people to legal representation?

And that said, I think for me, the escalation and the turning point started in waves. Definitely when we talk, for me, the escalation, there was an escalation that was very insidious and hidden and an escalation that was very public and bold. And some of the things that we started seeing early on in the spring is how people that were being targeted by ICE… they were being moved rapidly from one detention center to another, therefore preventing them from getting that legal representation, which under another administration could have happened. It was never really perfect or the perfect system, but attorneys and advocates, we had some access.

And so to me, one of the first escalation points in terms of just how heinous this administration is around forcibly removing people started early in the spring. Then there was another point of escalation where we started seeing more visibly that aggressiveness, that physical violence, and that was on June 4th, that was actually coincided with another tactic that I think goes back to another escalation from the Department of Homeland Security, which was sending out these text messages to people that had been paroled into the country and telling them to show up at their check-in and essentially people were going and being detained.

And there was a protest that broke outside of one of the offices, and we saw how dozens of agents came in and the way that they pushed out the crowd and were also being violent. And I think, again, there was another instance right on Father's Day weekend where they sent text messages basically telling people to show up on June 15th at the Broadview Processing Center. And so there were many escalations or things that happened all leading up to Operation Midway Blitz and Operation At Large, which I think to me just opened up the gates to even more violence for many agents to be emboldened. And it was more, of course, the number of agents that were here, and I think a real escalated attempt to create propaganda for the operation.

GG: Yeah, I think that all tracks with our experience. So what we saw locally in the beginning was individual sets of ICE agents, two, maybe three, at most four people coming to specific addresses, pretending to have warrants. They usually did not have judicial warrants. You could tell because they would knock on the door instead of knocking the door down. And we saw that if we had word of ICE in the neighborhood, we had a fairly… it seemed then like a short time, but now it seems like a very lengthy time, somewhere around eight minutes to respond to what they were doing. And there were a few instances early on where we were able to get there and it was clear that these agents were not particularly well-trained because we would show up and they would leave because they knew they were on tenuous ground and because they didn't know how to handle crowds and they didn't like being filmed and all of that stuff.

And then I think we saw, yes, in the time period that Rey was describing, a change, a shift to larger groups of agents, gangs of agents roaming the streets much more aggressive[ly], much more in people's face. We saw what began to happen on the Southwest Side where they began using pepper balls and tear gas on people. I don't like this term “non-lethal.” They talk about that… like somehow using that term makes people sound like an expert, but I think it really takes away from the impact of what is happening in streets where people live. We saw them tear gas people on the Southwest Side on a day when it was a warm day, people's windows were open, people were stooping. And so to be subjected to that at the hands of officers of the state was awful. And we saw how they were shifting and how they were beginning to change their operation.

And then that was really a moment, I think, when there were two things that became clear to us. One was that terror and punishment, collective punishment were part of the program, that all of their rhetoric around community safety and the “worst of the worst,” we knew it was a lie to begin with, but it was made so clear that what they were attempting to do was terrorize communities in order to control them. And it had nothing to do with “immigration enforcement.” That was the excuse for authoritarianism. And so that became very clear to us. And it also became very clear to us that then our response had to be about defense against authoritarianism in this moment being about what they're doing to our immigrant brothers and sisters, but not… We think they'll change over time and morph because authoritarians need an enemy and they will look for a new enemy.

I mean, you can see what they're doing right now in Minneapolis, where they're targeting refugee communities. I mean, refugees, people who had to run here and who have some form of status generally speaking, and they're targeting them all the same because to them, anybody who doesn't look white and uptight is like the enemy.

So we tracked all of that and began to respond to all of that as well. And one of the things that we started doing in the summer and continue doing is teaching our folks not only how to document and how to bear witness to what's happening, but also nonviolent direct action. How do we use our bodies? How do we move collectively? How do we communicate if we're in a large group with each other? How do we respond to the tactics that they're using as a group? And that has been really, I think, an important learning for us about how to keep ourselves safe, but also how to remain effective in a moment of a great authoritarian escalation.

KH: What you were saying about the shift in tactics and intensity that we saw makes me think about the difference between ICE agents and Customs and Border Patrol agents. Because, as Gabe mentioned, ICE agents would sometimes show up really unprepared, and seemingly out of their depth. I don't know if that's because ICE agents are being cranked out so rapidly by this administration, or what the deal is. But the Border Patrol agents seemed more hardened and the street violence, the snatch and grab kidnappings, that all seemed like second nature to them. And part of the reason for that, I think, is that Border Patrol routinely gets away with extreme violence and cruelty that the broader public never sees, targeting people who are trying to enter this country or have just arrived. This is what they do, and how they treat people. We're just not used to seeing it out in the open in our neighborhoods. We're not used to seeing our neighbors tear gassed, including children and families, who are just trying to get home, and I think that's the kind of thing you can't unsee.

Gabe, I also really appreciate what you're saying about defending our immigrant neighbors while also recognizing the inevitable expansion of authoritarian violence. We've seen glimpses of that, with US citizens being targeted by ICE agents, and also with what's happened in Washington, D.C., where, due to that city's unique legal status, the administration was able to take over the police department. With that legal range of motion, we saw unhoused people being targeted en masse, regardless of their immigration status, and we saw Black and brown people targeted with abandon. And so I think it's really important to think of community defense and building community safety in broad terms, as part of an anti-authoritarian project — and one that will I hope will endure after we bring down this administration, because the violence of policing and the threat of authoritarianism won't fade with the Trump administration. And I think one of the most powerful things we've found in this moment is each other, and our ability to create as much safety and justice as we can, on our own terms, in our communities. We're not out here calling the police — even though some people occasionally got confused about why we couldn't do that, and why that wouldn't help. But we've held, as a community norm amid all of this, that we don't call them, because they won't help us, and will actually pose a danger to people. So we've turned to each other for solutions. And I hope we keep turning to each other, and I hope those bonds endure. 

Jocelyn, what was your experience of a turning point, or recognizing the severity of the escalation here?

JW: For me, it was a pretty personal inflection point of escalation when I experienced the violence of ICE directly when they shot my guitar with one of those “less than lethal munitions,” which really does not feel less than lethal when it goes through the front of your guitar, through the back of your guitar, and can still leave a really nasty bruise on your leg even after the blow is softened. I mean, I hate to think of what would've happened if any of those had hit anyone in the head. And I know people had some pretty serious injuries. And again, like Gabe is saying, it's like they're trying to create this atmosphere of terror by pretty randomly using force in ways that seem designed to put everyone on edge.

They're acting with impunity, letting off these gasses and munitions. And unfortunately, I also feel like for some state actors, moments like that, they've been used to say like, “Hey, look, we need the Illinois State Police to protect these protestors from ICE.” But then that felt like another point of escalation where I felt even less safe having it even more completely militarized there at Broadview. And we have dozens of Illinois State Police standing close range, slapping their batons against their hands threateningly. And people might ask, “Well, don't you feel more safe with these trained Illinois State Police who know how to deal with crowds versus ICE agents shooting at you randomly?” And you can't really choose between being gassed and being beaten with batons at close range. They're both violence and if anything, I felt safer before the Illinois State Police were there because at least I knew there were that many less ICE agents going out and kidnapping people in the city because they were there listening to the concert we were providing for them.

KH: As someone who witnessed the violence of the state police at Broadview, and experienced the violence of federal agents while state police were also on the ground policing us, I wholeheartedly agree with what you're saying, Jocelyn. I understand that this was J.B. Pritzker's legal strategy — that by taking over crowd control at Broadview, he was trying to undercut the government's argument that the protests justified Trump's efforts to deploy the National Guard. But I believe the governor should have made his case against deploying the Guard by defending the protesters.

And as we saw with Chicago Headline Club v. Noem — the case brought by protesters and journalists against ICE for excessive force — it was entirely possible to make that case in open court. The government's claims that federal agents were under attack simply weren't true. I'm grateful to the people who brought that suit, and to the lawyers who documented — on the public record and for the historical record — the many lies Bovino and his agents told about being the victims of violence. Time and again, it was shown that their stories were fabrications, and that they were the perpetrators, not the targets, of violence.

Our governor could have pointed to that reality, instead of sending in the state police to ensure that ICE's operations at Broadview could proceed without interruption. In fact, an internal DHS email referenced in the court case about the Guard shows Peter Sukmanowski, assistant director of ICE's Chicago field office, telling Russell Hott and others:

DHS did not have to intervene with any protesters Saturday or Sunday [October 4 and 5]. The support from this unified command, and the communication with their on-site incident commander, has been great thus far this weekend. It's clear that ISP is the difference maker in this scenario, and we are grateful for their leadership. Hopefully, we can keep it up for the long haul.

I think our state's leaders should feel shamed by those words. And I think we should make it clear to our elected officials that we don't want them to be the “difference maker” for ICE — whether in enabling ICE's operations in our communities or in shielding ICE from the protests their violence inspires. I wanted to say that here, since we're talking about our takeaways from these events. I think the lawyers, journalists and activists who challenged ICE's actions in court, rather than accommodating them, collaborating with them, or capitulating to them taught us something about defending resistors and telling the truth — because that's how you fight authoritarianism.

So with all of that in mind, as these attacks and acts of resistance were unfolding, what stood out to you? What surprised you about the federal escalations we witnessed, or about how your communities responded?

RW: What surprised me about the federal escalation definitely was the increased violence, the way in which we saw the evolution really of that violence from January through now. It surprised me how evil these agents have been and can be. And it is very worrisome that there is no way of holding agents accountable, especially those federal agents. There's actually specific people that we saw, agents that we saw in the communities that were enacting a lot of violence and on purpose. And it's surprising still to this day that there is no accountability at the local level nor at the federal level. That said though, I don't think I'm so surprised because Chicago is such an organized city. I am very grateful and hopeful because of all the community response that really looked like what Gabe was describing, the recording, the making sure that people know their rights, people just started self-organizing.

I think networks were created during the pandemic and even before that. I think what surprised me maybe was how fast we came together. I think speaking from the ICIRR perspective, again, we knew that we had access to managing the Family Support Network Hotline. We have access to pushing legislation at the state level and also advocating in different ways. So that response to me, staying in that lane, it also, I think, allowed for us to collaborate with other groups that were coming out and self-organizing. I think ultimately the strategies that felt possible were around connecting with neighbors.

It was about also creating and providing a framework. Early on when as ICIRR, we started doing or resumed doing rapid response trainings, one of the challenges that we were having was that people were using Rapid Response and Migra Watch interchangeably. And so one of the strategies that we tried to use for also creating space for people to support regardless of their immigration status was this framework around Rapid Response being how we prepare our communities before, during, and after a raid. So before a raid, doing all the talking to your neighbors, canvassing, sharing Know Your Rights information, coordinating workshops at the very hyper-local level. During the raid, that's when the Migra Watch gets activated. That's when people go out and document. Calls can come into the hotline or people can just find out about it through word of mouth or social media. But the intent is to go out and verify and then connect people to those resources that are available if they wish to.

And then the third part is being the advocacy, which that piece, the post-raid efforts or the strategies felt more real and possible to me personally after we started seeing the impact of all of the documentation that people were doing either in an organized manner or on their own. We knew that we had, as OCAD and ICIRR had had this win with the Nava settlement back in 2018. And so we were also in deep conversations with legal partners like the National Immigrant Justice Center and others that could help us push these strategies that felt more possible when we can actually take them to court. So we took them to court for unlawfully arresting hundreds of people. There were other ways that also the community came together, which was also one of the responses that surprised me is just, again, the way that the legal community also came together, all the attorneys to provide support.

And I think it also speaks to the intention to build a movement lawyering community here in Chicago, not just for this issue, but it's been for many other issues. And we're seeing how it all intersected, especially when people started getting arrested at Broadview and we started seeing citizens that were responding to raids also getting targeted and arrested by federal agents.

GG: Yeah, I agree with that point that Rey is making around everybody playing their role. That was really, well, I don't know if we were surprised, mostly because we were just focused on what we were doing, but what became a really important aspect of the work was the response to these invasions was collective, and the collective was so large. I was talking with somebody about this just yesterday, because I'm old, way back in 2006, and we thought we had a chance to pass comprehensive immigration reform. We really felt like we were part of a movement. Well, it turned out we were only a part of a movement amongst ourselves, and there was a much broader American community that was not paying attention or didn't like the issue. And it feels so very different now. So many people are engaged and throwing down. And to Rey's point, playing the role that they can, and that includes… We have a channel here on the North Side. It's, I don't know, I'm going to say 20 elected officials on it, and nobody's trying to bigfoot, nobody's trying to get the spotlight.

They're all saying, “What can we do?” And they're making plans collectively and they're backing each other up. And we have another one with school principals, and it's the same thing. Now, it wasn't always easy. And sometimes it required some of these local institutions to realize the nature of the threat. But once that happened, we've seen doors open up and people think very creatively and willing to take risks that have just been incredible to see.

And that's been really… And again, I don't know about a surprise, but it's been great to see it and to feel like we were part of that. 

I would say what surprises me about them is, and maybe it shouldn't, but it's just how stupid they are. They really felt that they were so untouchable that they could go into Anglo communities like Lincoln Park or Old Irving Park and tear gas people, or they could steal people out of their place where they worked with children and just get away with it, or that they could beat people in the street, or that they could rip children away from their parents, and that people wouldn't see it and people wouldn't be revolted by it. They really thought they could just do it. And that's been….

I remember when we were at Oakton and Dodge and they were beating that guy and we're screaming at him like, “This isn't right. You got to know this isn't right.” And I remember one of them all masked up, but you could see his eyes and he looked me right in the face and you could see the glee in his eyes. And I'm astounded that they think they're going to get away with this. That is so surprising to me.

JW: Yeah. Again, as someone who's been singing at protests for the last couple years, I've just been shocked at the level of unprovoked force being used by agents against protestors in ways that even as a somewhat long-time protestor, I just have not seen before. And that's been shocking to me. And I've been so grateful for the response that people have had of solidarity with each other, of caring for each other, protecting each other, just trying to figure out how to respond in the face of this violence. But that's been really shocking.

KH: I would agree with that. As someone who's spent a lot of time organizing against the violence of policing, I always expect the worst from law enforcement. But local police departments tend to have certain norms or patterns that activists can study to get a rough sense of our risk level on the ground — or to guess when an escalation might be coming. It's never a perfect formula, but there are signals we can read that can help us understand how much danger we're in.

That simply does not exist when you're dealing with Border Patrol or ICE in this context. And I wasn't prepared for it. The first time I showed up at Broadview, within three minutes I took that footage — which has now been everywhere — of Reverend David Black being shot in the head with pepper balls by agents on the roof, while he stood on the sidewalk pleading with them to have a conscience. And within minutes, the air was barely breathable because those agents were firing pepper balls indiscriminately into the crowd. The level of recreational, unpredictable violence was truly shocking, even for me.

It was also really unpredictable in the streets, for people out on patrol, who were filming ICE, or accused of following ICE in their cars, or obstructing the actions of federal agents. A woman in Brighton Park was shot. Of course, the government made a bunch of wild accusations against her, but now, all of those charges against her have been dropped — because upon investigation, most of their stories fall apart. 

A lot of people observed ICE or alerted people to their presence without incident, but sometimes, we would see ICE watchers threatened, assaulted, sometimes pulled from their bikes or cars and arrested. But, as Gabe said, a lot of folks continued to take risks, because they simply couldn't allow these things to happen without pushing back. ICE killed a man in Franklin Park. Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez had children who needed him. They snatched a teacher from a daycare center in front of small children, and marched small children naked into the street, in the middle of the night, when they raided an entire apartment building in South Shore. These actions pushed a lot of people to think about who we are, in relation to this violence, and about what we owe to each other.

I was also so moved by the response — by how broad it was, by so many people from different backgrounds, with different beliefs, who united in opposition to these attacks. People who ran into the streets, sometimes in their pajamas, sometimes before brushing their teeth, because whistles were being blown, or alerts were going out, and they were ready to take moral action. I thought I knew how much I loved this city, and over the last few months, Chicagoans made me love it more. I really didn't think that was possible, but here we are.

So I want to ask: In this moment, what did you all learn about what solidarity demands of us?

GG: I can start. It's all so cliche, but it's true: patience, generosity. I don't think there's an individual word for this, but one of the things that we say among the leadership of Protect RP as a constant mantra for all of us is take the work very seriously, don't take yourself very seriously. Trying to be there for the community and for the work that we're doing, but it's not about aggrandizement. And also being willing to learn. We learned a lot. So there's organizations like Rad RP and others that exist in Rogers Park that we really learned a lot from and had a big influence on how we operate and creating a more distributed model and wanting to see a really expansive kind of leadership. Honestly, I was a professional community organizer for a very long time, and I have learned so much in the past six months.

Yeah, I'll stop there. But it's been an awful time, but also we've seen just so much grace and beauty in the people of this city.

RW: I agree. Along those lines, I think early on and going back to the conversation around just roles, we learned that solidarity also requires leaving the ego at the door and giving clarity as well as asking for clarity. And that became specifically really important, especially around coalition building. And I think there isn't one manual to get this done from A to Z perfectly, but I think we are all learning and have leaned in and also practice curiosity because I think in every space that I've been in since I came into this role, the task is clear. We are showing up for our communities, for each other, and for ourselves.

JW: Completely agree with all of that too. And I think something we say a lot in food mutual aid work is, “Solidarity, not charity.” And I think something that that really means in this moment is recognizing that when we are out there in the street, we really all are in this together. And if say you were approaching that in a charity mindset of, I'm out here for someone else, not for myself or something, a lot of the time people will ignore their own needs or think of themselves as more of a robot than a human and end up lashing out or letting the ego get in the way or not attending to your own humanity in it.

And I think one of the things that solidarity demands of us of the many things is to recognize that we need to take care of ourselves in this too, and also ask for the support that we need when things happen and not be afraid of conflict in our communities or being able to say when asking for support, “Hey, this is actually what I really need right now from my friends or from my comrades.” And I think it does require our willingness to collaborate with boundaries.

We're often singing with all kinds of different religious groups that we may not necessarily agree with every creed of when we're singing in Songs for Liberation. I think last Friday we were singing with the American Baptists and you can end up getting these really beautiful moments where you're able to find common ground on the things that you can while still being yourselves and being willing to learn, willing to experiment. It's been an incredibly generative time for all members of Songs for Liberation to be writing so many new songs and trying things out and being willing to be vulnerable or say, like, “Hey, that sounded great.” Or, “No, man, maybe I wouldn't play that one again.” And talking through the lyrics also helps us talk through and clarify our political beliefs and strategies with each other too.

KH: All of that resonates so much, and I really appreciate what Rey was saying about leaving ego at the door. Community defense work is such an important opportunity to rehearse our values, and it can be a real exercise in humility. I think some leftists associate action with the sense of confrontation we might experience in frontline protest situations, but when we practice community defense, we're all just nodes in a larger ecosystem of care and defense. Like when I've done school patrol work, monitoring school zones for ICE activity at the beginning and end of the school day — a good day is an incredibly low key experience. You are just holding down your corner, observing, communicating, and hopefully, you just watch a bunch of parents pick up their kids. I think a lot of leftists would benefit from engaging with that kind of work, which I think helps us recognize that we're not gonna win through individual acts of heroism, but through our willingness to play our part in something much larger than ourselves.

But, of course, some volunteers did have intense days on school patrol, when ICE attacked people in proximity to schools in our city. And we also had a lot of tough days in the streets, when despite our best efforts, many of our neighbors were kidnapped. And we know that there has been a lot of violence and repression, targeting resistors in recent months. So, I want to ask, what were some of the material, emotional, or political consequences of the choices you and your co-strugglers made? Jocelyn, would you like to start us on this one?

JW: Yeah, I can start on this one. The political and personal consequences have been very real. I was at work one Monday last month when I started getting repeated calls from someone who said they were a special agent at the FBI who needed to speak with me. And I called the National Lawyers Guild and initially spoke with Molly Armour who said she would figure out what was going on. And in the meantime, got another FBI call saying that if I didn't respond, they'd be at my door at 8:00 am the next morning to detain me with a warrant for my arrest. And I was really shocked and confused. And the NLG soon called me back to tell me I had been federally indicted and I would need to self-surrender at some point to avoid an arrest. The first few days with this news, I was incredibly unsettled because the indictment hadn't been unsealed and I had no idea what the allegations were.

And I really racked my brain trying to imagine how simply protesting while being a victim of ICE's violence myself could have resulted in me being charged. But once I was appointed a lawyer, Brad Thomson from the People's Law Office, we discovered I was being charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor assault along with five other individuals who I had never met or even spoken to previously. And the news broke around the same time we learned that the other defendants either were holding some sort of political office or working in politics. So it became very clear that this was a targeted political attack. Although I was still confused as to how or why I was being pursued, but as more details emerged and I had more conversations with both my lawyers and other organizers, it increasingly seemed like we were being singled out because federal officers had assaulted us in very public ways.

With my guitar being shot and with Kat Abughazaleh being thrown to the ground, we could only conclude that this was some kind of intimidation tactic and a desperate misguided attempt to control the narrative through that. So this is sadly consistent with the way my other fellow organizers have been brutalized and detained at Broadview simply for speaking out about the conditions our neighbors are facing and how their constitutional rights have been trampled. So we've been told to stand in these designated free speech zones. And even when we comply, police and federal agents have kettled us, forcibly backed us away from the facility, thrown us to the ground, and in some cases detained us overnight and brought more completely baseless charges. And this all seems like an attempt to criminalize protesting and free speech while the federal government and state government break the law on a daily basis, detaining people without due process, violating the TRUST Act by having these state agents collaborate with ICE, terrorizing our communities and denying those who are detained those basic guaranteed rights of pastoral care, medical care, and clean spaces to eat and sleep.

And as scary as this all is, I do want to also point out that, if these are the things they're willing to do in broad daylight, what are they doing to people that they're detaining in this atmosphere? And when I'm being able to get this due process through the indictment and at the same time, I'm hearing stories of people who are held in conditions so bad and being lied to about what they're signing and being forced to sign these self-deportation papers and people who are getting no due process with all of this violence being brought against us.

So yeah, the political and personal consequences have been real, but I also don't want anyone listening to this to think, okay, now I'm too afraid to protest because I think as someone who has been targeted in that way for protesting myself, I can say there's so much support. There's so much support from the NLG, there's so much support from other organizers. And I know that I'm going to make it through this and I've still been out protesting since then and it feels like the best way to respond to fear and intimidation tactics is to just show we're not afraid. We're going to keep showing up. We're going to keep speaking out.

KH: Joselyn, I really appreciate the depth and honesty of what you just shared. What happened to you — being shot with a foam baton round, then targeted with a conspiracy charge alongside people you'd never even met — really captures the logic of repression we've been talking about throughout this episode. It's about flipping the narrative, punishing the witnesses, and trying to terrify anyone who might step forward next time. 

The brave and generous spirit that you are bringing to this situation is an example for us all, and I am so grateful that you are being supported right now. I want to remind folks that, too often, people who are targeted for repression in moments of mass activation wind up being forgotten by the broader public, and even by other highly politicized people, as the news cycle moves on, and that's a norm we need to break. We have to support our people, and remember that it's not over until everyone — including all of our target neighbors and all of our resistors — are free. 

Gabe, what has your experience of consequences been like during this time?

GG: It doesn't really compare, but I mean, similarly, it's scary. I don't know if my in-laws are ever going to hear this podcast, but I quit my job to do this because I wasn't really working. I was just doing this anyway and it didn't seem fair to them. So there's been a significant financial cost to us. But yes, my wife and I were both deeply engaged in Protect RP. We've had multiple conversations about personal safety and making plans in case they start targeting a broader set of us in the way that they're targeting Jocelyn.

And they're awful conversations to have. But yeah, absolutely the same thing. We talk a lot about courage and risk assessment at Protect RP and we can't talk about those things and encourage people to do those things without doing it ourselves. And so I would also say, and the emotional toll, watching them be so violent, even if they weren't violent towards me personally, I grew up in a violent atmosphere, and experiencing that or re-experiencing that can be very traumatic. But I cannot imagine doing anything else in this moment. I don't think I could live with myself if I didn't do what I could to be in solidarity with others in this moment. So yeah, it sucks, but I don't know. What are you supposed to do?

KH: I feel what you're saying really deeply, Gabe. I think my worst moments over these past couple months have involved documenting things that I and others couldn't prevent. It's really hard to see, and it can be traumatizing, but like you, I can't imagine not trying. In fact, I know it would be worse to live through this without trying. Because that's where all of my hope and strength have come from — from moving, and acting and building alongside people like you all, and creating as much justice and safety as we can in opposition to this violence. That has kept me going. 

And since you all mentioned work, I also want to give a shout out to my colleagues at Truthout, who have really had my back over the last couple of months. There were days when our area was getting hit really hard when I just told my colleagues, “I'm sorry, I might blow this deadline, but ICE is abducting my neighbors, and I have to get out there,” and people weren't just understanding — they stepped up harder so I could be there for my community. And I have so much love and appreciation for my colleagues, because I really needed that support, and they came through.Rey, what has your experience been like, around consequences?

RW: Thank you for sharing that. Material, emotional, and political consequences. For me, I think about just the emotional impact of choosing to be part of this work, especially, I mean, I'm thinking about the operators. As I mentioned, we have this hotline and we have, as ICIRR, we manage operators that are answering the hotline and essentially talking to people that are calling in crisis. So that has definitely had an impact on people's emotional wellbeing. I think over time, I have also seen the physical impact of just doing this work every day almost nonstop. And I definitely have heard from members of the Rapid Response Network also feeling on alert all the time. And even now that the activity has lessened a little bit, still that feeling like someone is watching you or being on high alert. And then I think as an organization, the political consequences that we all have to be ready for long-term, short-term and long-term, which can include, and we've been in the mouth of members of the Republican Oversight Committee.

We know that there have been organizations that we work with at the national level that have been included in investigations. Whenever we would do, even at the beginning of the year when we were looking at the material, the language, how are we going to present this to the public? And will doing this Know Your Rights or talking about this thing put us at a higher risk of being a target? Ultimately, I think we recognize we're already a target. And so yeah, I think the political consequences is an area that we try to push when we can. And especially I think at the local level, we have a little bit more room, but ultimately that doesn't mean that the federal government cannot come for the organization, our funding in the ways that we have seen them go after organizations that support trans communities. So yeah.

KH: Thank you for naming all of that, Rey. I've also heard a lot of rapid responders talk about the hypervigilance that can set in when you're living your life on high alert, ready to respond to an incoming threat. It can be hard to shift gears and feel something else. One thing I learned during all of this is that I sometimes have to forcibly make space to feel something else, even when my body and brain feel stuck in go-mode. We need to make space for laughter, and we need activities that soothe our nervous systems, and it's not always going to feel natural to access the things we need. Sometimes, it's going to feel awkward at first, but we need to attend to ourselves as whole people, and we need to attend to each other. I was really grateful to people who hosted healing events, including somatic healing and PTSD prevention workshops during Midway Blitz, and people who participated in direct actions that were really acts of political communion, that grounded us in our values and our sense of connection to each other. We have a long fight ahead, so we really need to take care of ourselves and each other.

And speaking of that long fight: Sources inside DHS have stated that they're going to come back with four times as many agents in March. We obviously don't know if that's true or yet another lie from this administration, but we obviously have to prepare as though it's true. Without giving away anything that you don't want to reveal in public, what kind of work do you think needs to be done at the grassroots level here in Chicago to prepare for another surge of federal attacks and the escalation that could entail? 

GG: We've been talking a lot about this with the leadership of Protect RP. We're in a process right now, as I think many groups across the city are, of analysis and evaluation. What did we do well? What do we need to do better? What do we need to change? I think a lot of the folks here have touched on a lot of this. 

Well, first off, let me say, we don't know if they're coming back either or not because they lie all the time. Regardless though, we do believe that there will be, as I said at the beginning, some other form of oppression because they can't afford to lose. They've already done too much to too many people. They can't afford to lose. So we know that there will be some form of oppression and we know that the answer to that lies in community. So over the winter, we're going to be focusing on continuing to build community and to engage as many people as possible and to listen as well as explain what we're thinking.

And then come the spring, we're going to ramp up again as much as possible. I would say this, if there is a reinvasion in the spring. We're assuming they'll do it around the election and not because they particularly care about the Illinois primaries, but because it's a practice for them. And if they can successfully interfere with polling places, then they'll do it in force in November. That's what we're assuming because there's precedence for this. If you think before January 6th, those bunch of militia guys showed up in Michigan and I think a couple of other states as well at their state capitols, they were practicing and we would assume that that would be one of the things they would do first. And so we are thinking about not only reinvigorating the patrols in the way we do community defense here, but thinking about that kind of thing as well.

What does it look like to defend a polling place? What does it look like to… What's the message that we want to bring to this around democracy and around freedom and liberty and all those sort of good old-fashioned words… that seem so meaningless now. Yeah, but that's what we're thinking about right now.

RW: Similarly, we want to be ready and part of that is also looking at the hotline, the quality control really of how calls are coming in, how they're being answered, how we are connecting people to the legal referrals. So all of that, that's part of, again, we want to make sure that we don't run into issues. Scaling up is going to be another part of the planning. We had to scale up this year. The hotline actually just started with live operators at the beginning of this year. And when Operation Midway Blitz started, we had to triple the number of operators that we had just answering the ICE-sighting calls. And so with that in mind, having some standard now or some understanding of what that looks like, if they're coming three, four times or whatever, we have to figure out a plan. That's to just keep the system going.

And then the other piece is as a statewide coalition, the Rapid Response Network teams that we have been helping build out outside of the city, there are some in the suburbs and it is our intention to continue helping other groups and organizations anchor their own Rapid Response teams since we're also looking at data and looking at different communities where we know there's a large immigrant population, but maybe we're not getting as many calls because of the infrastructure there doesn't exist. So looking towards preparing for if they come back, as well as also looking into building longer term where we know there's communities and where we could go and support.

JW: I want to mostly echo here, but I think through the winter, continuing to do that work of building relationships with each other, learning from each other, I know we'll continue to have rehearsals and shows and things for Songs for Liberation. We're getting ready to sing some anti-imperialist Free Palestine Christmas Carols at the Christkindlmarket this winter. And I think things where I know protesting for Palestine is not the same as doing Rapid Response, but I think all of these fronts are connected where we find ourselves connecting to each other. And that puts you in touch with the next person who then when they say, “Hey, there's something going on. It's actually really close to where you live. Can you go respond to this right now?” And I think there's so many ways that we can keep forming these relationships with each other. And I think I'm going to be working on memorizing all of the lyrics to all of my friends' new songs.

There's some really great ones there, some of that kind of work. Working on our messaging where I'm also in a local band called Weird Rabbit. We're writing a lot more songs about this. We're writing about the guitar getting shot and we're really trying to combat that propaganda that's being put out saying that somehow joining ICE is some kind of heroic, play call of duty in real life thing that you are going to do for your country and kind of poking fun at the idea of cosplaying as this GI Joe when you're really joining the state's secret police force, and just really trying to flip the narrative on them as much as we can in that way to showcase the reality of what's going on. And then I think the last thing that I would say there is just continuing to build the infrastructure that can sustain us through this.

I know a lot of folks, like Gabe, you've mentioned, and Kelly too, there's days where you gotta be out there and you feel the need to respond to something and that can clash with us sustaining ourselves and getting our paychecks. And so as much as we can, building some infrastructure to support each other with things like food cooperatives that we're working on, which is often hard to pull away from things that feel really urgent to focus on some of that deeper infrastructure building, but feels so important. And work with the Chicago Food Sovereignty Coalition, people who are forming networks of mutual aid to deliver groceries to people who can't get out. And some of that work, again, that maybe feels more mundane, is less front and center and at the same time is so important for us to be doing as well.

KH: Thank you, Jocelyn. I really appreciate how you're naming the whole spectrum of what sustains us — the creative work, the relationships, the messaging, and the infrastructure that lets people keep showing up when it matters. I believe community defense is a form of mutual aid, so this really is all one struggle and one fight. And I also think it's important to name all the ways food-based mutual aid and material support have been crucial over the last couple of months — people bringing food to their neighbors who didn't feel safe leaving the house, people buying out street vendors, to help them get off the streets, and then distributing the food. There are so many ways Chicagoans have taken care of each other, and I really think caring for each other has been at the heart of this struggle, and I think we should be proud of that.

As we close things out today, I want to ask, what have you all been hearing from folks in other cities that have recently faced these mass raid operations? And what do you want to communicate to folks who haven't seen this violence yet, but expect to?

GG: So we've been talking to folks in Charlotte, Minneapolis, Memphis, and New Orleans, and it's all some variation of, “My God, this is awful. What did y'all do? We're doing this.” Usually sometimes asking for specific help, sometimes more general, like, “Just tell us everything you did so we can figure out our own solutions here.” But there is a lot of the same sense of solidarity. And I think the other thing that I hear a lot is that while I think we can all agree, it often felt very, very lonely when they were attacking us and it felt like nobody was there for us, and they were all watching. I know this because I talked to them and they were all watching and they were all cheering us on and they're all ready to learn now. And that has been both humbling and gratifying to hear, and will help us, I think, if they come back, to know that we're not alone.

RW: Yeah, I think what I can share is from the ICIRR perspective, the conversations that our legal team has been having, our organizers and others have really been focused on organizations or groups in different states trying to learn more about the hotline, how it operates, how we run it, how to scale it up, all of those questions. I think people are looking to figure out either how they repurpose what they already have and/or developing other infrastructure. And then the other piece that I think we have also been able to share more about has been on the legislative side toward the veto session here in Illinois. ICIRR was able to push a couple of bills that look to try to prevent ICE agents from being in hospitals or at least setting some parameters there since we started seeing the presence of ICE agents, federal agents at hospitals, at schools, parking lots, et cetera.

So people and organizations have also been curious in terms of some of the partnerships that made that happen, the language, and then also have just been sharing some of the pieces around the Nava consent decree and how we have been building this case against ICE for years in terms of accusing them and finding them guilty for unlawfully arresting people. So that has also been something that I think, like Gabe was saying, people are watching and are really curious what they can also get moving.

Of course, I think one reality is that not everything that works here is going to work in other places. So yeah, we have been making ourselves available to share. Ultimately, we trust the leadership of the local groups, and then we're also looking out for what enforcement looks like in those cities because it will also help us prepare. Prior to being hit during Immigration Midway Blitz and Operation At Large, we were also in conversation with people and organizations in LA and in D.C., and that helped us put some of the planning that we did ahead of that.

JW: So, my partner is from Memphis, and we've been talking to family and friends there about more of those indiscriminate and unlawful kidnappings that are happening now in Memphis. And even people who lean a bit more conservative or moderate have been shocked and outraged by how wrong this is. And I think just continuing to not discount that you won't be able to count on people or maybe they haven't necessarily shown up in a movement space before, but just to try reaching out to people and try to make those connections. And I think you might be surprised by where you can find those moments of solidarity and just a reminder to everyone to do some research on digital security and be considerate about how you take pictures and share pictures in protest situations as we can expect them to continue to escalate violence against protestors, just not giving them the moments to find ways to twist.

KH: Well, I want to thank you all so much for joining me today. I am so grateful for the work you do, for this conversation, and to be in the struggle with you.

JW: Thanks for having us, Kelly.

RW: Thank you.

GG: Thank you for the time.

[musical interlude]

KH: I am really grateful for that conversation, and for all of our listeners and readers who are thinking about how they can best defend their communities. We'll be including some resources in the show notes that some folks have found useful in their brainstorming around these issues.

This is our last episode of 2025, and since I've spent the homestretch of this year thinking and talking about our work here in Chicago, I want to close by reading an excerpt from something I wrote last month about how much I love this city right now. In a piece called, “In Chicago, We Run Toward Danger Together,” I wrote:

I see you, Chicago. I see you brave and beautiful in your cars, tailing ICE vehicles. I see you charging out of your homes before you've brushed your teeth to blow your whistles, shout down ICE agents, and hold onto your neighbors. I see you getting arrested and facing charges. I see you defending each other in the face of repression. I see you singing in the street, on a chilly Monday night, holding a lighted message that reads “RESIST ICE.” I see you gathering, hundreds at a time, to learn, to keep watch, and bare your teeth. I see you running toward danger, together, and loving each other more fiercely than you ever knew you could. 

I thought I knew what it meant to love Chicago — to feel something settle inside of me when I saw her skyline from the expressway, or her lights from the window of an airplane, after crossing the cloud line. I thought I knew what it meant to love her brick and steel towers, her annoying street preachers, her chorus of accents and the poetry of her activists, the grit of her workers, awaiting buses and trains in icy air, her guerrilla gardens, bookshops, bucket boys, and crashing winter waves becoming shelves of ice — so many corners that feel like home, even though you'll never live there. I know this place. I love this place, and I thought I knew how much, until you made me love it more.

When you check your alerts, when you rush to the corner knowing you probably won't get there in time, when you film the abduction you couldn't prevent, or hold onto someone the fascists would rip away — or get ripped away yourself, because you tried — you are reminding us what we owe to each other, and what it means to fight fascism.

And with that, I want to say, thank you, Chicago — and I also want to thank our listeners for joining us this year. And remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I'll see you in the streets.

December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you. So before you navigate away, we ask that you take just a second to support Truthout with a tax-deductible donation.

This year is a little different. We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. 2025 was a year of frightening censorship, news industry corporate consolidation, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board.

We can only resist Trump's agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

We've set an ambitious target for our year-end campaign — a goal of $250,000 to keep up our fight against authoritarianism in 2026. Please take a meaningful action in this fight: make a one-time or monthly donation to Truthout before December 31. If you have the means, please dig deep.

The president was vague regarding how the funds from the Trump Card program would actually be used.

Independent journalism at Truthout faces unprecedented authoritarian censorship. If you value progressive media, please make a year-end donation today.

On Wednesday, through a legally dubious executive order, President Donald Trump launched the “Trump Card,” a means by which wealthy immigrants or their corporate backers can expedite their visa process and gain entry into the United States.

“THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT'S TRUMP GOLD CARD IS HERE TODAY!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Wednesday. “A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING!”

Despite Trump's post, recipients of Trump Cards do not receive a “direct path to citizenship,” but rather secure “a lawful permanent resident status as an EB-1 or EB-2 visa holder.” They can theoretically begin the process of becoming a naturalized citizen after obtaining those statuses.

Two types of Trump “Gold” Cards are listed on an official government website: an individual card and one for corporations to use for their employees. 

The individual Trump Gold Card requires a $15,000 payment to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), plus some extra fees. With an additional $1 million contribution and a fully vetted background check, recipients can expedite their visa process.

The Trump Gold Card for corporations requires the same fees plus a $2 million contribution from a company to sponsor a foreign worker. The “card” allows the company to “transfer” who the card applies to (e.g. other workers) for a 5 percent fee. 

The site also mentions that a Trump “Platinum” Card is coming soon. That card, which will cost $5 million for individuals, will grant the recipient residency, plus 270 days in the U.S. “without being subject to U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income.”

“Once an applicant is approved, a Trump Gold Card will be available for use throughout all 50 states and territories,” the website brags, adding that it will become “evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States.”

Trump first proposed the idea of a Trump Card for expediting the immigration process in February. His initial proposal aimed at providing immigrants a faster pathway toward citizenship, not work visas, and would have cost individuals $5 million, not $1 million. 

Experts say the lower price tag is likely indicative of the administration expecting low demand for the cards. 

Trump issued an executive order in September that officially began the process of making Trump Cards a priority. Per the order, the cards are meant to prioritize the admission of immigrants “who will affirmatively benefit the Nation, including successful entrepreneurs, investors, and businessmen and women.”

Trump has not yet detailed where the funds collected from the cards will go — he has simply stated that they will enter “an account where we can do things positive for the country,” and that the program will generate “many billions of dollars.”

For the program to produce $2 billion, at least 2,000 individuals, or 1,000 workers sponsored by corporations (or a combination of those two numbers) would be required. 

Some legal experts expect challenges to the Trump Card — notably, Trump's executive order may not be based on any applicable law or power the president has been granted.

“Congress writes the rules [on visas]. The president can't just snap his fingers and change the rules,” explained Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, speaking to Forbes in September.

Other critics suggested there could be ways around the process for people with some level of wealth. 

“The Trump admin says anyone who pays $1 million will be deemed to have ‘exceptional business ability' and become eligible for an employment-based immigrant visa. But there's nothing stopping someone from just getting a loan or using parents' money,” wrote Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council.

The Trump Cards are yet another attempt by the president to make it harder for immigrants who are poorer or seeking better opportunities to come to the U.S. Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act, for example, requires asylum seekers, for the first time ever, to pay fees for their applications, placing an additional burden on people who may be fleeing political persecution in their home countries. 

Trump's new visa program also appears to be based on racism and a desire to attract immigrants from countries with whiter populations. 

Notably, in 2018, Trump was reported as describing immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, and African nations as coming from “shithole countries” during a meeting at the White House. At the time, Trump denied making the comment — but he repeated the phrase this week.

“We had a meeting. And I say: Why is it we only take people from shithole countries, right?” Trump told an audience at a rally he held in Pennsylvania this week. “Why can't we have some people from Norway, Sweden — just a few — let us have a few. From Denmark –- do you mind sending us a few people? Send us some nice people, do you mind?”

 What Can Reverse Democratic Decline?

 Steven Levitsky, Lucan A. Way, and Daniel Ziblatt

  Jan/Feb 2026 

When Donald Trump won reelection in November 2024, much of the American establishment responded with a shrug. After all, Trump had been democratically elected, even winning the popular vote. And democracy had survived the chaos of his first term, including the shocking events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Surely, then, it would survive a second Trump presidency.

That was not the case. In Trump's second term, the United States has descended into competitive authoritarianism—a system in which parties compete in elections but incumbents routinely abuse their power to punish critics and tilt the playing field against their opposition. Competitive authoritarian regimes emerged in the early twenty-first century in Hugo Chávez's Venezuela, Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Turkey, Viktor Orban's Hungary, and Narendra Modi's India. Not only did the United States follow a similar path under Trump in 2025, but its authoritarian turn was faster and farther-reaching than those that occurred in the first year of these other regimes.

The game, however, is far from up. The fact that the United States has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism does not mean that its democratic decline has reached a point of no return. Trump's authoritarian offensive is now unmistakable, but it is reversible.

Two things can be true at once. First, Americans face an authoritarian government. In 2025, the United States ceased to be a full democracy in the way that Canada, Germany, or even Argentina are democracies. Second, as the Democratic Party's success in the November 2025 elections shows, multiple channels remain through which opposition forces can contest—and potentially defeat—Trump's increasingly authoritarian government. Indeed, the existence of avenues for contestation is in the very nature of competitive authoritarianism.

Reversing the United States' slide into authoritarianism will require democracy's defenders to recognize the twin dangers of complacency and fatalism. On the one hand, underestimating the threat posed to democracy—believing that the Trump administration's behavior is simply politics as usual—enables authoritarianism by encouraging inaction in the face of systematic abuse of power. On the other hand, overestimating the impact of authoritarianism—believing the country has reached a point of no return—discourages the citizen actions required to defeat autocrats at the ballot box.

A year ago in these pages, two of us (Levitsky and Way) predicted that the United States would descend into competitive authoritarianism during Trump's second term. We anticipated that Trump, like elected autocrats elsewhere, would move quickly to weaponize state institutions and then deploy them in a variety of efforts to weaken or intimidate his political rivals.

Indeed, the Trump administration has done exactly that, going after multiple targets and shielding allies from accountability. To weaponize the state, elected autocrats must purge and then pack it. Following the blueprint created by authoritarian governments in Hungary, Poland, Turkey, and Venezuela, the Trump administration removed professional civil servants from the Justice Department, the FBI, and other key government agencies and put loyalists in charge who were committed to using those agencies to attack opponents. When sitting officials balked at doing what was asked of them, they were summarily removed and replaced with more pliable officials (including, in the Justice Department, personal lawyers of Trump who had little relevant experience).

These newly weaponized public agencies were then quickly deployed against the president's past and present opponents. Under orders from Trump, they launched or have threatened to launch investigations into dozens of public figures he views as political enemies, including Letitia James, the New York state attorney general; Senator Adam Schiff, a California Democrat; Jack Smith, who served as a special prosecutor in the Justice Department during the Biden administration; the philanthropist George Soros; civic watchdog organizations such as Media Matters; and former Trump officials turned critics James Comey, John Bolton, Christopher Krebs, and Miles Taylor.

Most of those singled out have faced petty charges, such as the accusations of mortgage fraud levied against James, Schiff, and the Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook. As every autocrat knows, if determined investigators look long and hard enough, they can invariably find some infraction—a mistake on a tax or mortgage form, a violation of a little-enforced regulation—committed by a person he wants to target. When rules or regulations are enforced selectively, targeting political foes, the law becomes a weapon.



Even if few prosecutions result in convictions or prison time, such investigations are themselves a powerful form of harassment. Targets are forced to spend their savings on lawyers and to devote substantial time and mental energy to their defense. They may be required to take leave of their jobs, and their reputations often suffer.

A weaponized justice system can be used to protect government allies, too. Trump's justice system has shielded government officials and supporters from prosecution. Even as it pursued critics for petty infractions, for example, it halted the prosecution of the “border czar” Tom Homan, whom undercover FBI agents had recorded accepting a $50,000 cash bribe in September 2024, before his appointment. More generally, Trump's unrestrained use of the presidential pardon—above all, his pardoning of nearly all the participants in the January 6 attack on the Capitol, including those convicted of assaulting police officers—sent a clear signal that illegal and violent acts undertaken on his behalf would be tolerated, even protected.

The Trump administration also turned its sights on individuals and groups that finance the opposition and civil society. Trump ordered the Justice Department to investigate ActBlue, a Democratic Party fundraising platform, and the Open Society Foundation, a major funder of civil society organizations; according to an October 2025 report in The Wall Street Journal, the administration plans to direct the Internal Revenue Service to target Democratic Party donors. And like elected autocrats in El Salvador, Hungary, India, Turkey, and Venezuela, Trump has bullied independent media. He has sued The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has opened investigations into a raft of establishment media outlets, including ABC, CBS, PBS, NPR, and Comcast, which owns NBC.

Such actions have been accompanied by a broader attack on civil society. Like competitive authoritarian governments in Hungary, India, Mexico, and Turkey, the Trump administration has attacked institutions of higher learning, launching investigations into dozens of universities, illegally freezing billions of dollars of their congressionally approved research funding, and pressing for the removal of several of their leaders. The administration has also effectively barred the federal government from hiring leading law firms with ties to the Democratic Party, such as Perkins Coie and Paul, Weiss, suspending their employees' security clearances and threatening to cancel their clients' government contracts.



Ominously, the Trump administration has also sought to politicize the armed forces. To prevent the weaponization of the military for partisan ends, the United States and other established democracies have developed professionalized security forces and elaborate laws and regulations to shield them from political influence. Autocrats often seek to break down those institutional barriers and weaponize the security forces. They do so by either creating new security agencies or radically transforming existing ones to evade established legal frameworks and oversight mechanisms. The Trump administration's expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its transformation of the agency into a poorly regulated paramilitary force is a clear example.

At the same time, Trump has crossed redlines with the regular armed forces. In a June 2025 speech at Fort Bragg, he goaded a crowd of army soldiers in uniform to jeer at elected Democratic officials. Moreover, the deployment of the National Guard in U.S. cities (on flimsy pretexts and, in some cases, against the will of elected local and state governments) has raised a serious concern that the administration will intimidate citizens and crack down on peaceful protests. Then, in September 2025, Trump told top U.S. military officials to prepare to deploy in U.S. cities and fight a “war from within” against an “enemy from within.” This is language reminiscent of the military dictatorships that ruled Argentina, Brazil, and Chile in the 1970s.

One form of authoritarian behavior that we did not anticipate a year ago was the Trump administration's routine subversion of the law—and even the U.S. Constitution. Although the Constitution gives Congress, not the executive branch, the authority to appropriate funds and set tariffs, Trump has usurped that authority, freezing or canceling spending appropriated by legislators and dismantling entire agencies established by Congress. He has also repeatedly imposed tariffs without legislative approval, usually by declaring national emergencies that did not exist (neither Canada nor Brazil posed an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to U.S. security). Indeed, most of the administration's signature policy initiatives in 2025, including the establishment of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the imposition of sweeping tariffs, and military assaults off the coast of Venezuela, were all carried out illegally, undermining Congress's authority.

Many Americans still do not view the Trump administration's behavior as a major departure from the practices of previous U.S. administrations. This interpretation is wrong. Modern U.S. history is indeed replete with examples of antidemocratic behavior and blatant violations of rights, including nearly a century of Jim Crow rule in the South, the Red Scare of 1919–20 that led to the arrests of purported radicals without due process, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the McCarthy-era blacklisting of suspected communists in the 1950s, the FBI's surveillance and harassment of civil rights activists in the 1950s and 1960s, and President Richard Nixon's well-documented efforts to spy on and harass his political rivals.

But overtly authoritarian abuse largely disappeared in the United States after the civil rights reforms of the 1950s and 1960s and the post-Watergate reforms of the 1970s. Since 1974, no government, Democratic or Republican, has engaged in anything remotely like the Trump administration's politicized attacks on critics and rivals. None of Trump's three predecessors—George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden—politicized the FBI. All three left existing FBI directors in place until the end of those directors' terms despite their links to partisan rivals. And all three presidents subsequently appointed experienced, professional FBI directors with whom they shared no strong personal or political relationships. Obama, for example, appointed James Comey, a longtime Republican who went on to make a statement about an FBI probe involving the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that may have cost her the election.

Likewise, Trump's predecessors did not seriously politicize the Justice Department. Under Bush, Obama, and Biden, politicians whom the department investigated and prosecuted were widely viewed as having committed serious crimes, and crucially, were both Republicans and Democrats. Bush's Justice Department investigated the Republican representative Mark Foley as well as the Democratic representative Jim Traficant. Under Obama, the department investigated the Democratic representatives Jesse Jackson, Jr., and Anthony Weiner, as well as the Republican representative Michael Grimm. Under Biden, the Justice Department investigated Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, as well as the president's own son, Hunter Biden.

In fact, Bush, Obama, and Biden bent over backward—sometimes at great cost—to avoid the appearance of political interference. Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland, hesitated to prosecute Trump for his attacks on democracy in the weeks following the 2020 election, only doing so after the House committee investigating the January 6 attacks on the Capitol uncovered overwhelming evidence of criminal activity. Rather than risk weaponizing the law, Garland's Justice Department slow walked other criminal cases against Trump as well.

The Bush, Obama, and Biden administrations did not attempt to politicize the military, reorient its mission to target domestic “enemies,” or deploy the National Guard to cities against the will of elected local officials. None of them sued major media outlets, used the FCC to threaten media companies if they did not alter their programming or other content, or attempted illegal extortion against law firms, universities, or other civil society institutions. Finally, Bush, Obama, and Biden never questioned the results of elections, tried to overturn election results, or sought to exert federal control over local and state election processes. In each of these critical areas, the Trump administration stands alone in its authoritarianism.

The Trump administration's authoritarian offensive has transformed American political life, perhaps even more than many of its critics realize. Fearing government retribution, individuals and organizations across the United States have changed their behavior, cooperating with or quietly acquiescing to authoritarian demands that they once would have rejected or spoken out against. As Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, put it, “We are all afraid. . . . We're in a time and place where I have not been. . . . I'm oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice because retaliation is real.”

Fear of retribution has begun to tilt the political playing field. Consider how the U.S. media landscape has changed. Numerous outlets have engaged in political realignment or self-censorship: The Washington Post has altered its editorial line, shifting markedly to the right, and Condé Nast gutted Teen Vogue's influential political reporting. CBS canceled the Trump critic Stephen Colbert's prominent late-night comedy show and imposed tighter controls on its most influential news program, 60 Minutes; its parent company, Paramount, then restructured CBS to bring in a more conservative editorial staff. According to a May 2025 report in The Daily Beast, the CEO of Disney, Bob Iger, and the president of ABC News, Almin Karamehmedovic, told the hosts of the country's leading daytime talk show, The View, to tone down their rhetoric about the president.

What makes self-censorship so insidious is that it is virtually impossible to ascertain its full impact. Although the public can observe firings and the cancellation of programming, it can never know how many editors have softened headlines or opted not to run certain news items, or how many journalists have chosen not to pursue stories out of fear of government retribution.



As in other competitive authoritarian regimes, changes in media coverage have also been driven by government measures to ensure that key media outlets are controlled by supporters. In Hungary, the Orban government took a series of steps to push independent media outlets into the hands of political allies: for example, it leveraged its control over licensing and lucrative government contracts to persuade Magyar Telekom—the parent company of the country's most-read news website, Origo—to fire the site's editor and later put it up for sale. Flush with cash from government-allied banks, a private company with ties to Orban easily outbid competitors and gained control of Origo. Like the more than 500 other Hungarian news outlets now owned by Orban loyalists, Origo ceased critical coverage of the government.

A similar process is underway in the United States as Trump's allies move to take over major news outlets with assistance from the administration. Skydance Media's acquisition of Paramount—greenlighted by an FCC that until recently tended to disapprove of big media mergers—gave the pro-Trump Ellison family control of CBS, which subsequently shifted its programming to the right. The Ellisons have sought to acquire a newly formulated U.S. version of TikTok in addition to Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN. Given that Fox News and X are already owned by wealthy right-wing figures, these moves have the potential to place a considerable share of legacy and social media platforms in the hands of pro-Trump billionaires.

Fear of retaliation has also affected political donors' behavior in ways that could tilt the electoral playing field against the opposition. Faced with a government that has explicitly declared its intent to use the Justice Department, the IRS, and other agencies to investigate people who finance the Democratic Party and other progressive causes, many wealthy donors have retreated to the sidelines. One of the Democrats' largest donors, Reid Hoffman, has scaled back his political contributions as well as his public criticism of Trump since the president began his second term, saying he fears retribution. Other major donors have similarly held back funds from the Democratic Party, helping to generate a marked fundraising advantage for Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.



Business leaders, foundations, and other wealthy donors have quietly distanced themselves from progressive causes they once supported—including civil rights, immigrant rights, and LGBT rights—to stay out of the federal government's cross hairs. According to The New York Times, the Ford Foundation is now scrutinizing grants it has distributed that officials “fear could be criticized” as partisan. The Gates Foundation, meanwhile, has halted grants administered by a major consulting firm with ties to the Democratic Party.

For individual donors, steering clear of certain causes to avoid a costly confrontation with the government is an act of prudence. But such inadvertent collaboration with an authoritarian administration can have a devastating impact on civic and opposition groups as they are simultaneously targeted by the government and shunned by erstwhile supporters.

Fear of direct government retribution has also led major law firms, universities, and other influential institutions to pull back, weakening the United States' civic defenses. Major Washington law firms have hesitated to hire former Biden administration officials and limited or ceased their pro bono work for causes that the Trump administration opposes. According to The Washington Post, plaintiffs in roughly 75 percent of the lawsuits challenging Trump's executive orders during his first term were represented by large top-tier law firms. Only 15 percent of such plaintiffs were represented by top firms in 2025. With the most powerful law firms on the sidelines, opponents of the administration have struggled to find legal representation, turning to smaller firms that lack the personnel and deep pockets to effectively challenge the administration in the courts.

Universities and colleges across the country, for their part, have responded to government threats by dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and restricting students' right to protest. And institutions and organizations have complied with government pressure to crack down on free expression. Dozens of teachers, university professors, and journalists were suspended or dismissed for social media commentary they posted after the right-wing commentator and activist Charlie Kirk was gunned down in September 2025. Although some were punished for expressing approval of Kirk's killing, others—including the Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah—were apparently targeted simply for criticizing his work.

None of these developments, however alarming, should be cause for fatalism or despair. The United States has entered an authoritarian moment. But there are multiple legal and peaceful ways out. Indeed, a defining feature of competitive authoritarianism is the existence of institutional arenas through which the opposition can seriously contest power. The playing field might be uneven, but the game is still played. The opposing team remains on the field, and sometimes it wins.

The most important arena for contestation in competitive authoritarian regimes is elections. Although they may be unfair, elections are not mere window-dressing. Competition is real, and outcomes are uncertain. Take India. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's declaration of an emergency in 1975 brought widespread repression. Within 24 hours, 676 opposition politicians were in jail. Her government imposed strict media censorship and ultimately arrested more than 110,000 critics and civil society activists over the course of 1975 and 1976. When Gandhi called elections in January 1977, many opposition leaders were still in prison. Yet the opposition Janata Party—a hastily formed coalition of Hindu nationalists, liberals, and leftists—managed to win the March vote, remove Gandhi from power, and restore Indian democracy.

In Malaysia, the long-ruling coalition Barisan Nasional controlled virtually all traditional media, maintained a massive advantage in resources (few businesses dared donate to the opposition), and used gerrymandering and manipulation of voter rolls to tilt the electoral playing field. Opposition forces nevertheless managed to win a parliamentary majority in 2018, putting an end to more than half a century of authoritarian rule.

After 2015, Poland descended into competitive authoritarianism as the governing Law and Justice party weaponized the state by packing the courts, the electoral commissions, and publicly owned media with loyalists. Nevertheless, left and center-right opposition parties forged a broad coalition and won back power in the 2023 elections.



The governments of competitive authoritarian regimes often rig elections, but these efforts can backfire. In Serbia, egregious fraud in the 2000 presidential election triggered a massive protest movement that toppled the country's autocratic president, Slobodan Milosevic. In Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in 2004 after Viktor Yanukovych used large-scale ballot stuffing to steal the presidential election. The protests forced a new election, which the opposition won.

The U.S. opposition, moreover, enjoys several advantages over its counterparts in other competitive authoritarian regimes. First, although American institutions have weakened, the United States retains powerful institutional bulwarks against authoritarian consolidation. The judiciary is more independent—and the rule of law generally stronger—than in any other competitive authoritarian regime. Likewise, notwithstanding the Trump administration's efforts to politicize the military, the U.S. armed forces remain highly professionalized and thus difficult to weaponize. Federalism in the United States remains robust and continues to generate and protect alternative centers of authority; ambitious and powerful governors are already pushing back against Trump's efforts. Finally, despite worrisome signs of media self-censorship, the United States retains a more vibrant media landscape than Hungary, Turkey, and other similar regimes do. Even though the Trump administration has tilted the playing field, the persistence of these institutional constraints will likely enable the opposition to continue to contest seriously for power. The Democratic Party's big victories in the 2025 off-year elections showed that U.S. elections remain highly competitive.

The United States also possesses a well-organized and resource-rich civil society. The country's enormous private sector has hundreds of billionaires, millions of millionaires, and dozens of law firms that generate at least $1 billion a year in revenue. The United States is home to more than 1,700 private universities and colleges and a vast infrastructure of churches, labor unions, private foundations, and nonprofit organizations. This endows U.S. citizens with vast financial and organizational resources for pushing back against authoritarian governments. Such countervailing power greatly exceeds anything available to oppositions in Hungary, India, or Turkey, let alone in El Salvador, Venezuela, Russia, and other autocracies.

The U.S. pro-democracy movement also benefits from a strong and unified opposition party. Most oppositions in competitive authoritarian regimes are fragmented and disorganized: in Hungary, for example, the opposition to Orban was split between the weak and discredited Socialist Party and the far-right Jobbik, which allowed Orban's Fidesz party to coast to victories in 2014 and 2018. In Venezuela, the main opposition parties were so discredited and weakened that they could not even field their own presidential candidates when Hugo Chávez ran for reelection in 2000 and 2006. By contrast, the U.S. opposition is united behind the Democratic Party, which—for all its flaws—remains well organized, well financed, and electorally viable.



Finally, Trump's limited popularity may hinder his efforts to entrench authoritarian rule. Elected autocrats are far more successful in consolidating power when they enjoy broad public support: Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, Chávez in Venezuela, Alberto Fujimori in Peru, and Vladimir Putin in Russia all had approval ratings above 80 percent when they imposed authoritarian rule. Trump's approval rating is stuck in the low 40s. Less popular authoritarian leaders, such as Yoon Suk-yeol in South Korea, Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, and Pedro Castillo in Peru, often fail.

It remains unclear how far Trump will go to manipulate future elections. Given that he attempted to overturn the 2020 election and his allies have sought to distort the 2026 midterms by openly pushing for mid-decade gerrymandering in Republican-controlled states, some manipulation seems likely—for example, measures to restrict ballot access, voter intimidation, or a refusal to accept results in some districts. Because the last few U.S. presidential elections have been so close and the margins of control in Congress are so tight, even relatively modest manipulation could be decisive in 2026 or 2028. But that is a risk, not a certainty.

In the United States, then, opposition forces can seriously contest power at the ballot box, in the courts, and on the street. No single arena will suffice. Pro-democratic forces cannot afford to wait for the 2026 and 2028 elections; they cannot simply rely on the courts to defend democracy; and by themselves, No Kings rallies will not restore democracy. Citizens must therefore work through all three channels. Although it is impossible to know how, when, or even if these strategies will succeed, the United States' prospects for returning to democratic rule remain good.

In this context, the gravest danger is not repression but demobilization. Opposition activists who treat a Trump dictatorship as a fait accompli and repression and rigged elections as inevitable risk creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Democratic erosion accelerates when citizens and elites withdraw from contestation—when, out of fear, exhaustion, or sheer resignation, promising candidates decline to run for office, donors pull back, lawyers stop filing lawsuits, and citizens tune out. The outcome of the United States' authoritarian turn depends less on the regime's strength than on the opposition's willingness to continue playing a difficult game.

If the Republican Party were to retain control over all major branches of government after 2026, the prospects for entrenchment would increase. Further purges and weaponization of the bureaucracy, increased politicization of the courts and the military, and tighter control over the media and universities could follow. Such developments would narrow the existing channels for contestation or close some off, making a return to democracy more difficult. But as events in Argentina, Chile, India, and Thailand show, even sharp authoritarian turns are reversible.

The most likely medium-term outcome in the United States is neither entrenched authoritarianism nor a return to stable democracy. Rather, it is regime instability: a protracted struggle between authoritarian impulses and democratic solidarity. In the absence of a radical transformation of the Republican Party, the most optimistic scenario for the coming decade is probably a slide back and forth between dysfunctional democracy and unstable competitive authoritarianism, depending on which party holds national power. In this sense, American politics may come to resemble Ukraine's in the 1990s and early 2000s, which oscillated between democracy and competitive authoritarianism as pro-European or pro-Russian forces variously controlled the executive branch. As with Poland's rounds of voting during the past decade, the next few elections in the United States will not only be contests between competing policies but involve a more fundamental choice between democracy and authoritarianism, as well.

To navigate this moment, Americans must sustain a kind of double vision, recognizing that their country is confronting authoritarianism while not forgetting that avenues for democratic contestation remain open. Losing sight of either truth invites defeat: complacency if the danger is underestimated, fatalism if it is overestimated. The outcome of this struggle remains open. It will turn less on the strength of the authoritarian government than on whether enough citizens act as though their efforts still matter—because, for now, they still do.

EKREM IMAMOGLU is the presidential candidate of Turkey's Republican People's Party. He served as Mayor of Istanbul from 2019 until his arrest on March 19, 2025.

 What a Democratic Restoration Offers the Country's Citizens—and the World

 Ekrem Imamoglu

As the Turkish Republic enters its second century, the world around it has become more complicated and less forgiving than ever before. The order that anchored global politics for decades is giving way to new centers of power, and crises are extending across borders. Populist threats to democracy and energy, climate, migration, and security challenges are intertwining in ways that test the capacity of governments everywhere.

For Turkey, a country that sits on two continents and near several conflicts, meeting the moment requires a steady hand: stability and freedom at home, and clear direction in its dealings abroad. But that is not what the Turkish government is delivering. The institutions that once made Turkey a confident democracy and a trusted partner have been weakened. The justice system no longer acts independently. Bureaucracy has lost its competence and diplomacy its discipline.

I have experienced the attack on Turkish democracy firsthand. Turkish authorities have been trying to build a legal case against me ever since I became mayor of Istanbul in 2019, and finally, in March, they arrested me on bogus charges. Last month, prosecutors produced a 3,379-page indictment seeking to lock me away for good with a sentence of more than 2,000 years. The allegations are being used to portray the elected administration of Istanbul as a criminal organization and its mayor as a gang leader. They rely on deliberate misreading of ordinary municipal work and anonymous witnesses. Confidentiality orders have prevented even my own legal team from scrutinizing the evidence.

This case is not about justice. It is about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's political survival. Having defeated mayoral candidates handpicked by Erdogan several times in Istanbul, I am now my party's candidate to challenge him in the next presidential election, which must take place by 2028 at the latest. The legal challenges I face are the government's attempt to strangle the opposition and engineer a political landscape in which Erdogan faces no competition—not now, and not in the years ahead.

Yet the people of Turkey still believe in the possibility of a capable, honest, and representative government, as they have made clear in peaceful demonstrations in city squares ever since my arrest in March. Thanks to their courage, the path back to democratic rule, competent policymaking, and consistent foreign engagement is not yet closed off.

Foreign policy blunders have limited Turkey's options, forcing the country to react to events around it rather than inspire positive change. A Turkey that is democratic, resilient, and self-confident will not only have a greater ability to mediate, convene, and lead in this critical period of geopolitical disruption. It will also be a constructive, stabilizing force in a world that desperately needs it.

Turkish officials speak often of “strategic autonomy,” of making sure the country can craft an independent foreign policy. But being truly autonomous requires strength—a strength that comes from domestic legitimacy, which in turn is grounded in democracy and the rule of law. A state that silences its citizens cannot speak with authority to the world. A divided society cannot project stability abroad. Turkey must be united at home if it is to withstand external pressure, adapt to change, and still maintain its moral compass. Rather than paying lip service to autonomy, Turkey should strive for strategic resilience: ensuring that the country is strong enough that it can make foreign policy choices freely.

This resilience requires a democracy grounded in fair, efficient institutions, which gives the government the ability to self-correct and navigate challenges. It also requires competent economic policies to encourage investment and innovation and to ensure that the country has sufficient resources to sustain its broader ambitions. And it requires investment in human capital and technological capabilities to prepare Turkey's citizens to participate fully in the global economy. Yet despite Turkey's inherent advantages, under the current government none of these pillars of resilience are as strong as they can and should be.

In the last two decades, Turkey's governance has deteriorated at the country's own expense. Independent courts, protected rights, and a predictable public administration in which key decisions follow rules rather than personal discretion instill confidence in a country's leadership and create favorable conditions for foreign direct investment. In Turkey, arbitrary verdicts, politicized prosecutions, and sudden regulatory shifts have done the opposite, causing many foreign investors to leave, weakening the country's global economic clout.

Restoring Turkey's reliability will require judicial reform, the return of independent and competent regulatory agencies, and effective parliamentary scrutiny of foreign policy, security, and economic decisions. Appointments must follow clear, merit-based procedures, not draw on informal loyalty networks. The judiciary, the central bank, the main government accounting body, the election authority, and regulators who deal with competition, banking, energy, and procurement all need insulation from partisan pressure.



Better stewardship of the economy is also essential. For years, key interest rate, credit, and budget decisions have been made primarily with the next election in mind. The central bank has been pressured to cut rates despite sky-high inflation, to sustain cheap credit booms, and to use its reserves to hold down the exchange rate. Pre-election government spending on public-sector wage hikes, early retirement schemes, and broad subsidies has boosted consumption without building productive capacity. This has fed severe inflation and capital flight as investors lost confidence in the stability and logic of economic policy. The distribution of government loans, meanwhile, has facilitated the growth of political patronage networks. Turkish citizens have benefited unevenly, and many who saw their savings disappear have lost trust in the political and economic system.

My party, the Republican People's Party, aims to reverse this downward slide. Turkey must restore predictable economic governance, protect the central bank's independence, and reward creativity rather than rent-seeking. Growth must be sustainable and equitably shared, driven by investment in green industries, digital innovation, and high-quality jobs. A sovereign technology policy should safeguard data privacy, critical infrastructure, and other national interests, particularly in 5G, artificial intelligence, and energy systems. Turkey must act with foresight, turning its attention now to energy diversification, climate adaptation, and efficient water management—and investing in the education and skills necessary to support the green and digital transitions.

Macroeconomic stability and smart investments will help Turkey make decisions from a position of strength. Today, Turkey is caught in a web of dependencies on Western finance, Russian energy, and Chinese supply chains. Because of these dependencies, Turkey occasionally has been forced to accept costly loans, inflexible long-term energy deals, and opaque investment arrangements that it would resist if it could.

A critical part of extricating Turkey from this web is closer integration with Europe, mainly through a modernized customs union. The current Turkey-EU customs union was established in 1995 and only covers trade in goods. A new agreement must extend to services, public procurement, agriculture, and digital trade, as well as align Turkey with EU standards on data governance and sustainability. This could double Turkey-EU trade over the next decade and will give Turkey more leverage with all its foreign partners. Turkey can then escape the cycle of making ad hoc arrangements out of necessity and deliberately position itself as a global economic hub—connected to many but dependent on none.

Over the past decade, Turkey's foreign policy decision-making has been erratic, reactive, and increasingly personalized. Above all, it has served power consolidation at home, driving a wedge between the national interest and the political interests of the current leadership. Unwise moves have undermined Turkey's credibility with its allies, including the acquisition of the Russian S-400 missile system in 2019; the use of Finland's and Sweden's 2022 NATO bids as an opportunity to make demands; abrupt shifts in policy toward Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, alienating these countries throughout the 2010s only to reverse course and seek rapprochement in the 2020s; and the gradual abandonment of judicial and regulatory reforms linked to the EU accession process. The sidelining of senior career diplomats who had managed the NATO, EU, and U.S. portfolios for decades deprived the diplomatic corps of institutional memory and steady guidance.

This improvisational approach isolated Turkey from EU partners, strained ties with the United States, and generated doubts in NATO about Turkey's long-term reliability. It also narrowed Turkey's room for maneuver. Policy changes became harder to negotiate, the country's influence within multilateral forums declined, and foreign partners insisted on stronger conditions or monitoring before agreeing to cooperation.

Turkey's dual identity—rooted in the institutional West yet attuned to the aspirations of the global South—puts it in a unique position to champion reform in global governance. In a fragmented world, Turkey can bring together partners across the EU, the Gulf, Africa, and Asia to push for reforms in the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and key UN bodies. It can advocate new rules that make trade and taxation fairer and ensure that the benefits of the global economy are shared more equitably. It can also help shape global norms on data protection, algorithmic accountability, and the military use of AI.



While the world's great powers remain gridlocked, middle powers can take the opportunity to advance reformist agendas. Consider migration. According to official figures, Turkey hosts nearly four million refugees, the highest number in the world. For years, policy has focused on containment, keeping refugees inside Turkey in return for financial support from Europe. This has reduced migration-related pressures on EU countries but leaves Turkey managing a long-term social and economic challenge largely alone. Countries must share such a responsibility, not outsource it, as Europe has done. A more collaborative migration policy should include real burden sharing with the EU through resettlement quotas, predictable and equitable financial support, and joint efforts to help refugees access education and employment. A democratic Turkey can not only push for this kind of migration cooperation with Europe but also promote this model elsewhere, drawing on its own unique experience.

In digital technology policy, too, Turkey can make the leap from passive consumer to norm-shaper. Clarifying its domestic policies can make Turkey a more constructive partner to others. It can engage directly with key allies and get more involved in initiatives on AI and data with the EU, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the G-20. True digital power requires reform at home, too. Transparent oversight and predictable privacy rules enforced by independent regulators can make Turkey a trusted base for cloud services and regional tech investment.

Similarly, integrating climate targets into Turkey's trade relationships, energy strategy, and industrial standards can position the country as a regional hub for adaptation finance and clean infrastructure. Turkish public and development banks, in partnership with European and multilateral lenders, can help fund coastal protection, resilient agriculture, and urban infrastructure in neighboring countries, and in doing so establish Istanbul—Turkey's economic capital—as a regional green finance center.

Across all of Turkey's foreign relationships, a key lesson stands out. When Turkey acted ideologically, it lost influence: tying its Middle East policy to support for the Muslim Brotherhood, for example, backfired when regional governments cracked down on the group after the Arab Spring. When it acted rationally and through institutions, it gained influence, as in Ankara's brokering of the 2022 UN-backed grain deal between Russia and Ukraine, and its subsequent management of the deal's implementation, including vessel inspections and coordination of a safe transit corridor in the Black Sea.

Restoring coherence and professionalism to the country's relationship management is therefore essential, as is privileging long-term national interests over short-term ideological concerns. Part of this recalibration involves recognizing that the transatlantic alliance is the backbone of Turkey's deterrence and crisis response. This means making efforts to undo the damage of Turkey's purchase and testing of Russian S-400s. The move was meant to signal the country's strategic autonomy, but it triggered U.S. sanctions, Turkey's removal from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, and a loss of interoperability with key NATO air forces. The S-400s are still causing friction within the alliance. Turkey now needs to work with NATO allies to figure out a long-term solution. More broadly, Turkey must rebuild trust within NATO by being a transparent and constructive ally, active in joint planning and capability development.

With the United States, the Turkish government has been under the illusion that recurrent tensions are over now that President Donald Trump is back in the White House. Yet the personal relationship between Trump and Erdogan is an unequal one, and it does not ensure steady cooperation. To put the relationship on firmer ground, Turkey should pursue regular strategic dialogues and strengthen working-level channels to cooperate with the United States on defense modernization, advanced technologies, counterterrorism, and energy security. A more institutionalized relationship would help protect Turkish and American interests, address areas of concern, and give any administration in Washington, including Trump's, a more dependable partner in Turkey.



With Europe, Turkey must reanchor itself not only in the continent's security structures but also in its legal and economic frameworks. It must prioritize a modernized customs union, simpler and more predictable visa processes for Turkish citizens, active participation in Europe's digital and green agendas, and a return to the Istanbul Convention, the largest pan-European accord on combating domestic violence, which Turkey withdrew from in 2021. Turkey must engage constructively with the EU to resolve long-standing issues in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, including for a just and viable solution in Cyprus, where unilateral actions by both the Greek Cypriot and the past Turkish Cypriot administrations and hard-line rhetoric on the Greek side have frozen talks. Finally, Turkey must resume the process of aligning with European law. A parliamentary body should monitor compliance with the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, whose jurisdiction Turkey has accepted. This body must also oversee legislation that would make Turkish laws compatible with EU laws and standards and meet the benchmarks that are part of the EU accession process. These steps are not concessions to Europe. They are investments in Turkey's own democracy and modernization.

It will remain necessary for Turkey to engage with Russia and China, but these relationships should also be conducted through transparent and institutional channels. The current approach, which relies on leader-to-leader bargaining and informal dealmaking, has produced opaque commitments, made the relationships prone to crisis, and left Turkey vulnerable to pressure. Turkey does need to work with Moscow in Beijing when interests genuinely overlap, such as in energy transit, counterterrorism, tourism, and the expansion of trade corridors across Eurasia, as well as in regional crisis management. But on matters such as the transatlantic alliance, human rights, digital surveillance norms, Turkey's interests diverge from those of Russia and China. Clear compartmentalization can help Turkey avoid being pushed into package arrangements that demand concessions in one area in exchange for cooperation in another.

In the Middle East, the eastern Mediterranean, and the Caucasus, Turkey has too often resorted to confrontation or empty gestures, such as suspending diplomatic contacts, issuing highly charged public statements, and announcing new initiatives but not following through. The way Turkey's influence will grow is instead through sustained dialogue and confidence building. It is crucial to maintain positions consistent with international law to play a constructive role in these regions. The full normalization of relations with Armenia and the opening of the Turkish-Armenian border, for example, would be an important step in this direction.

Turkey has another clear opportunity to model a better approach by defending the right of all Palestinians to a secure and dignified life and using bilateral diplomacy and initiatives at the UN and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to push for humanitarian access and reconstruction in Gaza, the establishment of accountable Palestinian institutions, and a two-state solution in line with UN resolutions. This is both sound statecraft and a moral duty.

I do not underestimate Turkey's challenges, domestic or international, but I reject fatalism. Turkey is resilient. This resilience is on display every day that young people protest peacefully to demand opportunity, and every time that citizens trust the ballot over the baton.

The country's next chapter can be one of renewal. If it can restore its democracy and return competence and consistency to its foreign policy, Turkey can once again become what its geography and history equip it to be: a European power with global reach, an indispensable member of the transatlantic alliance, and a commercial, energy, and diplomatic hub connecting its Western allies with partners across the global South. That is how Turkey becomes a stabilizing force in a fractured world. And it is how Turkey honors its citizens, by ensuring that the credibility it earns abroad rests on the justice upheld at home.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","EPA websites now downplay link between humans and climate change","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/11/climate/epa-climate-change-webpage-changes-oil-gas-coal","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 12:00:59 GMT","


            The Environmental Protection Agency has altered and removed information from its website that connected climate change to the burning of fossil fuels.
    


            The changes come as the Trump administration tries to supercharge US oil and gas production and resurrect the coal industry. Now, the EPA's webpage detailing the ‘causes of climate change' no longer lists human activities such as burning oil, gas and coal — the key drivers of a warming climate since the industrial revolution.
    


            In some cases, the agency has left information that implies the existence of human-caused climate change, while removing direct references to that fact. Other EPA webpages, including one explaining the ‘future of climate change,' still mention the link between humans burning fossil fuels and a changing climate.
    


            The ‘causes of climate change' page, for example, now reads, “Natural processes are always influencing the earth's climate and can explain climate changes prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s,” before listing such issues as changes in Earth's orbit, variations in solar activity and volcanic activity. “However, recent climate changes cannot be explained by natural causes alone.”
    


            Previously, that webpage contained an entire section on the human causes of climate change and cited the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's statement that “It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.” That section is now missing.
    


            Changes to the site were made sometime after early October, according to Internet Archive's webpage archive website Wayback Machine.
    


            In addition, the agency's webpages on ‘climate change indicators' are no longer active. This was a popular resource among educators since they detailed how climate change was affecting the United States. Other federal agencies have also made changes to climate-related websites, such as the discontinuation of climate.gov earlier this year.
    


            The changes have alarmed climate scientists.
    


            “This isn't just about data on a website; it's an attack on independent science and scientific integrity,” Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists said in a statement.
    


            Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, called the changed webpages “misleading,” and took aim at the altered page on the causes of climate change. “This is like a website on causes of chest pain that mentions indigestion but not heart attack: it leads to the wrong treatment,” he said.
    


            Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with UC Agriculture and Natural Resources, also told CNN the bigger problem is not the pages that have disappeared, but the ones like ‘causes of climate change' that have been modified “so that it is no longer accurate.”
    


            “The fact that a government agency would do that on their public facing website and make that choice within the past week or so, according to the timestamps, to change content that was previously correct and make it wrong, according to the overwhelming volume of scientific evidence, is highly concerning,” Swain said.
    


            In a statement, an EPA spokesperson said it is no longer focused on protecting “left-wing political agendas.”
    


            The “agency no longer takes marching orders from the climate cult,” an EPA spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson said the agency is committed to “uphold gold-standard science at the Trump EPA” and “previous iterations of the website that do not meet those standards are archived and available to the public.”
    


            The webpage changes are coming ahead of a widely anticipated EPA rule change that, if successful, would effectively take away the federal government's main way to fight climate change.
    


            The 2009 landmark scientific finding, known as the “endangerment finding,” determined planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels endangers human health. Since the Obama administration, it has served as the basis for federal rules limiting greenhouse gas pollution from power plants, cars and trucks and the oil and gas industry.
    


            The EPA unveiled its proposal to repeal the rule in July and is widely expected to finalize the decision early next year. The agency's proposal also sought to repeal rules that regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, since they stemmed from the finding.
    


            The webpage changes are part of a larger picture of the Trump administration's aggressively pro-fossil fuels stance, said former Biden administration EPA official Joe Goffman.
    


            “No matter how seemingly discreet the actions being taken across the executive branch, it's still the same project,” Goffman said, adding that the EPA has traditionally been a public source of current, user-friendly scientific information on climate change and its link to humans burning fossil fuels.
    


            “They've got to wipe that out, and that's what they've done by changing the website, removing any reference to human activity,” Goffman said.
    


            It's not the first time the Trump administration has downplayed climate change. The Trump administration also removed past National Climate Assessments from government sites.
    


            And last summer, the Energy Department released a report written by a small group of longtime climate contrarians, which minimized humans' role in global warming as well as its severity. Mainstream climate scientists heavily criticized the report for cherry-picking evidence and misinterpreting key climate science findings. The group dissolved after it was sued by environmental organizations. 



            Though the DOE report was first issued in conjunction with the EPA's proposal to repeal the endangerment finding, it may ultimately not be relied on for the final product, Goffman said.
    


            “Their first effort through DOE report was to try to justify why they were doing this, claiming that climate science didn't support the conclusion that human activity was causing climate change,” Goffman said. “But, by issuing that report, I think they actually ended up in a worse position vis a vis the public.”

A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.



            In President Donald Trump's simple and provocative language, Somali immigrants to the US, even US citizens, are “garbage.”
    


            “Send her back!” was the chant from supporters about Rep. Ilhan Omar, the elected member of Congress, at a campaign-style event Tuesday night.
    


            “Throw her the hell out!” Trump said.
    


            Trump also reminded everyone of the episode in his first term when he complained that the US was accepting immigrants from “shithole” countries.
    


            “Why can't we have some people from Norway, Sweden?” Trump asked the Pennsylvania crowd. “Send us some nice people, do you mind? But we always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”
    


            Stephen Miller, the White House aide who seems to hold outsized authority over much of Trump's agenda, in particular on immigration, expanded on these ideas on Fox News in an interview earlier Tuesday.
    


            Both Miller and Trump have seized upon a growing pandemic relief scandal in Minnesota to disparage the entire Somali immigrant community, much of which came to the country legally beginning in the 1990s.
    


            Miller suggested the country was better off with strict quotas that sought to preserve the racial makeup of the country in the 1920s and favored immigrants from Western and Northern Europe over what he called “third world countries.”
    


            That period was, in Miller's view, the “cauldron through which a unified shared national identity was formed.” He drew a line between the great events in that 50-year period of US history and negative migration. Back then, it was Swedish immigrants living in the Minneapolis neighborhood where Somalis have now settled.
    


            The legislation was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson at the Statue of Liberty in 1965, and its goal was to prioritize skills and abilities of legal immigrants. Previous law had demanded that the racial and cultural makeup of the country not be changed as a result of immigration.
    


            “It corrects a cruel and enduring wrong in the conduct of the American nation,” Johnson said at the time.
    


            He argued the system of quotas based on country of origin violated the founding precept of the country:
    


            JOHNSON: Men of needed skill and talent were denied entrance because they came from southern or eastern Europe or from one of the developing continents. This system violated the basic principle of American democracy — the principle that values and rewards each man on the basis of his merit as a man. It has been un-American in the highest sense, because it has been untrue to the faith that brought thousands to these shores even before we were a country.



Immigration surged, primarily from Latin America and Asia, while European immigration fell.
    


            The historian Mark Updegrove, who is CEO of the LBJ Presidential Library, puts the immigration law alongside the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act as key pieces of Civil Rights legislation that changed the country.
    


            “What LBJ said is that we shouldn't be asking people where they're from; we should be asking people what can you do for our country,” he said. “It opened up opportunities for people who, to that point, had been banned from coming to the United States simply by virtue of their ethnicity or country of origin, which is ridiculous.”
    


            The law also represented one of the few times Congress has been able to come together to address immigration in a comprehensive way.
    


            Miller's complaint, expressed on Fox News, is that the 1965 law attracted more people from “third world” countries who he argued have failed to assimilate in the US.
    


            “What you saw between 1965 and today was the single largest experiment on a society, on a civilization, that had ever been conducted in human history,” Miller argued.
    


            In his view, immigrant groups like Somali-Americans, who sought refuge in Minnesota starting in the 1990s, failed as Americans. And he said their natural born citizen children have also failed. On natural born citizenship, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to ignore the plain language of what's in the Constitution.
    


            “With a lot of these immigrant groups, not only is the first generation unsuccessful — again, Somalia is a clear example … but you see very persistent issues in every subsequent generation. You see consistent high rates of welfare use, high rates of criminal activity, consistent failures to assimilate.”
    


CNN's recent reporting, on the other hand, suggests Minnesota is still welcoming to the Somali immigrants, most of them now citizens having natural born citizen children.
    


            That's not what Miller sees, for either Somalis or other immigrant groups. Think back to when Trump falsely accused Haitian immigrants legally in the US of eating dogs in Ohio. Borrowing, at least in spirit, from the objectively racist concept of replacement theory, Miller said immigrants from “third world” countries are going to bring the US down.
    


            “It's just common sense. If Somalians cannot make Somalia successful, why would that we think that the track record would be any different in the United States?” he said, pointing also to immigrants from other African countries.
    


            “If these societies all over the world continue to fail, you have to ask yourself, if you bring those societies into our country, what do you think will happen? You will replicate the conditions they left,” he said.
    


            Miller, becoming animated, pointed to education, health care, public safety and deficit spending, which is just about the waterfront of societal issues.
    


            MILLER: If you subtract immigration out of test scores, all of a sudden our test scores skyrocket! If you subtract immigration out of health care, all of a sudden we don't have near to the size of the health care challenges our country faces. If you subtract immigration out of public safety, all of a sudden we don't have violent crime in so many of our cities. Issue after issue we talk about these things as they things just happen to us. The schools just suddenly fail. Violent crime just suddenly explodes. The deficit just suddenly skyrockets. These are a result of social policy choices that we made through immigration.



            I put Miller's comments to David Bier, a critic of the Trump administration's immigration policy at the libertarian-leaning CATO institute. Bier disagreed, to put it mildly.
    


            “His views are baseless smears based on bias, not serious analysis,” he told me by email, adding a point-by-point deconstruction of what Miller said.
    


            BIER: Immigrants to the United States today are assimilating faster than prior generations. They are more likely to know English, more likely to have graduated college, are more economically productive, and more beneficial to government budgets than in the early 20th century. They have more experience with democracy than past waves of immigration, and they are more patriotic and more supportive of US institutions than the US-born. By the time they naturalize they have adopted almost the same political views, except for immigration policy. They are less likely to commit crimes and be incarcerated than those in the early 20th century. Immigrants today cost less to the health care system than the US-born. They are less likely to commit and be incarcerated for crimes than the US-born. Immigrants increase the returns to education for the US-born, leading more US-born to graduate. They make the US-born more productive, increasing their wages and living standards. 



            Regardless of whether his views are based in fact, Miller's outlook is consistently repeated in Trump's policies, which frequently conflate legal and undocumented immigrants from countries like Somalia.
    


            Republicans cited unverified allegations of widespread fraud to cut future Medicaid and food assistance spending. Trump's Secretary of Homeland Security has indicated she will expand a travel ban from 19 countries to include “every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”
    


            The larger issue of immigration, including legal immigration, is also behind a more existential policy shift the US announced this week in a new National Security Strategy.



            The document announces a new “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine that will see the US act against Western Hemisphere countries to make sure they are able to prevent mass migration to the US.
    


            The document also seems to refer to migrant communities like Somalis in the US when it states that US sovereignty has been eroded by “the cynical manipulation of our immigration system to build up voting blocs loyal to foreign interests within our country.”
    


            The US warns in the National Security Strategy that Europe — ancestral home of the immigrants that Trump prefers — is threatened by “civilizational erasure,” an unsubtle reference to immigration to Europe.
    


            “Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less,” the document states, arguing such transformation could call into question whether European countries will remain as US allies.

    Japan's deadliest surge in bear attacks is gripping the nation. Upgrade to watch the full report.



            Haruo Ikegami starts each day at dawn.
    


            Just as sunlight interrupts the darkness over his small Hokkaido city, the 76-year-old pulls on his rain boots and dons a bright orange jacket. This is his uniform, he tells me.
    


            After grabbing his walkie talkies, he trudges across his frosted garden and climbs into a green van, adorned with stickers reading “on bear patrol.” His vehicle is instantly recognizable here. Along the drive, neighbors call out, asking about recent sightings.
    


            Ikegami is somewhat of a local hero in this rural community. Over his 40-year career, he's culled dozens of bears and sees his work as a crucial line of defense between the town and the increasingly unpredictable wilderness.
    


            “Without me,” he said, “who else would save this town?”
    


            The metal cages he's set up are scattered across Sunagawa city, each baited with slabs of deer meat and positioned where bears have been spotted this year. The day we accompany him, his traps are empty. But he warns that the bears are never far, increasingly pushing into human territory and frightening those who live here.
    


            “People are dead. This is a murder case,” the hunter told CNN.
    


            This year, at least 13 people have been killed and more than 200 wounded injured in bear encounters. Videos of bears rummaging through supermarket aisles, roaming school grounds and plucking persimmons from suburban backyards have gone viral on Japanese social media. Some schools have also closed temporarily, while residents in parts of northern Japan avoid going out after dark.
    


            The crisis has sparked national alarm. Japan's defense minister has deployed the Self-Defense Forces to hard-hit regions, and lawmakers are scrambling to find long-term solutions. The US and UK embassies have also issued advisories to travelers in rural areas.
    


            But for hunters, the crisis feels both frightening – and predictable.
    


            “There are just too many bears now, it's an emergency situation,” Ikegami said.
    


            Japan's bear population has skyrocketed, while the number of licensed hunters has plummeted.
    


            With more than a third of Japan's population now over 65, rural towns are shrinking. Few young residents remain, and even fewer are willing to take up hunting, Ikegami said, a dangerous job with low pay and little appeal compared to urban life in places like Tokyo.
    


            “If the government had taken this seriously earlier, it wouldn't have gotten this bad,” Atsushi Kanno, a 37-year-old bear hunter, told CNN. “It's nonsense that they're responding now, only after things have escalated.”
    


            There are several factors driving the surge in encounters.
    


            One is simply numbers. The population of the Hokkaido brown bear, one of two bear species in Japan, has more than doubled in the last 30 years, with nearly 12,000 of the animals now roaming the country's northernmost prefecture. The stocky cousins of the grizzly can stand nearly seven feet tall and are found only in Hokkaido.
    


            The other species, the Asiatic black bear, is smaller, reaching about five-and-a-half feet. But it's responsible for fatal attacks as well, particularly in northern prefectures such as Akita and Iwate.
    


            Experts say climate change is another factor. Poor harvests of nuts and fruit are pushing bears to seek food elsewhere.
    


            “When it's scarce, bears must find food. I believe bears are taking a step closer to human settlements,” Hiroo Tamatani, a bear conservationist, told CNN.
    


            Japan's demographic shifts also compound the problem. Rural towns and farmland once formed a natural buffer between deep forest and populated centers. But as those areas empty out, bears are moving in, taking advantage of the new real estate.
    


            Culling is currently Japan's primary response for bears that attack people or encroach on residential areas.
    


            The government has amended laws to allow riot police to use firearms more easily. But the Self-Defense Forces remain legally prohibited from using weapons unless national defense is at stake, leaving hunters like Ikegami on the frontlines.
    


            He trains young hunters, but few have the skill or confidence to take down animals that can weigh several hundred pounds. At the same time, he regularly receives angry phone calls urging him not to kill bears.
    


            “As long as we live here, we simply can't coexist,” he said.
    


            “Our lives are precious to us. No person would say a bear's life is more important than their own,” Ikegami added.
    


            Bear hunter Katsuo Harada shares that view. While the 84-year-old still goes out to hunt, his two apprentices largely take the helm in helping reinforce the boundary between the forest and residential areas.
    


            Harada also knows first-hand how powerful these bears can be. He was nearly killed by a bear more than 20 years ago while hunting deer.
    


            “I fired two shots, but the bear didn't stop. It got on top of me, pulled by gun out of my hands and bit by head,” he told CNN.
    


            “My eye and ear were hanging off,” he said.
    


            In the chaos, he shoved his fist down the bear's throat, cutting off its airway just long enough for the bullets to take effect. Harada says he remembers little after that, as he was fading in and out of consciousness. But he recalls reaching for his walkie-talkie and calling his friends, who were on the hunt with him, to get help.
    


            He keeps the bear's skull as a reminder of how quickly the roles can reverse—from hunter to hunted.
    


            Public opinion largely supports culling. Many in Japan now fear hiking or traveling to prefectures with recent attacks, and a growing number prefer visiting “no-bear prefectures,” areas with no known bear populations.
    


            But conservationists warn against blanket killing.
    


            “Rather than killing them all, we should identify the ones that cause problems and deal with those respectively,” Tamatani said.
    


            He works at a nonprofit called Picchio, which uses dogs to deter bears, and tags bears to track their movements. Tamatani also advocates planting bear food trees away from residential zones, so they have access to natural resources further from towns.
    


            While repeat offenders may still be culled, he argues that these measures reduce unnecessary deaths.
    


            “Bears are not monsters. They're animals that live just like us.”
    


            Japan continues searching for solutions that protect human life while allowing wildlife to survive.
    


            “Humans and animals have lived side by side for a long time. Sometimes we harmed each other, but we still must respect and acknowledge one another,” Tougen Yoshihara, a Buddhist monk who was attacked by a bear in May, told CNN.
    


            Yoshihara survived only because his dog, Chico, barked and chased the bear away, he said. He escaped with minor injuries, but the experience has haunted him—he now carries a carving knife when walking in the woods.
    


            For now, Japan stands at a crossroads. The country is pulled between fear and the desire to coexist with the bears, an important part of Japan's ecosystem.
    


            But until a lasting solution emerges, more lives, human and animal alike, will likely pay the price.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Pentagon did not conduct routine investigation on whether Hegseth damaged national security by sharing strike plans on Signal","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/11/politics/pentagon-did-not-conduct-hegseth-signal-investigation","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 09:00:58 GMT","


            The Pentagon did not conduct a routine investigation into the impact of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's disclosure of sensitive military information in a group chat on Signal earlier this year and whether it damaged national security – in part because Hegseth never authorized it, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.
    


            A classification review and damage assessment would typically be initiated following any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive defense information, in part, to examine whether sources and methods or ongoing US military and intelligence operations have been compromised in a way that would require mitigation.
    


            Hegseth did not order an assessment, two former senior officials who were working at the Pentagon at the time and a current US official with knowledge of the situation said.
    


            After the Signal messages came to light, Hegseth, instead turned his attention inward and focused on formally investigating suspected leakers on his own staff, even threatening to polygraph defense officials he believed were disclosing potentially embarrassing details about him, multiple current and former officials said. Those threats had a “chilling effect” among DoD officials who became increasingly wary of doing anything that could be perceived by Hegseth as an attempt to undercut him, according to those officials.
    


            The news that the Pentagon did not carry out a damage assessment or conduct an internal classification review comes days after an internal watchdog report was released that concluded Hegseth risked endangering American troops by sharing highly sensitive attack plans targeting Houthi rebels in Yemen. The sources said they'd have expected a damage assessment to be carried out separately to establish the practical implications of the Signal disclosure, in part, because the Inspector General probe had a limited scope.
    


            “100% a breach like that would warrant a top-to bottom damage assessment by both DoD and the IC,” one of the sources, the former senior defense official told CNN, referring to Hegseth's role in Signalgate.
    


            The Pentagon also has no plans to investigate the incident further — even after the IG concluded Hegseth actions violated DoD regulations and risked compromising sensitive military plans, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            Hegseth has mischaracterized the report's findings, claiming “total exoneration” and “no classified information” even though the watchdog declined to weigh in on his classification authority or whether a compromise occurred – acknowledging its investigation was limited in scope, in part, because the secretary refused to cooperate.
    


            “A damage assessment is forward-looking and focused on risk rather than personal culpability. Even without the official's cooperation, analysts can evaluate what material was shared, who had access to it, and any potential operational or counterintelligence implications. In that sense, a damage assessment would not have been constrained by the same limitations that hampered the IG investigation,” according to Brianna Rosen, a former White House official specializing in national security and tech policy.
    


            A senior pentagon official told CNN that the department waits for the IG report before making the determination about a damage assessment – and since the IG report found no classified info was shared, there was no need for a damage assessment.
    


            But that is not consistent with how other current and former officials explained the process.
    


            Inspectors general would not typically be responsible for determining whether a compromise of classified material occurred, according to Irvin McCullough, director of national security at the Government Accountability Project, who noted that is usually done by the department's security officers through a damage assessment.
    


            “I'd 100 percent expect a damage assessment,” McCullough told CNN. “If they did not do a damage assessment, I'd imagine it's because the Original Classification Authority/originator determined there was no compromise,” he said.
    


            In this case, the IG report suggests that decision would have likely been made by Hegseth.
    


            For Hegseth's use of Signal, a damage assessment would have examined how the information was transmitted, why it was classified at that level and assessed the risk from intelligence to what damage it could cause, the US official added.
    


            The Pentagon's Joint Staff and US Central Command, which carried out the strikes in Yemen, did not require Hegseth's explicit sign-off to open an investigation, but the secretary would have been notified if they had and could have stopped it, the former senior official and the current US official also told CNN.
    


            US intelligence agencies and the FBI similarly did not examine the broader national security implications of Hegseth using a commercial messaging app – on his personal phone – to send closely-guarded operational details about an imminent strike in Yemen despite concerns being raised that information could have jeopardized the safety of US troops and mission objectives, the sources said.
    


            No such assessment took place after revelations that Hegseth used Signal, via his personal phone, to send detailed attack plans to other Trump officials and a reporter, despite US officials raising immediate concerns about the information's sensitivity and his use of unsecure, non-government devices to share it, the sources said.
    


            Multiple current and former US officials told CNN that was unusual, particularly since the Pentagon inspector general determined the information Hegseth shared was from a document marked classified at the time and spoke to witnesses who said the secretary's use of Signal went well beyond the one group chat in question.
    


            “Based on our review, we concluded that some information the Secretary sent from his personal cell phone on Signal on March 15, 2025, matched the operational information USCENTCOM sent and classified as SECRET//NOFORN,” the unclassified IG report states.
    


            Former prosecutors who specialized in national security cases also told CNN that under previous administrations, investigators would have likely scrutinized whether Hegseth had used Signal for other sensitive discussions beyond the chat on Yemen strike plans.
    


            A third former senior defense official noted, however, that the decision to conduct a damage assessment is not automatic and not uniform across cases – meaning there is not a single uniform template that must be followed in every circumstance.
    


            “The decision to launch a damage assessment usually hinges on three factors: the extent of classified information that left controlled channels, the intelligence value that exposure might offer an adversary, and whether the incident reveals broader systemic vulnerabilities. When any of those elements are present, agencies generally err on the side of initiating an assessment because it guides mitigation responses and helps prevent future breaches,” Rosen told CNN.
    


            US intelligence agencies and the FBI were never contacted by the Pentagon to help assess the potential damage caused by Hegseth's disclosure, another source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            US intelligence agencies considered it the Defense Department's responsibility to initiate a damage assessment because the Pentagon was in charge of the operation in question and details shared by Hegseth seemed to come from classified military channels. They also believed no classified information of their own was disclosed in the Signal messages revealed by the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg.
    


            As a result, the intelligence community waited for a request to support the Pentagon's review, but it never came, puzzling some officials who immediately identified that the details shared by Hegseth likely originated from classified material.
    


            The IG report acknowledged Hegseth, as defense secretary, has broad authority to declassify information but also notes investigators were unable to find any documentation showing he properly did so in this case.
    


            To properly declassify the material, Hegseth would have had to issue a formal written order notifying several top Pentagon officials of his decision at the time he claims to have made it, including the DoD general counsel, undersecretary for intelligence and CENTCOM.
    


            Unlike the IG, Pentagon officials conducting a damage assessment, if one had been done, would have been able to examine whether Hegseth followed that process without relying solely on his cooperation, multiple current and former officials said.
    


            In some cases, like the investigation into former national security adviser John Bolton's handling of classified information following the publication of his book about his time working for Trump in 2020, damage assessments have uncovered evidence that led to a criminal prosecution.
    


            Investigators within Hegseth's own Defense Department have worked with the Department of Justice to prosecute other disclosures of sensitive military information.
    


            Last week, the DoD and Justice Department announced that a US Air Force colonel pleaded guilty to texting classified plans about an upcoming military operation to a woman who was not authorized to receive it.
    


            Those details included the operation's timing, targets, methods and objectives – similar to what Hegseth shared in at least two group chats, including one with his wife, brother and personal lawyer.
    


            In the announcement, officials said the colonel admitted he knew his personal devises were not authorized to handle classified information and that the woman was not cleared to receive it.
    


            The Air Force colonel now faces up to 10 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to one count of unauthorized communication of national defense information.

A federal judge in Maryland ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia freed from immigration detention on Thursday while his legal challenge against his deportation moves forward, handing a major victory to the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement. 

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must let Abrego Garcia go immediately. 

“Since Abrego Garcia's return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,” the judge wrote. “For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia's Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.” 

The Department of Homeland Security was highly critical of the release order and vowed to oppose it, calling it “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed by President Barack Obama, a Democrat. “This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department's assistant secretary.

Messages seeking comment were left with Abrego Garcia's attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg. The Department of Justice declined to comment on the order. 

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge in 2019 ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. under a court order. Since he cannot be deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His lawsuit in federal court claims Trump's Republican administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish Abrego Garcia over the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation to El Salvador.




In her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The reference was made to the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia to and submitted affirmations that Costa Rica had rescinded its offer to accept him — later determined to be untrue.

“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote. 

Xinis also dismissed the federal government's arguments that the court did not have jurisdiction to rule on a final order of removal, noting that order had not been filed.

“Thus, Abrego Garcia's request for immediate release cannot touch upon the execution of a removal order if no such order exists,” she wrote.

Meanwhile, in a separate action in immigration court, Abrego Garcia is petitioning to reopen his immigration case to seek asylum in the United States. 

Additionally, Abrego Garcia is facing criminal charges in federal court in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has filed a motion to dismiss the charges, claiming the prosecution is vindictive. 

His defense attorney in the Tennessee case, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.

A judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing to be held on the motion after previously finding some evidence that the prosecution against Abrego Garcia “may be vindictive.” The judge said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern.”

The judge specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case. ___

Senators clashed Thursday over President Donald Trump's use of the National Guard in American cities, with Republicans defending the deployments as necessary to fight lawlessness and Democrats calling it an extraordinary abuse of military power that violates states' rights.

The questioning of military officials before the Senate Armed Services Committee was the highest level of scrutiny, outside a courtroom, of Trump's use of the National Guard in U.S. cities since the deployments began.

Meanwhile, in a separate hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was accused by House Democrats of habitually lying about the Trump administration's immigration enforcement. The hearings came a day after the president faced another legal setback over efforts to send troops into U.S. cities against the objections of state and local officials.

Other news we're following: 








Delia Ramirez, a Democrat from Illinois, accused Noem's department of waging an “unaccountable, unlawful, unconstitutional” war against communities across the country.

Ramirez showed a number of videos of Noem talking and then repeatedly accused her of lying.

“Secretary Noem, you lie and you lie to the American people,” Ramirez said.

In one video, Noem said the agency focused on people in the country illegally, not American citizens while in another Noem said they were focusing on the “worst of the worst.”

Ramirez disputed those characterizations and said Noem lied with “impunity.”

The Senate has rejected a Republican bill to replace expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies with new health savings accounts. The legislation was a Republican alternative to Democratic legislation to extend the subsidies for three years.

Senators are now voting on the Democratic bill and are expected to reject it — meaning that the subsidies are likely to expire.

Noem defended the cancelation of billions of dollars in mitigation grants administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, saying the grants had been “weaponized to fund the Green New Deal and for climate change.”

The Trump administration in April canceled $3.6 billion in grants under the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, created under the first Trump administration to help communities harden infrastructure to mitigate damage from climate disasters. 

Noem said FEMA is “deploying resources two times faster on average, than in history,” though a policy that she personally approve DHS expenditures of $100,000 or more has been widely criticized for slowing deployment of FEMA services and dollars.

Secretary Noem has left the hearing early.

Noem said she had to go to another meeting of a council that is offering suggestions on how to reform the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

As she walked out, Julie Johnson, a Democrat from Texas who was slated to question the secretary next, joked: “I'm just going to take the position that she was scared of my questions.”

As Noem walked out of the room, protesters trailed her down the hallway yelling “Shame on you!”

But Trump administration officials declined to make commitments on what authorities the president may use in the future to send National Guard troops from one state to another.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, used the closing moments of the hearing to press the officials on whether National Guard troops will be deployed from other states beyond their current authority to protect federal facilities and officials, such as to conduct law enforcement activity. 

Federal judges have blocked or limited troop deployments in Oregon, Illinois and California as the Trump administration has attempted to use troops to assist in its mass deportation goals.

Mark Ditlevson, a Trump administration official who oversees homeland defense, only said that any orders would be evaluated to make sure they are “100% legal.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed solidarity with Maduro and told him “direct communication channels” between the countries “remain permanently open,” a Venezuelan government statement said.

Talking a day after the U.S. military seized an oil tanker off the Venezuela's coast, Putin told Maduro that “Russia will continue to support Venezuela in its struggle to assert its sovereignty, international law, and peace throughout Latin America, making its diplomatic capabilities available to strengthen cooperation in these essential areas,” the Venezuelan government said.

The Kremlin said both leaders also discussed developing friendly bilateral ties and their commitment to joint projects in trade, economic, energy, financial, cultural, humanitarian, and other areas.

The Senate is voting on Republican legislation that would create new health savings accounts as health care subsidies for millions of Americans are set to expire Jan. 1.

The Senate is expected to reject the legislation, along with a second Democratic bill that would extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. 

Republicans say the savings accounts would replace the subsidies by giving money directly to consumers, instead of to insurance companies. Democrats say the GOP plan would lead to higher costs for consumers. 

Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned that premiums will skyrocket unless Congress passes an extension of the subsidies. “If Republicans don't climb aboard, there won't be another chance to act,” Schumer said ahead of the votes.

Noem linked the seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast to the Trump administration's efforts to push back on “a regime that is systematically ... flooding our country with deadly drugs.” She said Trump administration officials had seized “enough lethal doses of cocaine to kill 177 million Americans.”

On Wednesday, Trump said the United States had seized the tanker as tensions mount with the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. 

Trump has broadly justified a regional military buildup and a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean as necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S.

House Democratic identified members of the audience they said had family members who had been improperly treated by the immigration system.

Noem said she would review the cases of several called out by Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island. One, a combat veteran, appeared on a screen via a video call. Magaziner said the Purple Heart recipient had been deported earlier this year.

“You don't seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys,” Magaziner said to Noem.

Trump's zero-tolerance immigration policy split more than 5,000 children from their families at the Mexico border during his first term, when images of babies and toddlers taken from the arms of mothers sparked global condemnation. Seven years later, families are being separated but in a much different way. 

With illegal border crossings at their lowest levels in seven decades, a push for mass deportations is dividing families of mixed legal status inside the U.S. Federal officials and their local law enforcement partners are detaining tens of thousands of asylum-seekers and migrants. Detainees are moved repeatedly, then deported, or held in poor conditions for weeks or months before asking to go home.

The federal government was holding an average of more than 66,000 people in November, the highest on record.

Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said Thursday that “decisive” actions by the United States, including the seizure of an oil tanker, have left the repressive government of President Nicolás Maduro at its weakest point, and she vowed to return to the country to keep fighting for democracy.

Machado's statements to reporters came hours after she appeared in public for the first time in 11 months, following her arrival in Norway's capital, Oslo, where her daughter received the Nobel Peace Prize award on her behalf on Wednesday.

Trump's actions “have been decisive to reach where we are now, where the regime is significantly weaker,” she said. “Because before, the regime thought it had impunity …. Now they start to understand that this is serious, and that the world is watching.”

Machado sidestepped questions on whether a U.S. military intervention is necessary to remove Maduro from power

Thompson repeatedly asked Michael Glasheen, operations director of the national security branch of the FBI, about how the Trump administration came to classify the decentralized antifa movement as a domestic terrorist organization. He asked for details on where the group is headquartered, and how many people are involved.

Trump announced he had made that designation earlier this year, in a crackdown on leftists after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Glasheen said officials were “building out the infrastructure” to investigate the group but offered no details as Thompson doubled down.

Mike Lindell, the fervent supporter of President Donald Trump known to TV viewers as the “MyPillow Guy,” officially entered the race for Minnesota governor Thursday in hopes of winning the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic Gov. Tim Walz.

“I'll leave no town unturned in Minnesota,” Lindell told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of a news conference set for Thursday.

He said he has a record of solving problems and personal experiences that will help businesses and fight addiction and homelessness as well as fraud in government programs.

The hearing quickly became heated over the tragic shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C.

Thompson had begun questioning Noem over what he called the “unfortunate accident” when the secretary interrupted the ranking Democrat.

“Unfortunate accident?” Noem retorted. She called it a “terrorist attack.”

The interaction devolved from there as Thompson questioned her department's approval of asylum claim that allowed the suspect to stay in the U.S.

Noem insisted it was the Biden administration's vetting process that failed to properly screen the man who had worked alongside the U.S. military in Afghanistan.

Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee zeroed in Thursday on Trump's statements that an “invasion within” or an “enemy within” justifies his guard deployments.

Gen. Gregory Guillot, who leads the military's Northern Command, said “I do not have any indications of an enemy within.” 

Charles Young, principal deputy general counsel for the Defense Department, said the Supreme Court has ruled that the president has the exclusive authority to decide whether an emergency exists.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL officer, argued during a Senate hearing that transnational crimes present enough of a risk to national security to justify military action, including on U.S. soil.

Sheehy claimed that there are foreign powers “actively attacking this country, using illegal immigration, using transnational crime, using drugs to do so.”

Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot agreed with Sheehy's assessment.

An attorney for the Pentagon declined to offer a clear answer when asked if a president could lawfully order the military to shoot protesters.

During a hearing Thursday on National Guard deployments in U.S. cities, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, noted that former Defense Secretary Mark Esper alleged that Trump inquired about shooting protesters during the George Floyd demonstrations.

Hirono asked Charles L. Young III, principal deputy general counsel at the defense department, whether a presidential order to shoot protesters would be lawful.

Young said he was unaware of Trump's comments and responded that the answer “would depend on the circumstances.”

“We have a president who doesn't think the rule of law applies to him,” Hirono said in response.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must release Abrego Garcia from custody immediately.

“Since Abrego Garcia's return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,” the judge wrote. “For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia's Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.” 

The Salvadoran national has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge in 2019 ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose Trump's immigration crackdown.

Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, raised concerns that National Guard troops deployed to U.S. cities don't receive training on how to handle situations where someone is having a mental health episode, saying that many police officers frequently encounter such situations and receive extensive training on how to handle them.

Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the commander of U.S. troops in North America, said that National Guard troops are trained to de-escalate tense interactions with people, but don't receive any specific training on mental health episodes.

The secretary also levied broad criticism of the program that brought the man to the United States years before he allegedly shot two National Guard members.

Operation Allies Welcome was created by the Biden administration to safe Afghan supporters from Taliban retribution after the U.S. military pullout from Afghanistan following 20 years of American intervention and billions of dollars of aid.

Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, was killed in the Washington shooting. Noem said Thursday that U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, has been showing improvement.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who was also shot during the confrontation, has been charged with murder. He pleaded not guilty.

The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed, questioned Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the commander of U.S. troops in North America, on how he evaluates the lawfulness of orders.

Guillot said that he consults with military attorneys, raises any questions with the defense secretary and commanding military officers, and executes the order once he's confident in its lawfulness.

This has become a pressing question under the Trump administration amid National Guard deployments to U.S. cities and a campaign to strike boats allegedly carrying drugs near Venezuela. The president has targeted Democratic lawmakers who released a video urging military and intelligence officers to refuse illegal orders.

“End deportations!” shouts one. “Stop ICE raids!” yells another.

The two people were escorted by Capitol Police out of the Homeland Security Committee hearing room.

Chairman Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., gaveled the panel back to order as Noem resumed her opening remarks.

Rep. Bennie Thompson, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, told the secretary she has diverted vast resources to carry out Trump's “extreme” immigration agenda, and failed to provide basic responses to oversight questions from Congress.

“I call on you to resign,” the Mississippi congressman said. “Do a real service to the country.”

Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi said in an opening statement that FBI Director Kash Patel should also be appearing at the hearing alongside Noem, saying he “can't help but notice” Patel's absence.

Patel appeared to be out of the country on official FBI business. Late Wednesday on X, Patel posted that he was in Brussels for a “great” meeting with Matt Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO.

Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the commander of U.S. troops in North America, told senators that National Guard troops are instructed not to perform many law enforcement activities like making arrests or searching for evidence of a crime. However, the troops are allowed to detain people if they deem the person to be putting others at risk.

Guillot said that one person was detained as part of Trump's campaign to deploy National Guard troops to U.S. cities. The person was detained in June outside a federal facility in Los Angeles.

“Stop terrorizing our communities,” one person shouted as the secretary entered.

Noem greeted some others in the audience.

One protester was singing the song from Star Wars that had been used to follow law enforcement officers as the agency conducts mass immigration raids and patrols city streets.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to face fierce questioning from Democrats Thursday as the public face of the Republican administration's hard-line approach to immigration.

Since Noem last appeared in Congress in May, immigration enforcement operations in U.S. cities have become increasingly contentious, with federal agents and activists frequently clashing over her department's tactics.

Noem is testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,” which in years past have focused on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. Thursday's appearance is likely to focus heavily on immigration.

This hearing is the highest level of scrutiny to Trump's use of the National Guard outside of a courtroom since the deployments began and comes a day after the president faced another legal setback over his muscular use of troops in larger federal operations. Trump has justified the use of the military in American cities by saying the National Guard is needed to support federal law enforcement, protect federal facilities and combat crime.

The hearing comes two weeks after two West Virginia National Guard members deployed to Washington were shot just blocks from the White House in what the city's mayor described as a targeted attack. Spc. Sarah Beckstrom died a day after the Nov. 26 shooting, and her funeral took place Tuesday. Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe is still hospitalized in Washington.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said Trump's deployment of the National Guard into American cities is “deeply unpopular.” 

“Most Americans don't want this,” she said at a the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, adding that most of the guard members don't want these assignments, either.

“Our heroes did not sign up for this,” said Duckworth, a combat veteran who served in the Illinois National Guard.

She noted that she had threatened to hold up the annual defense bill if Republican leadership continued to block the hearing, which she said is long overdue. She said she has questions for the military about how Trump's deployments are affecting readiness, training and costs.

The Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee is opening a hearing on Trump's National Guard troop deployment to U.S. cities by asserting that crime is on the rise. 

“In recent years, violent crime, rioting, drug trafficking and heinous gang activity have steadily escalated,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican.

He added that the troop deployments are “not only appropriate, but essential.”

Democrats are expected to use the hearing to criticize the deployments as an inappropriate use of military troops.

U.S. jobless claim applications for the week ending Dec. 6 climbed by 44,000 from the previous week's 192,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That's more than analysts' forecast of 213,000.

The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 29 fell by 99,000 to 1.84 million, the government said. That's the lowest level for continuing claims since mid-April.

Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Overall layoffs have been muted despite recent high-profile job cuts. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state.

The U.S. trade deficit fell for the second straight month in September, dropping to the lowest since June 2020 when global commerce was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the deficit — the gap between what the United States sells other countries and what it buys from them — dropped nearly 11% to $52.8 billion in September. It had fallen more than 23% from July to August.

Still, the U.S. trade deficit is up so far in 2025, coming in at $765.1 billion through September, up 17% from $652.6 billion in January-September 2024. Many companies imported foreign goods early in 2025 to get ahead of Trump's tariffs.

The outcome of Thursday's state Senate vote remains uncertain despite months of pressure from Trump to remap Indiana's House districts in ways that could give the GOP control of all nine seats. Even in the face of one-on-one pressure from the White House and violent threats against state lawmakers, many Indiana Republicans have been reluctant to back a new congressional map that would split the city of Indianapolis into four districts.

Democrats are increasingly liking their odds at flipping control of the U.S. House after the results of recent high-profile elections. Trump is threatening to back primary challengers for any GOP state senator who votes against the Republican remap. “If Republicans will not do what is necessary to save our Country, they will eventually lose everything to the Democrats,” Trump wrote on social media.

Trump's approval ratings on immigration have declined since March, but border security remains a relatively strong issue for him.




Half of U.S. adults, 50%, approve of how Trump is handling border security, according to a new AP-NORC poll. Just 38% currently approve of how he's handling the issue of immigration.

Trump's relative strength on border security is partially driven by Democrats and independents, who are less likely to approve of his immigration approach. Other polls have shown these groups tend to prioritize increasing border security more than deporting immigrants, even those who are living in the country illegally.

Shaniqwa Copeland, a 30-year-old independent and home health aide in St. Augustine, Florida, said she approves of Trump's overall handling of the presidency, but believes his immigration actions have gone too far.

“Now they're just picking up anybody,” Copeland told the AP. “They just like, pick up people, grabbing anybody. It's crazy.”

Prediction markets pegged AI as a leading contender, along with Trump, Pope Leo XIV, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.

Trump was already named the 2024 person of the year by the magazine after his winning his second bid for the White House, succeeding Taylor Swift, who was the 2023 person of the year. 

The magazine cited 2025 as the year when the potential of artificial intelligence “roared into view” with no turning back. “For delivering the age of thinking machines, for wowing and worrying humanity, for transforming the present and transcending the possible, the Architects of AI are TIME's 2025 Person of the Year,” Time said in a social media post Thursday.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine would give its latest peace proposals to U.S. negotiators ahead of his urgent talks Thursday with a coalition of about 30 countries supporting Kyiv's effort to end the war with Russia on acceptable terms. The White House did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday on whether that happened.

Negotiations are at “a critical moment,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. 

Washington's goal of a swift compromise to stop the fighting that followed Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 is reducing Kyiv's room for maneuvering. Zelenskyy is walking a tightrope between defending Ukrainian interests and showing Trump he is willing to compromise, even as Moscow shows no public sign of budging from its demands. Zelenskyy's allies are backing his effort, seeking a fair settlement that will deters future Russian attacks and defend Europe.

The Senate is poised on Thursday to reject legislation to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits for millions of Americans, a potentially unceremonious end to a monthslong Democratic effort to prevent the COVID-era subsidies from expiring on Jan. 1.

Despite a bipartisan desire to continue the credits, Republicans and Democrats have never engaged in meaningful or high-level negotiations. The Senate is expected to vote on two partisan bills and defeat them both — essentially guaranteeing that many who buy their health insurance on the ACA marketplaces see a steep rise in costs at the beginning of the year.

“It's too complicated and too difficult to get done in the limited time that we have left,” said Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has unsuccessfully pushed his Republican colleagues to extend the tax credits for a short time so they can find agreement on the issue next year. Neither side has seemed interested in compromise.

Senators for the first time are poised to question military leaders over Trump's use of the National Guard in American cities, an extraordinary move that has prompted legal challenges as well as questions about states' rights and the use of the military on U.S. soil.

The hearing Thursday before the Senate Armed Services Committee is expected to feature tough questioning for Pentagon leaders over the legality of the deployments, which in some places were done over the objections of mayors and governors.

The hearing will bring the highest level of scrutiny to Trump's use of the National Guard outside of a courtroom since the deployments began and comes a day after the president faced another legal setback over his muscular use of troops in larger federal operations.

Oil companies offered $300 million for drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday in the first of 30 sales planned for the region under Republican efforts to ramp up U.S. fossil fuel production.

The sale came after Trump's administration recently announced plans to allow new drilling off Florida and California for the first time in decades. That's drawn pushback, including from Republicans worried about impacts to tourism.

Wednesday's sale was mandated by the sweeping tax-and-spending bill approved by Republicans over the summer. Under that legislation, companies will pay a 12.5% royalty on oil produced from the leases. That's the lowest royalty level for deep-water drilling since 2007.

Thirty companies submitted bids on parcels covering 1,600 square miles (4,142 square kilometers). Total high bids were down from $382 million offered in the most recent lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico under former President Joe Biden in December 2023.

When Trump promised new tariffs while running for president, Gene Stehly worried that trade disputes would jeopardize his international sales of corn, soybeans and wheat.

A little more than a year later, Stehly said his fears have become a reality, and Trump's latest promise of federal assistance is insufficient to cover farmers' losses.

Trump announced Monday that his administration would distribute $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers, who have suffered from persistently low commodity prices, rising costs and declining sales after China cut off all agricultural purchases from America during the trade war.

While rural areas remain conservative bastions, farmers' patience with Washington is wearing thin. Several of them described the government bailout, an echo of similar policies during Trump's first term, as a welcome stopgap but one that won't solve the agricultural industry's problems.

“It's a bridge. It's not the ultimate solution we're looking for,” said Charlie Radman, a fourth-generation farmer. “What we really want to have is a little more certainty and not have to rely on these ad hoc payments.”

Sweeping taxes on imports have cost the average American household nearly $1,200 since Donald Trump returned to the White House this year, according to calculations by Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee.

Using Treasury Department numbers on revenue from tariffs and Goldman Sachs estimates of who ends up paying for them, the Democrats' report Thursday found that American consumers' share of the bill came to nearly $159 billion — or $1,198 per household — from February through November.

In his second term, Trump has reversed decades of U.S. policy that favored free trade. He's imposed double-digit tariffs on almost every country on earth. According to Yale University's Budget Lab, the average U.S. tariff has shot up from 2.4% at the beginning of the year to 16.8%, the highest since 1935.

The president argues that the import taxes will protect U.S. industries from unfair foreign competition, bring factories to the United States and raise money for the Treasury.

Trump's approval on the economy and immigration have fallen substantially since March, according to a new AP-NORC poll, the latest indication that two signature issues that got him elected barely a year ago could be turning into liabilities as his party begins to gear up for the 2026 midterms.




Only 31% of U.S. adults now approve of how Trump is handling the economy, the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds. That is down from 40% in March and marks the lowest economic approval he's registered in an AP-NORC poll in his first or second term. Trump has also struggled to recover from public blowback on other issues, such as his management of the federal government, and has not seen an approval bump even after congressional Democrats effectively capitulated to end a record-long government shutdown last month.

Just a few months ago, 53% of Americans approved of Trump's handling of crime, but that's fallen to 43% in the new poll. There's been a similar decline on immigration, from 49% approval in March to 38% now.

Disney is investing $1 billion in OpenAI and will bring characters such as Mickey Mouse, Cinderella and Luke Skywalker to the AI company's Sora video generation tool, in a licensing deal that the two companies announced on Thursday. 

At the same time, Disney went after Google, demanding the tech company stop exploiting its copyrighted characters to train its AI systems. 

The OpenAI agreement makes the Walt Disney Co. the first major content licensing partner for Sora, which uses generative artificial intelligence to create short videos. 

Under the three-year licensing deal, fans will be able to use Sora to generate and share videos based on more than 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars characters. 

AI video generators like Sora have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of such videos on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about “AI slop” crowding out human-created work alongside concerns about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright.

Disney and OpenAI said they are committed to responsible use of AI that protects the safety of users and the rights of creators.

“This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. 




Disney CEO Robert Iger said the deal will “extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.” 

As part of the deal, some user-generated Sora videos will be made available on the Disney+ streaming service.

Disney will also become a “major customer” of OpenAI and use its technology to build new products, tools, and services. It will also roll out ChatGPT for employees.

Also Thursday, Disney sent Google a cease and desist letter, demanding that the tech company stop using Disney content without permission to feed and train its AI models, including its Veo video generator and Imagen and Nano Banana image generators.

It has previously issued similar cease and desist letters to Meta and Character.AI and has filed litigation with NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery against AI image generator Midjourney and AI company Minimax.

“Well, we have been aggressive at protecting our IP, and we have gone after other companies that have not honored our IP, not respected our IP, not valued it. And this is another example of us doing just that,” Iger said in an interview on CNBC's “Squawk on the Street. “We have been in conversation with Google, basically expressing our concerns about this. And, ultimately, because we didn't really make any progress, the conversations didn't bear fruit, we felt we had no choice but to send them a cease-and-desist.”

Disney accused Google of “infringing Disney's copyrights on a massive scale,” according to a copy of the letter dated Dec. 10 seen by The Associated Press. The letter included examples that it says Google's AI systems easily generated, such as characters from Star Wars, The Simpsons, Deadpool and The Lion King.

Google has also been “intentionally amplifying” the problem by making the infringing content available across its many channels including YouTube, Disney said.

Disney said Google hasn't taken any measures to mitigate the problem even though it has been raising the concerns for months. “Google's mass infringement of Disney's copyrighted works must stop,” the letter said. 

Google did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

A hiker was rescued on Sunday after he was caught in quicksand in Arches National Park, Utah.

This image taken from drone footage provided by Grand County Search and Rescue shows a man being freed from quicksand Sunday, Dec. 7, 2025, in Arches National Park in eastern Utah.

This image taken from drone footage provided by Grand County Search and Rescue shows a man, right, stuck in quicksand on Sunday, Dec. 7, 2025 in Arches National Park in eastern Utah.


















Getting trapped in quicksand is a corny peril of old movies and TV shows, but it really did happen to one unfortunate hiker in Utah's Arches National Park. 

The park famous for dozens of natural, sandstone arches gets over 1 million visitors a year, and accidents ranging from falls to heat stroke are common.

Quicksand? Not really — but it has happened at least a couple of times now.

“The wet sand just kind of flows back in. It's kind of a never-ending battle,” said John Marshall, who helped a woman stuck in quicksand over a decade ago and coordinated the latest rescue.

On Sunday, an experienced hiker, whose identity wasn't released, was traversing a small canyon on the second day of a 20-mile (32-kilometer) backpacking trip when he sank up to his thigh, according to Marshall.

Unable to free himself, the hiker activated an emergency satellite beacon. His message got forwarded to Grand County emergency responders and Marshall got the call at 7:15 a.m..

“I was just rolling out of bed,” Marshall said. “I'm scratching my head, going, ‘Did I hear that right? Did they say quicksand?'”

He put his boots on and rendezvoused with a team that set out with all-terrain vehicles, a ladder, traction boards, backboards and a drone. Soon, Marshall had a bird's-eye view of the situation.

Through the drone camera he saw a park ranger who'd tossed the man a shovel. But the quicksand flowed back as soon as the backpacker shoveled it away, Marshall said.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




The Grand County Search and Rescue team positioned the ladder and boards near the backpacker and slowly worked his leg loose. By then he'd been standing in near-freezing muck, in temperatures in the 20s (minus 6 to minus 1 Celsius), for a couple of hours.




Rescuers warmed him up until he could stand, then walk. He then hiked out on his own, even carrying his backpack, Marshall said.

Quicksand is dangerous but it's a myth total submersion is the main risk, said Marshall.

“In quicksand you're extremely buoyant,” he said. “Most people won't sink past their waist in quicksand.”

Marshall is more or less a quicksand expert. 

In 2014, he was a medic who helped a 78-year-old woman after she was stuck for over 13 hours in the same canyon just 2 miles (3 kilometers) from where Sunday's rescue took place.

President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, a move that comes amid rising escalations with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government.

President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the U.S. has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela amid mounting tensions with the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

It's the Trump administration's latest push to increase pressure on Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. 

Trump told reporters at the White House the tanker “was seized for a very good reason.” When asked what would happen to the oil aboard the tanker, Trump said, “Well, we keep it, I guess.”

The seizure was led by the U.S. Coast Guard and supported by the Navy, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

A day earlier, the U.S. military flew a pair of fighter jets over the Gulf of Venezuela in what appeared to be the closest that warplanes had come to the South American country's airspace since the start of the administration's pressure campaign.

Trump has previously said land attacks are coming soon but has not offered any details on location.

The Trump administration may have softened its language on China to maintain a fragile truce in their trade war, but Congress is charging ahead with more restrictions in a defense authorization bill that would deny Beijing investments in highly sensitive sectors and reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese biotechnology companies.

Included in the 3,000-page bill approved Wednesday by the House is a provision to scrutinize American investments in China that could help develop technologies to boost Chinese military power. The bill, which next heads to the Senate, also would prohibit government money to be used for equipment and services from blacklisted Chinese biotechnology companies.

In addition, the National Defense Authorization Act would boost U.S. support for the self-governing island of Taiwan that Beijing claims as its own and says it will take by force if necessary.

The U.S. has accused Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels of stepping up a campaign of intimidation against Yemenis who work or previously worked for international organizations and the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa.

The State Department on Wednesday condemned Houthis for what it called their “intensified campaign of intimidation and abuse against Yemeni citizens affiliated with international organizations and foreign governments.”

“The Houthis' arrests of those staff, and the sham proceedings that have been brought against them, are further evidence that the Houthis rely on the use of terror against their own people as a way to stay in power,” the department said. “We call for the immediate and unconditional release of the mission staff.”

The U.S. and other governments have for years repeatedly denounced the Houthis for the detention of foreign embassy and other workers with little impact. 

It was not immediately clear if a new development had prompted the U.S. statement, but Yemen was a topic of discussion in a phone call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Saudi foreign minister on Tuesday.

The seized tanker was identified as the Skipper by a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The ship departed Venezuela around Dec. 2 with about 2 million barrels of heavy crude, roughly half of it belonging to a Cuban state-run oil importer, according to documents from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., commonly known as PDVSA. The documents were provided on the condition of anonymity because the official did not have permission to share them.

The Skipper was previously known as the M/T Adisa, according to ship tracking data. The Adisa was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2022 over accusations of belonging to a sophisticated network of shadow tankers that smuggled crude oil on behalf of Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.

The network was reportedly run by a Switzerland-based Ukrainian oil trader, the U.S. Treasury Department said at the time.

The Coast Guard members were taken to the oil tanker by helicopter from the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. 

The Ford is in the Caribbean Sea after arriving last month in a major show of force, joining a fleet of other warships.

Video posted to social media by Attorney General Pam Bondi shows people fast-roping from one of the helicopters involved in the operation as it hovers just feet from the deck.

The Coast Guard members can be seen later in the video moving throughout the superstructure of the ship with their weapons drawn.

Bondi wrote that “for multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.”

Venezuela's government in a statement said the seizure “constitutes a blatant theft and an act of international piracy.”

“Under these circumstances, the true reasons for the prolonged aggression against Venezuela have finally been revealed… It has always been about our natural resources, our oil, our energy, the resources that belong exclusively to the Venezuelan people,” according to the statement.

A Department of Interior auction Wednesday was the first of 30 sales planned for the Gulf under Republican efforts to ramp up U.S. fossil fuel production.

The sale came after Trump's administration announced plans to allow new drilling off Florida and California for the first time in decades, drawing bipartisan pushback about impacts on tourism.

Thirty companies submitted bids, including industry giants Chevron, Shell and BP. An industry official said the takeaway from the sale was that under Trump, the Gulf “is open” for business, in contrast to the Biden administration, which limited new oil leases to address climate change.

The House has voted to pass a sweeping defense policy bill that authorizes $900 billion in military programs. 

The bill includes a pay raise for troops and an overhaul of how the Department of Defense buys weapons. It comes at a time of increasing friction between the Republican-controlled Congress and how Trump's administration has handled the military.

The White House has signaled “strong support” for the must-pass legislation and says it is in line with Trump's national security agenda. Yet tucked into the over-3,000-page bill are several measures that push back on the Department of Defense.

The Coast Guard members that seized the tanker were taken to that ship by a helicopter from the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, a U.S. official confirmed to The Associated Press.

The official was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The Ford is operating in the Caribbean Sea and arrived last month in a major show of force, joining a fleet of other warships that have been increasing pressure on Maduro.

Trump confirmed to reporters that U.S. forces seized a “large tanker.” Asked what would happen to the oil aboard the tanker, Trump said, “Well, we keep it, I guess.”

The Environmental Protection Agency is finalizing an agenda of priorities to align with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy J.'s Make America Healthy Again movement.

EPA director Lee Zeldin teased that the framework would include replacing lead pipes, cleaning up the nation's most contaminated sites and combating food waste, among other initiatives.

Wednesday's announcement was made on a call with MAHA activists. It comes as some of Kennedy's supporters have been criticizing the EPA's recent actions related to pesticides. Some released a petition last week calling for Trump to fire Zeldin.

Zeldin said he attended a MAHA holiday party this week and has since held an hourlong meeting with a group of MAHA activists at the EPA headquarters. He implored the activists to reach out if they wanted to help craft his agency's MAHA agenda.

Tony Lyons, head of the advocacy group MAHA Action, complimented Zeldin and blamed the media for the recent tensions.

“So many people are trying to drive wedges and we want to build bridges,” Lyons said.

The president said Speaker Mike Johnson, who has been under fire from his rank-and-file as of late, is doing a great job despite his circumstances.

“I think Mike Johnson is great,” Trump said. Commenting on the GOP's majority, he continued: “He's had a majority of two, three, four, and back to two (votes). We actually had one. So we were one heart attack away from disaster.”

Trump also said, “I think few people could've done that job.”

Trump was asked if he has spoken to Colombian President Gustavo Petro after having conversations in recent weeks with the leaders of Mexico and Venezuela amid his pressure campaign and push to combat drug trafficking, but Trump dismissed the idea.

Trump said Petro has been “fairly hostile to the United States.”

“He better wise up or he'll be next. He'll be next,” Trump said. “I hope he's listening. He's going to be next.” 

“I think I can get them to stop fighting. Who else can do that?” Trump said in an exchange with reporters in which he also repeated his exaggerated claim of settling eight wars around the globe, including a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia, since his return to the White House. “Every once in a while, one will flame up again and I have to put out that little flame. I have to put it out, but we're going to put it out again.”

Renewed border fighting between Thailand and Cambodia showed no signs of abating Wednesday, with hundreds of thousands of displaced people in strained conditions as more flooded into temporary shelters.

The latest fighting was triggered by longstanding territorial disputes and it followed a skirmish Sunday that wounded two Thai soldiers.

The president said he'll meet with former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as Trump looks to appoint the next Fed chair.

Trump added that he wants someone who will lower interest rates. “Our rates should be the lowest rates in the world,” he said.

Warsh is among a short list of candidates to replace Chairman Jerome Powell after his term ends in May.

President Trump said Wednesday that Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy “has to be realistic” about the war in Ukraine and mused about when Ukraine was next holding elections.

The comments came after Trump spoke with the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, who discussed Ukraine “in pretty strong terms,” the U.S. president said.

Trump said European leaders would like a meeting this weekend with both the U.S. and Ukraine, and “we'll make a determination depending on what they come back with.”

In recent days, Trump has pushed Zelenskyy to get on board with a proposed peace plan to end the war in Ukraine that Russia started in 2022.

“I think he has to be realistic,” Trump said of Zelenskyy during a question-and-answer session with reporters. “I do wonder about, you know, how long is it going to be until they have an election?”

The president was asked about Paramount Skydance's hostile takeover bid for the company behind CNN, including the fact that Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has also been involved in several peace negotiations on behalf of the Trump administration, is one of the investors behind the bid.

Trump said that he thinks CNN has been “spreading poison” and that “you have some good companies bidding on it.”

“I will be probably involved, maybe involved in the decision. It depends,” Trump said.

The president said the Fed's latest quarter-point reduction was a “rather small number” and should have been at least twice that.

He complained that the Fed is killing economic growth by keeping interest rates higher than he would like.

“They're so afraid of inflation,” Trump said. “That's what they're doing, they kill the growth.”

Trump said rates should be driven down further to boost economic growth beyond its latest expansion.

“If there is inflation, that's OK, then we can slow it down. But we should be able to do a lot better than 3 or 4%,” he said.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's remark came during a speech before a ruling-party organized demonstration in Caracas, Venezuela's capital. He did not address the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.

Maduro, flanked by senior officials, said that only the ruling party can “guarantee peace, stability, and the harmonious development of Venezuela, South America, and the Caribbean.”

“And the only president who has the preparation, the history, and the unwavering support of the people and the armed forces … is named Nicolás Maduro,” he added.

The White House started taking online applications for the new path to citizenship, which the president pitched as a tool for U.S. companies hoping to hire foreign students.

Trump said business chiefs including Apple CEO Tim Cook complained it was too risky to hire foreign students without certainty they can stay in the country. With the new card, he said, “you'll be able to buy a card and keep that person in the United States.”

A card costs $1 million for individuals and $2 million for companies.

It comes even as the Trump administration presses some colleges to reduce foreign enrollment. Numbers of new foreign students coming to the U.S. fell sharply this year amid a federal crackdown

Spc. Sarah Beckstrom was laid to rest with full military honors Tuesday at the West Virginia National Cemetery in Grafton, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a news release.

Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe were ambushed as they patrolled a subway station three blocks from the White House on Nov. 26. Beckstrom died from her injuries the next day.

Wolfe's family expects he will be in acute care for another few weeks, the governor said.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who was also shot during the confrontation, has been charged with murder. He has pleaded not guilty.

The president told reporters about the seizure as he appeared at an unrelated White House roundtable Wednesday afternoon. 

He did not immediately offer additional details.

The announcement comes as the administration has undertaken a large military buildup and a series of deadly strikes on boats that it has alleged are carrying drugs in the Caribbean.

Democrat Eileen Higgins' victory in Miami's mayoral election deals a blow to Trump. 

The Republican president has appeared dismissive on economic worries, blaming Democrats for using the term “affordability” as a “hoax.” Higgins said she would tell Trump to “think deeply” and that the concerns are real.

Higgins has been very critical of Trump on immigration and is vowing to look at legal options to end an agreement between city police and federal immigration agents.

The Times has done a handful of stories on that topic recently, including an opinion column that said Trump is “starting to give President Joe Biden vibes.”

In a Truth Social post, Trump said it might be treasonous for outlets like the Times to do “FAKE” reports about his health and “we should do something about it.” 

The news outlet said Wednesday it won't be deterred by Trump's “false and inflammatory language” from writing about the 79-year-old president's health.

Judge Emil Bove's attendance at Trump's speech Tuesday in Pennsylvania violated the federal Code of Judicial Conduct, a courts ethics watchdog said in a complaint filed Wednesday.

Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, said in the complaint that Bove's presence at the event that included charged partisan attacks violated the code's admonitions to judges to refrain from political activity and avoid even the appearance of impropriety.

“It should have been obvious to Judge Bove, either at the start of the rally or fairly close to it, that this was a highly charged, highly political event that no federal judge should have been within shouting distance of,” Roth's complaint said.

Trump appointed Bove, the president's former lawyer, to a lifetime seat on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

The complaint was filed with the 3rd Circuit's judicial council.

The move that could attract ire from Trump, who has demanded steep reductions to borrowing costs. 

In a set of quarterly economic projections, Fed officials signaled they expect to lower rates just once next year. 

Wednesday's cut reduced the rate to about 3.6%, the lowest it has been in nearly three years. 

Democrat Eileen Higgins won the Miami mayor's race on Tuesday, defeating a Republican endorsed by President Donald Trump to end her party's nearly three-decade losing streak and give Democrats a boost in one of the last electoral battles ahead of the 2026 midterms.

In a briefing the day after her historic win as the first woman elected mayor of the south Florida metropolis, Eileen Higgins decried elected officials' use of “language that is demeaning, that is cruel, that is disrespectful about the people who live in the city of Miami.”

She also called Miami “the tip of the spear of the affordability crisis in America.”

Campaigning as a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan race, Higgins on Tuesday defeated a Republican endorsed by Trump, ending Democrats' nearly three-decade losing streak leading the Hispanic-majority city. Higgins said she has heard of many people in Miami who were worried about family members being detained.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has kicked off a series of meetings with British and Australian counterparts in Washington that are aimed at moving forward with the large nuclear submarine building and technology sharing pact between the three nations known as known as AUKUS.

Ahead of the meetings, the British defense minister said he's “all in” following a U.S. review of the deal.

“Those reviews are now done,” U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey told reporters Wednesday. He added that “all three of us are now determined to reboot AUKUS with a new commitment and a new determination in particular to deliver.”

The deal was originally inked in 2021. The Pentagon recently determined that the agreement was in the U.S. national security interest.

It includes the sale of three U.S.-built nuclear-powered submarines to Australia starting in 2032.

“I'm absolutely delighted that Jasmine Crockett is running for Senate in Texas,” Johnson said, eagerly rubbing his hands together.

The House GOP speaker called the liberal firebrand “the face of the Democratic Party,” and compared Crockett to New York's new mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.

“Good luck with that,” he said. “What Jasmine is trying to sell will not be purchased by the folks in Texas, that is my prediction.”

He said, “I want her to have the largest, loudest microphone that she can every single day,” he said, “and we look forward to having that election down there.”

A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must end the California National Guard deployment in Los Angeles. Other deployments are being challenged in court. Here are the other U.S. cities where troops remain:

The Republican speaker said he missed the classified briefing with Hegseth and Rubio this week because he was working with House GOP lawmakers on their emerging health care proposals.

Johnson would not say if the video should be widely released, in part because he said he had not viewed it.

“We'll see,” he said.

Because of his timing conflict with the classified briefing, he said Hegseth and Rubio would meet with him separately at a later date.

Marco Rubio has ordered that all diplomatic correspondence must return to the more traditional Times New Roman font.

It reverses a Biden-era shift to the less formal typeface that Rubio said was wasteful, confusing and unbefitting the dignity of official U.S. government documents.

His cable sent to all U.S. embassies and consulates Tuesday said the 2023 shift to the sans serif Calibri font was the result of misguided diversity, equity and inclusion policies pursued by his predecessor, Antony Blinken. Rubio's cable, obtained by The Associated Press, said Blinken's switch “was promised to mitigate accessibility issues for individuals with disabilities.”

It says the change had cost the department $145,000 but offered no supporting evidence. The cable was first reported by The New York Times.

The vice president is expected to give a speech in Allentown in the vein of Trump's remarks last night to focus on the economy and assure voters that the administration is working to address inflation, according to his office.

A three-year extension of expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits would increase federal deficits by nearly $83 billion over the next decade, according to a new estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.

The Senate will vote on competing health plans on Thursday. The three-year extension of the subsidy is being pitched by Senate Democrats, but it is not expected to pass.

The CBO also estimates that enacting the Democratic plan would increase the number of people with health insurance by about 400,000 next year, 3 million in 2027 and 4 million in 2028.

Gross premiums, the amount consumers would pay before a tax credit is applied, have already been set for 2026. But CBO says they would fall by 5.7% in 2027 and 9% in 2028, because people who enroll in ACA plans would be healthier than they would be without the extension.

Trump took command in June following protests over his efforts to carry out mass deportations. California sued, and Breyer issued a temporary restraining order that required the administration to return control of the Guard members to California. An appeals court put that decision on hold. Then in September, Breyer ruled after a trial that the deployment was illegal.

California argued that the president was using Guard members as his personal police force in violation of a law limiting the use of the military in domestic affairs.

The administration said courts can't second-guess the president's decision that violence during the protests made it impossible for him to execute U.S. laws with regular forces, and reflected a rebellion, or danger of rebellion.

Other judges have blocked the administration's deployments to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago.

The Trump administration must return control of the troops to the state, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco ruled Wednesday. 

Breyer granted a preliminary injunction against Trump's extraordinary move to use state Guard troops without the governor's approval. He put the decision on hold until Monday.

California argued that conditions in Los Angeles had changed since Trump first took command of the troops and deployed them in June. The administration initially called up more than 4,000 California National Guard troops. By late October, only a 100 or so remained in the Los Angeles area. Justice Department lawyers said they are still needed to protect federal personnel and property.

The Republican administration extended the deployment until February while also trying to use California Guard members in Portland, Oregon. 

Secret grand jury transcripts from Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 sex trafficking case can be made public, a judge ruled Wednesday, joining two other judges in granting the requests involving investigations into the late financier's sexual abuse.

U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman reversed his earlier decision, citing a new law that requires the government to open its files on Epstein and his longtime confidant Ghislaine Maxwell. The judge previously cautioned that the 70 or so pages of grand jury materials slated for release are hardly revelatory.

Different judges ordered the release of records from Maxwell's 2021 sex trafficking case and from an abandoned Epstein federal grand jury investigation in the 2000s.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act Trump signed last month created a narrow exception to rules that normally keep grand jury proceedings confidential.

According to a Harris aide, the 2024 Democratic nominee's national tour will not focus as heavily on her defeat to Trump and her resulting campaign memoir, “107 Days.” Instead, Harris will talk about the state of the country, what she's heard from voters during the first leg of her book tour and future solutions to national problems.

The shift could fuel speculation about her 2028 presidential ambitions. Harris announced 15 tour stops beginning Jan. 13 in New Orleans and continuing through March 3 in her hometown of Oakland, California.

That's where she announced her unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2019. She dropped out before nominating contests began but Joe Biden tapped her as his running mate in 2020, and she was elected as the first woman to hold national office.

Rep. Haley Stevens said in a video posted on X Wednesday that the Health and Human Services secretary “has got to go.”

Stevens, who is running for Michigan's open U.S. Senate seat, calls Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “the biggest, self-created threat to our health and safety,” citing “skyrocketing” health care costs and the “gutting” of research.

Stevens, who represents a suburban Detroit district, is part of House Democrats' 2019 freshman class that flipped dozens of Republican-held seats to deliver a Democratic majority that reshaped Trump's first presidency, including twice impeaching him.

Narrowly defeating her opponent in 2020, she cruised to reelection in 2022 and 2024 after her district was redrawn and became more favorable to Democrats.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino's public support for Trump and a peace prize awarded to the U.S. president are the subjects of formal complaints to the global soccer body's ethics investigators.

FairSquare, a London-based human rights nonprofit, said Tuesday it filed requests for investigations into Infantino's alleged breaches of FIFA's statutory duty to be politically neutral. FIFA said its ethics committee does not comment on potential ongoing cases, and could not confirm receiving the complaint.

FIFA's ethics code calls for a ban from soccer of up to two years for violating the duty of neutrality. But it's unclear if FIFA's current ethics investigators and judges will take up the case — they're seen by some observers to operate with less independence than their predecessors a decade ago when then-president Sepp Blatter was removed from office.

The outgoing comptroller of New York City is challenging U.S. Rep. Dan Goldman in a Democratic primary for a liberal district in lower Manhattan and northwest Brooklyn.

Brad Lander, a progressive ally of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, in a video and social media posts promised Wednesday to offer “courageous leadership in the face of Donald Trump's attacks on New Yorkers.”

Lander scheduled a public speech about his campaign Wednesday evening near his home in Brooklyn. He's has been eyeing a challenge to Goldman since he lost the Democratic mayoral primary to Mamdani this summer.

Lander and Mamdani endorsed one another during the mayoral primary in an effort, as part of the city's ranked choice voting system, to join forces against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who at the time was the front-runner.

A Dallas congresswoman opened her Senate campaign by telling voters that she “has gone toe to toe with Donald Trump.” Her Democratic primary opponent insisted that Americans are tired of “politics as a blood sport.”

The divergent approach highlights how U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico are navigating a race where Democrats hope to break a three-decade losing streak in Texas. It also reflects a broader divide within the party, with some candidates continuing to focus on Trump while others barely mention his name.

Figuring out the best approach will be critical for Democrats who are seeking control of Congress next year and already maneuvering for the 2028 presidential race.

The bigger question for financial markets and the economy is what Chair Jerome Powell may signal Wednesday regarding the central bank's next steps.

This would be the third cut in a row and bring the Fed's key rate to about 3.6%, the lowest in nearly three years. For Americans struggling with high borrowing costs for homes, cars, and other large purchases, rate cuts could reduce those costs over time — though it's not guaranteed.

This week's meeting could presage a much cloudier path ahead. The government shutdown delayed two months of jobs and inflation data, leaving the Fed with much less information on hiring and inflation. And with Powell's term as chair ending in May, Trump will nominate a replacement, possibly as soon as this month, who will almost certainly push for lower borrowing costs.

Mega billionaire Elon Musk says he would not run the Department of Government Efficiency again, and he assesses the overall effort as only “somewhat successful.”

Musk made his comments to Katie Miller, a conservative operative who works for Musk and is married to Trump adviser Stephen Miller.

“I don't think so,” Musk said when she asked on her podcast whether he'd start the now-shuttered agency again. 

The SpaceX and Tesla CEO, who also owns X, said he'd focus on business instead. 

Musk said DOGE identified billions in “zombie payments” but wasn't able to enact his promised sweeping reduction of the federal footprint.

Musk acknowledged that his businesses, especially Tesla, faced backlash because of DOGE's unpopularity. Things turned in his favor after he left the Trump administration. Tesla shareholders approved a pay package that could make Musk the world's first trillionaire.

Emboldened by recent elections, Democrats are adding more Republican-held House districts to 2026 midterm target list.

Several additions result from recent gerrymandering by state legislatures: Republican Darrell Issa's California district, North Carolina seats held by Republicans Greg Murphy and Chuck Edwards, and a newly drawn open seat in Texas.

Sacramento Democrats redrew Issa's seat to their favor. Murphy's and Edwards' districts also became less solidly Republican when GOP lawmakers in Raleigh strengthened Republican chances elsewhere. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also added Florida Republican Laurel Lee's district.

Trump won there and in the newly added Texas seat by double digits in 2024, but Democrats note that in elections across the country this year, their candidates made double-digit gains compared to the presidential election.

Republicans in Florida have found strong support from voters with heritage from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua as they likened Democratic leaders to the governments they fled.

But U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Republican whose district is being targeted by Democrats and includes the city of Miami, said Hispanics also want a secure border, a healthy economy and some relief for “those who have been here for years and do not have a criminal record.”

“The Hispanic vote is not guaranteed,” Salazar said in a video post after Democratic wins in New Jersey and Virginia. “Hispanics married President Trump, but they are only dating the GOP.”

Democrat David Jolly, running for Florida governor, celebrated the results in Miami: “Change is here. It's sweeping the nation, and it's sweeping Florida.” 

Voters elected Eileen Higgins by a margin of about 19 percentage points on Tuesday, defeating a Republican endorsed by President Donald Trump to end her party's nearly three-decade losing streak and give Democrats a boost in one of the last electoral battles ahead of the 2026 midterms.

“We are facing rhetoric from elected officials that is so dehumanizing and cruel, especially against immigrant populations,” Higgins told The Associated Press after her victory speech in the Hispanic-majority city that may become the home of Trump's presidential library. “The residents of Miami were ready to be done with that.”

The victory provides Democrats with some momentum as the GOP looks to keep its grip in Florida. “Tonight's result is yet another warning sign to Republicans that voters are fed up with their out-of-touch agenda that is raising costs,” Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin said in a statement.

Todd Piro reports on the University of Michigan's dismissal of head football coach Sherrone Moore amid claims of an inappropriate relationship.

After being taken into custody Wednesday night, it appears Sherrone Moore will remain in jail for the foreseeable future.

The former Michigan head coach ""remains under active investigation by law enforcement,"" and potential charges are not expected to be announced until at least Friday, officials told Fox News Digital.

""Mr. Moore remains in custody at the Washtenaw County Jail. As this remains an active investigation, we are unable to comment further at this time, but our office will provide an update once a decision on charges is made,"" the Washtenaw County Prosecutor's Office said.

Pittsfield police said later Thursday that Moore would be arraigned on Friday.

Moore was fired Wednesday, and the University of Michigan quickly announced it found credible evidence of an ""inappropriate relationship"" with a staffer. Shortly after, he was booked into the Michigan jail.

""The conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior,"" athletic director Warde Manuel said.

WHO IS SHERRONE MOORE? NATIONAL CHAMPION COACH'S STUNNING DOWNFALL FROM MICHIGAN ENDS IN JAILING

Following news of the police investigation, the University of Michigan athletic department told Fox News Digital it ""cannot comment on personnel matters"" and had ""nothing to share beyond the initial statement.""

Pittsfield police said they responded to a home as part of an assault investigation. Police said a suspect was taken into custody and that the incident does not appear to be random. Police said the suspect was lodged in the Washtenaw County Jail pending review of charges by the Washtenaw County prosecutor.

Moore got married in 2015, and he and his wife have three daughters.

The University of Michigan fired Sherrone Moore after the school found ""credible evidence"" of an inappropriate relationship with a staffer – hours later, he was booked into a jail.

It is quite a rapid fall from grace for Moore, who less than two years ago was on top of the college football world as a national champion.

Moore found himself in controversy during the investigation into Michigan's potential sign-stealing, but this controversy trumps them all.

Here is a look at how Moore got to where he is today.

Moore is a former college football player, standing at 6-foot-5 and over 300 pounds during his college days. After spending his first two years at a community college near his hometown, he transferred to Oklahoma and played there for two years.

Moore played in 14 games as with the Sooners, winning the Big 12 Championship in both seasons. In 2007, they defeated top-ranked Missouri in the Big 12 title game, but the Sooners lost the Fiesta Bowl both seasons.

Just one year after graduating from Oklahoma, Moore joined the coaching staff at Louisville as a graduate assistant. He was promoted to a full-time assistant in 2012, becoming the team's tight ends coach.

Moore left to hold the same position at Central Michigan in 2014 before also becoming the team's assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator in 2017. In 2018, he then landed in Ann Arbor to become the Wolverines' tight ends coach.

Moore was the tight ends coach through 2020 and was promoted in early 2021 to the team's co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach. Michigan was named the top offensive line in both 2021 and 2022, and with Jim Harbaugh running the show, the Wolverines were creeping back into a powerhouse, making the College Football Playoff both seasons for the first time.

Moore's first taste as a head coach came in 2023, when he became the acting head coach while Harbaugh served two separate three-game suspensions stemming from the sign-stealing scandal. Michigan completed a perfect season, winning the national championship over Washington.

After Harbaugh left for the Los Angeles Chargers, Moore was promoted to head coach. His first season was a disappointment, as Michigan went 8-5, but one of those wins was a huge upset as three-touchdown underdogs in Columbus against Ohio State.

Moore served a two-game suspension this season as the sign-stealing scandal investigation continued, and despite going 9-3 in the regular season, the school's winning streak against Ohio State ended, and the Wolverines missed out on the playoff.

Moore was shockingly fired on Wednesday, and the University of Michigan quickly announced it found credible evidence of an inappropriate relationship with a staffer. Shortly after, he was booked into the Washtenaw County Jail in Michigan.

Pittsfield police said they responded to a home as part of an assault investigation. Police said a suspect was taken into custody and that the incident does not appear to be random. Police said the suspect was lodged in the Washtenaw County Jail pending review of charges by the Washtenaw County prosecutor.

Police said the investigation was ongoing. At the time of publication, Moore had yet to be charged.

A federal judge in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Thursday ordered the release of Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia from federal immigration custody in Pennsylvania — a long-awaited update in an extraordinary case that has dominated international headlines and federal court dockets for nearly 10 months.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered Abrego Garcia released from the ICE Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pa., on the grounds that the Trump administration had not obtained the final notice of removal order that is needed to deport him to a third country, including a list of African nations they had previously identified for his removal. 

""Since Abrego Garcia's return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,"" Xinis said in her order on Thursday. 

""For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia's Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.""

Xinis in November had used a lengthy evidentiary hearing to press lawyers for the Trump administration on whether it had the final order needed to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. to a third country, including the African nations identified by government officials. 

Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign suggested then that the immigration judge who ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia could not be removed back to his home country of El Salvador had ""meant,"" or implied a final order of removal — a notion Xinis dismissed in her ruling.

""No such order of removal exists for Abrego Garcia,"" she said.

The Justice Department is almost certain to appeal her order to a higher court, as Ensign indicated they would do in previous hearings. 

Xinis had said last month that without final notice of removal, Abrego Garcia would be ""at a minimum"" entitled to certain relief. She cited Supreme Court precedent under Zadvydas v. Davis, which bars the government from indefinitely detaining migrants after removal issues have been ordered. 

FEDERAL JUDGE EXTENDS ARGUMENTS IN ABREGO GARCIA CASE, SLAMS ICE WITNESS WHO 'KNEW NOTHING'

Abrego Garcia's status since March has been at the center of a legal and political maelstrom, when he was deported to his home country of El Salvador, in violation of a 2019 court order and in what Trump officials acknowledge was an ""administrative error."" Xinis ordered then that Abrego Garcia be ""immediately"" returned to the U.S.

Critics argue the months-long legal fight that ensued has allowed the Trump administration to test its mettle on immigration enforcement, as well as its ability to slow-walk or evade compliance with federal courts. 

Senior DHS and Justice Department officials, for their part, have disputed that accusation. 

They have also been sharply critical of Xinis and other federal judges presiding over deportation cages, whom they have repeatedly accused of overstepping their authority as a district judge.

""This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Thursday in response to the order.

Upon his return to the U.S. in June, Abrego Garcia was immediately taken into federal custody in Nashville and detained on human smuggling charges, stemming from a 2022 traffic stop. 

Government officials later acknowledged that the investigation into the traffic stop began when Abrego Garcia was still detained in El Salvador, prompting new questions as to the process of securing the indictment. 

A federal judge in Tennessee has been hearing from the government and Abrego Garcia's lawyers on his motion to dismiss that case on the grounds of vindictive and selective prosecution. 

A hearing on the motion to dismiss has been scheduled in Nashville for early next month.

Xinis had also pressed Trump officials on why they could not deport Abrego Garcia to the third county of Costa Rica, whose government had granted the necessary assurances that they would not detain him or refoul him back to his home country of El Salvador.

Trump officials previously told her in court that Costa Rica was ""off the table,"" though they did not provide evidence. 

Subsequent court filings appear to show that Costa Rica had not reneged on its agreement to accept Abrego Garcia into their country, casting renewed doubt on that claim. 

The order from Xinis comes after lawyers for the Trump administration repeatedly asked Xinis to dissolve an emergency order she handed down in August, which required Abrego Garcia to remain in U.S. immigration custody, and within 200 miles of her court. 

ABREGO GARCIA LAWYERS ASK US JUDGE TO ORDER RETURN TO MARYLAND AMID ONGOING CRIMINAL CASE

Xinis's order also ostensibly allows Abrego Garcia to remain in the U.S. with his brother, pending trial in the criminal case in Nashville. 

The Trump administration previously tried and failed to remove Abrego Garcia to the African countries of Liberia, Eswatini, Uganda and briefly, Ghana.

Xinis noted in late November that the government cannot take any of those steps without the final notice of removal order.

""You've raised all these arguments, and they all depend on me having a withholding of removal order,"" Xinis said then. ""You can't ‘fake it 'til you make it.'""

Swedish archaeologists recently uncovered remnants of a forgotten 16th-century city beneath modern-day Gothenburg.

The excavation was conducted by Arkeologerna, a Swedish archaeological consultancy, earlier this autumn. Researchers focused on Olskroken, a district east of central Gothenburg — Sweden's second-largest city after Stockholm.

What they found were the remnants of a place called Nya Lödöse, a short-lived town founded by Swedish regent Sten Sture the Elder in 1473.

MAN STUMBLES ACROSS HOARD OF PRICELESS COINS WHILE OUT FOR NATURE WALK: 'FACE TO FACE WITH HISTORY'

With its strategic location near the North Sea, Nya Lödöse flourished as a port and attracted traders from across Western Europe.

By 1624, however, it was largely abandoned, and Gothenburg began to rise in its place. Thanks to archaeologists' hard work, remnants of the long-forgotten locale have turned up in recent months.

Archaeologist Mattias Obrink told Fox News Digital that Nya Lödöse was designed like a typical medieval market town, with a grid surrounding a main marketplace with a town hall.

""There were similarities in the physical structure of most of the plots,"" he said. ""All houses except the church were wooden and mostly uniform in size and architectural style.""

Obrink added, ""They resembled rural dwellings and the architecture didn't show different social and economic status. What we uncovered were not complete houses — but rather the remains of walls and the boundaries of the individual plots.""

ELITE ROMAN FAMILY'S ANCIENT TREASURE UNEARTHED IN RUINS OF FIRE-SCORCHED DWELLING

Obrink worked as a project manager during the excavations. He noted that subtle class differences emerged through the artifacts.

""We found a huge amount of artifacts reflecting everyday life and surplus — like, for instance, a leather glove and a wooden barrel,"" he said.

""We also found many imported ceramic objects. One of the most surprising artifacts was pieces of a pocket watch from the mid-16th century.""

Photos from the excavation include the remains of a house, a 16th-century leather glove and a cobbled street, along with a 17th-century wooden barrel that was repurposed as a cesspit.

""In the 16th century, this part of the town was densely built up, and analyses of the buried inhabitants have given us important insights into life in Nya Lödöse,"" he said.

""We have excavated an exceptionally large portion of the town, and the material we uncovered spans a period of only 150 years.""

""The founding of Nya Lödöse represents the beginning of an independent Swedish trade policy.""

Obrink noted that Nya Lödöse was established to succeed the older medieval settlement of Lödöse, during a time ""marked by conflict between Denmark and Sweden.""

""Although the two kingdoms had been united in a political union since the 14th century, Sweden repeatedly attempted to break free,"" he said.

""The founding of Nya Lödöse represents the beginning of an independent Swedish trade policy.""

But Nya Lödöse's proximity to the Danish border invited conflict, Obrink said — and it was replaced ""by the heavily fortified city of Gothenburg.""

Obrink said subtle social differences appeared through artifacts such as clothing, imported goods and tools. (Arkeologerna, Statens Historiska Museer)

Since 2013, archaeologists have uncovered streets, at least 39 plots, the port, the pier and the main square — and more recently, the city's 16th-century fortifications, which included a moat, rampart and traces of several gardens inside the walls.

All in all, Obrink said that the new findings give researchers ""extraordinary opportunities to examine fine-grained details of the built environment and to tell the stories of life in Nya Lödöse.""

""[It's] something that has rarely been possible elsewhere,"" he said. 

""These stories unfold against the wider backdrop of the transformative 16th century, when medieval Europe transitioned into the early modern era.""

""It was a time marked by the discovery of the Americas, the Reformation and the emergence of powerful princely states,"" Obrink concluded.

The Gothenburg excavation is one of many fascinating archaeological digs that took place in Sweden in 2025.

Body language expert Susan Constantine told Fox News Digital that Luigi Mangione displayed several 'red flags' in the moments before he was arrested by police in Pennsylvania.

A body language expert said that Luigi Mangione displayed several ""red flags"" when he was arrested by police in Pennsylvania after allegedly killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024.

Prosecutors released body camera video on Tuesday that shows police officers confronting Mangione at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Dec. 9, 2024. An employee at the fast-food restaurant reportedly recognized Mangione and told a co-worker, who then alerted police.

Body language expert Susan Constantine told Fox News Digital that Mangione displayed ""red flags"" when police first confronted him at the McDonald's and said someone reported him as being suspicious.

""So he does this expression on his face when he's asked that question, is that frozen freeze response. Like that, right? Eyes wide open, mouth drops. And then he doesn't deny. He doesn't ask any questions. He doesn't defend himself,"" Constantine said. ""He doesn't say anything. And the fact that he doesn't say anything, all of those were red flags because you would naturally be curious.""

Constantine also pointed out how Mangione ""positioned himself in the corner conspicuously"" and was fully masked. Constantine said that concealment is one of the ways she can determine ""dangerous intent,"" which she says Mangione is doing.

""So the fact that he was hiding in the back, that's one pin, right? Then he's got the concealment of the clothing. He's got his little hat down over his eyebrows, then he's got the mask on, and he's looking down, right? So he's trying to remove himself from ever being noticed, and that's what he was doing,"" Constantine said.

She added that Mangione knew it was ""game over"" when he went to grab the driver's license to hand to police, and had a ""fear response"" when approached by the officer.

""At that point, I knew he knew it was game over just because of his body language of being more in a low confidence. You know, his shoulders are kind of pulled in, he's kind of huddled together. He's not leaning out and just, you know, going on his computer just doing work. There were so many signals,"" Constantine said. ""All of those things led to this is an anomaly compared to everybody else that was in that restaurant. That's what it is. It's an anomaly.""

The McDonald's employee who made the initial 911 call identified Mangione as the suspect in Thompson's death, according to a transcript of the call.

""I'm a manager at Plank Road McDonald's out here on the boulevard,"" a McDonald's manager told the 911 dispatcher. ""And I have a customer here, that some other customers were suspicious of, that he looks like the CEO shooter from New York.""

Altoona Police Officer Christy Wasser testified in court on Monday that she found a magazine with bullets wrapped in wet underwear that was inside Mangione's backpack.

Dr. Stephanie Kuku, chief knowledge officer at Conceivable Life in the U.K., discusses how AI-powered IVF could reduce the number of cycles and increase the chances of conception.

A sperm donor whose samples helped conceive nearly 200 children across Europe unknowingly carried a cancer-causing genetic mutation — a hidden risk now tied to multiple childhood illnesses and early deaths.

An investigation led by the BBC and many other public service broadcasters revealed that the donations were made to Denmark's European Sperm Bank (ESB). Those donations were then used by 67 fertility clinics in 14 countries over a 17-year span.

The donor, who was not identified, was paid to donate as a student beginning in 2005, according to the report.

Although the donor passed the initial health screenings, he had hidden genetic mutations that damaged the TP53 gene, which helps to prevent cancer by repairing DNA damage or trigger the death of cancer cells.

When TP53 is mutated, those protective functions are lost, which can lead to uncontrolled cell division, accumulation of mutations and tumor growth, research has shown.

Up to 20% of the man's sperm would contain that mutated gene, and any children conceived from that affected sperm would have the mutation in every cell of their body, the BBC report stated.

As a result, these children would have a 90% risk of developing some type of cancer in their lifetime, including breast cancer, bone cancers, brain tumors and leukemia. This heightened risk is known as Li Fraumeni syndrome.

THREE-PERSON IVF TECHNIQUE SHOWN TO PREVENT INHERITED GENETIC DISEASES 

Doctors raised these concerns at the annual congress of the European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG), which was held in Milan in May 2025.

At that conference, Edwige Kasper — a specialist in cancer genetics at Rouen University Hospital in France — presented the case of the sperm donor whose genetic material carried the harmful variant.

""This is the abnormal dissemination of genetic disease. Not every man has 75 children across Europe.""

It was reported that 23 children had been confirmed to have the variant at that time, 10 of which had already been diagnosed with cancer. 

The actual number is likely much higher, the report surmised, as at least 197 children were born from the donated sperm — but not all data has been collected. 

Kasper called for a limit on the number of births or families for a single donor in Europe.

""We can't do whole-genome sequencing for all sperm donors — I'm not arguing for that,"" she said. ""But this is the abnormal dissemination of genetic disease. Not every man has 75 children across Europe.""

SKIN DNA BREAKTHROUGH COULD LET 60-YEAR-OLD WOMEN HAVE GENETICALLY RELATED KIDS

She also recommended that children born from this donor's sperm undergo genetic counseling.

""We have some children that have already developed two different cancers, and some of them have already died at a very early age,"" Kasper recently told the investigators.

Up to 20% of the man's sperm would contain that mutated gene, and any children conceived from that affected sperm would have the mutation in every cell of their body, the BBC report stated. (iStock)

There is no worldwide law that limits how many times a donor's sperm can be used or how many children may be born from a single donor, according to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE).

However, individual countries may have their own rules or guidelines surrounding sperm donor usage. The ESHRE recently proposed a cap of 50 families per donor as an international limit.

HOW AI IS MAKING IVF MORE PREDICTABLE

Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst, commented on these developments to Fox News Digital.

""This awful story emphasizes the growing need for up-to-date genetic screening for all donors,"" he said. ""It also provides context for the idea that knowing the donor provides an advantage.""

""This awful story emphasizes the growing need for up-to-date genetic screening for all donors,"" Dr. Marc Siegel said. (iStock)

""Genetic screening, including for oncogenes (genes that have the potential to cause cancer) is improving dramatically, and all use of sperm donations must include it,"" Siegel went on. 

He also called for AI to be used to improve and speed up the process.

""When a propensity for disease is suspected, the sperm must be discarded,"" the doctor added.

In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, ​​the European Sperm Bank (ESB) expressed ""deepest sympathy"" for the families involved.

""We are deeply affected by the case and the impact that the rare TP53 mutation has on a number of families, children and the donor. They have our deepest sympathy,"" the ESB said.

The American Society of Reproductive Medicine provided its guidance on embryo and gamete donation, which stated in part that all prospective donors should undergo ""appropriate genetic evaluation."" (iStock)

""ESB tests and performs an individual medical assessment of all donors in full compliance with recognized and scientific practice and legislation.""

In the case of this particular sperm donor with the TP53 mutation, the ESB noted that it occurs only in a small part of the donor's sperm cells and not in the rest of the body.

""In such cases, the donor himself and his family members are not ill, and a mutation of this type is not detected preventively by genetic screening,"" the agency said.

When the ESB later confirmed the mutation in 2023, the donor was ""immediately blocked"" and authorities and clinics were notified.

""Donors should be healthy and have no history to suggest hereditary disease.""

""The clinics are responsible for informing the patients, partly because we as a sperm bank do not necessarily know the patients, and because the patients' own treating physicians are best equipped to advise them in the specific situation,"" the agency stated.

Fix the Court, a self-proclaimed nonpartisan court reform advocacy group with left-wing ties, filed a judicial misconduct complaint against U.S. Circuit Judge Emil Bove for attending President Donald Trump's speech in Pennsylvania on Tuesday.

As Trump commenced his affordability-focused tour in Pennsylvania, Bove, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, attended the president's speech in the Poconos. The Trump-appointed judge, who served as principal associate deputy attorney general at the Department of Justice before his appointment, raised ethics concerns among some Democratic lawmakers with his appearance at the rally.

Bove told MS NOW's Vaughn Hillyard that he attended the speech as a private citizen: “Just here as a citizen coming to watch the president speak.”

Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, filed a judicial misconduct complaint against Bove on Wednesday over his attendance at the Trump event. Fix the Court was originally founded as a project of New Venture Fund, which is managed by the left-wing dark money group Arabella Advisers.

“It should have been obvious to Judge Bove, either at the start of the rally or fairly close to it, that this was a highly charged, highly political event that no federal judge should have been within shouting distance of,” Roth wrote in the complaint.

When asked for comment on Fix the Court's complaint, the White House referred the Washington Examiner to communications director Steven Cheung's statement, which blasted a Politico reporter's tweet that said it was “highly unusual” for Bove to attend the event as “pearl-clutching.”

“No it's not. Stop your pearl-clutching. An American citizen is at an event listening to the President of the United States speak. In your world, you'd rather give rights to illegal criminals over Americans,” Cheung said.

Roth pointed to the code of conduct for judges in his complaint, specifically Canon 2 and Canon 5.

“Canon 2 states that a judge ‘should avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities.' Attending a Trump event — and not leaving when it became clear that the speech was, in fact, a partisan rally — violates this canon,” Roth wrote. “Canon 5 states that a judge ‘should refrain from political activity.' Last night's event in Pennsylvania was barely distinguishable (i.e., only temporally) from a Trump rally in 2020 or 2024, both of which were obvious political activities.”

A spokeswoman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Clare Slattery, told Bloomberg Law that Trump's speech “was an official White House event highlighting kitchen table issues that impact all Americans.”

“Where's the outrage over federal judges who've potentially violated the judicial Code of Conduct by trashing their own branch of government in recent statements to the press?” Slattery told Bloomberg. Grassley and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) have raised code of conduct concerns about federal judges who they say have anonymously made “inflammatory comments” about the Supreme Court.

TRUMP RIPS BIDEN AND DEMOCRATS OVER AFFORDABILITY IN PENNSYLVANIA: ‘LIKE BONNIE AND CLYDE PREACHING PUBLIC SAFETY'

Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Dick Durbin (D-IL) told the Courthouse News Service that he hoped Bove would show “better judgment.”

“Mr. Bove is a loyalist to President Trump, but I hoped that after he received this appointment to the federal bench at the second-highest court in the land, he would show better judgment,” Durbin told the outlet.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) has long been a critic of continued U.S. membership in NATO. He's categorized it as an archaic institution that serves no current purpose and a waste of taxpayer money. On Tuesday, Massie introduced a bill to end the country's membership in NATO.

NATO is a Cold War relic. The United States should withdraw from NATO and use that money to defend our country, not socialist countries.Today, I introduced HR 6508 to end our NATO membership. pic.twitter.com/IvRfTH388W

“NATO is a Cold War relic. We should withdraw from NATO and use that money to defend our own country, not socialist countries,” Massie said in a press release and in social media posts. “NATO was created to counter the Soviet Union, which collapsed over thirty years ago. Since then, U.S. participation has cost taxpayers trillions of dollars and continues to risk U.S. involvement in foreign wars.”

Massie's NATO Act called for:

In defending his legislative proposal, Massie said that the country's continued membership in NATO ran counter to the ideologies the country's founders supported. He specifically mentioned warnings from the founders cautioning the government not to get involved in foreign affairs.  

“Our Constitution did not authorize permanent foreign entanglements, something our Founding Fathers explicitly warned us against,” Massie said. “America should not be the world's security blanket — especially when wealthy countries refuse to pay for their own defense.”

Massie's emphasis on the Founding Fathers' reluctance to get involved in “foreign entanglements” likely refers to George Washington's “Farewell Address” delivered in 1796. Washington warned of the dangers of getting involved in European conflicts and the negative impact it could have on the U.S.

“Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation?” Washington said in his farewell speech. “Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor or caprice?”

“It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements,” the first president said. “I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense. But, in my opinion, it is unnecessary and would be unwise to extend them,” the speech continued.

Massie has a history of urging the U.S. to leave NATO. On at least two occasions, he has voted against congressional resolutions affirming support for the alliance.

In June 2017, Massie voted against a resolution pledging U.S. support for NATO's mutual defense agreement. The resolution was sponsored by House leadership at the time, including then-Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), then-House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), and then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).

“The move to expand NATO in Eastern Europe is unwise and unaffordable,” Massie told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2017. He said the 2017 proposed resolution “was in direct conflict with President Trump's campaign assertion that NATO is obsolete.”

WHAT TRUMP'S SECURITY STRATEGY MEANS FOR EUROPE

He voted against another congressional resolution urging support for NATO in 2022, to “uphold the founding democratic principles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and establish a Center for Democratic Resilience within the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.”

“NATO is a relic of the Cold War,” Massie said on social media at the time. “Why should Americans pay for Europe's defense?”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson blasted Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) during an interview on CNN's The Source with Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday night. 

Wilson said Mace acted like an “entitled, spoiled brat” during an incident at the Charleston International Airport on Oct. 30, in which she reportedly berated law enforcement officials and Transportation Security Administration staff. Mace had called the accusations false, denying that she used inappropriate language with airport officials, and said the report was partly “falsified.”

“There are half a dozen people who gave reports, I mean statements, that she used, I mean they're all saying the same thing,” Wilson said in response to a question asked by Collins about Mace's denial. “Is everyone lying and she telling the truth?”

“And it's not just this one incident,” Wilson added. “Apparently, there's a handful of incidents over the last year where she is cussing out TSA, cussing out security. This is something that goes back, not just this past month, but for the last year. At the end of the day, she's saying things that are delusional, and this basically reminds me of a spoiled brat, an entitled, spoiled brat.”

Mace was accused of using foul language at airport officials during an incident in October over what was considered a communication error, in which she was briefly delayed in getting a security escort at Charleston International Airport in South Carolina. According to the police report from that day, police officers eventually connected with Mace at a TSA entrance, where they found her “very irate.” 

“During the entire escort, Rep. Mace was talking loudly, using profanity at times for others to hear,” read the police report. “It appeared she was either dictating a message into her phone or talking to someone about the situation.”

Earlier this week, while also appearing on CNN, Mace criticized the report of her exchange with airport officers, calling it a political “hit job” and partly “falsified.”

“Part of the report was actually falsified,” Mace said regarding the report. “We asked for all the video, all the audio, everything, all the body cam. And the video that was released yesterday showed me asking TSA agents for help and for assistance. And conveniently, there is no audio that goes with it.”

“I do take responsibility for my words. I always have, but the idea that I would call somebody an idiot. I have never done that in my life,” Mace added. “And to me, it was an incredible hit job. It was effective. It was a very effective political hit job, but that's all that it was.”

POLICE INVESTIGATION FINDS NANCY MACE CAUSED ‘SPECTACLE' AT SOUTH CAROLINA AIRPORT

Mace also alleged Wilson might have been behind the controversy surrounding the report. She was asked on CNN if Wilson and the Charleston Airport Police Department collaborated.

“Oh, 100%,” Mace replied.

“Six minutes after they released the falsified reports, he had a news release and a press thing on social media,” the congresswoman said. “It was a very effective political hit job, but I'm not going to sit here and allow the mainstream media to allow the press to concoct a story.”

Wilson has been South Carolina's attorney general since 2011. He announced his candidacy for governor of South Carolina in June 2025. In August 2025, Mace also announced her candidacy for governor of South Carolina.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Small-c conservatism is still a point of pride in the state.

The Indiana legislature does not keep its constituents at a great distance. As lawmakers convened in Indianapolis on Monday to consider a bill backed by President Donald Trump to redraw the state's congressional map, all that separated them from protesters who had gathered in a corridor just outside the capitol chamber was a series of glass windows. Inside the room, chants of “Just vote no!” and “We want fair maps!” could be heard as clearly as the legislative debate.

In an era when politicians typically operate at arm's length from their voters, the public's easy access to elected representatives is refreshing. In Indiana this week, it's also a bit jarring. The state Senate is meeting under threat. Trump and his allies have vowed to target Republican lawmakers who vote against a redistricting plan that could wipe out the state's Democratic congressional representation, protecting the U.S. House GOP majority. Over the past several weeks, Republican state legislators have faced a wave of “swatting” incidents, bomb threats, and other anonymous acts of intimidation, leading some to worry about their personal safety. The current climate of fear in Indiana, lawmakers in both parties told me, is without modern precedent in the state.

“We can have an argument and still be nice,” Mike Gaskill, the Republican chair of the senate's elections committee, said as he opened a hearing on the redistricting bill. It was a plea as much as a declaration.

Indiana Republicans have been targeted because a number of them have done something that few others in the party, either in Washington, D.C., or in state capitals across the country, have dared to do: They have stood up to Trump. The administration launched its redistricting campaign over the summer in Texas, where GOP legislators quickly signed on to a plan to gerrymander the state's congressional map to flip as many as five Democratic U.S. House seats. Republicans in Missouri and North Carolina acceded to similar White House demands.

In Indiana, the GOP holds the governorship and a supermajority in both chambers of the legislature. But from the outset, Republicans in the state Senate have resisted the president's push. Two visits from Vice President J. D. Vance failed to secure enough support, and last month, the Senate voted to reject Governor Mike Braun's call to hold a special session this month to consider a redistricting proposal.

Under intense pressure from the White House—Trump has singled out Indiana legislators by name in Truth Social posts—the state Senate president pro tempore, Rodric Bray, reversed course shortly before Thanksgiving and announced that the chamber would return to Indianapolis this week to consider a redistricting bill passed by the state House. Whether the president's threats of retribution ultimately succeed should become clear today, when the Indiana Senate holds a final vote on a new congressional map drawn to give Republicans all nine seats—they currently hold seven—in the state's U.S. House delegation.

The outcome is a mystery even to the highest-ranking Republicans in Indiana. Senators whose votes could be decisive have kept quiet, seeking to buy as much time as possible and avoid making themselves the target of even more harassment. When the elections committee approved the bill on Monday, teeing it up for today's floor vote, three of the Republicans who supported the proposed map cautioned that they were pushing it forward only “for additional vetting” and that they could change their minds. “I'm going to continue listening to my constituents,” one of those Republicans, Linda Rogers, told me afterward. She said public opinion in her district, along the state's northern border, was split “pretty equal” between supporters and opponents. Top Republicans in Washington, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and James Blair, the White House deputy chief of staff, have been calling and texting Indiana holdouts this week in hopes of flipping their votes.

The committee vote followed a marathon hearing in which senators heard four hours of testimony from more than 100 members of the public, the large majority of whom urged Republicans to stand strong and defeat the redistricting bill. “It's not just politics. It's a calculated assault on fair representation,” Ethan Hatcher, a local radio host who said that he voted for Trump in each of the past two presidential elections, told the committee as cheers erupted from the demonstrators listening outside the chamber.

In the hearing's closing moments, Senator Greg Walker, a Republican, described the harassment he received after declaring his early opposition to redistricting, including an unsolicited pizza delivery and a separate incident in which heavily armed police responded to a false emergency call to his home. He said he was fortunate, because unlike other Republicans subjected to such swatting attempts, he did not have small children who might have been traumatized by the scene. “I refuse to be intimidated,” Walker said, reaffirming his intent to vote no. Through tears, he described having held a friend's newborn the night before and worrying about the world the child would inherit. “I fear for this institution,” Walker said. “I fear for the state of Indiana. And I fear for all states if we allow threats and intimidation to become the norm.”

Over the past few days, I've asked both Republicans and Democrats here to explain why Indiana has become the new hotbed of GOP resistance to Trump. It is not the only state to rebuff the president's redistricting demands; Kansas Republicans also have been unable to muster the votes for gerrymandering, and success in Florida is not assured. But no state has faced the White House–directed onslaught that Indiana has.

I received several answers. Most, however, said that the push for mid-decade redistricting simply ran afoul of the small-c conservatism on which many Indiana Republican legislators still pride themselves. “Midwesterners being midwestern,” one anti-redistricting advocate replied with a shrug outside the senate chamber. Republicans told me that state Senate opponents of redrawing the maps tended to be more institutionalist than MAGA, echoing a divide that still crops up among the party's lawmakers in Washington. “I'm such a rule follower, it's not even funny,” Walker said during his committee speech on Monday.

Read: ‘None of this is good for Republicans'

Democrats told me that many Republican senators in Indiana remained far more pragmatic than their counterparts in Congress have become during the Trump era. In this, they have more in common with Indiana Republicans from an earlier era, such as former Governor Mitch Daniels (a public opponent of redistricting) and the late Senator Richard Lugar, who was known for his friendship with President Barack Obama. Senators have clashed with Republican governors (including former Vice President Mike Pence) over other national flash-point issues such as abortion and gay rights. Most of what they debate, however, draws little interest from the president and his allies. “A lot of these people are not die-hard partisans,” Nick Roberts, a 25-year-old member of the Indianapolis city council, told me. Roberts has spoken out against the redistricting plan and is the only Democrat known to have received threats as a result.

The debate on Monday was notably more collegial than the acrimonious exchanges that have proliferated in Congress. Democrats are largely powerless in the Indiana legislature, holding just 10 out of the senate's 50 seats. But they effusively praised Gaskill, a redistricting supporter and staunch Trump backer, for his handling of the hearing even as they encouraged their colleagues to continue bucking the president. “He does not care about Republicans in Indiana. He does not care about Republican senators,” Senator Fady Qaddoura, a Democrat representing part of Indianapolis, said of Trump during the hearing. “And if you stand in his way, he will destroy you.” Then he said to Republicans: “I pray for you. I pray for your safety.”

In the lead-up to Thanksgiving, opponents of redistricting believed that the pressure campaign was fading. A significant bloc of Republicans had joined with Democrats to reject a special legislative session demanded by Trump and called by the governor. But then Bray announced that, indeed, the state Senate would return this month to vote on any redistricting bill passed by the state House, where GOP support for the proposal has been stronger. “Getting that call was a call no one wanted to get,” Shelli Yoder, Indiana's Senate Democratic leader, told me. “We really wanted to turn that page.”

The lobbying intensified once again. Turning Point Action, a political arm of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, declared that it would help raise more than $10 million to spend in primaries against GOP legislators in Indiana who vote against redistricting. As Republicans filed into the chamber yesterday to continue debating the bill, Senator Dan Dernulc told a colleague that he had received a bomb threat to his home the night before. In a brief interview, he would not say how he planned to vote today but declared that the threat would not move him. “I'm going to do what's right and let the chips fall where they may,” Dernulc said.

Senator Sue Glick, a Republican opponent of redistricting, received a text from Blair, the senior Trump aide, shortly before the floor debate began yesterday, she told me. Earlier this week, she answered a call that she thought was coming from one of her aides. “Hello, Jim,” she said. “No,” the caller replied, “this is Mike Johnson from Washington.” Perplexed, Glick asked him, “And who are you with?” He replied that he was the speaker of the House. “You know,” Glick joked to me, “I'm from the sticks.”

Glick said that she and Johnson had a cordial conversation, but she would not back the bill. “There's no good reason for this,” she said, commenting that it was “ridiculous” that Indiana had been dragged into a Washington fight that the state did not want. Glick said emails and phone calls from her constituents were running overwhelmingly against the redistricting plan. Backers of the bill have accused Democrats of orchestrating a public outcry—a charge Glick dismissed. In her district, she said, a meeting of the Democratic county committee could be held “in the phone booth behind the courthouse. There's not that many Democrats.” When I asked her about Trump's threats to launch a primary challenge against Republicans such as her, she replied: “That's fine. I trust the people to make the right decision.”

Read: The Trump steamroller is broken

There were other signs that the White House's strong-arm tactics were backfiring. After Trump used a slur demeaning people with disabilities late last month against the governor of Minnesota, State Senator Mike Bohacek, a Republican who has a daughter with Down syndrome, called out the president and reaffirmed his opposition to the proposal. A rally held last week by Turning Point Action at the statehouse in Indianapolis drew a paltry crowd compared with demonstrations organized by redistricting opponents.

Threats of primary challenges are more potent in Indiana state House races, where lawmakers are up for reelection every two years and will face a filing deadline early next year. Only half of the senators will be on the ballot next year, and a number of Republicans in the chamber have already announced their retirement. GOP senators also have reason to doubt that either Trump or his allies will follow through on promised spending in the coming years, particularly for those whose next election isn't until 2028. “The idea that Trump would be spending political capital not just four months from now, but two and a- half years from now, individually targeting Indiana senators who defied them on one vote? Just crazy,” Roberts said. By 2028, “they will have bigger fish to fry.”

As the week wore on, opponents of redistricting grew cautiously optimistic that the state Senate would defeat the bill. One Republican critic told me that they were confident the legislation would fail, but added: “I don't want to say anything that's going to jeopardize the vote.” Another, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of how sensitive the debate had become, told me that “if anything,” the heavy-handed tactics had made Republican senators “dig in their heels a little bit.” The senator, who opposes redistricting, said that as he was driving to Indianapolis on Monday, he was worried about how many “no” votes would flip to “yes.” But as he began talking with his colleagues, he realized they were holding firm. Later today, he and the rest of the country will find out exactly how much arm-twisting Indiana Republicans can withstand.

AI has changed the hiring process, and one way to stand out is to be as human as possible

To anyone who doesn't dream of labor, the idea of a personality hire — a person who gets jobs because they're a fun, unique human to be around — can be a bit jarring. And there's an idea that might be even more puzzling than the existence of personality hires: that these people can teach us valuable lessons about being hired today. It would behoove us to start thinking about the job process through the eyes of a charming, pleasant, fun, distinctly human personality hire.

Let me explain.

Statistically, today's job market is not great. But more than that, the inevitable creep of AI has made the process of applying for jobs even more of a headache than it was before. Never has the application felt more crapshooty (and crappy), when it seems like so many recruiters and employers are using AI to sift through applicants. The idea that someone's life-changing opportunity could all depend on the way a computer responds to a prompt feels equal parts dehumanizing and maddening.

Even more demoralizing is when you realize how fickle and faulty AI can be.

A study from researchers at Columbia Business School tested three generative AI models — GPT-3, GPT-4, and Llama 3.1 — and found that, when there are multiple options (i.e., a person in HR plugging in multiple candidates), the AI models can show “order bias” and will default to the first option (candidate) listed. Olivier Toubia, a professor at Columbia Business School and one of the authors of the study, talked to me about the worrying results and also shed light on how he thinks we can be more successful in the wake of an AI-powered job market.

Essentially, the more the job market turns to AI, the more we should think about how to be more human to stand out. And, at least to my mind, no one may do that better than personality hires. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Olivier, the impression I'm getting is that there are parts of the job market where both employers or recruiters as well as applicants are using AI. Recruiters are using AI to screen resumes, while candidates are feeding their resumes and CVs to the machines to better their chances. 

Yes, we're starting to see applications of AI for hiring and for screening candidates. We're starting to see AI agents processing CVs, and actually I think that's a bit concerning.

I'd assume that jobs are important and people don't necessarily want a machine making that very crucial decision versus a human. Tell me about your research. 

What we found in our research is that [if you're using AI], the way you order the options may influence the results. If you say, Here's A, B, and C, which one do you think is more qualified? It turns out that the way you ask the question and the way you label and order the options [the candidates being recruited] is actually going to influence the results.

We found systematically that which one is labeled A versus B versus C, and how we order them impacts the choice that GPT makes.

So people could be picked for an interview or a job just because they were entered as the first option, and AI may be more likely to go for the first option just based on numerical order. 

Yes, and I think it could be a bit dangerous because you could actually end up with the results that are going to be driven by pure random factors. What was the order of the candidate on the list as opposed to the actual qualities of the candidates? That's one issue.

We also found that there's potential stereotypes or biases that might come up. Maybe some candidates might be judged as being more or less worthy based on characteristics that should not be considered, [like] identity, gender, ethnicity, age, or other factors. There's the risk of possible biases, social biases, and just also idiosyncratic biases. That's just one issue of using AI as a recruiting tool.

How concerning is that for you? I don't hire people. I don't fire people. That's not my job. That said, to me, I think it sounds alarming that AI could be basing such a crucial decision about my future based on what order I was entered into a system. 

Generative AI is impressive. It's able to solve complex mathematical problems. It's able to write poetry. It's able to do things that only very smart humans will be able to do. So because of that, we tend to think that gen AI is superhuman. But it's not like a human brain. It's a very different architecture.

We want to assume that we can trust Gen AI, and that we don't need to worry about simple errors that it could make. So that's why maybe we tend to turn a blind eye on this. And I'm actually surprised that not more people are aware of these biases. It's an inconvenient truth.

I want to ask you about the idea that AI “levels the playing field” at work. 

That's been a debate, in academia and in practice, of augmentation versus automation. Is AI going to make us more productive? Is AI going to automate us? Is it going to level the playing field or is it going to actually amplify differences? I think so far we don't have a lot of evidence that really leads to very clear conclusions.

My own take on this is that in many cases, it might level the playing field and indeed helps people who maybe have less skills and less experience perform similarly to those who have more. It can level the playing field among humans. But then the issue is: could an AI then do the job without humans at all?

Right. If you're totally reliant on AI, then what exactly are you doing? 

Generative AI may level the playing field, but AI is also going to replace humans because if AI can do well enough, then why would anyone hire a human and pay a human to do something that AI can do well enough?

That's depressing. 

Yeah, I know. In my opinion, the people who are going to “win” with AI are the ones who are going to use AI as a source of differentiation to differentiate themselves. And there's two ways to differentiate yourself. There's vertical and horizontal.

Tell me more. 

Vertical means being better. So basically: Those [who] are going to use AI to be better than they are without AI, but also better than other people with AI, and also even better than AI without humans. If you have the skills and the experience and use AI to be the best performing agent, then I think that's going to become actually more desirable on the job market.

And what does “horizontal” mean? 

It means being different. It's more about having a unique personality, unique points of view, and then maybe using AI to really express your ideas and your views in more compelling ways.

If the job market is people using machines to look for candidates and people using the same machines to look for new jobs, then it sort of becomes two machines talking to each other, right? One of the few differences between candidates may be having personality, right? 

I see some use cases where maybe people use AI to create more compelling work products that actually are going to really showcase their unique ideas and personalities and points of view. And that I think is another area in which maybe AI could actually help humans. If you're using AI, you want to use AI to differentiate yourself either by being better or by being different.

That's interesting: Being different could be as important as being better?

It's two different pathways in some cases. It's not like one is above the other. It's more like there are two ways that are not exclusive in which people can differentiate themselves.

Do you have an example of a field that values horizontal strength? 

Any field that has to do with creativity, opinions, and personal connections. Any field where it helps to really have a connection with your audience. Maybe some consulting industries and creative industries where people will pay for unique insights, unique perspectives, unique points of view that are very sharp and distinct from others.

People have always told me that when you write cover letters, you need to make sure to stand out and tell whoever is reading why they need to choose you. That seems like it's more important than ever in this job market. We have to really let ourselves shine through, otherwise we risk getting lost in the shuffle. 

Yeah. I told my students, “Don't be afraid to make yourself heard. Stand out, even be annoying — be a human.” You want to actually stand out.

Be annoying.

Okay, maybe not when you write your cover letter, but in life, you want to stand out. You want people to notice you; you want to have something to say. If you just blend in, then you will just be replaced by AI.

By the way, there's now also AI tools to help you with live interviews when you're on Zoom. There's an AI that is actually helping you answer questions live. So you basically have to have the person live in front of you in your office with no electronics to be able to really test them

The whole idea just makes me sad? But it also kind of makes me a little hopeful that maybe the only way to succeed is to be a person. 

I think I'm with you.

Republicans are also quitting in droves.

For most of this year, Republican members of the House of Representatives seemed to move in lockstep with President Donald Trump, not hesitating to back him on controversial measures on immigration and the economy.

But now they seem to be breaking ranks.

Some Republican members of Congress have stood up to Trump on the release of the Epstein Files, tariffs, health care subsidies, boat strikes in the Caribbean, and other issues.

They've voiced frustration with House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has let Trump set the agenda for Congress even as the president's approval rating continues to decline.

Some GOP members of the House, fed up with partisan gridlock, stalled legislation, and threats of political violence, are just calling it quits altogether. They're either retiring or resigning to seek other offices.

The GOP could potentially lose its razor-thin margin even before the midterms. Once Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene officially resigns in January, Republicans will only have a one-seat advantage.

Today, Explained's Astead Herndon talked to Leigh Ann Caldwell, chief Washington correspondent for Puck News, about what's causing the House GOP exodus and what it could mean for the party in power.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

In the last few weeks we've heard quite a few Congress people say they're going to retire, even resign. What is the scope of this angst in Congress? What's the source of it?

The scope could be pretty big. I'm hearing from Republican sources, lawmakers, aides, and people close to these people who are expecting a lot more retirement announcements in the coming weeks.

There are so many reasons for it, but the most immediate is the political environment. It's been a really tough fall for Republicans. They had completely underperformed in those November elections. There was a special election in Tennessee in a very red district that Trump won by 22 points. The Republican who won only won by nine points.

It's just another data point of the political environment and the mood of the country around Republicans right now. People are looking at that and seeing the writing on the wall and believing that the House Republicans are not going to be in the majority after the midterms, that they'll lose the majority. And it's not a very fun place to be.

The thing about serving in the House is you get to reevaluate your life every two years, and we're in that season where people, Republicans especially, are deciding if it's worth it. And I'm told that many more Republicans are going to say that it's not.

Does your reporting give you any sense of numbers and how we can compare that possible number to ones we've seen previously?

An estimate that one source told me was that close to 20 more Republicans are set to retire.

That's a seismic number.

It is. We're already at 23 Republicans who have announced. So it also talks about the mood of the Congress. People are just not happy right now.

Are Democrats retiring in these types of numbers? And when they are quitting, is it for the same reasons?

Democrats are retiring too. It happens every year. But the numbers are lower for Democrats and the reasons are different. For the Democrats, most of them are in their late seventies or eighties, or they have served for decades. Nancy Pelosi is one of the Democrats who is retiring.

Jerry Nadler in New York.

It's different on the Republican side. Troy Nehls was elected in 2020. Morgan Luttrell of Texas just started serving in 2023. He's young. A lot of members who are younger, who haven't been here that long, are deciding to call it quits. And that is really what's different.

Republicans have had tough moments before. Donald Trump has been unpopular before. What is it about this year, in this time, or the next midterm that might've been different than just general other bouts of Trump controversy?

This term, Donald Trump has so much control over this Congress. They govern in fear. They do what he says because they're afraid. Marjorie Taylor Greene said on 60 Minutes: “I think they're terrified to step out of line and get a nasty Truth Social post on them.”

Threats of political violence have only increased, and everyone knows that if your name is in a Truth Social and negatively, there will be an uptick for that person. These members have been dealing with that for a long time, and that has led to retirements in the past. The ability to be an independent member of Congress has really, really diminished, and people are feeling that. They are frustrated with Speaker Johnson. They think that he is playing into the demands of the president rather than what the members want and need. They were frustrated that they were out of town for seven weeks during the government shutdown.

It's also one of the least productive Congresses in modern history. The last Congress was really unproductive, and this one is way more unproductive. In the last Congress, over two years, 274 bills were signed into law. We're one year into this Congress. Only 47 bills have been signed into law, and that's big legislation and small resolutions. They are just not doing anything and legislators get frustrated. Many of them actually come to legislate and when they're not able to deliver for their district, when they're not able to take home wins and projects and money, people are asking themselves, what is the point?

What is Speaker Johnson doing about this? It would seem that if these retirements continue, he would have a little bit of a crisis on his hands. And even when we think about things like redistricting efforts and others, he has really chosen to be on the side of Donald Trump 120 percent. How has that blowback impacted his own caucus? And when they're upset with him, what exactly is the reason why?

They obviously don't want to see a lot of retirements because it just looks bad. It's an indictment of Congress, of the job. It's also an indictment on Speaker Johnson if he's unable to keep these members happy, unable to make them feel that they are productive members of society, productive legislators, and that's just not happening right now. People are really down.

The speakership seems like such a difficult job, because it's eaten up the last several Republican GOP speakers. If we think about that role as one that holds together many different parts of the Republican party, is it always just destined to be this fraught? Or is that a consequence of our current Congress and polarization? What is the universe that Mike Johnson makes it out on the other side here with a united GOP?

I think every day that becomes a harder and harder task for him, especially when you look at polling. Trump's approval ratings continue to fall. They're divided on a message. They're divided on how to deal with health care and the affordability issue. And so Speaker Johnson coming out on the other side with a united GOP? Maybe, but it's going to be wounded and exhausted and tired and really cranky. And so the question is, if they don't win the majority, what does Speaker Johnson do? There are definitely going to be leadership changes. And so there could be a huge shakeup among House Republicans after the midterms.

After all that talk about Democrats and their kind of fractured state, there are certainly some cracks that seem to be appearing on the Republican side too.

Absolutely. And Republicans are really worried about how the party is dealing with these trying times right now for them.

How one community figured out how to reduce fire threats — and their insurance rates.

Earlier this month, the real-estate listing site Zillow ended a subtle social experiment. In 2024, they began to embed climate risk data directly in their property profiles, scoring a home's future risks from flood, wildfire, wind, heat, and air quality on a 1-to-10 scale.

Say you are looking for a home in your budget for your growing family, and you find the perfect three-bedroom Cape Cod house — but it's close to a shoreline. Zillow's property listing might show that it has a nine out of 10 flood risk score. Depending on your personal risk tolerance, that might rule out the house for you.

Including this information seemed like an obvious move for Zillow. Disasters worsened by warming are contributing to multibillion-dollar damages to homes, and the site's competitors, such as Redfin, already feature climate risk information in their listings.

“Climate risks are now a critical factor in home-buying decisions,” Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow, said in a statement last year.

Zillow's own data proved that many homebuyers were indeed starting to think more about climate change alongside square footage, nearby schools, and curb appeal — so much so that real estate agencies and sellers complained that the climate risk scores were starting to hurt sales.

Which is kind of the point.

Giving homebuyers a sense of where warming temperatures could lead to a higher chance of a wildfire or flood should ideally steer people away from properties facing greater danger. Over time, people would buy safer homes — and if they chose to buy in riskier areas, at least they were forewarned and could boost their insurance policies.

But climate risk assessments are not great if your current house has a bad score, and you're trying to sell it. Under pressure from real estate groups, Zillow stopped including them. The climate risks, of course, haven't gone away.

Welcome to the “la, la, la, can't hear you” climate era.

In many parts of the US, populations are still increasing in areas vulnerable to disasters such as floods, extreme heat, drought, and fires, while the federal government under President Donald Trump is removing references to climate change from government websites.

People, too, will cover their eyes when the climate reality threatens real estate prices. Clear Lake, Texas, for example, installed signs showing the potential high water mark from storm surge after Hurricane Ike in 2011, but when locals complained that the warnings were hurting sales, the signs were taken down. In 2012, North Carolina outlawed a forecast of sea level rise that showed that many more coastal properties were at risk of flooding over the next century, in favor of adopting a forecast that only looked 30 years ahead.

Yet, while sellers might want to overlook future risks, banks, insurance companies, and buyers don't want to lose money on what is often their single-most expensive purchase. More costly disaster damages are also taking a bigger bite out of the $55 trillion US residential housing market as a whole.

“I don't think this is a good thing for anyone but Zillow — people need to know more about their risk, not less,” said Marc Ragin, a researcher studying disaster risk at the University of Georgia, in an email.

Anticipating future threats worsened by climate change is not just about creating warnings, though; they can be useful tools for adapting to climate change. One community that took them seriously actually saved money by lowering their property insurance rates. Here's how.

Wildfires regularly confront the communities around Lake Tahoe in Nevada and California. Though the flames rarely make it into neighborhoods, the basin is often bathed in choking smoke from nearby blazes, and residents are starting to realize that it's only a matter of time before they will face an inferno up close.

The Tahoe Fund, a nonprofit, took an unflinching look at the wildfire risks in the area and launched a pilot project this year to create “the most fire-ready community in Tahoe.” They laid out their process in a playbook for reducing fire risks that they hope any place looking to reduce the odds of homes going up in flames could draw on.

They began with a homeowners association in pine-forested Incline Village, Nevada — home to 9,000 people — where the average home price is $1.4 million. The association, Tyrolian Village, is composed of 228 homes. Using a mix of fire risk models, the Tahoe Fund team identified the areas most primed to burn. The models they used were more sophisticated than those used on real estate sites and more tailored to the community, but it helped the team get more bang for their buck when it came to figuring out what tactics would best improve the neighborhood's fire resilience.

“Through technology, you don't necessarily need to do everything,” said Amy Berry, who leads the Tahoe Fund. “You need to do the things that are the most important that are going to have the biggest impact on lowering risk.”

They then reached out to community leaders to set priorities for measures like reducing fuel loads in public areas, building defensible spaces, and making homes more fire-resistant, drawing on public funds and private donations. The pilot project also gave homeowners individual fire risk assessments and to-do lists, offering grants to spur owners of the highest-priority homes to act.

The effort is already starting to produce results. Another nearby neighborhood, the McCloud Condominium Homeowners Association, saw its home insurance premiums drop by one-third. Berry said that this kind of targeted risk reduction could be applied in many places.

Insurance looms in the background of any discussion of disasters. In California, insurance companies have been dropping customers whose wildfire risks were too hot to handle. In states like Florida and Louisiana, some private insurers have stopped insuring new properties, gone bankrupt, or left the market entirely. The federally backed National Flood Insurance Program is continually losing billions of dollars. So, a project that measurably reduces risks is encouraging.

Yet, there are still many people in the community who are reluctant to grapple with the threats they face. “We emailed everyone. We sent postcards. We said open your reports, so you know what to do, and only 50 [percent] of the homeowners have opened their reports,” Berry said.

It's also important to remember that risk forecasts aren't guarantees, and climate change isn't the only factor at play. Plenty of homes that aren't in established flood zones still flood, while some in high-risk areas have kept their basements dry. The same goes for homes inside and outside high fire-risk zones.

Still, having even a vague sense of where risks to property are higher and lower can be useful for planning things like storm drains and seawalls. Individual homebuyers could start to include climate risk assessments in their home inspections, checking structures for fire-resistant materials and water runoff alongside termite damage and cracks in the foundation.

But, that requires buyers to realize these perils are out there. Past research showed that another driver of real estate prices in vulnerable areas was belief in climate change. Homes in at-risk communities where people took threats of rising temperatures seriously sold for less than in flood zones where residents did not think climate change was a problem.

People also quickly forget the lessons of past disasters, often rebuilding and expanding in an area that's flooded or burned. And it's even harder to get people to adapt to things that they've never experienced before.

So, while forecasting climate change and adapting to emerging threats are still immense challenges, the biggest hurdle is human behavior, getting people to actually engage with the dangers they face. Hiding this information can only help sellers for a little while before the bill comes due.

A Ukrainian brigade has released footage of one of its uncrewed ground vehicles opening fire on a Russian armored personnel carrier, offering a rare glimpse at the emerging technology in action.

The 5th Separate Assault Brigade said on Wednesday that it deployed a Droid TW 12.7 — a remotely operated tracked system developed by a Ukrainian defense tech company — on a road deemed likely to be a route for advancing Russian troops.

The brigade said that the ground-based drone later encountered a Russian MT-LB, a lightly armored fighting vehicle often used to transport infantry.

Thermal footage filmed at night from the uncrewed ground vehicle, or UGV, shows it opening fire on the vehicle, its operator swerving a targeting reticle across the MT-LB's front.

Business Insider could neither independently verify when nor where the footage was filmed.

The Droid TW 12.7 is equipped with an M2 Browning machine gun that fires .50 caliber rounds, which would typically pierce an MT-LB's armor.

The 5th Brigade said it used armor-piercing incendiary rounds for the mission.

Sparks fly from the armored vehicle's chassis as it slows to a crawl and drifts in front of the UGV, which continues firing point-blank.

""The 12.7 mm bullets punch through the MT-LB's side, striking the crew and onboard systems,"" a narrator said in the 5th Brigade's video, referring to the metric measurement for .50 caliber bullets.

The MT-LB appears to be aimlessly crawling past the drone, indicating that its driver is incapacitated or its controls are damaged.

The UGV then pivots and begins firing on the rear of the MT-LB, ""killing the infantry in the troop compartment,"" the narrator said.

The 5th Brigade said that it found in the morning that the MT-LB crew and their passengers were ""completely wiped out,"" publishing short clips of the aftermath shot by a first-person-view aerial drone.

Wednesday's published footage provides insight into how UGVs are increasingly used on the battlefield in Ukraine, where troops on both sides are experimenting with ground drones to perform missions that human soldiers must otherwise conduct.

While official statistics show that uncrewed aerial vehicles still dominated the drone warfare space last month, the spread of UGVs offers a possible future where Kyiv can rely on remotely operated systems for ground operations instead of risking its troops.

This year, Ukraine said that it aims to manufacture and deploy at least 15,000 UGVs across the battlefield.

Ukrainian and Russian teams have developed hundreds of such systems, ranging from buggies that can ferry provisions near the front lines to trucks outfitted with remotely operated machine guns.

The 5th brigade and DevDroid, the company that makes the Droid TW 12.7, did not respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Americans barely own gold — and that means prices could climb even further, Goldman says","https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/gold-price-today-us-ownership-upside-goldman-sachs-outlook-forecast-2025-12","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 07:13:00 GMT","

Gold's record rally this year has grabbed headlines, but American investors barely own any of it, which means the yellow metal's price could have more room to run, according to Goldman Sachs.

Even with gold hitting repeated highs, US ownership hasn't budged much. Gold ETF exposure is still six basis points, or 0.06 percentage points, below its 2012 peak since the launch of gold ETFs in the mid-2000s, according to Goldman's analysis published on Wednesday.

The low gold allocation is simply because ""portfolio growth has outpaced gains in gold prices and volumes over the past decade,"" Goldman's analysts wrote.

And while gold has surged to new all-time highs in 2025, Goldman's analysis shows that the rally hasn't translated into meaningful increases in actual US ownership.

Gold ETFs make up just 0.17% of private US financial portfolios as of the second quarter — a microscopic slice of the roughly $112 trillion Americans hold in stocks and bonds, according to Goldman's analysis.

Goldman's data also shows that fewer than half of large US institutions managing over $100 million hold any gold ETF position at all. Among those that do, allocations typically sit between 0.1% and 0.5%. For major long-term investors, only about 0.2% of their portfolios are in gold.

Despite the social media buzz around Costco gold bars and US Mint coin sales, the report notes that physical gold demand in the US is tiny compared with ETF flows — just 11 to 15 metric tons year-to-date, versus roughly 400 tons of net ETF buying.

That low ownership stands in sharp contrast to recommendations coming from major market voices, including Citi, UBS, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, advising investors to add gold to their portfolios.

The gap between those recommendations and reality is exactly what Goldman says could push gold's next leg higher.

The bank estimates that every 1-basis-point, or 0.01 percentage point, increase in gold's share of US financial portfolios would push gold prices up by about 1.4%.

Goldman argues that if households or institutions meaningfully boosted their gold exposure as a diversifier — especially amid global macro uncertainty, including concerns about the fiscal outlook — such inflows could ""substantially raise prices"" in the small gold market.

The bank forecasts gold to reach $4,900 by the end of 2026, but says that forecast carries ""significant upside risk"" if private-sector buying broadens beyond the central banks that have dominated demand in recent years.

The spot gold price hit a record high near $4,400 per troy ounce in late October and has since pulled back to around $4,220 per ounce. Prices are up 60% so far this year.

In this article

The Walt Disney Co. on Thursday announced it will make a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI and will allow users to make videos with its copyrighted characters on its Sora app.

OpenAI launched Sora in September, and it allows users to create short videos by simply typing in a prompt. 

As part of the startup's new three-year licensing agreement with Disney, Sora users will be able make content with more than 200 characters across Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars starting next year. 

""The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works,"" Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a statement.

As part of the agreement, Disney said it will receive warrants to purchase additional equity and will become a major OpenAI customer. 

Disney is deploying OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, to its employees and will work with its technology to build new tools and experiences, according to a release. 

When Sora launched this fall, the app rocketed to the top of Apple's App Store and generated a storm of controversy as users flooded the platform with videos of popular brands and characters. 

The Motion Picture Association said in October that OpenAI needed to take ""immediate and decisive action"" to prevent copyright infringement on Sora. 

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said more ""granular control"" over character generation was coming, according to a blog post following the launch.

As AI startups have rapidly changed the way that people can interact with content online, media companies, including Disney, have kicked off a series of fresh legal battles to try and protect their intellectual property.

Disney sent a cease and desist letter to Google late on Wednesday alleging the company infringed its copyrights on a ""massive scale."" In the letter, which was viewed by CNBC, Disney said Google has been using its copyrighted works to train models and distributing copies of its protected content without authorization.

CNBC has reached out to Google for comment on the letter.

Universal and Disney have sued the AI image creator Midjourney, alleging that the company improperly used and distributed AI-generated characters from their movies. Disney also sent a cease and desist letter to Character.AI in September, warning the startup to stop using its copyrighted characters without authorization.

Disney's deal with OpenAI suggests the company isn't ruling out AI platforms entirely.

The companies said they have affirmed a commitment to the use of AI that ""protects user safety and the rights of creators"" and ""respects the creative industries,"" according to the release. 

OpenAI has also agreed to maintain ""robust controls"" to prevent illegal or harmful content from being generated on its platforms. 

Some of the characters available through the deal include Mickey Mouse, Ariel, Cinderella, Iron Man and Darth Vader. Disney and OpenAI said the agreement does not include any talent likeness or voices. 

Users will also be able to draw from the same intellectual property while using ChatGPT Images, where they can use natural language prompts to create images. 

""Disney is the global gold standard for storytelling, and we're excited to partner to allow Sora and ChatGPT Images to expand the way people create and experience great content,"" Altman said in a statement.

Curated selections of Sora videos will also be available to watch on Disney's streaming platform Disney+.

The Walt Disney Company's $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI will serve as ""a way in"" to artificial intelligence, which will have a significant long-term impact on Disney's business, Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Thursday.

""We want to participate in what Sam is creating, what his team is creating,"" Iger said. ""We think this is a good investment for the company.""

Disney announced its investment in OpenAI as part of an agreement on Thursday that will allow users to make AI videos with its copyrighted characters on the startup's app called Sora. 

More than 200 characters, including Mickey Mouse, Darth Vader and Cinderella, will be available on the platform through a three-year licensing agreement, which Iger said would be exclusive to OpenAI at the beginning of the term.

As new AI products have exploded into the mainstream, several media companies, including Disney, have taken legal action in an effort to safeguard their intellectual property. 

Iger said Disney has been ""aggressive"" at protecting its IP, but he has been ""extremely impressed"" with OpenAI's growth as well as their willingness to license content. 

""No human generation has ever stood in the way of technological advance, and we don't intend to try,"" Iger said. ""We've always felt that if it's going to happen, including disruption of our current business models, then we should get on board.""

Shares of Disney are up more than 1% on Thursday.

Barton Crockett, a senior internet media research analyst, told CNBC that Disney's investment is ""a great endorsement for OpenAI."" 

He said it's important for companies like Disney to understand the importance of user-generated and AI-generated content.

""I think it's crucial for a content-creation company, like Disney, to get ahead of that,"" he said.

OpenAI launched Sora in September, and the short-form video app allows people to generate content by simply typing in a prompt. 

The app quickly rose to the top of Apple's App Store, but as users flooded the platform with videos of popular brands and characters, large media players began to raise concerns around safety and copyright infringement. 

Iger said Disney's deal with OpenAI ""does not in any way represent a threat to creators at all,"" in part because characters' voices as well as talent names and likenesses are not included. 

""In fact, the opposite,"" Iger said. ""I think it honors them and respects them, in part because there's a license fee associated with it.""

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said there will be guardrails in place around how Disney's characters will be used on Sora.  

""It's very important that we enable Disney to set and evolve those guardrails over time, but they will of course be in there,"" Altman told CNBC on Thursday.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Thursday that the U.S. should focus on bringing in immigrants that help grow the economy as the White House rolls out its long-awaited ""gold card"" visa.

""We're the only great country that lets other people just come in without vetting them and deciding whether they're really going to help the economy of America,"" Lutnick said Thursday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

""Let's bring in the top of the best,"" he said. ""Let's help them grow America and build America. Why should we take people who are below average? It just doesn't make any sense.""

Lutnick said the ""average green-card holder"" in the U.S. earns ""one-third less than the average American.""

His comments come as President Donald Trump officially launched his gold card visa. The program, which had its price reduced from $5 million to $1 million, offers a path to citizenship and has garnered high interest from rich foreigners.

Trump's administration has made the crackdown on immigration a centerpiece of his return to the White House. Trump said in September he would slap a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications, a popular avenue for technology companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad.

Lutnick said an immigrant's willingness to shell out the $1 million can ""prove"" they are worthy of having an expedited application.

""We should be bringing in the best and the brightest,"" Lutnick said. ""That's what Donald Trump is changing about our immigration system.""

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is proposing a major change in how the government approaches financial regulation and stability, CNBC has learned.

In a letter set to be released Thursday, Bessent will recommend altering the approach of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.

Whereas the agency's focus had been tightening regulations and oversight of the institutions it oversees, the new plan will switch that, and push for looser regulation and a freer approach.

The letter will say, ""the Council will work with and support member agencies in considering whether aspects of the U.S. financial regulatory framework impose undue burdens and negatively impact economic growth, thereby undermining financial stability.""

FSOC was formed in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 to monitor and address the kind of systemic risk that led to the collapse of major Wall Street institutions and sent the economy into its worst slump since the Great Depression. The council was created in 2010 as an outgrowth of efforts to prevent such a crisis from happening again.

As Treasury secretary, Bessent chairs the council. The proposal coincides with an FSOC meeting slated for Thursday at which he delivers a letter updating where it stands on its work.

The plan also lines up with the Trump administration's focus on deregulation, but represents a switch from the council's long-standing tilt toward stronger regulation. 

Along with the proposal, Bessent is forming a working group whose mission will be to ""explore opportunities for [artificial intelligence] to promote the resilience of the financial system while also monitoring for potential risks to financial stability that might be posed by the adoption of AI.""

Bessent will contend that lowering regulator barriers and oversight will strengthen the financial system and boost economic growth.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Stocks surged yesterday after the Federal Reserve delivered a widely expected interest rate cut at its final policy gathering of the year. But the bank seemed to take the ""hawkish cut"" stance many were anticipating, saying that the move doesn't signal more decreases in the near future.

Here's the rundown:

Oracle missed analysts' expectations for revenue in its high-profile earnings report yesterday. Shares of the software company dropped 11% in extended trading, dragging down other artificial intelligence plays such as Nvidia and CoreWeave.

The revenue miss overshadowed Oracle's quarterly earnings per share, which blew past Wall Street's forecast for the second quarter. Oracle also said its remaining performance obligations soared more than 400% from a year ago, driven by new commitments from companies including Meta and Nvidia.

On the other hand, shares of Cisco rallied to an all-time closing high in yesterday's session. As CNBC's Jordan Novet points out, it's the first such record for Cisco since its dot-com bubble peak in 2000.

Trump said yesterday that the U.S. seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. He said it was ""the largest one ever seized.""

Matt Smith, head U.S. analyst at energy consultancy Kpler, told CNBC that the tanker has been identified as the Skipper, a Guyana-flagged ""Very Large Crude Carrier"" that appeared to be en route to Cuba. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an X post yesterday that the tanker had been sanctioned by the U.S. for years ""due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.""

The move comes as Trump continues to escalate his pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, saying in a Politico interview published Tuesday that Maduro's ""days are numbered."" Oil prices popped yesterday following Trump's announcement.

Rivian is taking a turn toward artificial intelligence. The electric vehicle maker is hosting its first-ever ""Autonomy and AI Day"" today as it pitches shareholders on its in-house technology for new cars.

As CNBC's Michael Wayland notes, Rivian's AI push comes as the company's core EV business has lagged expectations since it went public four years ago. Rivian is also losing billions of dollars annually despite efforts to reduce costs and increase software revenue.

The latest C-suite shakeup came last night: Coca-Cola announced operations chief Henrique Braun will succeed James Quincey as CEO next year.

Braun, who has worked at the soda giant for nearly three decades, will take the helm at the end of March. Quincey will stay with Coca-Cola as its board's executive chairman following his eight-year stint as CEO.

Coca-Cola has mostly outperformed rival Pepsico under Quincey, and its namesake Coke brand has held on to its title as the top-selling soda in the U.S. But the company has grappled with cooling demand as lower-income consumers buckle under inflationary pressures.

In this article

Eli Lilly on Thursday said its next-generation obesity drug delivered what appears to be the highest weight loss yet in a late-stage trial while reducing knee arthritis pain, clearing the first of several upcoming studies on the weekly injection. 

The highest dose of the drug helped patients with obesity and a type of knee arthritis lose an average of 23.7% of their body weight at 68 weeks, when analyzing all participants, including those who discontinued treatment. When evaluating only patients who stayed on the drug, the highest dose delivered 28.7% weight loss on average. 

The company said some patients lost so much weight that they decided to drop out of the trial. 

""It's incredible,"" said Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Now, we have a drug that rivals the weight loss benefits of surgery.""

Apovian said Eli Lilly appears to be positioning the drug strategically for people with severe obesity, or a body mass index above 35 or 40. She noted that the company said 84% of patients in the trial had a BMI above that number in the trial.

Shares of Eli Lilly rose more than 3% on Thursday. 

It is the first late-stage data on retatrutide, which works differently from existing injections and appears to be more effective. Eli Lilly is betting big on retatrutide as the next pillar of its obesity portfolio after its weight loss injection Zepbound and its upcoming pill. But it's still unclear when the drug could enter the market. 

It's a critical part of the drugmaker's plan to maintain its market share majority over Novo Nordisk in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs. Some analysts estimate the segment could be worth about $100 billion by the 2030s.

Retatrutide also met the trial's other main goal of reducing pain from knee osteoarthritis – a common condition that wears down the joint's cartilage and leads to pain and stiffness – by up to 62.6% on average when analyzing all patients, based on a widely used survey. More than 1 in 8 patients who took the drug were completely free from knee pain by the end of the trial, Eli Lilly said. 

One concern with current weight loss drugs is that they can lead to the loss of lean muscle mass. But Apovian said the results show that in adults with severe obesity, you can improve physical function with retatrutide. 

The results appear to surpass Wall Street's expectations. In a note ahead of the findings, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said his base-case assumption was for the drug to show weight loss of around 20% to 23%, with at least a 50% reduction in knee pain. 

The company believes retatrutide ""could become an important option for patients with significant weight loss needs and certain complications, including knee osteoarthritis,"" Kenneth Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, said in a statement. 

In a note Thursday, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said retatrutide's tolerability data, or how well patients handle the treatment, is ""somewhat worse vs Zepbound, though not surprising, in our view."" 

Roughly 18% of patients on the highest dose of the drug stopped treatment due to side effects, compared with 4% of those in the placebo group. Eli Lilly said those dropout rates were ""highly correlated"" to patients' starting body mass index and included discontinuations due to ""perceived excessive weight loss."" 

Among those with a BMI of 35 or higher who took highest dose, 12% stopped treatment. Schott said that number is closer to the dropout rates seen in trials on Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's obesity injection Wegovy. 

In a separate note on Thursday, BMO's Seigerman said discontinuation rates ""appear to highlight the speed and strength of weight loss was excessive for some patients with lower BMI."" But he said, ""all in results are impressive.""

Around 43% of patients on the highest dose experienced nausea, while roughly 33% and 20.9% had diarrhea and vomiting, respectively. More than 1 in 5 patients on the highest dose also experienced dysesthesia, which is an unpleasant nerve sensation. The company said it was generally mild for patients and rarely led to them discontinuing treatment. 

The study, called TRIUMPH-4, didn't solely focus on weight loss, meaning that other trials specifically designed for that outcome could produce different or higher results. Eli Lilly expects to report findings from seven additional phase three trials on the drug by the end of 2026. 

Dubbed the ""triple G"" drug, retatrutide works by mimicking three hunger-regulating hormones – GLP-1, GIP and glucagon – rather than just one or two like existing treatments. That appears to have more potent effects on a person's appetite and satisfaction with food than other treatments.

Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, mimics GLP-1 and GIP. Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, mimics only GLP-1.

Higher doses of tirzepatide helped patients with obesity lose roughly 20.9% of their body weight on average in late-stage studies, when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations. 

As Eli Lilly establishes an edge in the space, its chief rival, Novo Nordisk, is racing to catch up. In March, Novo Nordisk said it agreed to pay up to $2 billion for the rights to an early experimental drug from the Chinese pharmaceutical company United Laboratories International. 

Novo Nordisk's newly acquired drug is a clear potential competitor to retatrutide because it similarly uses a three-pronged approach to promoting weight loss and regulating blood sugar. But Novo Nordisk's treatment is much earlier in development, meaning it will take several years before it reaches patients.

In this article

Oracle shares plummeted 15% Thursday, after the firm reported disappointing results.

The cloud computing and database software maker reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue on Wednesday, despite booming demand for its artificial intelligence infrastructure. Its revenue came in at $16.06 billion, compared with $16.21 billion expected by analysts, according to data compiled by LSEG.

It dragged other AI-related names down with it. 

Chip darling Nvidia fell more than 2%, memory and storage firm Micron was 1% lower, cloud company Coreweave slid 5% and AMD was 3% lower. 

Oracle has been the subject of much market chatter since raising $18 billion in a jumbo bond sale in September, marking one of the largest debt issuances for the tech industry on record. The name shot onto investor agendas when it inked a $300 billion deal with OpenAI in the same month. Oracle made further moves into cloud infrastructure, where it battles Big Tech names such as Amazon,  Microsoft and Google for AI contracts.

However, investors have questioned Oracle's aggressive AI infrastructure build-out plans and whether it needs such a colossal amount of debt to execute, though other tech firms have also recently issued corporate bonds. 

Oracle specifically has secured billions of dollars of construction loans through a consortium of banks tied to data centers in New Mexico and Wisconsin. The firm will raise roughly $20 billion to $30 billion in debt every year for the next three years, according to estimates by Citi analyst Tyler Radke.

On the company's earnings call, Principal Financial Officer Doug Kehring committed to keeping Oracle's investment-grade debt rating. 

""In addition, there are other financing options through customers that may bring their own chips to be installed in our data centers and suppliers who may lease their chips rather than sell them,"" he said. ""Both of these options enable Oracle to synchronize our payments with our receipts and borrow substantially less than most people are modeling.""

Oracle expects about $50 billion in full-year capital expenditures, up from $35 billion as of September, with the new commitments, Kehring said. The sum for fiscal 2025 was $21.2 billion.

Its free cash flow — the metric investors are watching closely as they navigate AI bubble concerns, as it shows a company's ability to pay its debt —  for the November quarter was negative by about $10 billion. The StreetAccount consensus was negative $5.2 billion.

While this is ""naturally a focus point of investors,"" Wedbush Securities analysts said that it's ""a high class problem that Oracle is dealing with on the AI demand front.""

""Overall, Oracle's core AI and cloud numbers and backlog tell a very healthy and robust AI Revolution demand story for the sector....any sell-off today on the sector we view as a clear buying opportunity given the underlying demand story that was further validated by Oracle last night.""

Oracle's share price has moved 34% higher year-to-date despite recent losses.

Nvidia is developing software that could provide location verification for its AI graphics processing units (GPUs), a move that comes as Washington ramps up efforts to prevent restricted chips from being used in countries like China.

The opt-in service uses a client software agent that Nvidia chip customers can install to monitor the health of their AI GPUs, the company said in a blog post on Wednesday. 

Nvidia also said that customers ""will be able to visualize their GPU fleet utilization in a dashboard, globally or by compute zones — groups of nodes enrolled in the same physical or cloud locations.""

However, Nvidia told CNBC in a statement that the latest software does not give the company or outside actors the ability to disable its chips.

""There is no kill switch,"" it added. ""For GPU health, there are no features that allow NVIDIA to remotely control or take action on registered systems. It is read-only telemetry sent to NVIDIA.""

Telemetry is the automated process of collecting and transmitting data from remote or inaccessible sources to a central location for monitoring, analysis and optimization.

The ability to locate a device depends on the type of sensor data collected and transmitted, such as IP-based network information, timestamps, or other system-level signals that can be mapped to physical or cloud locations.

A screenshot of the software posted on Nvidia's blog showed details such as the machine's IP address and location.

Lukasz Olejnik, a senior research fellow at the Department of War Studies, King's College London, said that while Nvidia indicated that its GPUs do not have hardware tracking technology, the blog did not specify if the data ""uses customer input, network data, cloud provider metadata, or other methods.""

""In principle, also, the sent data contains metadata like network address, which may enable location in practice,"" Olejnik, who is also an independent consultant, told CNBC. 

The software could also detect any unexpected usage patterns that differ from what was declared, he added.

The latest features from Nvidia follow calls by lawmakers in Washington for the company to outfit its chips with tracking software that could help enforce export controls. 

Those rules bar Nvidia from selling its more advanced AI chips to companies in China and other prohibited locations without a special license. While Trump has recently said he plans to roll back some of these export restrictions, those on Nvidia's cutting-edge chips will remain in place.  

In May, Senator Tom Cotton and a bipartisan group of eight lawmakers introduced the Chip Security Act, which, if passed, would mandate security mechanisms and location verification in advanced AI chips. 

""Firms affected by U.S. export controls or China-related restrictions could use the system to verify and prove their GPU fleets remain in approved locations and state, and demonstrate compliant usage to regulators,"" Olejn noted.

""That could actually help in compliance and indirectly on investment outlook positively.""

Pressure on Nvidia has intensified after Justice Department investigations into alleged smuggling rings that moved over $160 million in Nvidia chips to China.

However, Chinese officials have pushed back, warning Nvidia against equipping its chips with tracking features, as well as ""potential backdoors and vulnerabilities."" 

Following a national security investigation into some of Nvidia's chips to check for these backdoors, Chinese officials have prevented local tech companies from purchasing products from the American chip designer. 

Despite a green light from U.S. President Donald Trump for Nvidia to ship its previously restricted H200 chips to China, Beijing is reportedly undecided about whether to  permit the imports.

Google DeepMind, the tech giant's AI unit, unveiled plans for its first ""automated research lab"" in the U.K. as it signs a partnership that could lead to the company deploying its latest models in the country. 

The AI company will open the lab, which will use AI and robotics to run experiments, in the U.K. next year. It will focus on developing new superconductor materials, which can be used to develop medical imaging tech, alongside new materials for semiconductors.

British scientists will gain ""priority access"" to some of the world's most advanced AI tools under the partnership, the U.K. government said in its announcement.

Founded in London in 2010 by Nobel prize winner Demis Hassabis, DeepMind was acquired by Google in 2014, but has retained a large operational base in the U.K. The company has made several breakthroughs considered crucial to advancing AI technology.

The partnership could also lead to DeepMind working with the government on AI research in areas like nuclear fusion and deploying its Gemini models across government and education in the U.K, the government said.

""DeepMind serves as the perfect example of what UK-US tech collaboration can deliver - a firm with roots on both sides of the Atlantic backing British innovators to shape the curve of technological progress,"" said U.K. Technology Secretary Liz Kendall in a statement.

""This agreement could help to unlock cleaner energy, smarter public services, and new opportunities which will benefit communities up and down the country,"" she said.

""AI has incredible potential to drive a new era of scientific discovery and improve everyday life,"" said Hassabis.

""We're excited to deepen our collaboration with the UK government and build on the country's rich heritage of innovation to advance science, strengthen security, and deliver tangible improvements for citizens.""

The U.K. has been racing to sign deals with major tech companies as it tries to build out its AI infrastructure and public deployment of the technology, since the publication of a national strategy for AI in January.

Microsoft, Nvidia, Google and OpenAI announced plans to funnel over $40 billion of investment into new AI infrastructure in the country in September, during a state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump.

This report is from this week's CNBC's ""Inside India"" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse. Subscribe here.

The growing pool of investors in India is increasingly attracting global attention — and renewed interest from fund houses. 

This year, the world's largest fund house, BlackRock, launched multiple mutual fund schemes in India through Jio BlackRock, marking the U.S. firm's reentry after its exit in 2018. 

Reportedly, the world's fourth largest asset manager, State Street, is looking to buy a stake in an Indian fund house.

Global companies, from the U.S. to South Korea, are looking to list their Indian business units, building on the boom in the country's primary market, and offering fund houses more avenues to invest.   

Accelerating financialization of Indian household savings is driving flows: as more retail investors participate in capital markets, the opportunities for asset managers to handle those funds are ballooning.  

Global consultancy firm Bain & Company estimates retail investor-driven assets of Indian mutual fund industry to grow to 300 trillion rupees ($3.3 trillion) by 2035 from 45 trillion rupees in fiscal year 2025. 

There is substantial room for growth in the industry, as India's individual mutual fund assets are less than 15% of its GDP, compared to 80% for mature economies such as the U.S. and Canada, said Rakesh Pozhath, Partner, Bengaluru, Bain. 

Salaried millennials in metro cities and Gen Zs are increasingly investing savings in mutual funds, even avoiding direct equities, the report said. For a large chunk of investors, making monthly investments has become part of discipline. As a result, the share of long-term mutual fund holdings is on the rise, Bain said. 

Investment through systematic investment plans, which refer to investing bite-sized sums at regular intervals, tripled to 2.89 trillion rupees in fiscal year 2025 from 2021, data from Association of Mutual Funds in India shows.

India's central bank has noted that retail investors are increasingly preferring equity investments, primarily through mutual funds, over traditional saving instruments. The Reserve Bank of India said in August that the share of mutual funds in the household sector's gross financial savings climbed to 6% in the year ended March 2023 from 0.9% in fiscal year 2012.  

As the Indian economy has grows, surplus incomes across middle class and upper middle class are being invested across multiple financial products, said Vivek Sharma, head of international business at Nuvama Private.

The Indian mutual fund industry has become sizeable enough to attract the attention of global fund houses, experts say. 

""In the last decade, many global fund houses either exited or meaningfully reduced their presence in India because the growth of the industry was not there,"" said Hiren Dasani, chief investment officer for Emerging Markets at WhiteOak Capital. 

Now, mutual fund assets have grown enough to garner the interest of even large global asset managers, he said. 

BlackRock, which in a joint venture with billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Jio Financial services set up Jio BlackRock Asset Management, received regulatory approval to launch mutual funds in May this year. In July, it raised raised more than $2.1 billion across three fund schemes.

In an interview to Bloomberg in September, Sid Swaminathan, chief executive officer of Jio Blackrock Asset Management, said he expects the Indian mutual fund industry to triple in the next seven years.

India's growing pool of young, long-term investors is not just an opportunity for global fund houses, but also for multinational companies. 

The Indian primary market has been extremely hot this year, even as the secondary market cooled off.

The country has seen companies raise $11.4 billion via 252 IPOs during the first three quarters of the year, and with many big-ticket listings — LG Electronics, Tata Capital and Lenskart — coming in the final quarter, the final amount of funds raised is expected to be higher than last year's $19.9 billion.

While the debate over some IPOs being overpriced continues, experts say robust domestic liquidity is absorbing a large number IPOs, no matter the size. 

Take the case of LG Electronics' India IPO, whose institutional book was over subscribed 150 times. 

According to data shared by India capital market research firm Prime Database with CNBC, of the 1.6 trillion rupees raised by large IPOs in India in 2025 around 22% was invested by mutual funds. 

While the companies benefited from heavily oversubscribed IPOs, mutual funds saw their investments soar. IPO returns for the first three quarters of the year stand at 17.7% during, compared to just 4.4% for the benchmark BSE Sensex, according to an EY report. 

The opportunities arising from India's shift to financial assets, don't just end here. Experts say the final avenue that this growing pool of investors could unlock is the flow of capital into global market.

Investors in India are also keen to invest in U.S. equities to participate in themes such as the AI boom, or bet on China's revival, but their participation is limited due to capital control norms.  

Mutual funds, however, allow them to gain overseas exposure — though it is capped at $7 billion for the whole industry — said Dhiraj Agarwal, managing director, at Ambit Investment Managers.

""Offshore investments vehicles in India are seeing great traction,"" he added.   

Given the growing demand and the size of the industry, most experts see access to overseas investments improving for small investors, in turn making the AUM opportunity for global funds more attractive. 

In an exclusive interview, S. Krishnan, secretary at India's Ministry of Electronics and IT, said the country was focusing on AI applications, expanding data centers, and jobs through indirect growth. 

Evan Feigenbaum from Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said there was no major problem India faces to which closer ties with Russia is the solution, but India-China hold considerable unrealized economic potential.

Stefano Baronci of ACI Asia-Pacific & Middle East said the flight cancellation issues at Indian carrier IndiGo was a ""transitional setback,"" adding that India's air passenger market will lead the region's growth.

Big Tech is doubling down on investing billions in India. In under 24 hours, Microsoft and Amazon pledged more than $50 billion toward India's cloud and AI infrastructure, while Intel on Monday said it plans to make chips in the country. 

Indigo shares slump as thousands of flights are cancelled. Airline passengers in India faced massive disruptions starting last Friday as the country's largest carrier cancelled thousands of flights due to a change in rules about pilots' rest time. The airline said on Wednesday that operations had stabilized.

India's central bank cuts policy rate to 5.25%: India's central bank on Friday cut its policy rate by 25 basis points, in line with forecasts from economists, owing to ""weakness in some key economic indicators."" 

The big question for India is really income growth and where that will come from. Next year we will need to have job growth and wage growth, and one of the positive is really this, finally, implementation of the labor code which passed in 2020 but finally implemented now.

—Trinh Nguyen, senior economist at Natixis

It ended up being a ""hawkish cut,"" as expected. Still, investors managed to find a few gifts tucked between the lumps of coal.

Even though the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday stateside, two regional bank presidents — Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City and Austan Goolsbee of Chicago — wanted rates to stand pat.

Their caution was echoed in the Fed's ""dot plot"" of rate projection, which showed officials penciling in just one cut in 2026 and another for 2027.

Even the Fed's rate statement was repurposed from the December 2024 meeting, which ushered in a nine-month period without cuts until September this year.

Why, then, did U.S. markets rise after the meeting?

The biggest surprise was the Fed's announcement that it would begin purchasing $40 billion in Treasury bills, starting Friday. That move increases the money supply in the economy. In other words, it's a stealthy way to ease conditions, which helps support financial markets.

Next, Chair Jerome Powell dismissed speculation about future hikes.

""I don't think that a rate hike ... is anybody's base case at this point,"" Powell said. ""I'm not hearing that.""

Fed officials also see the U.S economy as remaining resilient. Collectively, they increased their forecast for economic expansion in 2026 to 2.3% from an earlier estimate of 1.8% in September.

""We have an extraordinary economy,"" said Powell.

And the markets may be setting up for an extraordinary finish to the year.

""The last interest rate decision of 2025 has essentially paved the way for a Santa Claus rally to end the year, and the S&P 500 is poised to exceed the 7,000 milestone in the next few weeks,"" said José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.

For investors, that would count as a very decent Christmas surprise.

 — CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

The Fed cuts rates by a quarter percentage point. That brings the targeted range of U.S. interest rates to 3.5%-3.75%. The decision was not unanimous: two members from the 12-member voting committee wanted rates unchanged, while one wanted a larger cut.

U.S. stocks climb after digesting Fed meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average popped 1.1% on Wednesday, rising alongside other major indexes. Asia-Pacific markets gave up early gains to trade mostly lower on Thursday.

Oracle misses revenue expectations. The company's quarterly revenue grew 14% from a year ago, but missed Wall Street's mark. Oracle's earnings and AI backlog topped estimates. Shares tumbled more than 11% in extended trading, dragging AI-related stocks lower.

India's allure to Big Tech. In under 24 hours, Microsoft and Amazon pledged more than $50 billion to invest in the country's AI industries. New Delhi's abundance of resources, talent pool and market opportunity are attracting the attention of such companies.

[PRO] Goldman Sachs likes these energy stocks. The bank's monthly ""Conviction List,"" a selection of stocks it recommends buying, features several energy stocks. One name is ""underappreciated,"" and another is likely to provide ""continued buybacks.""

AI defense booms in UK and Germany as new wave of billion-dollar startups emerge

Venture capital for European defense startups has spiked as members of the NATO military alliance have agreed to increase security spending to 5% of gross domestic product. Additionally, defense departments in London and Berlin have increasingly signaled a willingness to adopt new technology built by younger players in the market.

Investors, buoyed by the promise of commercial deals, have funneled a record $4.3 billion into the sector since the start of 2022, according to Dealroom — nearly four times the funds deployed in the previous four years.

South Korea's SK Hynix on Wednesday confirmed that it is weighing a U.S. listing as the memory chipmaker's valuation soars on global demand for artificial intelligence hardware.

The company at the center of the AI infrastructure boom said in a regulatory filing that it was ""reviewing various measures to enhance corporate value, including a U.S. stock market listing utilizing treasury shares,"" while noting that no final decision has been made.

A U.S. listing would give American investors direct access to SK Hynix shares, which have surged nearly 230% so far this year in trading in Seoul on the back of strong AI demand. 

The Korea Exchange on Tuesday asked SK Hynix to address a Korea Economic Daily report that the company had received proposals to list about 2.4% of its shares as American depositary receipts (ADRs) backed by treasury stock.

ADRs are tradable certificates issued by U.S. banks that represent shares in a foreign company. While they tend to trade with lower liquidity than a full U.S. listing, which can deter some investors, ADRs use existing shares rather than new stock, preserving value for existing shareholders.

SK Hynix holds treasury shares equivalent to about 2.4% of its issued stock, according to the company's investor relations website.

Shares of SK Hynix rose 4% on Wednesday following its statement, before paring gains on Thursday, trading over 2% lower.

The company has cemented its lead in high-bandwidth memory chips, which are used in Nvidia's AI processors. 

A U.S. listing could help narrow valuation gaps between the company and U.S.-listed memory rival Micron Technology, as well as Samsung Electronics. 

SK Hynix has also been committing significant capital at home and abroad to expand its supply capacity, as it races to keep up with growing AI demand. 

The firm has committed nearly $4 billion to an advanced packaging fab in Indiana, aligning with Washington's aim to expand domestic chip production. 

SK Hynix is also set to benefit from the government's growing support of the local semiconductor industry. 

South Korea is considering building a 4.5 trillion won ($3.06 billion) foundry, funded by state and private capital  to nurture local chipmakers amid growing demand for AI chips, according to a Reuters report on Wednesday. 

The report added that South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with executives from chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, on the same day to discuss plans to maintain the country's lead in memory chips and support its local chip manufacturing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","The Swiss city that lets you pay for most things with bitcoin","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r959n91p4o","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 00:22:58 GMT","

In a McDonald's by a lake surrounded by mountains, in the centre of the Swiss city of Lugano, a customer orders coffee.

""Can I pay with bitcoin?"" he asks, and the person behind the counter holds out what looks like a credit card payment terminal.

It is in fact a machine for paying by crypto currency. The equipment has been distributed free to local retail businesses by the city council.

The buyer pays by contactless, from the bitcoin wallet on his mobile phone. The bill comes to 0.00008629, which is roughly $8.80 (£6.60).

Few people who have bought bitcoin would probably think about using it to purchase actual things in shops. It is instead generally seen as an investment, a bet on its value going up.

But in Lugano, in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, it's a different story.

While you can of course still pay for everything in Swiss francs, some 350 shops and restaurants now also accept bitcoin. The local authority has even started taking payments in crypto currency for municipal services. You can, for example, pay for pre-school childcare in bitcoin.

I get talking to the McDonald's customer, Nicolas, who comes from France. He is what you might call a bitcoin true believer.

""What's great about paying in bitcoin is the feeling of freedom it gives you,"" he says. ""You are no longer dependant on a financial system with its middlemen and its costs.""

Nicolas says he's discovered bitcoin cards in Switzerland. These are prepaid gift cards. You buy a certain sum in Swiss francs but download it in bitcoin onto a digital wallet on your phone.

I walk through the centre of Lugano, down a high street where just about all the shops sell luxury stuff. Jewellery or expensive clothes mainly.

In a shop called Vintage Nassa that sells new and second-hand bags and watches, the owner Cherubino Fry tells me he accepts bitcoin because the processing fee he has to pay per transaction is less than those charged by credit card companies.

For bitcoin it is generally below 1%, while for debit cards it can be as high as 1.7%, and up to 3.4% for credit cards. Although for the latter two it can vary from country to country.

I ask Mr Fry if he does much business in bitcoin.

""In reality, not a lot. For now, only sporadically, only some clients,"" he says. ""But using bitcoin will be like a tree growing, and this tree will grow very big in five, 10 years.""

A stone's throw from Mr Fry's shop, I visit the headquarters of Plan B, an initiative launched in 2022 by the City of Lugano in collaboration with crypto currency platform Tether.

With the B standing for bitcoin, its stated aim is to educate people about cryptocurrency, and ""to make Lugano the European hub for bitcoin"".

""I want to talk about an experiment I did this July,"" says Plan B hub director Mir Liponi. She explains that she had a problem with her bank, which resulted in her not being able to access her funds.

For 11 days she had no way of paying, other than with bitcoin, but she says that experiment turned out well, and that you can mostly survive just on bitcoin in Lugano.

""It's missing public transportation at the moment… another one is fuel. Groceries are okay. I got things delivered at home, even.

""Plenty of medical places, but not a dentist. And another big thing is [energy] bills. You cannot pay bills in bitcoin yet.""

Ms Liponi adds that in the future she wants to see ""circular economies where people earn bitcoin, keep bitcoin, spend bitcoin, pay for services in bitcoin"".

Yet elsewhere, similar bitcoin projects to Lugano's have come unstuck.

In 2021, El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender alongside the US dollar. To encourage its use the government gave people the bitcoin equivalent of $30 that they downloaded via an app.

""So what people did was download the app, exchange the bitcoin for dollars and never use it again,"" says Vincent Charles, head of crypto currency firm Unchain Data.

He went to El Salvador earlier this year to see how bitcoin uptake was going, and concluded that people don't really use it, and retailers and service providers rarely accept it.

However, there are other successful bitcoin adoption examples from around the globe. Slovenian capital Ljubljana was declared the world's most crypto-friendly city in a report back in April, followed by Hong Kong and Zurich.

Back in Lugano, not everyone is seemingly impressed with bitcoin. In a park on the lakefront there used to be a statue representing Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the unknown person or persons who claim to have invented the crypto currency back in 2008.

In August, vandals broke the sculpture into bits and threw it into Lake Lugano.

""It's interesting because not that many things get vandalised around here,"" says Lucia, a passerby who lives in the city. ""People are usually fairly well behaved. And you don't see often people having very strong political opinions either.""

She adds, though, that she herself is skeptical of cryptocurrencies in general.

""At the University of Lugano where I study there's a club to promote bitcoin and everything. I do find it surprising that institutions such as my university would promote cryptocurrencies so much. I think they are associated with crime, with the dark web and speculation.

""A lot of people lose their money because they invest in a cryptocurrency and then it crashes.""

Sergio Rossi is a professor of economics at Switzerland's University of Fribourg. He says that bitcoin is a risk for shopkeepers in Lugano or elsewhere because of its volatility – its value can go sharply up and down.

So, he says it is important that they instantly convert the bitcoin they receive into Swiss francs, euros, or another currency issued by a government or central bank. These are also known as ""fiat"" currencies.

He adds: ""There is also a reputational risk with those cryptocurrencies used in illegal transactions, which could affect the city of Lugano and its financial institutions.""

Prof Rossi also cautions that people's bitcoin is held by a digital third party, which makes it risky. ""If the platform where my digital wallet is recorded fails or goes bankrupt, my cryptocurrencies disappear instantaneously.

""And therefore, I lose the corresponding amount forever. By contrast, in Switzerland, all bank deposits are guaranteed up to the amount of 100,000 Swiss francs ($125,000; £94,000). This means that if the bank where my savings are recorded goes bankrupt, I can recover them up to this amount.""

At Lugano town hall I ask Mayor Michele Foletti if he is concerned that Lugano could be a magnet for mafia money.

""No. You can use fiat money to do something good or something bad,"" he says. ""The same with bitcoin.

""And mafia people are more interested to use fiat for money laundering. When they sell drugs or something like this, they receive [physical] fiat money, not bitcoin because the more anonymous way is cash,"" he says.

He adds that bitcoin continues to be positive for Lugano, and that 110 crypto-sector companies have now moved to, or started up, in the city.

The levies are set to take effect on 1 January and will apply to goods like cars, clothing and appliances.

The special visas will be awarded to those who can show they can make a ""substantial benefit"" to the US.

Dragonfly managing partner Haseeb Qureshi has sharpened his defense of Ethereum's valuation, arguing that critics are using the wrong financial framework and that ETH should be analyzed more like an early-stage Amazon than a mature “value” stock.

Speaking on the Milk Road Show on 9 December 2025, Qureshi revisited his now-viral valuation clash with investor Santiago “Santi” Santos, hosted by ThreadGuy, which reignited the debate over how to price layer 1 blockchains. At the core of Qureshi's thesis is a simple but controversial claim: fee revenue on Ethereum is effectively pure margin and should be treated as profit, not as “revenue” in the traditional corporate sense.

“Blockchains don't have revenue. They have profit,” he said. “When chains charge fees, that's profit. There's no expenses for a chain. Chains don't pay expenses, right? There's no AWS hosting cost for Ethereum.”

Qureshi Pushes Back On Claims Ethereum Is Overvalued

Santos had argued that Ethereum is trading at “300 plus” times sales, calling these price-to-sales (P/S) levels “embarrassing” relative to traditional companies and suggesting valuations are “way ahead of their skis.” Qureshi did not contest the magnitude of the multiples but rejected P/S as the right lens.

“He was insisting in the debate that the right way to look at these things is price of sales. So if you look at price sales for Ethereum, it's something like 380. If you look at Amazon, I think Amazon topped out at price of sales of 42. And this was during the bubble,” Qureshi said.

He countered that for a blockchain, what equity investors would call “sales” is closer to the GDP or GMV of the on-chain economy, which is not directly measured at the protocol level. The only clean, observable line is fee income, which he treats as net income.

“The sales in some sense is like the GDP of the blockchain which we're not measuring,” he argued. “The right thing to understand for a chain is the profit… The right thing to understand is what is the profit of Ethereum relative to the profit of Amazon.”

That opens the door to the Amazon analogy. Qureshi emphasized that Amazon delayed profitability for almost two decades to prioritize growth, yet public markets still assigned it extremely high earnings multiples.

“Amazon literally made no profit, no profit until basically about 20 years in as a business,” he said. “In the year I think it was 2013… Amazon had a PE ratio… over 600 whereas today the PE ratio of Ethereum of course is something like 380.”

Because Ethereum's P/S and P/E converge under his “fees = profit” assumption, Qureshi's argument is that investors should compare ETH's 300–380x multiple to Amazon's P/E history, not to its much lower P/S, if they are going to use a single headline ratio at all.

The broader context, he stressed, is that Ethereum and other L1s are still in an exponential build-out phase, more akin to early internet or e-commerce infrastructure than to late-cycle dividend payers.

“This technology has been getting bigger and bigger over time. It's gobbling up the entire world of finance from where it started,” he said, referencing his essay “In Defense of Exponentials.” “None of [these technologies] started printing a bunch of profit immediately in the first five or even 10 years.”

Despite choppy price action and underperformance of altcoins versus AI equities and gold, Qureshi said his conviction in the long-dated Ethereum thesis has increased, not weakened, through the public debate.

“If anything, I have become more confident in my view,” he said, adding that nothing material had changed in the last months to justify a major portfolio rethink. “What exactly has changed in the last 2 months between, you know, ETH going to like $4,800 and ETH being at $3,000? The answer is basically nothing.”

Shared some post-debate reflections on my L1 debate with @santiagoroel, my rebuttal against the “crypto is all a big casino” doomers, and where I think we are in the crypto macro cycle  https://t.co/9uMJFuLVrX

For Qureshi, a genuine repositioning would require a clear invalidation of core assumptions—such as a quantum break of cryptography or a structural collapse in on-chain stablecoin demand. Short-term swings, in his view, are simply the pendulum of sentiment moving around a still-fixed fundamental anchor.

His message to skeptics is that if markets tolerated Amazon at 600x earnings while it scaled into a dominant platform, dismissing Ethereum at roughly 300–380x on a “too high on P/S” argument alone is analytically inconsistent.

At press time, ETH traded at $3,325.

An early Bitcoin investor nicknamed “1011short” has expanded an Ethereum long position to 120,094 ETH, valued at $392.5 million, on Hyperliquid, according to data tracked by Lookonchain.

The position faces liquidation at $2,234 per ETH. The trader has been actively trading Ethereum in recent months and recently bet on renewed upward momentum.

Ethereum was trading at around $3,260 at press time, down from its daily high of $3,400, per CoinGecko. The decline extended following the Fed's decision to lower interest rates by 25 basis points.

Analysts suggest, however, that the pullback may reflect a sell-the-news reaction, given that markets had widely anticipated the rate cut.

Bitcoin and top altcoins suffered a harsh reversal today, Dec. 11, as concerns about the Federal Reserve forward guidance resumed. BTC dropped below $90,000, erasing some of the gains made earlier this week.

XRP price dropped by 3.6% in the last 24 hours and by 7.8% in the previous seven days. Similarly, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, and Chainlink prices were down by over 3% in the last 24 hours.

The closely-watched CoinMarketCap 20 Index, which is made up of the biggest coins in the crypto industry, dropped by 3%. Also, the market capitalization of all coins dropped by 2.64% to ~$3.02 trillion.

Altcoins dropped as investors sold the news

The main reason why Bitcoin and altcoins like Solana, Dogecoin, XRP, Cardano, and Chainlink are going down is the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, which happened on Wednesday.

The decision had two main catalysts for the crypto market, including the rate cut itself and the return to quantitative easing (QE) policies.

On QE, the bank will start buying short-term government bonds worth $40 billion a month, a move that will lead to more liquidity in the market.

However, the bank's dot plot pointed to just one interest rate cut in 2026, which was lower than what analysts were expecting.

On the positive side, the dot plot will likely change next year since the composition of the Fed will change. Indeed, Donald Trump is interviewing candidates for the Fed Chair role this week, with most analysts favoring Kevin Hassett. Hassett has insisted that rates needs to go down substantially.

Bitcoin and most altcoins were up earlier this week as investors waited for the upcoming Fed rate decision. Therefore, the decline is happening as investors sell the news.

Altcoin Season Index is falling 

Top altcoins like XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, and Chainlink are dropping today as demand for these tokens wanes.

Data compiled by CoinMarketCap shows that the Altcoin Season Index has been in a freefall in the past few months. It has dropped to the year-to-date low of 17, much lower than the year-to-date high of over 60.

The index has dropped as most altcoins have plunged, with the top laggards being DoubleZero, Story, MYX Finance, Pudgy Penguins, Celestia, Ethena, Worldcoin, and Pyth Network. All these tokens have plunged by over 62% in the last 90 days, erasing billions of dollars in value.

The performance is a sign that investors are favoring Bitcoin, while demand for altcoins has tumbled in the past few months.

Soaring liquidations continue 

Bitcoin and altcoins like Solana and Cardano are also falling as liquidations jump. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that Bitcoin positions worth over $175 million were liquidated in the last 24 hours.

Ethereum positions worth over $170 million were liquidated, while Solana positions worth over $25 million were wiped out. Some of the other top liquidated tokens were XRP, Dogecoin, Chainlink, and Zcash.

Liquidations happen when crypto exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Hyperliquid, OKX, and Gate are forced to close leveraged positions when they move to a certain level in a bid to protect their margins.

In line with this, Bitcoin and most altcoins dropped as the futures open interest dropped by nearly 1% in the last 24 hours to $132 billion.

Looking ahead, there is a likelihood that these altcoins will rebound as the post-Federal Reserve drop was likely a knee-jerk reaction from investors. Besides, a look beneath the surface shows that altcoin ETFs have continued to accumulate assets in the past few days, with Chainlink adding $2.5 million and Solana funds adding $4.85 million.

The crypto market tumbled back to the lower side of its range after the Federal Reserve's decision to slash interest rates by 25 baiss points.

The announcement, while bullish for macro assets in the long term, was arguably priced in by traders ahead of the event, with long exposure rapidly unwinding in the subsequent hours.

Now, bitcoin remains above the $88,200 level of support, trading at $90,350 as it looks for a catalyst to lift it above this week's stern level of resistance at $94,500.

The altcoin market continues to show weakness as several tokens lost further ground on their respective bitcoin trading pairs.

In the unpredictable realm of cryptocurrency, the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut has sent ripples through the waters, sparking curiosity and caution in equal measure among investors. For those who typically ride the Bitcoin wave, this could herald a fresh chapter, revealing distinct avenues for altcoin aficionados. Amid this economic upheaval, tokens such as Zcash, Uniswap, and Monero are poised to capture the imagination, each offering unique traits that could attract renewed interest and investment.

Today's cryptocurrency ecosystem is influenced by a slew of evolving economic signals, making it essential to pinpoint altcoins ripe for growth. Although Bitcoin's frequently erratic performance tends to overshadow smaller cryptocurrencies, the recent Federal Reserve rate cut opens up a distinctly favorable climate. By grasping the intricate relationships and individual characteristics of coins like Zcash, Uniswap, and Monero, savvy investors can secure a competitive edge in this shifting financial landscape.

Among the promising altcoins to watch, Zcash emerges, drawing attention due to its historically inverse correlation with Bitcoin. As Bitcoin stumbles, investors often pivot towards Zcash as a calculated refuge. The token's correlation of nearly -1.0 over the past year indicates a comforting resilience; the harder Bitcoin falls, the more likely Zcash rises. Notably, despite a recent drop of 8% today, Zcash has experienced a commendable rally of around 13% over the past week, showcasing its capacity to withstand adverse conditions.

Currently resting at the pivotal Fibonacci level of $573, Zcash's next moves are critical. Should it successfully breach this crucial point, the potential for additional price escalation could cement its appeal as a favorable investment for those wary of Bitcoin's unpredictable journey.

In the arena of decentralized finance (DeFi), Uniswap stands as a resilient contender, having navigated the storm of recent market unrest with grace. The Fed's interest rate reduction has the potential to redirect capital from traditional asset avenues into the DeFi space, paving the way for platforms like Uniswap to flourish. Recent statistics indicate a significant uptick, with the top 100 wallets accumulating Uniswap tokens by over 2.5%, signaling a resurgence of confidence among key holders about the token's future.

As investors strive to harness opportunities in these volatile market conditions, decentralized exchanges grow increasingly attractive. With current support set at $4.74 and resistance at $6.47, these benchmarks are highly significant. Should trading volumes escalate post-rate cut, Uniswap might just emerge as a shining beacon among altcoin contenders, riding the expanding wave of DeFi enthusiasm.

Monero's journey reflects its stronghold within the cryptocurrency sphere, exhibiting an admirable 2.7% gain over the past month while many counterparts remain mired in stagnation. This unique dwindling correlation with Bitcoin grants it an independent path, appealing to investors seeking a safe haven during turbulent times. 

However, Monero's trajectory is intricately bound to the shifting regulatory spotlight surrounding privacy coins. As scrutiny intensifies globally, Monero's appeal—rooted in its commitment to anonymity—may spark renewed interest, particularly if Bitcoin stabilizes. Historically, privacy-centric cryptocurrencies like Monero find renewed vigor when investor sentiment transitions from caution to curious exploration.

The overarching ramifications of the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut are profound. Such decisions typically ignite heightened interest in cryptocurrencies, often resulting in capital surges towards riskier assets. History indicates that rate cuts have led to notable price surges in Bitcoin and several altcoins, suggesting that the current market landscape could mirror those prior behavioral patterns.

As these changes resonate with both institutional and retail investors alike, the prospect for increased engagement in altcoin markets becomes glaringly evident. As the balancing act between risk inclination and market tranquility plays out, the evolving landscape could act as a catalyst for a resurgence in altcoin investments, particularly highlighting Zcash, Uniswap, and Monero.

In an ever-changing cryptocurrency environment, Zcash, Uniswap, and Monero stand out as compelling prospects for those eager to navigate the aftermath of the Fed's interest rate cut. Their unique performances in relation to Bitcoin, combined with opportunities found in the realms of privacy and DeFi, situate these altcoins favorably for future growth. Whether you hail from the ranks of seasoned traders or are just stepping into this vibrant arena, grasping the interplay between macroeconomic shifts and the specific attributes of these altcoins can unveil valuable investment paths ahead.

As the cryptocurrency saga continues to unfold, these altcoins have the potential to redefine resilience and opportunity within the multifaceted world of digital assets. Staying alert and informed will be crucial for capitalizing on the potential transformations that lie just over the horizon.

Oops, something went wrong

Dec 11 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan said on Thursday that it issued a U.S. commercial paper for Galaxy Digital Holdings on the Solana blockchain, ​marking an important step in the broader institutional adoption of digital assets.

Cryptocurrency ‌exchange Coinbase Global and investment management firm Franklin Templeton purchased the commercial paper, a short term and ‌unsecured debt instrument.

The deal is among the earliest that uses blockchain for the issue and service of securities, which J.P. Morgan called a ""global milestone"", as traditional finance begins to intersect with the new technology.

The debt deal is worth $50 million, according to a ⁠person familiar with the matter.

Blockchain ‌platforms, such as Solana which was founded in 2017 and launched its mainnet three years later, have seen a keen interest from ‍the legacy finance institutions due to their high speed and low transaction costs.

The ""landmark transaction is an important step toward building the future of finance, demonstrating institutional adoption of digital assets ​and our capability to securely bring new instruments on-chain in a complex legal ‌and regulatory environment via Solana,"" said Scott Lucas, Head of Markets Digital Assets at J.P. Morgan, in a statement.

Prior issuances on J.P. Morgan's private, permissioned blockchain platform include a municipal securities offering for the City of Quincy in April 2024 and a U.S. commercial paper issuance for Oversea‑Chinese Banking Corporation in August 2025.

""In the ⁠first half of next year, we intend to ​build on this momentum by exploring how this ​structure and J.P. Morgan's role in it can be expanded, not just in terms of the investor and issuer base but also security ‍type,"" Lucas said.

J.P. Morgan ⁠acted as the arranger in the deal and created the on-chain USCP token. Both the issuance and redemption proceeds will be paid in USDC, ⁠a stablecoin issued by Circle.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to track the value of a real‑world currency, typically ‌the U.S. dollar.

When businesses decide to engage with crypto, they quickly discover the landscape is fragmented across numerous blockchains. If they want to move assets between different chains, they must often rely on a technology called bridging that can prove insecure and expensive. Philipp Zentner, cofounder and CEO of LI.FI, created his company to address these issues. The startup provides businesses with price comparisons of exchange rates and bridging fees. It also aims to find businesses the most efficient and cost-effective pathway for each transaction. 

On Thursday, LI.FI announced that it raised $29 million in funding led by Multicoin and CoinFund, bringing the total capital to about $52 million. Zentner did not disclose the company's valuation. 

“You can think of us like a combination of Google Flights and Google Maps,” he said in an interview with Fortune. “[We're] a competitive price comparison and transaction pathfinding for businesses in crypto finance.”

The businesses that LI.FI partners with are fintechs, brokerage apps, trading desks, wallets, and neobanks. The startup has more than 800 partners, including Robinhood, Binance, and Kraken. The company says that its value proposition is that its service allows companies to go to market faster and saves them time on research, integration, and maintenance. 

Zentner says that LI.FI is profitable and generates revenue through transaction fees, though he declined to disclose specific revenue numbers. It has $8 billion in monthly transaction volume as of October, which is about seven times more than its monthly volume from a year prior. The company has more than 100 employees. 

“As crypto trading becomes a core feature inside mainstream fintech apps, the hardest problem is…making fragmented blockchains, liquidity, and execution work seamlessly together,” said Spencer Applebaum, investment partner at Multicoin Capital, in a statement. “LI.FI Protocol gives fintechs and web3 wallets a single API to offer both trading and cross-chain asset movement, handling on-chain routing and execution behind the scenes.”

With the new funding, LI.FI plans to expand into different transaction domains, including perpetual futures, yield opportunities, prediction markets, and lending markets. Zentner says with the new capital he also aims to hire more employees.

By using the ISO 20022 messaging standard, the partners say they can make tokenised deposits interoperable with legacy systems

Ant International, HSBC and Swift have successfully tested cross-border transfers of tokenised deposits using an international financial messaging standard, in a move that could streamline global blockchain-based payments and corporate treasury management.

The milestone, announced on Thursday, marked the first case leveraging the Swift network and ISO 20022 as a messaging standard in cross-border payments using tokenised deposits.

The standard is a universal language for exchanging electronic data in financial business transactions.

In the test, Singapore-based Ant International and HSBC connected Ant's blockchain infrastructure to Swift's network, allowing real-time cross-border treasury management between HSBC Singapore and Hong Kong through the bank's tokenised deposit services.

Could live NFT auctions be changing the game for crypto payroll?  This dynamic form of auction has come to the forefront, offering a novel way for creators and businesses to engage with digital assets. The rise of these real-time auctions may very well pave the way for innovative payroll solutions, offering unique compensation models and enhancing employee engagement. Is your fintech startup ready to capitalize on this trend?

So what actually are live NFT auctions? These are real-time events designed for creators to showcase their digital assets with the ability for buyers to place bids instantly. Unlike conventional auctions that can last for days, live auctions create an electric atmosphere where excitement grows as the clock counts down. This format draws inspiration from successful live commerce models in Asia, where platforms have seen billions in sales through interactive experiences.

The mechanics? Quite straightforward. Creators list their NFTs, and participants can bid while interacting through comments. This format fosters a community feel where the immediate engagement heightens the buying experience, giving creators valuable feedback on which pieces strike a chord with collectors.

Is the importance of live NFT auctions for creators understated? Live NFT auctions present a distinct opportunity for creators to connect with their audience. The real-time interaction cultivates a sense of community and connection, elements that are increasingly vital in today's digital landscape. Platforms like Zora are at the forefront of this movement by allowing creators to conduct live auctions, making the process more dynamic and accessible.

Additionally, these auctions can amplify the visibility of an artist's work. Early reports indicate that auctions on platforms like Zora tend to close faster and draw in more bids compared to traditional listings. This heightened engagement can lead to increased sales and a stronger creator following, ultimately bolstering their career.

Could fintech startups tap into the live NFT auction phenomenon to innovate their crypto payroll solutions? Absolutely! By leveraging NFTs, companies can create automated, flexible, and engaging payroll models. Imagine using NFTs to automate payroll through smart contracts, ensuring efficient and transparent disbursements while trimming administrative costs.

Furthermore, live NFT auctions can act as a stage for performance-based rewards. Companies could offer unique NFTs as bonuses, generating excitement among employees. This strategy not only attracts tech-savvy talent but also boosts employee satisfaction with tangible, valuable assets.

But are there challenges in integrating NFT payroll? Definitely. Regulatory compliance stands out as a major hurdle, given the nascent nature of the NFT market. Startups need to ensure they adhere to evolving laws and guidelines. The volatile nature of NFTs can complicate salary assessments and payment structures.

Technical challenges abound as well, especially in merging NFT systems with existing payroll platforms. Robust infrastructure is essential for effective management of these complexities. However, with the right strategies and tools, like those offered by platforms such as Gilded, startups can streamline their crypto payroll workflows and navigate these challenges.

What does the future hold for live NFT auctions? The outlook seems bright, with potential applications extending beyond art and entertainment. The benefits of integrating NFTs into operational frameworks may drive broader adoption across payroll, marketing, and customer engagement.

The emergence of Web3 business banking and crypto-native tools could further bolster live NFT auctions, making them increasingly accessible. As more companies embrace crypto payments and explore innovative compensation models, these auctions may become commonplace in the digital economy.

In summary, live NFT auctions are more than just a fleeting trend; they mark a significant shift in how businesses can engage with employees and customers. By tapping into the excitement surrounding these auctions, fintech startups can revolutionize payroll solutions and create a dynamic workplace environment. The future favors those who adapt.

Despite the bustling activity in crypto markets, Moonie NFT USD (MNYUSD) remains remarkably steady. Today, we observe its price holding firm at $0.000002687992 with no fluctuation, sparking curiosity. Let's delve into what's keeping MNYUSD steady and what might be ahead.

Today, Moonie NFT USD stands unchanged at $0.000002687992. Over the past year, it faced a decline of 10.40%, reflecting broader crypto market challenges. Its year high of $0.000003 and year low of $0.000001 highlight a narrow trading range. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 0 suggests extreme oversold conditions, but the lack of movement indicates hesitance among traders. MACD, ADX, and various volatility indicators all read zero, reinforcing the stagnancy. Clearly, MNYUSD is in a holding pattern, waiting for a catalyst. Meyka AI's comprehensive analysis highlights these stagnant trends, urging caution but also potential at these lows.

While MNYUSD shows stability today, its past tells a story of intense volatility. A staggering drop of 99.99624% from five years ago indicates historic market interest that has since dwindled. With a current market cap of zero and no trading volume data, market sentiment around Moonie NFT USD remains cautious. As traders look for undervalued assets, MNYUSD's steady price might appear as a potential turnaround point when market conditions change. Any breakthrough could drive renewed interest, considering its low-cost entry point.

The future of Moonie NFT USD hinges on market perception and broader economic conditions. Forecasts suggest a seven-year potential increase to $0.000548, offering a long-term possibility. However, with technical indicators showing no movement, actual recovery could require significant shifts in market dynamics or adoption. Potential regulatory changes or technological advancements could act as catalysts. Given its history, MNYUSD could experience sudden shifts based on external factors. As always, forecasts can change due to macroeconomic shifts, regulations, or unexpected events affecting the crypto market.

Though Moonie NFT USD shows no immediate price movement, its historical performance and current technical readings suggest a complex outlook. With a speculative future forecast, it may attract cautious investors awaiting broader market developments.

MNYUSD remains at a steady price, showing no recent trading activity or significant market interest, reflected by unchanged technical indicators and zero market cap.

The long-term forecast suggests a potential rise up to $0.000548 in seven years, but this is contingent on market conditions and adoption trends changing.

Investment suitability depends on individual risk tolerance. MNYUSD is currently stable but has a history of significant declines, indicating speculative risk.

Key indicators include RSI and MACD, both at zero, suggesting a lack of momentum. The Relative Volatility Index and Moving Average Envelopes also show no activity.

Historically, MNYUSD has declined sharply, with a near 99.99624% drop over five years, reflecting high past volatility and speculative trading nature.

We have fined password manager provider LastPass UK Ltd £1.2 million following a 2022 data breach that compromised the personal information of up to 1.6 million of its UK users. 

We found that LastPass failed to implement sufficiently robust technical and security measures, which ultimately enabled a hacker to gain unauthorised access to its backup database. There is no evidence that hackers were able to unencrypt customer passwords as these are stored locally on customer devices and not by LastPass. 

The incidents occurred in August 2022 when a hacker gained access first to a corporate laptop of an employee based in Europe and then to a US-based employee's personal laptop on which the hacker implanted malware and then was able to capture the employee's master password. The combined detail from both incidents enabled the hacker to access LastPass' backup database and take personal information which included customer names, emails, phone numbers, and stored website URLs. 

John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said: 

“Password managers are a safe and effective tool for businesses and the public to manage their numerous login details and we continue to encourage their use. However, as is clear from this incident, businesses offering these services should ensure that system access and use is restricted to ensure risks of attack are significantly reduced. 

“LastPass customers had a right to expect the personal information they entrusted to the company would be kept safe and secure. However, the company fell short of this expectation, resulting in the proportionate fine being announced today. 

“I call on all UK business to take note of the outcome of this investigation and urgently review their own systems and procedures to make sure, as best as possible, that they are not leaving their customers and themselves exposed to similar risks”. 

Our investigation found no evidence that encrypted passwords and other credentials were able to be unencrypted by the hacker. This is due to LastPass' use of a ‘zero knowledge' encryption system, whereby the master password required to access a password vault is stored locally on a customer's own device and never shared with LastPass. 

We urge organisations to ensure internal security policies explicitly consider and address data breach risks. Where risks are identified access should be restricted to specific user groups.

Businesses wishing to review their procedures should turn to our and the National Cyber Security Centre websites which provide a rich source of information detailing ways to improve practices including Working from home – security checklist for employers, Data security guidance and Device security guidance.

It is important for your customers to receive timely and relevant information to support decisions about their finances, while having their direct marketing preferences and data protection rights respected. This is crucial in order for customers to trust the information they receive, helping them to make informed decisions and pursue their financial goals.

Under the framework set out in the FCA's policy statement (PS25/22), authorised firms would be able to offer a new type of help called ‘targeted support' and make suggestions to an individual based on them being in a group of consumers with common characteristics. These could include customers who may be currently drawing down on their pension unsustainably, not saving enough for retirement, or who could be in a position to invest some of their cash savings. Targeted support aims to help consumers navigate their financial lives and tackle some of the difficult financial decisions we all face: how to save; invest; and prepare for a comfortable retirement.

We have heard from firms that they would benefit from regulatory clarity on how targeted support messaging interacts with existing direct marketing rules under data protection law.  

This joint statement addresses these calls for regulatory clarity. The statement has also been published in parallel to the publication of the FCA's Policy Statement on targeted support and HM Treasury's response to its policy note on targeted support.   

Summary of firms' data protection and direct marketing obligations 

Data protection law enables people's personal information to be used in ways that empower and benefit them, while safeguarding their rights. The ICO's regulatory approach supports this, seeking to create an environment in which people are protected, while ensuring that organisations which process personal information can operate and innovate efficiently and responsibly 1.

For targeted support, you will need to process personal information to align customers with a particular consumer segment before sending tailored messages. You must ensure that you comply with UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), Data (Use and Access) Act (DUAA) and the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations 2003 (PECR) when delivering targeted support, for example by:  

ICO guidance explains how the soft opt-in can be used to send marketing by electronic mail. Under the soft opt-in you can only send electronic mail marketing about similar products and services that people would reasonably expect to receive. For example, a bank that provides a customer with a current account may consider that the customer would reasonably expect emails about other products commonly sold byjoint banks. 

When a message is not direct marketing, it can be communicated to all customers, including those who have opted out of direct marketing, not consented, or when no ‘soft opt-in' opportunity was available.

How firms can engage their customers about targeted support 

You can engage with your customers about targeted support, so that customers can find out how you support effective decision making and better financial outcomes, while ensuring the UK GDPR, the Data Protection Act 2018 and PECR are complied with. 

Ways that firms can actively promote their targeted support offering that are not covered by direct marketing rules  

You can promote targeted support to all of your customers in ways which are not covered by direct marketing rules and PECR. For example: 

These types of messages can be broadcast to all customers and can be promotional and marketing material so long as the messaging is not directed at any one particular individual.  

Respecting people's direct marketing preferences, and providing clear choices 

You must carefully consider what messages the permissions from customers cover.  

If a customer agrees to receive direct marketing in relation to targeted support, this means that you can only use their information for this purpose and send messages promoting actions, products or services that relate to the provision of targeted support (including initiating its delivery). It doesn't mean that you can use their information for other purposes which are not part of targeted support (unless these customers have, for example, given previous permissions for other such purposes). 

When customers are seeking to give or change their direct marketing and/or targeted support permissions, they must be given clearly communicated options, which may cover the different types of processing and messages you envisage. Consent must not be bundled with other purposes.  

You can also remind people about their direct marketing and targeted support preferences, if the reminder forms a minor and incidental addition to a message that you are sending anyway. The content must be for another purpose and not include marketing material. For example, an annual statement that includes a message at the end saying how a customer can update their preferences for direct marketing and targeted support (but not encouraging them to change their mind). 

Engaging customers who have provided permission to receive  direct marketing 

For some customers, you may already have appropriate direct marketing permissions to send targeted support messages. As this is a new processing activity, you will need to consider how you comply with data protection requirements such as having an appropriate lawful basis for the underlying processing of personal data (likely consent or legitimate interest), provide clear information about the processing and give customers a way to opt out.

This includes ensuring you are transparent with customers about the data processing taking place, including any profiling, and the messages customers should expect to receive from you; and ensuring customers are given the opportunity to object to this data processing.  

Engaging customers who have not provided permission to receive  electronic direct marketing  

Where customers have not consented to receiving electronic direct marketing, and the soft opt in does not apply, you must respect the direct marketing preferences of your customers. However, this does not prevent you from making customers aware of your new authorisation to provide targeted support, where you have been provided with this authorisation.    

You could do this by sending a message (eg an email) to customers which doesn't constitute direct marketing but ensures customers are aware of your targeted support authorisation from the FCA so that the customer can choose, if they wish, to be part of it.  

For example, such a message could factually and neutrally reference information (but not encourage a course of action such as clicking on a particular link) on:  

Engaging with customers to provide important messages about their finances 

Customers must still continue to receive important messages about their finances regardless of whether or not they've given permission for direct marketing or targeted support. The ICO and FCA have previously produced joint statements 3 on examples of messages which are important for supporting all customers along their financial journey, such as: 

In these messages, you can remind customers that you are authorised to offer targeted support, using a neutrally toned, non-promotional factual message to tell them where to find more information (eg on your website or in app). You can also tell customers why you are contacting them, for example, because you think they may be in one of the above situations.  

Next steps 

The ICO and FCA will consider further options for future engagement from early 2026 to continue to support firms who want to contact customers about targeted support.

Norges Bank has completed its fifth phase of central bank digital currency (CBDC) research, announcing it has no plans to proceed with either retail or wholesale issuance for the Norwegian Krone at this stage. It will publish the details of its research in due course.

“Norges Bank has concluded that introducing a central bank digital currency is currently not warranted,”  said Governor Ida Wolden Bache. “The need for such a currency may, however, change in the future. We will be ready to introduce a central bank digital currency if it becomes necessary to maintain an efficient and secure payment system. We look forward to cooperating with the financial industry and other central banks on work in this area.”

The decision reflected several considerations, including the lack of off-the-shelf systems and standards. In late 2023 the central bank released results of its previous research phase, highlighting that it did not see the need for a retail CBDC. It also conducted cross border retail CBDC trials with Sweden and Israel. The latest research explored specific aspects of a retail CBDC in order to be prepared, and also explored wholesale CBDC using distributed ledger technology.

Norway is hitting pause on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and I have to say, it actually makes sense. They're not diving headfirst into the digital currency pool just because everyone else is doing it. Instead, they're saying, “Hold up, let's see how our current payment systems hold up first.” 

Norges Bank, Norway's central bank, is saying that their current payment systems are already reliable and speedy enough. So, they don't feel the need for a digital krone, at least not right now. This is their way of saying that they want to make sure whatever new technology they adopt is stable and secure.

To break it down:
- No Rush: They don't see an urgent need for a CBDC, given their existing systems work just fine.
- Wait-and-See: They're taking their time, unlike Sweden and the European Central Bank. No peer pressure here.
- Research Continues: The bank is still looking at CBDC tech, so the door isn't completely shut.

Norway's digital payment scene is already world-class. Debit cards, mobile wallets, and bank-driven payment channels are everywhere. So, do they really need a CBDC? Everything seems to be flowing smoothly.

But there are risks involved if they decide to go for it. Like, what if all deposits move from banks to a CBDC? It could cause some serious credit issues. And, think about bank runs—converting deposits into digital currency would be way too easy.

Also, privacy? Forget it. A CBDC would mean all financial data is centralized and who knows who's watching.

Norges Bank isn't completely done with digital currency. They're planning to publish a technical report about their research on things like tokenization frameworks and alternative settlement layers. 

This just shows that there's still room for innovation while keeping the current systems functional. Fintech startups need to ask themselves if their products are really filling gaps in the market. Adaptability seems key here.

As digital finance changes, CBDCs aren't just about cash. Privacy, cybersecurity, and regulations are big deals. 

Startups should be about transparency and data protection, and make sure they're abiding by the law. They should build things that make systems stronger and think about backup plans for digital payments. 

Norway's cautious research-first approach is a great lesson for fintech startups. It's not about rushing to be first; it's about being ready and compliant. 

Startups should think about how CBDCs can work with their products to make payments better for everyone. By using CBDC platforms to innovate, they can keep things competitive and stop a few big players from taking over.

Norway's measured pace on CBDCs shows that it's wise to be careful rather than hasty. For startups, it's a matter of focusing on real needs, following the rules, and being open to innovation in a traditional banking world.

Norges Bank pauses Norway CBDC launch, citing a strong digital payments system while keeping options open amid Europe's crypto shift.

Norges Bank will not launch a central bank digital currency at this stage, saying Norway's current payment system remains secure and efficient. The decision follows a multi-year review of digital currency options and places Norway among the European countries choosing caution as CBDC debates continue.

The bank said its infrastructure serves consumers and banks without major gaps, so a digital currency is not required for now. It added that ongoing work will still examine how a CBDC could support financial stability, privacy protections and settlement efficiency if future needs arise.

Norges Bank emphasized that payments in Norway already rely heavily on electronic rails, which reduces the urgency to introduce a digital alternative to cash. Officials noted that the system handles both retail and interbank transactions with high reliability, so any shift must offer clear benefits.

The decision lands as crypto adoption widens across Europe and regulators weigh the role of public digital money alongside private tokens and stablecoins. Norway's move signals that strong domestic systems can delay CBDC rollouts even as neighboring countries advance pilots.

Norges Bank said it will monitor how digital assets, stablecoins and cross-border settlement tools evolve under European rules. The bank also plans further studies on tokenization and resilience in case private digital money gains more traction.

This update positions Norway as a cautious participant in the wider shift toward blockchain-based financial infrastructures, while keeping open the option of a future CBDC if market conditions or technology change.

Shalini is a crypto reporter who provides in-depth reports on daily developments and regulatory shifts in the cryptocurrency sector.

Norway's central bank has decided it does not need a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for now, capping several years of research and signalling that the country's existing payment system still does the job for consumers, banks and merchants.

Norges Bank said Wednesday that introducing a digital krone is “currently not warranted” after assessing whether a CBDC is needed to keep payments in Norwegian currency secure, efficient and attractive. 

Cash use in Norway has fallen to among the lowest levels globally, which had added urgency to the debate over a potential digital alternative.

“The Norwegian payment system is efficient and secure,” the bank said, citing stable operations, fast settlement, low economic cost and “sound” contingency arrangements. It added that work is already under way to further strengthen these back up systems.

Governor Ida Wolden Bache stressed that the decision is about timing, not closing the door. 

“Norges Bank has concluded that introducing a central bank digital currency is currently not warranted. The need for such a currency may, however, change in the future. We will be ready to introduce a central bank digital currency if it becomes necessary to maintain an efficient and secure payment system,” she said.

The bank distinguishes between two main types of CBDC, retail and wholesale. A retail CBDC would serve as a universally accessible means of payment similar to cash and deposits, while a wholesale CBDC would be limited to banks and other financial institutions. In the wholesale model, deposits at the central bank are represented as digital units, or tokens, in a ledger based on blockchain technology and can be used for interbank settlement.

Norges Bank is not stepping away from tokenization. It says token-based systems can deliver innovation, efficiency gains and lower settlement risk, even as it warns that other risks and open questions remain and the eventual scale of use is uncertain. 

The bank plans to keep running experiments, often with other payment system participants, to test tokenised solutions in practice.

The central bank will publish a report on its CBDC research and lay out more detailed plans for further work in the first quarter of next year. It will also continue to monitor international developments, including the Eurosystem's work on a potential digital euro and emerging standards that could one day support shared CBDC infrastructure.

December saw another great leap forward for the UAE's growing status as a global Digital Asset Hub with the announcement of Crypto.com's Strategic Partnership with Sirius International Holding (SIH), the technology investment arm of International Holdings Company (IHC). Their shared aim will be building and enhancing the digital asset/tokenization ecosystems in both areas. This is an important milestone in the fast growth in blockchain technology and clear rules around it.  

The partnership is coming at the right time, as the UAE is emerging as top in the Middle East for cryptocurrency and blockchain projects. The UAE stands out as a pivotal hub in the MENA region for asset tokenization and settlement systems, proudly holding the 6th position globally in cryptocurrency adoption, as highlighted by industry data.

Sirius International Holding, founded in 2022 and headquartered in Abu Dhabi, has positioned itself at the forefront of the UAE's digital transformation initiatives. Sirius, the digital arm of $240 billion conglomerate IHC, builds sovereign blockchain and digital finance infrastructure and builds secure, government-backed digital assets and currencies.

Crypto.com's choice to go with Sirius is a strategic choice for the exchange to strengthen its institutional presence in the region. The exchange has established a significant presence in the UAE in compliance with the regulations set by Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority and Abu Dhabi Global Market. Crypto.com, Binance, and Bybit received UAE licenses due to the country's zero personal income tax, attractive corporate tax rates, and transparent regulatory structure.

The association comes at a moment in which tokenization of real-world assets has become one of the most revolutionary trends in the global financial marketplace. Analysts believe the tokenization business is valued at $30 trillion with institutional adoption growing rapidly in advanced financial hubs.

Sirius International Holding has taken sovereign blockchain and digital finance as an integral part of our investment strategy. The company channels resources into infrastructure that transforms how governments and enterprises handle digital transactions. Sirius gets access to one of the world's largest cryptocurrency platforms, Crypto.com, with its large user base and technology infrastructure.

In the case of Crypto.Com, such partnership provides access to the network of government connections and institutional relationships that Sirius has in the region. Sirius operates in an ecosystem comprising over fifty government and industry efforts in 20 countries, ranging from real estate tokenization to blockchain banking.

This partnership announcement coincides with what industry observers are calling a blockbuster month for cryptocurrency activity in the UAE. In December 2025, Emirates held more than 50,000 international guests at 8 key crypto conferences and summits, allowing key industry executives, institutional investors and policymakers to network as never before.

The regulatory environment has been one of the key differentiators in the UAE being able to attract digital asset companies. The VARA and ADGM frameworks balance innovation and investor protection with the international Financial Action Task Force-recommended anti-money laundering criteria.

Recent market data indicates that stablecoins account for over 90% of crypto payments to professionals in the region. The UAE attracts high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors with its 72% crypto adoption rate and no capital gains tax on digital assets.

Sirius International Holdings and Crypto.com have partnered to accelerate the movement of the Middle East from a largely retail-driven crypto marketplace to one that is based on institutional-level infrastructure. This collaboration seeks to leverage Crypto.com's established global presence and technological capabilities with Sirius' connections to government and sovereign digital infrastructure development to promote widespread adoption of blockchain technology within both governments and large enterprises. Partnerships such as this show how the UAE's legislative and regulatory framework is supporting bridging the gap between blockchain technology and conventional financial institutions. This approach is supporting the growth of an institutionally built, and vibrant, digital asset marketplace.

All things being equal, easier Fed monetary policy tends to lead to a weaker U.S. dollar, falling bond yields, rising precious metals prices and gains for risk assets, bitcoin BTC$90,193.08 and crypto among them.

Following the Fed's rate cut yesterday, the dollar is indeed weaker — the DXY falling to a seven-week low — precious metals are sharply higher, with silver touching a new record of $64 per ounce, and the 10-year Treasury yield has pulled back to 4.12% from 4.20%.

In what's become a familiar story, though, crypto is not participating. After (very) briefly rallying above $94,000 in the minutes following the rate cut, bitcoin BTC$90,193.08 has slumped to $89,400, now down 3% over the past 24 hours. Ether ETH$3,202.29 is down 5.5%, while XRP and solana slide closer to 4%.

Possibly souring the mood in crypto are declining AI-related names following Oracle's (ORCL) disappointing quarterly earnings released last night. Oracle has plunged 14% on Thursday, pulling down familiar names like Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom. The Nasdaq is lower by 1.2%.

Bitcoin mining stocks — many of whom have pivoted business models to focus instead on AI infrastructure — are lower alongside: Hut 8 (HUT), Iren (IREN), Cipher (CIFR) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are among those with losses in the 5%-6% range.

Leading bitcoin treasury player Strategy (MSTR) is off by 6.4%, while crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) is down 5%. Robinhood (HOOD) is lower by 8.3% after a November update showed a disappointing slump in crypto trading volumes.

Fintech giant Revolut and Binance-owned Trust Wallet announced Thursday that they are teaming up to make crypto purchases faster and easier for European users, without giving up control of their assets.

The two companies are launching an integration that lets Trust Wallet users buy crypto using RevolutPay, debit or credit cards and bank transfers, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

Users in the EU can fund their wallets instantly and, in some cases, with zero fees. The press release said that unlike many other fintech-to-crypto offerings, users never have to deposit their funds into a centralized exchange.

The cryptocurrencies goes straight into their Trust Wallet, a self-custodial app the release said was used by more than 220 million people.

This partnership comes as Revolut accelerates its push into crypto. The London-based fintech reached a $75 billion valuation last month in a secondary share sale backed by firms including Coatue, Fidelity and NVIDIA's NVentures. It also secured a MiCA license via Cyprus, giving it regulatory approval to offer crypto services across the European Economic Area.

The company reported $4 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in pre-tax profit for 2024 and has expanded globally with new banking licenses in Mexico and Colombia. In November, Revolut also began working with Polygon Labs to enable crypto remittances in USDC, USDT, and POL via the Polygon blockchain.

The initial rollout of its partnership with Trust Wallet supports bitcoin, ether, solana, USDC and USDT. More assets are expected to be added down the road.

Risk assets are under pressure Thursday despite the Fed's rate cut, with Oracle's earnings miss piling on alongside the central bank's hawkish guidance. 

Bitcoin BTC$90,193.08, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, is trading near $90,000, representing a 2.8% drop over 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. Futures tied to Wall Street's tech heavy index, Nasdaq, are down 0.80%. 

Late Wednesday, Oracle published its fiscal second quarter 2026 earnings (Q2 FY26), covering the period ended Nov. 30, 2025. Total revenue came in slightly below consensus, with legacy software revenue down and new license sales particularly weak.

This has once again highlighted the gap between the debt-fueled AI infrastructure spending spree, the promised revenue and the reality of delayed cash flows hitting the coffers. 

The Financial Times reported that Oracle's earnings were overshadowed by a $15 billion jump in planned data centre spending and a revenue miss, while its long-term debt increased to $99.6 billion, a jump of 25% from one-year ago. The cloud infrastructure revenue came in at $4.1 billion, below expectations, relying further on debt expansion. 

The report quoted Morgan Stanley as forecasting a surge in Oracle's net debt to about $290 billion by 2028. 

Shares on Oracle fell over 10% in after market hours, dragging down the AI stocks and offering bearish cues to the crypto market. The price swoon renewed social media focus on Oracle's five-year credit default, a type of an insurance contracts that reflects perceived default risk. 

It has jumped to the highest since 2022. The surge reflects the material repricing of risk, according to the Special Situations newsletter. 

""Historically, ORCL CDS traded around 20–40 bps, so 117 bps represents a material repricing of risk, but not a distressed profile,"" the newsletter service said on X.

""Oracle 5Y CDS graph looks exciting $ORCL until you run the math and realize that it is only pricing in 1.93% probability of default per year and a 9% 5 year cumulative probability of default,"" it added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Archaeologists Broke Open the Great Wall of China—and Found a Treasure Trove of Artifacts","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a69636223/great-wall-cannon/","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

The discovery's highlight was a 247-pound cannon from the Ming dynasty, but archaeologists also found remains of crops and turquoise pieces.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

China's famed Great Wall outside of Beijing continues to reveal secrets of a past Chinese life. The latest glimpse into that rich history, unveiled by a recent archaeological excavation, features a Ming Dynasty-era cannon. This formidable weapon shows the military focus of the Great Wall while also offering insight into how ancient Chinese and Europeans traded military know-how. 

A brick-by-brick restoration of the wall offered an opportunity to excavate the Jiankou section, which spans across a mountainous region near Beijing. Archaeologists excavated three watchtowers and the connecting walls, all of which held remnants of both military and daily life from China's past.  

The most distinct find, according to Shang Heng, associate research fellow at the Beijing Institute of Archaeology, was a Ming Dynasty-era cannon likely from 1632. Heng said a well-preserved inscription on the cannon provides an opportunity for experts to research the manufacturing and military technology of the time. 

The 35-inch, 247-pound cannon features the inscription “Chongzhen Year 5,” what we would now call 1632 C.E. The cannon also has similarities to European-style red-coat cannons, including the size of the barrel. The cannon fits within the battery platforms found on the wall, showing a weapon of its style and size was likely a standard atop watchtowers. 

“This provides crucial physical proof of Chinese-Western military technology exchange,” Heng said, according to the Global Times.

Beyond the cannon, crews also uncovered storage rooms used by troops stationed on the wall, including a heated brick bed and stove in Watchtower 118 which demonstrates how soldiers would have lived. Watchtower 117 featured an immigration monument dated to 1573 C.E., giving a construction date for that section. 

Three different individual bricks offered additional information. Two bricks included inscriptions noting weight specifications, upending previous beliefs on how Ming-era brick kiln operations occurred. Investigations into the lime mortar showed a high-magnesium lime mixture with plant fibers to help with adhesion, further defining Ming-era construction techniques. 

The third brick inscription wasn't so much about construction techniques but living conditions. The words, translated as “nothing but alcohol or worry; three years of toil turned my hair white,” were likely inscribed by a wall builder. 

“These findings transform the Great Wall from a cold military structure into a living historical landscape integrating defense, cultural exchange, and daily life,” Heng said.

Researchers discovered plenty of crops and medicinal plants, indicative of everything from diets to medical know-how of the time. Investigation into animal bones highlighted both domesticated and wild animals at the site, including evidence of animal butchering. 

The excavations offered more than just weapons and other staples of military life. Crews discovered 28 turquoise artifacts, according to the People's Daily. Deeper investigation into the pieces suggest they originated from mines near the provinces of Hubei, Henan, and Shaanxi, further evidence into the trading practices across northern China. 

Within one of the most famous fortifications in the world were remnants of lives lived long ago, and further excavations may offer even more insights. “The Great Wall's landscape and geography have barely changed,” Heng said, “making it ideal for time-travel-style restoration research.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The biological process of a zygote eventually transforming into a living, breathing human is one of the true masterpieces of evolution—but the process is far from perfect. Mutations, malformities, and strange fusions can cause a variety of birth defects and other kinds of biological strangeness (such as chimerism). 

Now, in a new study published in the journal Nature Communications, a team of scientists (from the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain, and Harvard Medical School in Boston) has identified a “weakness” in DNA that may drive mosaic mutations—a subset of post-zygotic mutations that can create different cell lines in one person. The vulnerable region is located within the first 100 base pairs following the beginning of genes, which are known as transcription start sites (TSS). 

“These sequences are extremely prone to mutations and rank among the most functionally important regions in the entire human genome, together with protein-coding sequences,” Donate Weghorn, the senior author of the study from the Center for Genomic Regulation, said in a press statement. “Finding a new source of mutations, particularly those affecting the human germline, doesn't happen often.”

The authors discovered that these mosaic mutations usually took place after conception during the first stages of cell division in the embryo. This is similar to chimerism in some respects, but mosaic mutations occur from a single zygote, whereas chimerism  typically involves the fusion of two fertilized eggs that create different cell lines. 

While chimera cells are typically present throughout the entire body, these mosaic mutations are not as evenly distributed, which is why they've remained undetected until now. In fact, a person who carries these mutations may never notice due to a lack of symptoms. However, if offspring inherit these genetic changes, they can carry over to every living cell and cause a variety of health issues and defects. 

To uncover this well-hidden vulnerability, scientists relied on the Genome Aggregation Database (which gathers genomic data from a variety of human sequencing projects) and the U.K. Biobank to create a pool of some 225,000 transcription start sites. This data was then cross-referenced with eleven family studies that provided details about mosaic mutations specifically. Within these vulnerable TSS regions, researchers found mutations in the starting regions of genes impacting cancer, brain function, and abnormal limb development. 

Luckily, there is some good news. Rare variants of mutations (typically indicating a recent genetic change) contained a particularly strong concentration of mutations, but those changes lessened in more common variants. This suggests that natural selection slowly removed these mutations, and over generations in particular families, they eventually disappeared entirely.

This research could help improve the challenging study of mosaic mutations, which are hard to pinpoint compared to mutations present in every parent cell. It could also fine-tune genome mutation models, which might currently set the baseline mutation number at these TSS regions too low and thus alter the outcome of the model.

“If a model doesn't know this region is naturally mutation-rich, it might expect, say, 10 mutations but observe 50. If the correct baseline is 80, then 50 means fewer than expected and is a sign harmful changes are being removed by natural selection,” Weghorn said in a press statement. “You would completely miss the importance of that gene.”

A zygote's first moment of existence is one of chaos and a building pressure to grow, divide, and grow again. While cells can often repair errors that pop up, some mistakes get left behind. Now, scientists have a whole new area to analyze when trying to solve a mutation mystery.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New research reveals how everyday cues secretly shape your habits","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251210223635.htm","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 03:53:54 GMT","

Researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center have identified a way the brain's learning system can shift depending on the activity of a particular protein. Their work shows that the ability to connect cues with rewarding outcomes can be strengthened or weakened when this protein becomes more or less active. This process helps determine whether the brain responds to signals that lead to positive behaviors or ignores cues tied to harmful habits, including those involved in smoking addiction.

""Our ability to link certain cues or stimuli with positive or rewarding experiences is a basic brain process, and it is disrupted in many conditions such as addiction, depression, and schizophrenia,"" says Alexey Ostroumov, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacology & Physiology at Georgetown University School of Medicine and senior author of the study. ""For example, drug abuse can cause changes in the KCC2 protein that is crucial for normal learning. By interfering with this mechanism, addictive substances can hijack the learning process.""

The study, supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was published December 9 in Nature Communications.

How KCC2 Shapes Dopamine Activity and Reward Learning

The team found that changes in learning can occur when levels of the KCC2 protein shift. When KCC2 levels are reduced, dopamine neurons fire more rapidly, which encourages the formation of new reward associations. These dopamine neurons produce and release dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for motivation, reward processing, and motor control.

To better understand this relationship, researchers studied rodent brain tissue and monitored the behavior of rats during Pavlovian cue-reward tests. In these classic experiments, a brief sound alerts the rats that a sugar cube is on the way. Beyond analyzing how KCC2 affects the pace of neuron firing, the investigators discovered that neurons firing in a coordinated pattern can amplify dopamine activity in a surprising way. Short bursts of dopamine appear to serve as potent learning signals that help the brain assign meaning and value to shared experiences.

Why Everyday Cues Can Trigger Cravings

""Our findings help explain why powerful and unwanted associations form so easily, like when a smoker who always pairs morning coffee with a cigarette later finds that just drinking coffee triggers a strong craving to smoke,"" notes Ostroumov. ""Preventing even relatively benign drug-induced associations with situations or places, or restoring healthy learning mechanisms, can help develop better treatments for addiction and related disorders.""

How Diazepam and Other Drugs Influence Neuron Coordination

The researchers also examined whether drugs that act on specific cellular receptors, including benzodiazepines such as diazepam, could alter learning processes. Earlier work showed that shifts in KCC2 production, and therefore in neuron activity, can change how diazepam (valium) produces its calming effects in the brain. The current study adds another layer to this understanding by showing that neurons do more than increase or decrease activity. They can coordinate their firing patterns, and when that coordination occurs, they transmit information more effectively. The team found that diazepam can support this coordinated activity in their experiments.

Methods and the Importance of Using Rats for Behavioral Tests

""To reach our conclusions, we combined many experimental approaches, including electrophysiology, pharmacology, fiber photometry, behavior, computational modeling, and molecular analyses,"" says the study's first author Joyce Woo, a PhD candidate in Ostroumov's lab.

She explained that rats were chosen for the behavioral portion of the research because they typically perform more consistently than mice on longer and more complex tasks. Their reliability in reward-learning experiments allowed the research team to gather more stable and informative data.

Broader Implications for Brain Disorders and Treatment Strategies

""We believe these discoveries extend beyond basic learning research,"" says Ostroumov. ""They reveal new ways the brain regulates communication between neurons. And because this communication can go wrong in different brain disorders, our hope is that by preempting these disruptions, or by fixing normal communication when it's impaired, we can help develop better treatments for a wide range of brain disorders.""

Additional Georgetown contributors include Ajay Uprety, Daniel Reid, Irene Chang, Aelon Ketema Samuel, Helena de Carvalho Schuch and Caroline C Swain.

Ostroumov and his co-authors report having no personal financial interests related to the study.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Researchers catch atoms standing still inside molten metal","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251210092017.htm","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 09:16:55 GMT","

Researchers have found that, inside a liquid, not every atom is moving. Some atoms stay fixed in place even when the temperature is very high. These motionless atoms have a major effect on how a liquid turns into a solid, including the creation of an unusual state of matter known as a corralled supercooled liquid.

The way materials solidify is crucial in many natural processes, such as mineralization, the formation of ice, and the folding of protein fibrils. Solidification is also central to many technologies, from pharmaceuticals to metal-based industries, including aviation, construction, and electronics.

Imaging Molten Metal at the Atomic Scale

To explore how solids form, scientists from the University of Nottingham and the University of Ulm in Germany used transmission electron microscopy to watch molten metal nano-droplets as they solidified. Their findings were published on December 9 in the journal ACS Nano.

Professor Andrei Khlobystov, who led the team, said, ""When we consider matter, we typically think of three states: gas, liquid, and solid. While the behavior of atoms in gases and solids is easier to understand and describe, liquids remain more mysterious.""

Complex Motion Inside Liquids

In liquids, atoms move in a complicated, crowded way, similar to people jostling through a busy street. They zip past one another at high speed while still interacting. This motion is especially difficult to study during the key moment when a liquid begins to solidify, a stage that sets the material's structure and many of its functional properties.

Graphene ""Hob"" Experiments and the SALVE Instrument

Dr. Christopher Leist, who performed transmission electron microscopy experiments at Ulm using the unique low-voltage SALVE instrument, said, ""We began by melting metal nanoparticles, such as platinum, gold, and palladium, deposited on an atomically thin support -- graphene. We used graphene as a sort of hob for this process to heat the particles, and as they melted, their atoms began to move rapidly, as expected. However, to our surprise, we found that some atoms remained stationary.""

Further analysis showed that these stationary atoms are strongly attached to the supporting material at specific locations called point defects, and this strong bonding persists even at very high temperatures. By concentrating the electron beam on selected areas, the team could create more defects and therefore adjust how many atoms stayed pinned in place within the liquid.

Wave-Particle Duality and a New Phase of Matter

Professor Ute Kaiser, who established the SALVE center at Ulm University, said, ""Our experiments have surprised us as we directly observe the wave-particle duality of electrons in the electron beam. We visualize the material using electrons as waves. At the same time, electrons behave like particles, delivering discrete bursts of momentum that can either move or, surprisingly, even fix atoms at the edge of a liquid metal. This remarkable observation has allowed us to discover a new phase of matter.""

The same research team has previously produced films of chemical reactions involving single molecules, including the first direct recording of a chemical bond breaking and reforming in real time. Their approach makes it possible to watch chemistry unfold at the level of individual atoms.

Atomic Corrals and Disrupted Crystal Growth

In the new study, the scientists discovered that stationary atoms play a powerful role in directing how a liquid turns solid. When only a few atoms are pinned, a crystal can grow from the liquid and continue to expand until the entire nanoparticle becomes solid. In contrast, when many atoms are held in place, they interfere with this process and block the formation of any crystal at all.

Professor Andrei Khlobystov from the University of Nottingham said ""The effect is particularly striking when stationary atoms create a ring that surrounds the liquid. Once the liquid is trapped in this atomic corral, it can remain in a liquid state even at temperatures significantly below its freezing point, which for platinum can be as low as 350 degrees Celsius -- that is more than 1,000 degrees below what is typically expected.""

Corralled Supercooled Liquid and Unstable Amorphous Metal

If the temperature is lowered enough, the corralled liquid eventually turns solid, but not into a regular crystal. Instead, it becomes an amorphous solid, a form of metal without the ordered structure of a crystal. This amorphous metal is highly unstable and exists only as long as the stationary atoms continue to confine it. Once that confinement breaks down, the built-up tension is released and the metal rearranges into its usual crystalline form.

Hybrid Metal State and Catalysis

Dr. Jesum Alves Fernandes, expert in catalysis at the University of Nottingham, said, ""The discovery of a new hybrid state of metal is significant. Since platinum on carbon is one of the most widely used catalysts globally, finding a confined liquid state with non-classical phase behavior could change our understanding of how catalysts work. This advancement may lead to the design of self-cleaning catalysts with improved activity and longevity.""

Toward New Forms of Matter and Cleaner Technologies

Up to now, nanoscale corralling has only been achieved for photons and electrons; this study is the first demonstration that atoms themselves can be corralled in a similar way. Professor Andrei Khlobystov said, ""Our achievement may herald a new form of matter combining characteristics of solids and liquids in the same material.""

The researchers suggest that by carefully arranging the positions of pinned atoms on a surface, they may be able to build larger and more intricate atomic corrals. Such control over rare metals could lead to more efficient use of these materials in clean technologies, including energy conversion and energy storage.

This work is funded by the EPSRC Program Grant 'Metal atoms on surfaces and interfaces (MASI) for sustainable future.'

Researchers have developed a catalyst sourced from renewable plant waste that shows strong potential for speeding up clean hydrogen production. The material is produced by embedding nickel oxide and iron oxide nanoparticles into carbon fibers made from lignin, creating a structure that improves both efficiency and durability during the oxygen evolution reaction, a crucial part of water electrolysis.

The study, published in Biochar X, reports that the catalyst reaches a low overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm² and remains highly stable for more than 50 hours when operating at elevated current density. These performance levels point to a viable, low cost alternative to the precious metal catalysts typically used in large-scale water splitting.

""Oxygen evolution is one of the biggest barriers to efficient hydrogen production,"" said corresponding author Yanlin Qin of the Guangdong University of Technology. ""Our work shows that a catalyst made from lignin, a low-value byproduct of the paper and biorefinery industries, can deliver high activity and exceptional durability. This provides a greener and more economical route to large-scale hydrogen generation.""

Transforming Lignin Into a Functional Carbon Framework

Lignin is one of the most abundant natural polymers, yet it is often burned for minimal energy return. In this work, the team converted lignin into carbon fibers using electrospinning and thermal treatment. These fibers serve as a conductive and supportive framework for the metal oxide particles. The resulting catalyst, known as NiO/Fe3O4@LCFs, contains nitrogen-doped carbon fibers that offer fast charge transport, high surface area, and strong structural stability.

Microscopy revealed that the nickel and iron oxides form a nanoscale heterojunction within the carbon fiber structure. This interface plays a central role in the oxygen evolution reaction by helping intermediate molecules bind and detach at optimal rates. Pairing these metal oxides with a conductive carbon network improves electron movement and prevents the particles from clumping together, which is a frequent issue in conventional base metal catalysts.

Verified Activity Through Advanced Testing

Electrochemical measurements showed that the material performs better than catalysts containing only one metal, especially under the high current conditions needed for real world electrolysis systems. The catalyst also exhibits a Tafel slope of 138 mV per decade, indicating more rapid reaction kinetics. Additional evidence from in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations supports the proposed mechanism, confirming that the engineered interface efficiently drives oxygen evolution.

Scalable Design Using Widely Available Biomass

""Our goal was to develop a catalyst that not only performs well but is scalable and rooted in sustainable materials,"" said co-corresponding author Xueqing Qiu. ""Because lignin is produced in huge quantities worldwide, the approach offers a realistic path toward greener industrial hydrogen production technologies.""

The findings underscore the increasing value of biomass-derived materials in energy conversion applications. Combining renewable carbon supports with carefully designed metal oxide interfaces aligns with global efforts to create low cost and environmentally friendly clean energy technologies.

The researchers note that this method could be adapted to different metal combinations and catalytic reactions, opening new opportunities for designing next generation electrocatalysts based on abundant natural resources.

Young people in Australia can no longer use popular social media platforms.Credit: David Gray/AFP via Getty

This week, Australia became the first country to ban children aged under 16 from using most social media platforms. Many teenagers in the country are furious about the policy, but for social scientists, it offers a natural experiment to study the effects of social media restrictions on young people. 

Technology companies have had a year to come up with ways to stop teens using their platforms, including Facebook, X, Reddit, YouTube, Threads and Snapchat. From 10 December, companies must take reasonable steps to prevent Australian's under 16 from creating or keeping accounts, or risk fines of up to Aus$49.5million (US$33 million).

Do smartphones and social media really harm teens' mental health?

Do smartphones and social media really harm teens' mental health?

Other countries including France, Denmark and Spain have introduced social media restrictions for young people, or announced plans to, but no policy is as far reaching as Australia's. The government there says social media is harming young people's mental health, causing teens to lose sleep because of addictive design features, and exposing them to harmful content. Researchers say the evidence that social media causes harm is mixed. In some cases, young people's access to their peers online is a vital support system, particularly those in minority groups and those living in remote areas.

Nature spoke with researchers who will be studying the effects of the social media ban.

For Susan Sawyer, a clinician researcher specializing in adolescent health at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia, the start of the social media ban this week meant entering the next phase of her research. Over the past two months, Sawyer and her colleagues interviewed 177 teenagers aged between 13 and 16 about their social media use, screentime, and mental health before the ban came into effect. She and her colleagues plan to survey the teens again in six months, to see whether the ban has affected their use of the platforms or their mental health. They'll also be surveying the children's parents about problematic internet and social media use.

Another research collaboration between The Kids Research Institute Australia, The University of Western Australia and Edith Cowan University, all in Perth, will also examine whether the new laws are presenting new parenting challenges, and what family conflicts have arisen as a result.

Amanda Third, a researcher from Western Sydney University, says the ban is an opportunity to collect data about the effect of policies that restrict young people's access to the internet/social media. She is going to investigate how teenagers engage with technology, the internet, and their face-to-face interactions following the ban.

But she says it might be hard to tell whether any changes following the ban are a direct result of the policy or other policies designed to make the internet safer, such as new industry standards for technology companies to prevent exposing children to sexually explicit or violent content on the internet, which will start later this month. The social media ban could undercut some of the very well-thought-out efforts to positively impact children's experiences online, she says. These measures are about keeping children on social media and ensuring they have positive experiences. “The ban is about booting them out.”

Zareh Ghazarian, a political scientist at Monash University who studies role of social media in young people's political development, says online platforms can be an important way young people engage with politics. Teachers can discuss contemporary issues, political debates and policy issues that come up on social media, he says. Now that the ban is in place, he plans to interview teachers to find out how it is affecting students' political knowledge, and what alternate platforms they are turning too. “Part of education is to be able to engage with issues and ideas that may not be covered in the classroom – and that was the benefit social media was bringing,” he says.

In April last year, more rain fell in Dubai in a single day than would normally be expected to fall in an entire year.Credit: Giuseppe Cacace/AFP via Getty

Artificial-intelligence tools have transformed weather forecasting, thanks to their ability to learn past patterns from observations and predict how future patterns might unfold. But until now, models have sometimes struggled to forecast extreme weather events that they've never seen before, but that are happening more frequently as the planet warms.

It's like trying to “forecast the future with yesterday's climate”, as Jacob Landsberg, a data scientist at Boston University in Massachusetts, puts it. 

One new approach that's showing success combines an AI model with a conventional climate model, plus mathematical tools that describe rare events, to forecast weather extremes more effectively. In early tests, this hybrid approach simulated the probabilities of extreme heatwaves as accurately as the older, non-AI method, which takes much longer to run1.

“We think this is the way forward,” says Pedram Hassanzadeh, a climate physicist at the University of Chicago in Illinois who is involved in several of the early studies. Team members posted the results in a series of preprints on arXiv this year, and will discuss the work at upcoming conferences, including the American Geophysical Union meeting this month.

Extreme weather can be particularly dangerous when it goes beyond what people usually experience. Examples include the deep freeze in Texas in 2021 that killed hundreds of people, and the 2010 heatwave in Moscow that killed more than 10,000. But it's hard to reproduce the statistics of such rare events and accurately predict how they might change in the future, Hassanzadeh says. AI models might be working with only 40 years of training data but need to forecast a weather extreme that happens just once every 1,000 years.

Consider the unprecedented rains that hit Dubai in April 2024, when more than one year's worth of rain fell in one day. Researchers led by Qiang Sun, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Chicago, and Hassanzadeh analysed the event with two AI models. They were surprised and impressed to find that one of them, the GraphCast model developed by Google DeepMind in London, would have accurately forecast the event eight days before it occurred2.

But things didn't work as well when the scientists looked at tropical cyclones. A different AI weather model, FourCastNet, developed by NVIDIA in Santa Clara, California, struggled to forecast the strongest tropical cyclones when it had no extreme storms in its training set3.

That seemed like bad news, but the researchers did spot a glimmer of hope. The model seemed to be able to learn from storms that occurred in one ocean basin, such as the Atlantic, and apply that learning to other ocean basins, such as the Pacific. It could basically improve its regional forecasts by translating information to different parts of the globe. “The fact that they can do that gives them a lot of power,” Hassanzadeh says.

In their latest work, the researchers found a way forwards with yet another AI model, Pangu-Weather, developed by Chinese firm Huawei Cloud, in Shenzhen. The scientists combined it with a physics-based global climate model, plus a mathematical method for analysing the statistics of rare events, to see whether they could predict mid-latitude heatwaves.

Cursor, the wildly popular AI coding startup, is launching a new feature that lets people design the look and feel of web applications with AI. The tool, Visual Editor, is essentially a vibe-coding product for designers, giving them access to the same fine-grained controls they'd expect from professional design software. But in addition to making changes manually, the tool lets them request edits from Cursor's AI agent using natural language.

Cursor is best known for its AI coding platform, but with Visual Editor, the startup wants to capture other parts of the software creation process. “The core that we care about, professional developers, never changes,” Cursor's head of design, Ryo Lu, tells WIRED. “But in reality, developers are not by themselves. They work with a lot of people, and anyone making software should be able to find something useful out of Cursor.”

Cursor is one of the fastest growing AI startups of all time. Since its 2023 debut, the company says it has surpassed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue and counts tens of thousands of companies, including Nvidia, Salesforce, and PwC, as customers. In November, the startup closed a $2.3 billion funding round that brought its valuation to nearly $30 billion.

Cursor was an early leader in the AI coding market, but it's now facing more pressure than ever from larger competitors like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. The startup has historically licensed AI models from these companies, but now its rivals are investing heavily in AI coding products of their own. Anthropic's Claude Code, for example, grew even faster than Cursor, reaching $1 billion in annual recurring revenue just six months after launch. In response, Cursor has started developing and deploying its own AI models.

Traditionally, building software applications has required many different teams working together across a wide range of products and tools. By integrating design capabilities directly into its coding environment, Cursor wants to show that it can bring these functions together into a single platform.

“Before, designers used to live in their own world of pixels and frames, and they don't really translate to code. So teams had to build processes to hand off tasks back and forth between developers and designers, but there was a lot of friction,” says Lu. “We kind of melded the design world and the coding world together into one interface with one AI agent.”

In a demo at WIRED's San Francisco headquarters, Cursor's product engineering lead Jason Ginsberg showcased how Visual Editor could modify the aesthetics of a webpage.

A traditional design panel on the right lets users adjust fonts, add buttons, create menus, or change backgrounds. On the left, a chat interface accepts natural-language requests, such as “make this button's background color red.” Cursor's agent then applies those changes directly into the code base.

Earlier this year, Cursor released its own web browser that works directly within its coding environment. The company argues the browser creates a better feedback loop when developing products, allowing engineers and designers to view requests from real users and access Chrome-style developer tools.

Because Visual Editor sits on top of Cursor's browser, users can also point it at any live site—not just their own—and inspect it as if they were inside that site's code base. At one point, I asked Ginsberg to load up WIRED's homepage.

Instantly, Cursor surfaced our publication's design system: every font family, color token, and spacing variable defined on the page. Ginsberg could tweak the header typography, lighten background colors, or apply a gradient in real time using the same controls Cursor offers for in-progress apps. “It's all defined on the web,” Ginsberg says. “We can show you exactly what the site is built with.”

Ginsberg argues that Cursor is trying to respect the “design language” of different companies. Many web designers, he says, are skeptical of vibe-coding apps on the market today, because they tend to produce generic-looking websites that don't take a brand's unique aesthetics into consideration. For example, it's become a meme that if your website has a purple gradient, it was likely made with AI.

Precise design controls are central to Cursor's pitch for its Visual Editor. Users can fine-tune corner radii, adjust letter spacing, or change whether a menu opens to the left or right. Unlike traditional design tools that rely on their own abstractions, Lu says every control maps to real CSS—the coding language that tells browsers how to render a page's visual elements. That means designers aren't working in a symbolic approximation of a user interface, but within the actual system that ships to users.

When asked about how Cursor's Visual Editor compares to other vibe-coding apps, such as Replit and Lovable, Lu rejected the framing altogether. He argues that those companies primarily target users building quick demos, not professionals working in large code bases. For that reason, Cursor views its competitors as much larger software providers.

“We care about people who are software builders, who are opinionated, who have taste, who have strong opinions about how things should be, and giving them the tools to act on that vision,” says Roman Ugarte, Cursor's head of growth. “We might do a similar thing in the future for product managers. We might do a similar thing in the future for other roles, but I think the theme is ambition—raising the ceiling for what people can do—not just making things easier.”

Demand for Cursor's design tools is already emerging organically, says Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, who led the firm's investment in the startup. Casado says designers at Shopify, for example, are already using Cursor's tools.

Cursor's new offering could pose a challenge to incumbents like Adobe or Figma, but Casado says the market is large enough to support multiple approaches as software creation becomes accessible to people working in more types of roles.

“Cursor is really focused on design, as it's attached directly to the code base,” he says. “With all of these platform shifts, we'll see new behaviors emerge. Some of that will be an evolution of old behavior, and some will actually be net new.”

Update: 12/11/2025, 1 PM EDT: WIRED has clarified a quote from Martin Casado, who, following the publication of this article, updated that he meant Shopify — and not Spotify — designers are using Cursor.

Beyond comfortable socks and cases of seltzer water, you could also pick up a new television to go with your chicken bake and double chocolate chunk cookie. Some of our favorite televisions are also available to purchase from Costco, either online or at the warehouse while you wait for your pizza.

Of course, there are also practical reasons for buying a television at Costco, like an exceptional return policy that you won't find elsewhere, occasional discounts that beat out other major retailers, and even special bundles exclusively for members.

If you aren't a Costco member, you can always peruse our favorite televisions for both movies and gaming, or check out our favorite soundbars and bookshelf speakers for the perfect companion for your new television.

While a lot of TVs are fighting over the “brightest screen” title, TCL would rather put out a television with a more balanced profile. The mini-LED-powered QM6K boasts deep black levels and wonderfully natural colors across a wide viewing angle, earning it the coveted top spot on our list of favorite TVs. It has all the features you'd expect from a midrange screen, including Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) up to 144 Hz, a low-latency mode for gaming, and support for HDR and Dolby Vision.

It's a great fit for living rooms and busy homes, thanks to the Google TV interface, which is both quick and easy to use. It also supports basically every streaming service, alongside casting from Android or Windows devices.

If you're looking for a more premium television, Costco has the excellent LG G5 OLED in stock. It has exceptional brightness, top-tier glare reduction, and nearly perfect picture quality, with only some minor quibbles keeping this screen from total perfection. It covers a huge color range with impressive accuracy and has a slim design that can be mounted flush to a wall.

It's also an excellent gaming pick. It has a refresh rate of up to 165 Hz at 4K, a perfect fit for your Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5. Variable refresh helps keep demanding games running smoothly, and the Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) means you're never lagging.

Sony

At the top end of Sony's OLED spectrum, things are looking mighty fine. The brand has really refined its image processing, and as a result, the Bravia 8 II boasts incredible clarity and performance across a wide variety of media. It has a stylish look, with super thin bezels, and comes loaded with Google TV, which is easy to use and responsive.

While the brightness doesn't quite reach the same peak levels as other screens on the list, it's still an excellent buy for anyone with a sharp eye that can appreciate a really well-tuned television. It has excellent gaming options, too, but only two HDMI 2.1 ports, so gamers with lots of consoles may want to look elsewhere.

For a more budget-friendly option, you might consider the mini-LED-powered Sony Bravia 5, which WIRED writer Ryan Waniata got a chance to check out in Tokyo earlier this year. It boasts strong color accuracy and brightness, as well as solid black levels, but the off-angle viewing isn't quite as clean as some of the other options on our list.

This model also includes Sony's new XR Backlight Master Drive algorithm. This special tech uses image recognition to improve its light distribution, which should result in less bloom in dark areas.

LG's premium C4 OLED panel achieves top-tier contrast, with colors that pop and big brightness that make it a great fit for any room. It's one of our favorite TVs in general and our preferred pick for anyone looking to upgrade to an OLED screen. With the full suite of HDR options, including Dolby Vision, there's not much this TV can't do.

Solid gaming features include support for up to 144-Hz refresh at 4K and Nvidia's G-Sync, which keeps your screen's refresh rate tied to the actual frame rate of the game you're playing, for smooth gameplay with no tearing.

While it isn't quite as bright as the C4, the LG B5 is a more budget-friendly option that still includes the OLED panel. It has the deep black levels that those panels are known for, as well as great contrast and low-light details, but it lacks a bit of refinement that we see with the more expensive models.

It's still a good screen, particularly for gaming, with four HDMI 2.1 inputs and support for both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync.

On Thursday, Disney and OpenAI announced a deal that might have seemed unthinkable not so long ago. Starting next year, OpenAI will be able to use Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Ariel, and Yoda in its Sora video-generation model. Disney will take a $1 billion stake in OpenAI, and its employees will get access to the firm's APIs and ChatGPT. None of this makes much sense—unless Disney was fighting a battle it couldn't win.

Disney has always been a notoriously aggressive litigant around its intellectual property. Alongside fellow IP powerhouse Universal, it sued Midjourney in June over outputs that allegedly infringed on classic film and TV characters. The night before the OpenAI deal was announced, Disney reportedly sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google alleging copyright infractions on a “massive scale.”

On the surface, there appears to be some dissonance with Disney embracing OpenAI while poking its rivals. But it's more than likely that Hollywood is embarking down a similar path as media publishers when it comes to AI, signing licensing agreements where it can and using litigation when it can't. (WIRED is owned by Condé Nast, which inked a deal with OpenAI in August 2024.)

“I think that AI companies and copyright holders are beginning to understand and become reconciled to the fact that neither side is going to score an absolute victory,” says Matthew Sag, a professor of law and artificial intelligence at Emory University. While many of these cases are still working their way through the courts, so far it seems like model inputs—the training data that these models learn from—are covered by fair use. But this deal is about outputs—what the model returns based on your prompt—where IP owners like Disney have a much stronger case

Coming to an output agreement resolves a host of messy, potentially unsolvable issues. Even if a company tells an AI model not to produce, say, Elsa at a Wendy's drive-through, the model might know enough about Elsa to do so anyway—or a user might be able to prompt their way into making Elsa without asking for the character by name. It's a tension that legal scholars call the “Snoopy problem,” but in this case you might as well call it the Disney problem.

“Faced with this increasingly clear reality, it makes sense for consumer-facing AI companies and entertainment giants like Disney to think about licensing arrangements,” says Sag.

By partnering with OpenAI, Disney gets a say in how its characters are used in Sora. (The two companies “affirmed a shared commitment to maintaining robust controls to prevent the generation of illegal or harmful content,” according to an OpenAI press release, although the internet tends to find a way around those.) The company's Disney+ streaming platform will feature a curated selection of “fan-inspired Sora short form videos,” a new form of storytelling for the 102-year-old studio. And with access to OpenAI's tools, it can try to ensure it's not left behind by an AI-generated entertainment revolution, as unlikely as that may seem today. (Remember that OpenAI is currently backing a feature-length animated film that will be largely AI-generated.)

The $1 billion stake in OpenAI is a hedge as well, and not entirely out of character for the entertainment giant. Just last year, Disney invested $1.5 billion in Fortnite developer Epic Games. (Which is illustrative in itself; when Darth Vader made an in-game appearance in May, players promptly made him swear and misbehave.) As entertainment preferences continue to flow from big screens to smaller ones, both OpenAI and Epic give Disney an opportunity to meet its customers where they're at—or where they're going.

“Bringing together Disney's iconic stories and characters with OpenAI's groundbreaking technology puts imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we've never seen before,” said Disney CEO Robert Iger in the press release, “giving them richer and more personal ways to connect with the Disney characters and stories they love.”

As for OpenAI, it not only gets access to more than 200 internationally recognized characters, but also a significant monetary injection as it continues its relentless pursuit of scale. OpenAI and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

More than anything, though, the deal signals that Disney is ready to play ball. It clarifies that the AI copyright war isn't about keeping iconic characters out of models anymore. It's about finding the right price to keep them in.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","With a Spike in RAM Prices, Now Might Be the Best Time to Buy a Laptop","https://www.wired.com/story/laptops-have-never-been-cheaper-that-trend-might-reverse-in-2026/","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Tariffs. Inflation. Historic corporate shake-ups and mergers. With all the factors the tech industry is facing, you might think the price of a common product like a laptop would have risen this year. But just the opposite has been happening.

I've been watching laptop prices slowly drop throughout 2025, a trend that peaked during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Regardless of the state of the economy, I feel like I can say that laptop prices have never been lower. Some of my favorite laptops have recently offered significant price cuts across Macs, Windows, and Chromebooks. In a time when money is tight for so many of us, that's welcome news. But with a RAM shortage brewing behind the scenes, there's good reason to think it won't last for much longer.

There's one perfect example to demonstrate my point: the MacBook Air. For years now, the latest MacBook has been sold at $999. In 2022, Apple briefly bumped the price of the M2 version to $1,199 but kept the previous-gen M1 MacBook Air for $999. The last MacBook to be sold for less than $999 was in 2015, when Apple had an 11-inch model for $899. That's a long time to stay static, considering how much more nearly everything in your life costs today than it did in 2015.

Don't forget the discounts. The M4 MacBook Air is the latest model, and it dropped to $749 in November at retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart. Before that, it was selling for $800 for many months. That's an incredible price for this laptop, especially since the starting configuration comes with 16 GB of RAM.

Apple has offered a supply of older models through third-party retailers. Walmart briefly dropped the price of the M1 MacBook Air to $499. These aren't refurbished or used; they're new. That alone is unusual for Apple. There was a time when Apple was seen as the overpriced alternative. But for modern, entry-level Macs, that's just not true anymore. Even the brand-new M5 MacBook Pro got an unprecedented $150 discount on Black Friday, just a month after it was announced, and that discount is still in place today.

The landscape has changed beyond just MacBooks. For the first time, we're seeing laptops sell for budget-tier prices (meaning under $700) that aren't terrible. Some, like the Dell 14 Plus, have been discounted to such a degree that it's now under $700 (and was as low as $500 during Black Friday). This is a laptop with a 2560 x 1600 resolution display, 16 GB of RAM, 1 TB of storage, and fantastic all-day battery life. It's powered by Intel's Core Ultra 256V, the most efficient chip Intel has in its lineup. It's also reasonably portable, well-built, and attractive. You could never get a laptop of this caliber this cheap—even just a year or two ago.

The Asus Vivobook 14 is another good example. It has been sold all year at $700 but frequently dips down to $650. While it's not as strong as the Dell 14 Plus, it's an example of cutting-edge chip technology disrupting the laptop space, powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon X. This chip delivers great battery life, something budget laptops have struggled with. More competition has led to lower prices and better products.

These are just the tip of the iceberg. We're seeing affordable prices across the board, regardless of the operating system or chip. It's a great time to buy a laptop. But you may want to act fast, as stormy clouds are on the horizon.

It's no secret that RAM (random-access memory) prices have been escalating in recent months. AI processing is incredibly memory-sensitive, and it'll gobble up as much as you can give it. As more and more resources are being allocated toward manufacturing HBM (high-bandwidth memory) RAM for data centers, a massive shortage is building on the consumer front.

Micron recently announced that it would discontinue its Crucial RAM brand, one of the most popular options in PC gaming. The company is pivoting to—yep, you guessed it—manufacturing memory for AI. Micron is one of the three largest RAM manufacturers, the others being Samsung and SK Hynix.

This has affected desktop users first, as DDR5 memory sticks have skyrocketed in price, making it pricey for PC gamers to upgrade their own systems. Some reports have indicated that prices have risen by more than 100 percent in recent months. Just check out this pair of 32 GB Corsair sticks, which is currently selling for a cool $907 at Best Buy. We're already seeing increased prices roll out to prebuilt desktop systems ahead of the looming situation on laptops. Popular PC builder CyberPowerPC has already announced it would be raising prices on all its systems as of December 7, and so has compact PC brand Minisforum. Even Raspberry Pi has been forced to increase prices.

This hasn't hit laptops and other electronics yet, but some of the biggest laptop manufacturers in the world have started issuing warnings. In late November, HP stated that DDR5 RAM had jumped by over 200 percent in just the weeks leading up to its earnings call. HP explicitly said it will reduce memory configurations and raise prices to make ends meet in the future, though we won't see those higher prices until May 2026, as it has hoarded RAM to weather the storm. Lenovo says it has been doing the same. The panic-buying of RAM, however, is contributing to rising DRAM prices behind the scenes. While this is keeping laptop prices down right now, none of that protection is guaranteed in 2026 and beyond.

It's not just RAM. Storage is facing a similar tightening supply and increase in demand for AI data centers. The CEO of Phison, the company that makes the flash memory controllers for solid-state drives, recently characterized next year's flash storage shortages as “severe” and said supply will be ""tight for the next 10 years"" in Phison's recent earnings call, as reported by Toms Hardware. Importantly, this is the type of storage Apple uses across its products in iPhones and Macs.

Apple has had the industry sway to weather shortages better than others in the past. The upcoming MacBook refreshes due in early 2026 likely aren't affected. But beyond that, we'll have to see. Perhaps laptop price increases won't be so dramatic that people will notice. Maybe the industry will be forced to eat the cost. One thing is for sure: Right now remains a very good time to buy a new laptop if you need one. Come next year, it's anyone's guess.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The AI Gap is Widening","https://www.wired.com/sponsored/story/the-ai-gap-is-widening/","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 16:53:05 GMT","

In recent years, so many conversations about AI transformations in the corporate world have seemed to go the way that homeowners talk about remodels: An upgrade would be nice and would add a lot of value to the place; let's do it sometime this year; let's move forward once the plans are finalized, the budget's approved. Then, things stall. Months tick by, and then a year.

Meanwhile, prices are increasing, and other problems arise—maybe even ones that the upgrade you have been talking about could've helped avoid. The reality hits: You may think you can't afford to make the changes, but the truth is, you can't afford not to.

The new Build for the Future 2025 report from BCG found that a small cohort—just 5 percent of companies—are generating substantial value from AI. But that value is twice the revenue increase and 40 percent greater cost reductions when compared to companies that haven't invested in AI capabilities. This 5 percent has figured out how to extract real, scaled value from AI, and that value is going to continue to grow, as is the way of technological gains. Meanwhile, 60 percent of the more than 1,200 companies studied for the report have little or nothing concrete to show for their investments. The degree of separation between early adopters and those who haven't made moves to integrate AI thoughtfully isn't a slight gap anymore; it's a widening chasm. That's because, in practice, many companies confuse “being cautious with “moving slowly.”

“Leaders tend to distance themselves from the rest of the pack more and more,” says Nicolas de Bellefonds, global leader of AI at BCG and a co-author of the report. “The time for passive observation has sailed.” That's not just advice to integrate AI, it's also a result of the study itself. AI technology is advancing fast enough that every week spent observing instead of acting makes catching up harder. Future-built companies—BCG's term for that 5 percent—are “pulling away, widening the value gap, and putting slow movers in a deeper value hole.”

To understand how future-built companies got that way, the report looks at how they applied AI technology and how they spend their money on it. It finds that the biggest value isn't in side projects or one-off chatbots—it's in the heart of the company: sales, manufacturing, supply chain, R&D, and, increasingly, IT. “Big value comes not from AI pilots or isolated use cases,” the report notes, “but from reshaping and reinventing core business workflows end-to-end.”

Amanda Luther, Global Leader of AI and Digital Transformation at BCG and a report co-author, says that “focusing on a few big bets” that you transform across the value chain can have the biggest return on investment. “If you're a consumer-goods company, pick marketing or R&D and go for material lift. If you're industrial, it might be manufacturing and supply chain,” she says. “It's about figuring out what those couple of places are that really matter for the competitive advantage of the company, and then really driving against those.”

The report doesn't serve as a post-mortem on how certain companies have become AI leaders, deriving value from the technology in their teams and in their businesses, but as a proof of concept for fast followers. It's not about catching up as much as it is about making a move now and having data to back it up.

“I think the positive news for those that hadn't moved yet is that there is proof at scale at other organizations of where value delivery can really happen,” explains Luther. “It can allow you as an organization to be a fast follower and to focus on those areas where there's real value. But I do think there is a widening gap. It's largely because the companies that have already started have fixed their data foundations. They've started to create an organization that is willing and able to use AI. There's kind of an organizational muscle for adopting technology and change that the early adopters and those leaders have built that will continue to get stronger.”

De Bellefonds agrees, and that catching up isn't a competition for the “highest number of use cases.” That's in part because leaders are seeing the value of the technology and reinvesting their returns. Those included in the study plan to spend twice as much on IT this year and direct more of that IT budget specifically to AI.

The impact of agentic AI is one of the fastest accelerators. What once seemed like a buzzword is now proving its mettle, as the report estimates agentic AI—systems that reason, learn, and act autonomously across workflows—account for 17 percent of AI value in 2025 and could reach 29 percent by 2028. To achieve that value, the research shows that deeply integrating agentic AI into the area that's been identified as most important to the company—like the marketing or supply chain areas that Luther referenced—is best practice.

Like any transformation that has a significant ROI, it takes time. And hard work.

“There's this misconception that AI is this magic wand and integrating it will be easy—that you just have to plug this tool and voila! it all works out,” says de Bellefonds. “That misconception, frankly, is often pushed by some AI providers. The fact is, it takes a bit of hard work to really transform how you work and how you operate. People underestimate that. Maybe because they want to believe that it's easy. The report shows there is real value, but it only works if you do the real transformative work that goes with it.”

That means AI failure is not often about the model being used. The report found that most roadblocks are human and organizational, like aligning strategies, training, getting people to actually use the tools, handling unstructured data, and setting clear goals. Companies that skip the groundwork—operating model, skills, guardrails—struggle to scale, no matter how clear their prompts or clean their coding.

“We always had this rule of thumb we called 10, 20, 70,” Luther says. The rule suggests that success with AI relies 10 percent on the algorithms, 20 percent on the tech, and 70 percent on the people. With this longitudinal study, “it actually proves out… that it is really all about the people.” Done well, she adds, AI “takes the toil out of the day-to-day” and “creates more joy in the job” because humans spend more time on judgment and creativity.

The performance case for AI, it turns out, is also a human case.

This story was supported by the Pulitzer Center.

The town hall in Akranes, on the west coast of Iceland, filled quickly as locals streamed in to the residents' meeting. The mood was happy, positive, relaxed. In between speeches, a woman sang folk songs while her family played guitar and melodica. Yet when the guest speaker, an American named Marty Odlin, took the stage, he struck a deadly serious tone.

“We woke up Godzilla,” he told the assembled residents. “It's burning down forests and towns and stealing fish and doing all sorts of terrible things. It's a horrible monster, but we did that. We woke it up. And so we have to fix it.”

Odlin, the founder of a US climate startup called Running Tide, had become a well-known figure around Akranes that summer of 2022 in his signature neon beanie and fisherman's flannels. He was setting up a base of operations in a nearby harbor, planning to unleash a counteroffensive against the Godzilla of climate change. Odlin had outlined a plan to create jobs in this former fishing hub of 8,000. He'd need people to help sink huge volumes of biomass in the surrounding ocean. Together, they'd remove gigatons of carbon from Earth's atmosphere—and make money by selling carbon credits to Silicon Valley hyperscalers. The exponential growth in tech companies' emissions, driven by an explosion in demand for data centers and AI, had made the carbon-credit market hotter than ever. Lowercarbon Capital, a VC firm cofounded by Chris Sacca of Shark Tank, had led a $54 million Series B funding round for Running Tide earlier that year.

Marty Odlin, founder and CEO of Running Tide, in its workshop in Portland, Maine.

At first, Running Tide painted a vision of free-floating “micro forests” of seaweed seeded on biodegradable buoys, which would float in the ocean before sinking under their own weight, locking that carbon deep in the sea. Within nine months of his appearance in Akranes, though, that vision had morphed into something else: dumping around 25,000 tons of chemically treated Canadian wood chips off Iceland's coast. Some ocean-carbon experts describe the work as “poor science fiction” that likely removed no atmospheric carbon while contributing to marine pollution. Ship-tracking data indicates that in the process, the startup likely violated the maritime rights of multiple countries.

By the time WIRED visited Running Tide's Iceland headquarters in the autumn of 2024, the party was over. An orange jacket emblazoned with the Running Tide logo hung on a coat rack. A sensor buoy gathered dust in a corner. Gone was the founder, along with his grand plans and his neon beanie. Gone were the hundred or so workers once employed by the company. The startup, at one time the next great hope for carbon removal, left in its wake thousands of credits uncertified by any independent entity.

WIRED spoke with nearly 40 sources from France, Iceland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as with international scientists who advise the United Nations, to trace Running Tide's meteoric rise and fall. They include scientists directly involved with marine geoengineering science, carbon dioxide removal experts, lawmakers, government officials, buyers of the company's credits, and former Running Tide staff, most of whom requested anonymity to describe sensitive information. WIRED analyzed corporate financial filings, emails and other internal documents, patent applications, carbon-accounting records, and shipping data to reveal the story of how a small-scale operator with little geoengineering expertise was able to gather millions of dollars from blue-chip investors.

The demise of Running Tide is not the end of a story but the beginning. Investors have kept right on pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into experimental and potentially harmful technologies designed to lock away more carbon in the sea—a warning of what could be next as the demand for carbon removal grows.

The idea of companies “offsetting” their carbon footprint began in the 1980s. Back then, you could buy into, say, a forestry or bamboo-growing project that offered up to 80 years of carbon sequestration. As the popularity of offsetting grew, middlemen emerged to verify credits that had been produced and offer them to potential buyers. An offsetter would make a claim about a project, an intermediary like the nonprofit Verra, which runs the Verified Carbon Standard Program, would kick the tires and list the credits on a registry, and emitters would buy them. By 2022 this had turned into a $1.9 billion industry, with Verra overseeing the lion's share of sales. Each project listed on its marketplace is independently verified, and information on each deal—down to the carbon ton—is publicly available.

That year, the market was rocked by controversy: One of the world's largest carbon-offset projects, a forest-conservation program run by the billion-dollar firm South Pole, was reported to have knowingly sold more credits than the project was ultimately worth. Elias Ayrey, an independent expert in forest ecology, had analyzed satellite imagery of South Pole's forests in Kariba, Zimbabwe, and found the company's calculations were a vast overestimate. South Pole acknowledged the discrepancy but denied overselling the project, and exited the Kariba program in October 2023. The company's then CEO resigned the following month over the controversy. Verra ultimately concluded that just over half the 26.8 million credits issued should be canceled.

To some, the failure of an organization like Verra to catch the South Pole debacle suggested the whole market was bunk. To others, it was an opportunity. Large companies with emissions to offset now had cover to stop relying on third-party verifiers. They could argue for bypassing this seemingly broken system and embrace the alternative: in-house verification of credits bought directly to offset their emissions.

At the same time, the credits evolved. Alongside traditional nature-based offsets, many of which focused on tree-growing and offered up to 200 years of carbon sequestration, new companies began selling “carbon-removal” services directly to emitters, offering to lock away carbon for up to 800 years using novel, technology-based solutions such as injecting dissolved CO2 into underground rocks, scrubbing carbon from the air with machines, or sinking carbon-rich biomass into the deep sea. In less than two years, companies bought around $2.6 billion in carbon-removal credits, up from just $55 million in 2022, with many of these unverified by any third party. Microsoft, to date the biggest buyer in the space, reported in 2023 that it had bought 2.8 million tons of carbon-removal credits designed to lock carbon away for at least 200 years; of these, only 42,000 were listed as third-party verified. It was in this market, offering its seaweed-sinking solution, that Running Tide would operate.

Odlin had founded Running Tide in 2017, eventually setting up its headquarters in Portland, Maine, a short distance from where his father had run a very successful groundfishing fleet for decades. The company had first experimented with raising oysters to improve ocean health, but by 2020 had expanded into carbon removal. “We make little buoys out of terrestrial biomass and some minerals,” Odlin once explained on stage at South by Southwest, “and spray some kelp spores on them and spread them out in the ocean.”

Running Tide's office on Danforth Street in Portland, as well as its offices in the Marine Trade Center on the Portland waterfront, are now closed.

Seaweed would grow on these buoys, absorbing carbon from the ocean to do so, and drawing carbon down from the atmosphere into the sea to replace it. In time, these free-floating biodegradable buoys would then break apart, and the seaweed that had grown on them would sink. Thanks to the way carbon is cycled by the ocean, the carbon in that seaweed, if sunk in the right places, would then be sequestered for over 800 years in the deep sea. Or so the industry theory went.

Theory alone had been enough for Running Tide to sell small bundles of credits to Shopify in 2020 and Stripe in 2021. But a bigger fish was in its sights: Microsoft. And to land a big contract with the tech giant, it needed evidence its technology would work.

A styrofoam buoy produced by Running Tide, marked with its initials, that the company intended to grow seaweed on.

During its first phase of experimentation, the company dropped 120-pound moorings to the seafloor, each attached to a floating buoy. Running between each mooring and buoy was a cotton line, inoculated with seaweed spores. This experiment would allow the startup to understand seaweed growth and calculate carbon-removal potential before moving on to creating its free-floating biodegradable buoys. In the winter of 2021, the startup released as many as 1,600 of these anchored lines off of the Maine coast. Problems with the tests soon emerged.

The cotton lines were supposed to be good for seeding kelp, but they weren't very resilient in seawater. Within months, a few dozen buoys had been lost. Two moorings from the batch washed up hundreds of miles south at Cape Cod, resulting in an inquiry from the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries to the Maine Department of Marine Resources about their origins.

While the majority of the lines remained intact, there was another problem: The seaweed “wasn't really growing,” says one former staffer who joined the company in July 2021. During the hiring process, the source says Odlin had told them that the company was capable of growing 10,000 tons of kelp a year. When field data started coming in, the source found it alarming. Forget 10,000 tons of kelp. “I was like: OK, this is not even 100 tons. Maybe it's not even 10 tons.” A few months later, alleging an “undercurrent of dishonesty” at the company, the source left Running Tide altogether. Odlin says that the company was capable of spawning around 10,000 tons in its hatchery at the time, not on the deployed buoys, and denies that he misrepresented the company's capacity.

A staff member working at Running Tide's Portland kelp hatchery in 2021 adds sporophytes, or early-stage kelp, to pipes wrapped with string.

Two ex-staffers said they felt that their data or output was manipulated in order to garner new rounds of investment. When Chris Payne, a veteran marine scientist, joined Running Tide's kelp team in early 2022, he recalls, “they had us gluing algae on the buoys so they could take pictures to show people.”

Shortly after Payne joined Running Tide, he raised another concern: a lack of proper diving protocols. Typically, when divers are doing underwater work on a project like the one in Maine, their time both at the surface and at depth is carefully timed out and tracked by a supervisor to prevent decompression sickness. Running Tide didn't do any tracking, former staffers allege. And yet, recalls one ex-employee who was on a buoy cleanup team, “they wanted us to do multiple ‘bounce' dives in a day down to 100 feet.” The source added: “I wasn't comfortable doing that.” Finnian Donovan, Running Tide's former director of operations, confirms that individuals were responsible for logging their own dives, but maintains that the data was looked over by a safety officer. He also claims divers weren't asked to descend to this depth: “Deepest that we had anyone go was 30 feet,” he says.

Payne, alarmed by what he says was the lack of a dive safety manual, safety records, gear protocol, and a dive control board, says he raised the idea of creating protocols. He says that management told him: “If there's any problems … we can blame the dive company that we rent our gear from.” Donovan says he was never made aware of this, but that the statement would be at odds with the company's safety protocols. “We recognized that it was the most dangerous thing that anyone at the company was doing,” he said. He also asserted that Running Tide had a dive safety manual.

Six former employees WIRED spoke with reported similar concerns about diving safety and problems with the company's product. They raised these concerns in emails, texts, and documents from that time, which WIRED has reviewed. Internal presentations from late 2021 and early 2022, seen by WIRED, show that the company was aware that it was struggling to scale up its kelp growing.

In interviews with WIRED, the former leaders of Running Tide framed these issues as growing pains. “We were trying to both be R&D and a developed industry at the same time, which makes it kind of complicated,” says Kristinn Árni L. Hróbjartsson, the organization's former general manager in Iceland. This problem wasn't unique to Running Tide, Hróbjartsson says, but permeates the marine carbon-removal sector to this day. “It's being evaluated as if it were an actual industry. Everybody is just still figuring out what to do.”

Odlin says staff may have glued seaweed onto buoys, but claims that this was a way of showing the “project road map” to investors. “There's a big difference between falsifying data about the performance of a company and making a render of something you're trying to do in the future,” he says. Still, Odlin admitted that he thinks Running Tide actually grew less than 10 tons of seaweed in the ocean during the company's entire operations.

While the Casco Bay experiment showed that Running Tide was still a long way from being able to grow large amounts of kelp, publicly the company presented the tests as evidence that its free-floating buoy technology was progressing. But having already sold credits to investors, it needed a carbon-removal strategy that would scale. Internal company documents show that Running Tide was considering a shift in plans in December 2021 from primarily building algae buoys to sinking wood chips in the ocean (Odlin says they started conducting experiments with wood chips in 2020). The development of the algae-sinking buoys would continue alongside the wood-chip sinking.

The wood-chip project was supposed to strike at Godzilla in two ways. First, the chips would be coated with alkaline dust from industrial lime kilns and dumped in the water. In theory, they'd float on the surface for a while, and the alkaline dust would react with dissolved CO2 in the sea. Carbon in the atmosphere would then dissolve in the sea to replace the CO2 consumed in this reaction. Then, when the wood chips became waterlogged, they'd sink to the ocean floor. Since the wood wouldn't decompose on land or be used as fuel, its carbon would be prevented from reentering the atmosphere and instead be sequestered in the deep sea.

Not long after the Casco Bay work had finished, the company moved its operations to Iceland. Former employees and local aquaculture farmers in Maine felt that this was because Running Tide had used up its social capital for seaweed experiments in the area, and the company never applied for additional experimental permits for growing seaweed in Maine. Odlin says the decision was influenced by a multitude of factors, including Iceland's favorable water conditions for kelp: “We felt like being further in the north and being able to exploit the longer growing time would have been advantageous early on.” Plus, when it comes to marine expertise, Iceland is “head and shoulders” above everybody else, Odlin says. “Iceland's the Silicon Valley of marine technology.”

When Running Tide formally applied to the Icelandic government for research permits in March 2022, its work raised concerns. “It was really unclear what kind of research they were actually doing,” says Hrönn Egilsdóttir, head of the Environmental Division at the Marine and Freshwater Research Institute in Iceland. The institute assessed Running Tide's application for an initial research permit, and later provided a further assessment to the Environment Agency of Iceland.

The startup's proposal and research was “not up to standard,” Egilsdóttir says, as Running Tide did not sufficiently quantify its carbon removal or potential ecosystem impact on the deep sea. The shifting scope of the company's work also concerned Egilsdóttir. Running Tide's initial permit application had focused on algae-sinking buoys, and in July, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had signed off on the company releasing 50,000 tons of these. “Large kelp will be cultivated in spheres/floating capsules, which are being designed and are expected to be basketball-sized and made from materials including wood mass, lime, and binders,” the ministry's sign-off note read.

But as Running Tide's application continued through the approval process, Egilsdóttir flagged how the work seemed to be shifting. “It is clear that considerable changes have occurred in both the scope and nature of the operation since the application for the original research permit was submitted,” Egilsdóttir wrote in an October 2022 email. “In Phase 1, the primary goal is not to cultivate kelp and sink it into the deep sea but to discharge tree bark mixed with alkaline substances.” An estimated 10,000 tons of wood chips, between 1 and 3 centimeters in size and combined with lime and calcium oxide/calcium hydroxide, would be released, company documents suggested.

Egilsdóttir therefore recommended that for the seaweed sinking, a “third party be engaged to conduct research and evaluate the results,” and pointed out that across marine science there was “a significant lack of necessary knowledge and scientific research to justify large-scale implementations such as those that Running Tide is aiming for.” Regarding the wood chips, Egilsdóttir advised that Running Tide “conduct a small-scale experiment as the first step” and to structure operations in such a way that the carbon sequestration of the technique could be assessed. The email closed by recommending that “extensive research on the effectiveness and environmental impacts” of Running Tide's proposed operations be conducted.

That prompted the country's Environment Agency to advise that a third party verify the experiments' effects, that the experiments themselves be smaller, and that Running Tide submit a more detailed research proposal to obtain the permits. Running Tide offered no evidence that any of these steps were taken.

While the permit application was under review, Running Tide set up its base of operations in Akranes. In June, Odlin attended the residents' meeting to present the startup's work to the local community. Sinkable seaweed-growing buoys would be their strategy for sequestering carbon, Odlin told the attendees, stating that the company would be building “buoys out of biomass” that would also be coated with limestone to boost their carbon removal and then seeded with kelp.

The application dragged on into the autumn, with a 2024 investigation by the Icelandic magazine Heimildin lifting the lid on the government's decisionmaking process. In December 2022, the Environment Agency came to the conclusion that Running Tide's activities would, under the law, amount to dumping materials in the sea, and require a separate permit. But then, in May 2023, the Ministry of Environment, Energy, and Climate reached its own conclusion, deciding that Running Tide's work constituted research, not dumping, and signed off on the company's plans. The Environment Agency, in response, declared that it then had no jurisdiction over how Running Tide carried out its activities. The minister of environment, energy, and climate at the time described the project publicly as “the largest permanent carbon-capture project in the world.” Both he and the then minister for foreign affairs declined to speak with WIRED.

While Running Tide's research permit was the first of its kind ever granted in Iceland, it was not published on government websites. When Heimildin published its investigation, there was an outcry across Icelandic social media over the fact that the project had been allowed to go ahead.

Egilsdóttir, who initially evaluated the proposal, says the decision by the ministers was “weird,” adding there was no justification for issuing Running Tide a permit, and that the application “should have failed.” She says that in the aftermath of Running Tide's experiments, there was no “scientific output” that she has seen that validates the company's carbon sequestration claims.

Running Tide had initially thought its license to operate in Iceland would arrive quickly. But as securing its permit and necessary permissions stretched throughout 2022, the startup's Icelandic deployment schedule kept bumping: from summer 2022, to fall 2022, and then to spring 2023. All the time, Running Tide was spending money—including, according to a former employee, $18,000 a day on renting a barge that was needed to transport materials out into the ocean. The company did, however, receive a boost in the spring—finally landing a long-sought contract with Microsoft. In March 2023, the tech giant purchased 12,000 tons of Running Tide carbon-removal credits. The race was now on to get them fulfilled.

Over the course of summer 2023, Running Tide sent at least 11 deployments of treated wood chips out to sea from Grundartangi Harbor, an industrial port near Akranes where the carbon-removal company's neighbors included an aluminum smelter and a ferrosilicon plant. The team was in a constant battle against the unpredictable Icelandic conditions. “Our weather window up here in the North, it's super small,” says one former employee.

Across 30 hours, they would load barges with thousands of tons of wood chips mixed with alkaline material. Equipment troubles plagued the team, former staffers say. Most issues stemmed from the wood chips being extremely light; the equipment the company had purchased for handling the chips was for dense materials, like concrete. Out on the ocean there were other issues.

Following Iceland's “cod wars” with the United Kingdom, which ended in the 1970s, the United Nations formally established so-called exclusive economic zones, or EEZs, that extend a country's sovereignty into the ocean, ranging anywhere from 3 to 200 nautical miles offshore. Running Tide's permit granted it permission to operate only within Iceland's EEZ. But after analyzing the movements of the company's carbon-removal projects using MarineTraffic, a ship tracking and maritime analytics provider, as well as GPS coordinates in emails between Running Tide and the Icelandic Coast Guard, WIRED found evidence that Running Tide may have violated the Faroe Islands' EEZ in January 2023 and Canada's EEZ in 2024. According to documents uploaded on Running Tide's website, the company also violated Denmark's EEZ in 2023. Running Tide did not seek permission from any of these countries to operate in their waters.

By early 2024, Jón Ólafsson, professor emeritus at the University of Iceland and an expert in carbon fluxes around the Arctic Sea, had grown alarmed by statements that Running Tide, and in particular Odlin, were making to the press, speaking as if they had unlimited access to Icelandic waters. The company's activities seemed especially preposterous because, according to Ólafsson, their wood-chip dumping could not have sequestered any carbon from the atmosphere. “Throwing wood chips into the ocean does nothing for the atmosphere,” Ólafsson told Heimildin, the Icelandic magazine.

Jón Ólafsson is professor emeritus in oceanography at the University of Iceland in Reykjavík.

The location where Running Tide dumped the Nova Scotian wood naturally “releases about as much [carbon] back to the atmosphere in winter as it fixes in the summer,” says Ólafsson, who published a peer-reviewed article on this very topic—carbon fluxes in the North Atlantic—in 2021. According to Ólafsson's decades of research, it was physically impossible for the ocean to absorb carbon for more than six months in those locations. When told this information by WIRED, Odlin said he was not familiar with the scientists or the 2021 paper. “This is what academics do. This is what happens when people are stuck in institutions and don't have to live in the real world,” Odlin said. “I could care less what that guy thinks.”

Outside of Iceland, scientists also began raising questions about Running Tide's chip-sinking techniques, based on documents the company published on its website. Coating wood chips with lime kiln dust and sinking them are “essentially two mutually exclusive processes to my mind, in terms of carbon sequestration,” says James Kerry, an adjunct senior research fellow at James Cook University, Australia, and a senior marine and climate scientist at the conservation organization OceanCare.

It is impossible for both methods to work, Kerry contends. If the wood chips sank, the alkaline enhancement—a chemical reaction that can only occur at the surface—wouldn't have happened. And if the wood chips stayed at the surface long enough for alkaline enhancement, the chips would likely “have ended up as marine pollution” along the coasts of Iceland and Northern Europe.

In the final carbon-accounting report for its wood-chip-sinking work, originally published on Running Tide's website and since taken down, the company mentions both forms of sequestration, but does not claim carbon credits for its ocean alkalinity enhancement. Pointing out that the small monitoring devices and few cameras they had were insufficient to do any environmental impact assessment of the actual experiments, Kerry believes that the project appeared to be “about making money before any kind of proper science had been conducted.” In his view, “there is no scientific justification based on what they were trying to study to dump 19,000 tons of something in the ocean.”

Odlin confirms that for all of the Icelandic wood-chip ocean deposits, it was impossible for Running Tide to monitor the wood chips for more than three hours after their release, saying, “We couldn't measure signal from noise in the ocean on the alkalinity.”

Despite having sold credits to Stripe, Shopify, Microsoft, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, financial pressures on Running Tide continued to mount as the flow of funds from Silicon Valley dried up. According to one former employee, Odlin would start meetings in spring 2024 by announcing that the company had only a few more weeks of funds before it would have to close. That June, Odlin admitted defeat.

In a LinkedIn post on June 14, 2024, Odlin wrote that “there simply isn't the demand needed to support large-scale carbon removal.” The company ceased global operations that month. Nearly all employees in Iceland and the US were suddenly let go. One employee was presenting about Running Tide at an algae conference when he was told the news.

“People were happy with our credits. We were filling our contracts. We were selling additional contracts. It just wasn't enough,” Odlin says. Running Tide had sold $30 million of credits and said it had commitments for tens of millions more, but by Odlin's estimate, the company needed somewhere between $100 million and $150 million of sales. “That was, like, the rent we were designed for.”

The legacy the company leaves behind after its wood-chip dumping is unclear. It's simply not known what effect the sinking of biomass will have on the ocean, and the scientists and deep-sea experts WIRED spoke to remain hesitant about pursuing such marine geoengineering until more is understood about the deep sea.

A pile of wood chips left by Running Tide at Grundartangi, filmed in October 2024.

Dumping biomass in the ocean could create “dead zones,” areas where aquatic life is starved of oxygen, says Samantha Joye, a Regents' Professor in the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Georgia, who has worked on dead zones in the Mississippi Delta as well as on the cleanup of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Deep sea environments—some of which provide life-saving drugs or insights into how early Earth formed—could also be forever damaged, Joye adds. A recent carbon flux report by Convex Seascape Survey, an international research collaboration, found that once the seabed is disrupted, this could actually halt the ability for sediments to absorb carbon. Joye also points out that without proper research, ocean alkalinity enhancement could also cause spikes in ocean acidity if it draws lots of carbon into the sea that isn't then distributed into its deep waters—the very opposite of what the treated wood chips were trying to achieve.

“The deep sea and the surface ocean are intimately connected,” says Joye. “We really can't afford to screw this up.”

Odlin, though, dismisses the idea that Running Tide did harm to the ocean. “We had multiple studies about the impact of biomass sinking on the benthic habitat. We had a bunch of experts around us.” Everything that the company did, Odlin says, was in consultation with its science advisory board, which included individuals from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, Georgia Institute of Technology, and American University. “I think the probability of adverse harm to the ocean is almost zero for what we did. Zero.”

For him, the need to press ahead with carbon removal trumped the need for a perfect answer on how to manipulate the ocean's carbon cycle. “You can't necessarily wait for the perfect model, because there's always going to be a better model coming,” he says.

Ultimately, Odlin says, they had the authorization they needed from the Icelandic government for the work they were doing. “All I know is we applied, and we got the approval.”

For Microsoft, Running Tide's work was initially deemed a success: despite no independent verification that the organization sequestered any carbon, the tech giant still listed the Running Tide credits it bought in its Carbon Removal Portfolio for Fiscal Year 2023. This was in spite of Microsoft having purchased seaweed-sinking credits, says Brian Marrs, the company's senior director of energy and carbon removal, and not those created through wood-sinking. “We have not signed contracts for that product,” Marrs says. “Our purchases were for, I guess what I consider the original product, which was the kelp algae product.”

When asked about this discrepancy between what Microsoft ordered and received, Odlin refused to go into details. “I'm not gonna comment on what Microsoft said. We had a contract with them that we filled.”

WIRED first asked Microsoft about the veracity of Running Tide's credits in the fall of 2024. In response, the tech company cited its NDA with Running Tide and refused to comment. However, it later acknowledged that it had removed some of Running Tide's credits from its carbon-removal portfolio. “We pilot innovative pathways—including ocean-based methods—while holding every project to the highest standards of third-party verification and measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV),” Microsoft spokesperson Ben Wilsker says. “When credits don't meet those standards, as was the case with some deliveries from Running Tide, we don't count them toward our carbon accounting.”

Any problems it might have had with Running Tide's credits didn't dampen the tech giant's appetite for marine carbon removal. In October 2024, Microsoft signed the world's largest purchase agreement to date for marine carbon dioxide removal, with Ebb Carbon. Microsoft secured at first 1,333 tons of carbon removal, with options to purchase an additional 350,000 tons. Having garnered $24.75 million in Series A funding, Ebb Carbon uses green electricity to split seawater into acidic and alkaline solutions, and then releases the latter back into the ocean to increase alkalinity so that the sea can absorb more carbon from the atmosphere.

This headline-inducing deal is part of Microsoft's bullish strategy on pursuing carbon removal, and runs counter to Odlin's claim that demand for large-scale marine carbon removal isn't there. In 2024, the company purchased 5 million tons of credits, from terrestrial and ocean-based carbon-removal projects, accounting for 63 percent of the volume of the entire carbon-removal market that year. Microsoft's purchases in the carbon-removal space are “building the markets we buy from,” says Marrs. When asked about issues like no third-party verification, Marrs says that Microsoft “welcomes that ecosystem catching up, but at the same time, we don't always need to wait for those verification bodies.”

The ecosystem is busily developing. Gigablue, which grows and sinks plankton in the ocean, sold 200,000 marine carbon-removal credits in January 2025. Planetary Technologies, a company specializing in ocean alkalinity enhancement, raised over $11 million in Series A funding in October 2024. And Equatic has begun building what it claims to be the largest marine carbon-removal facilities in Asia and North America, which will capture carbon on land and then mineralize it and store it in the ocean.

Investments and sales across the sector over the past two years total as much as a quarter billion dollars. But because carbon removal remains unregulated, and exact numbers on the price per ton of carbon are not publicly available, it is difficult to see how these industries are progressing. “The voluntary carbon market has no rules,” says Stacy Kauk, chief science officer at Isometric, a carbon-removal registry. Formerly the head of sustainability at Shopify, Kauk organized one of the first investments into Running Tide in her former role. “On the corporation side, you're incentivized to buy credits so that you can then make a green claim,” she says.

Hróbjartsson, Running Tide's former general manager, is skeptical about how much positive impact the marine carbon-removal industry can have. “We're just making a prettier carbon-offset market,” he says of the industry. “It's lipstick on a pig.”

“Any marine carbon removal, if it's going to work on a global scale, we're going to have to make a decision to completely alter some ecosystems,” says Egilsdóttir. Pointing out that deep-sea sediments can take up to 1,000 years to grow 1 millimeter, she believes that “we should never, ever do that unless we know exactly what we're doing, and we are quite far from reaching that point.”

Running Tide contends it had no adverse impact on the ocean around Iceland—but it has left its mark. In January 2025, a beach cleanup team found one of the company's 3-foot-tall buoys washed up on the shore in Caithness, a small coastal town in northern Scotland. Seeing that the debris was from an American company, the volunteers conducting the cleanup contacted the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to see if they knew of the buoys; the organization was unaware.

“We have messed up the atmosphere as mankind,” says Ólafsson. “Is it OK that we just go to the next place and mess up the oceans?”

Tracking down a far-flung team for a 40-year reunion isn't easy. But the people who worked on Windows 1.0 got some help from their younger selves: a mischievous Easter egg they hid long ago in the software that would become the foundation of the world's dominant PC platform.

Back in the mid-1980s, before the product launched, they secretly inserted credits in the code, listing their names, to be revealed through a specific combination of keystrokes. 

As the story goes, Bill Gates inadvertently found the list by slamming his fists on the keyboard in frustration over the system's sluggishness, a discovery that only made things worse. The fix: make the sequence more obscure. It worked. The credits went unnoticed by the public until 2022, when a researcher who was reverse-engineering old Windows binaries found them.

So when members of the Windows 1.0 team decided to hold a 40th anniversary reunion this year, that roster became their starting point. It was a time capsule that doubled as a guest list.

A core group from that original Windows team reunited over dinner at Steve Ballmer's offices in Bellevue on Tuesday evening — trading memories, correcting the historical record, and marveling at what they accomplished back then under nearly impossible circumstances. 

“Today, developers have all these tools, drag and drop,” said Rao Remala, an early Windows developer, adding that he would challenge anyone today to build a functioning PC operating environment under the 64K segment limits and other technical constraints of the era. 

“Have you tried it in ChatGPT?” Ballmer joked from across the room. 

This year has been filled with commemorative milestones for the tech giant, from Microsoft's 50th to Excel's 40th to the 30th anniversary of the company's internet pivot. But this one is different. It's a glimpse into one of Microsoft's scrappiest projects, from a moment in its history when key resources — including budget and computing power — were far more scarce.

Windows 1.0, which shipped on a set of 5.25-inch floppy disks, was technically considered an operating environment, not an operating system, because it ran on MS-DOS 2.0. 

Microsoft announced that it was developing Windows in November 1983. The release was delayed as the team worked through leadership turnover, technical challenges, and user-interface debates (i.e., tiled vs. overlapping windows), giving rise to industry accusations of peddling “vaporware.” Windows 1.0 finally debuted on Nov. 20, 1985.

By the time Windows launched, Apple's Macintosh had set the standard with its elegant interface (at least by 1980s standards), and other DOS-based alternatives were also on the market. Critics favored the Mac's polish, but Microsoft bet on broad PC compatibility, and that approach ultimately paid off.

Microsoft would later get sidetracked temporarily by its ill-fated OS/2 partnership with IBM, before Windows 3.1 became a breakout hit and Windows 95 set the global standard.

But none of it would have been possible without Windows 1.0. The intense, multi-year project was the foundation for the platform that ultimately turned Microsoft into one of the world's most valuable companies, launching careers that would reshape the tech industry.

For Ballmer, who was tapped to get Windows 1.0 across the finish line long before he became Microsoft's CEO, the 40-year reunion stirred up old memories and emotions. 

“Of all the things I worked on at Microsoft, in a way, I have the most pride about this project,” he told the group, explaining that he truly felt part of the team.

As the night went on, the stories came out, some of them for the first time.

Working out of Microsoft's Bellevue offices, before the company moved to Redmond, the team was largely in their 20s and even their teens in some cases. Ballmer, in his late 20s at the time, was one of the older people in the office. That helps to explain the culture at the time. 

“Work and social life — there was no difference. It all sort of blended together,” said Scott Ludwig, who worked on the Windows 1.0 window manager, the core system that handled windows, input, events, menus, and dialog boxes.

In many cases back then, they were figuring things out on the fly. For example, when Lin Shaw started in August 1984, months before the original ship date, not a single printer driver existed. She built the banding architecture — a way of imaging one strip of a page at a time to work within memory constraints — that would last through Windows 95.

She routinely stayed up all night and considered it the best job in the world. “It was just like college,” she told the group during the reunion dinner, “except I got paid really well.”

Gates got involved, at times, down to the smallest details. Mark Taylor, who wrote the calculator and other early Windows apps, recalled Gates asking him to remove a timer delay in the Reversi game — not to make it faster, but to make Windows look faster. Years later, chips got so fast that the move flashed by too quickly to see, turning the fix into a bug.

Joe King, who worked on the Windows Control Panel, had an office across the hall from Ballmer with remarkably thin walls. He watched a parade of people come for their “SteveB meeting.” The pattern was always the same: quiet conversation at first, then Ballmer would start pacing, getting louder, gesturing emphatically, and reaching a crescendo before it was over.

“The door would open, a guy would sheepishly walk out, and Steve would greet the next person with full energy and enthusiasm,” King recalled. “I would see that all day long.”

Tandy Trower reminisced about joining the team in 1985 despite being warned that it was a dead end by another product manager, Rob Glaser, later of RealNetworks fame. 

“I came to Microsoft with this vision of bringing software to the people,” Trower said, explaining that Ballmer pitched the Windows project to him as a way of accomplishing that goal. 

He took the job, only to discover the head development manager was already gone. Ballmer offered reassurances that the product was “virtually done.” It wasn't. 

When Trower suggested changes — overlapping windows, proportional fonts — he got the same response: “You want to ship this year?” The answer was yes. Trower ended up working on Windows through Windows 95, part of a Microsoft career that ultimately spanned 28 years.

Marlin Eller, a programmer and musician, was interested in building a music notation editor. At the end of his first year, Gates asked what he wanted to work on. Eller pitched his idea. Gates engaged enthusiastically, then asked: “How big is the market?” Eller realized it was very small.

Gates had another idea. For music notation, Eller would need to build a graphics package — lines, ovals, curves, etc. An operating system needed that foundational technology to support spreadsheets and charts. And that's how Eller ended up working on Windows. 

“The thing the world does not know,” Eller joked before the dinner, “is that Windows was written so I could do music notation. All those other people were working for me.”

And then there were the pranks. A month or two before Windows 1.0 shipped, for example, developer Mark Cliggett decided to have some fun. He wrote a program that gradually turned off bits on a computer screen, and installed it on Ballmer's machine when he wasn't there.

“Multiple bad decisions right there,” Cliggett acknowledged: putting malware on a colleague's computer, giving it to the future CEO, and missing the irony given the security challenges that would consume the industry years later. Marlin Eller wasted an hour debugging the problem before realizing what had happened. Ballmer, to his credit, didn't hold a grudge.

GeekWire was invited to cover the Windows 1.0 reunion and document all this history. To prepare, I pulled together a 16-page report using Google's NotebookLM to mine for information about Windows 1.0 in a variety of historical documents, books, and articles.

After I mentioned this to Ballmer, he suggested I open the evening by reading some colorful anecdotes from the research. It turned into an impromptu fact-checking exercise. 

Did Ballmer really call a meeting at 9 a.m. on Easter Sunday 1985 and take down the names of anyone who didn't show? Yes, he called the meeting. No, he didn't take names. “I wouldn't call it exactly a loyalty test,” Ballmer explained, saying it was more about setting a tone. 

Did the team really blow off steam by making bombs and rockets with sugar and saltpeter, drawing police to the building when a security guard smelled explosives? Actually, that happened when making a later Windows version, according to someone who was there. The security guard joined them to blow up traffic cones in the parking garage. The police came later, when they were hiding in the library. (The details are a little fuzzy, but you get the idea.)

And finally, turning to a canonical story about the Windows 1.0 project: was the pivotal 1983 Comdex demo really just a videotape flashing graphics on the screen — classic smoke and mirrors to freeze the market? No. “This was real code,” Remala insisted. 

“It was a little more smoky than not,” Ballmer added, “but it was all real code.”

Some notable former members of the Windows 1.0 team were missing from the reunion, including the famously hard-to-reach Gabe Newell, who went on to co-found Valve and build Steam into the dominant PC gaming platform. 

Scott McGregor, the lead development manager recruited from Xerox PARC, left before Windows 1.0 shipped. McGregor later co-authored the X11 windowing system at DEC and served as CEO of Broadcom.

Other members of the Windows 1.0 team went on to remarkably varied careers. 

For example, user interface developer Neil Konzen worked at Ferrari in Italy and pioneered Formula One telemetry. Ed Mills, who worked on fonts, runs a movement therapy practice in Bellevue and is involved in a nonprofit that operates a roller-skating rink in Issaquah.

Cliggett became a long-distance running coach. Eller (who went on to co-author the book Barbarians Led by Bill Gates) teaches computer science. Trower founded a robotics company and continues to work in the field. Taylor is a Seattle public school teacher.

King still introduces himself in the Seattle tech scene by saying he goes back to Windows 1.0 — sometimes prompting the response: “There was a 1.0?” Yes, there sure was.

For Ballmer, the Windows 1.0 experience led to a management technique he still uses today. On his first day as development manager, he repeated to the team what he'd been told was the schedule for different aspects of the project. He heard laughter in response.

He now calls this the “snicker test” — repeat back what you've heard from a project's leaders, and see how the room reacts. If they laugh, you know you're not getting the true story.

But the real legacy of Windows is much bigger, he told the group this week. If it had shipped two or three years later, Windows wouldn't have been a relevant product, he said. The key, he explained, was figuring out how to ship “enough of the right stuff at the right time.”

“You did, and it's nothing short of amazing,” Ballmer said. “It did change the world.”

Only a few months ago, Outbound Aerospace was on its way up — literally — after raising more than $1 million in pre-seed funding and flying a prototype meant to pave the way for a blended-wing passenger jet. But now the Seattle startup's fortunes have fallen back to earth.

Outbound's co-founder and chief technology officer, Jake Armenta, announced on LinkedIn last week that the company was shutting down. He joked that the news would be greeted with celebration by  “competitors such as Boeing, who have been rightly terrified of us.”

During an interview with GeekWire, Armenta took a more serious tone as he discussed why Outbound fell short: “The simplest answer is that we ran out of money, and hadn't really secured customer commitments that were strong enough to secure the next stage of investment,” he said.

Armenta said Outbound was caught between its initial strategy to create a different kind of passenger aircraft and an evolving strategy to start out building drones for military customers. That commercial-to-military pivot is an option many aerospace startups are considering as the prospects brighten for programs including the Golden Dome missile defense system, next-generation drones, tactically responsive space systems and hypersonic air vehicles.

“We didn't really plan on being a military vendor,” he said. “But I have a background in Boeing Phantom Works, and I spent a lot of time working on drones at Boeing … so I know exactly what kind of things the U.S. government's looking for. In that regard, we were able to put together a pretty compelling kind of platform.”

Outbound's team came up with a drone concept called the Gateway UAV, which closely resembles the 22-foot-wide, blended-wing prototype that was tested in March. Gateway would fly rapidly deployable “mission containers” that could carry cargo or a suite of sensors for national security missions.

Armenta said the concept attracted significant interest from potential military customers. “But the U.S. military is a slow customer to work with, and the truth is, they prefer to work with companies that are very well funded,” he said.

Unfortunately, Outbound was not that kind of company in the summer of 2025. The company had raised $1.3 million dollars in total investment — including $500,000 from Blue Collective, a matching amount from Antler, and the remainder from smaller private investors. But even $1.3 million goes only so far.

“By pivoting away from the big aircraft, we lost the interest of some of the initial investors who were really wanting to do big moonshot projects,” Armenta said. “And then the investors who wanted to invest in military drones wanted to see a lot more traction than we had.”

Outbound CEO Ian Lee told GeekWire that the company faced a “chicken-and-egg” problem.

“We got stuck with DoD customers who were saying, ‘Hey, this is amazing. We want to see it demoed. And then we can write a contract, and contract equals dollars,'” Lee recalled. “So, then we turned around and went to the investment community and said, ‘They want to see a demo, and we need to raise [money] to do that.' It's kind of a ‘we need money to go make money' situation, and we were too far along to raise that young money, if you want to call it that.”

Armenta said the timing was bad for a shift in strategy. “You know, there's a version of this where if we had decided early on, ‘Hey, we're going to build a military drone first and put all of our effort into that' … I think we would have been able to sell it without a problem in the time frame that we had,” he said. “But we didn't really decide that until midway through.”

Ironically, at the same time Outbound Aerospace was running on empty, the buzz surrounding the venture was revving up. 

A month ago, the BBC featured Outbound alongside JetZero and Volatus Aerospace's Natilus project in a story about the rising interest in blended-wing aircraft designs. And two months ago, Lee said in a LinkedIn post that he was “excited for y'all to see what's next.”

“That post was leading into several discussions with investors to go do the DoD work that we needed to do,” Lee said this week. “We had half of our round secured at that point, we were talking to a number of other players, and we had the DoD product ready. … At that point, I was expecting investment to come on pretty quickly and [we could] start talking about that publicly. It never came through.”

So, what's next? Outbound's website still touts the Gateway drone as well as the 254-passenger Olympic airliner, which is said to be “coming in 2033.”

Lee promised that those concepts won't be “disappearing into the ether,” and Armenta plans to make sure they don't.

“We designed not one or two, but five novel transport-category aircraft at Outbound … and all of them are pretty neat,” he said. “I'm going to spend a little bit of time talking about those more publicly over the next couple of months. Maybe next year.”

Both founders are taking time to consider their next steps.

“I'm doing some consulting,” Lee said. “I am advising a couple of friends and also interviewing at various companies. Actually, part of what I'm trying to do is pick what the next few years of projects look like. I'm taking a pause on running a startup directly. I'll probably be back at that at some point, but not for the next few years.”

Armenta is also helping out some friends in the aerospace industry while he takes stock of what he's learned over the past couple of years.

“We were a lot closer than we had any right to be,” he said. “The thing is, there's so much hunger in the market, and in every market for new aircraft across the board. We saw that in the drone space, but it's really there in the commercial space and even in the business-jet space.”

Even though Outbound's fortunes have fallen back to earth, Armenta is still looking up. “This has been something that I've been wanting to do — literally — for 30 years,” he said. “I'm 34 years old, and I can remember being a very small child and wanting to build aircraft. This has never stopped.”

The lessons learned at Outbound have only heightened his resolve. “Through this journey over the last couple of years, I saw a small, constrained number of errors that we made,” Armenta said. “I think that in the future, with a slightly different strategy, with all the knowledge and information and preparation that I have now … I'll be back. Like I said, I'll be back.”

Spoor launched in 2021 with the goal of using computer vision to help reduce the impact of wind turbines on local bird populations. Now, the startup has proven its technology works and is seeing demand from wind farms and beyond.

Oslo, Norway-based Spoor has built software that uses computer vision to track and identify bird populations and migration patterns. The software can detect birds within a 2.5-kilometer radius (about 1.5 miles) and can work with any off-the-shelf high-resolution camera.

Wind farm operators can use this information to better plan where wind farms should be located and to help them better navigate migration patterns. For example, a wind farm could slow down its turbines, or even stop them entirely, during heavy periods of local migration.

Ask Helseth (pictured above left), the co-founder and CEO of Spoor, told TechCrunch last year that he got interested in this space after learning that wind farms lacked effective tracking methods, despite many countries having strict rules around where wind farms can be built and how they can operate due to local bird populations.

“The expectations from the regulators are growing but the industry doesn't have a great tool,” Helseth said at the time. “A lot of people [go out] in the field with binoculars and trained dogs to find out how many birds are colliding with the turbines.”

Helseth told TechCrunch last week that since then, the company has proven the need for this technology and worked to make it better.

At the time of its seed raise in 2024, Spoor was able to track birds in a 1-kilometer range, which has since doubled. As the company has collected more data to feed into its AI model, it has been able to improve its bird identification accuracy to about 96%.

“Identifying the species of the bird for some of the clients, you add another layer,” Helseth said. “Is it a bird or not a bird? We have an in-house ornithologist to help train the model to train the new types of birds or a new type of species. Having deployment in other countries [means] having rare species in the database.”

Spoor now works across three continents and with more than 20 of the world's largest energy companies. It has also started to see interest from other industries such as airports and aquaculture farms. Spoor has a partnership with Rio Tinto, a London-based mining giant, to track bats.

The company has also received interest in using its tech to track other objects of similar size — but Helseth said they aren't thinking of pivoting into those areas quite yet.

“Drones are of course a plastic bird in our mind,” Helseth joked. “They move in a different way and have a different shape and size. Currently we are discarding that data but we are getting interest in it.”

Spoor recently raised an €8 million ($9.3 million) Series A round led by SET Ventures with participation from Ørsted Ventures and Superorganism in addition to strategic investors.

Helseth predicts that interest in this type of technology will only grow as regulators continue to crack down on wind farms. For example, French regulators shut down a wind farm in April due to its impact on the local bird population and imposed hundreds of millions of fines.

“Our mission is to enable industry and nature to coexist,” Helseth said. “We have started on that journey, but we are still a small startup with a lot to prove. In the coming years, we want to really cement our position in the wind industry and become a global leader to tackle these challenges. At the same time, we want to build some proof points that this technology has value beyond that main category.”

Messaging app Freedom Chat has fixed a pair of security flaws: one that allowed a security researcher to guess registered users' phone numbers, and another that exposed user-set PINs to others on the app.

Freedom Chat, released in June, bills itself as a secure messaging app, and claims on its website that users' phone numbers stay private.

But security researcher Eric Daigle told TechCrunch that users' phone numbers and PIN codes, used for locking the app, could be easily obtained by exploiting vulnerabilities.

Daigle found the vulnerabilities last week and shared their details with TechCrunch, as Freedom Chat does not provide a public way to report security flaws, like a vulnerability disclosure program. TechCrunch then alerted Freedom Chat founder Tanner Haas to the security flaws by email.

Haas confirmed to TechCrunch that the app has now reset user PINs and released a new version. Haas added that the company is removing instances where users' phone numbers were occasionally visible, and has notched up rate-limiting on its servers to prevent mass-guess attempts.

Daigle, who published his findings in a blog post, told TechCrunch it was possible to enumerate the phone numbers of close to 2,000 users who had signed up to use Freedom Chat since it launched. Daigle said Freedom Chat's servers allowed anyone to flood it with millions of phone number guesses to determine if a user's phone number was stored on the servers.

Per Daigle, this technique is identical to one described by the University of Vienna in research last month, where academics scraped data on some 3.5 billion user accounts who signed up to WhatsApp by matching billions of phone numbers against WhatsApp's servers.

Daigle also found Freedom Chat was leaking users' PIN codes. Using an open source network traffic inspection tool to analyze the data going in and out of the app, Daigle saw that the app would respond with the PIN codes of every other user in the same public channel — even if the PINs weren't visible to users within the app itself.

According to Daigle, anyone who was in the default Freedom Chat channel, which users are automatically subscribed to when they first sign up, had their PIN broadcast to everyone else in the channel. Daigle told TechCrunch that knowledge of a person's PIN could allow someone to open the app from a user's stolen device.

In an app store update published Sunday, Freedom Chat noted: “A critical reset: A recent backend update inadvertently exposed user PINs in a system response. No messages were ever at risk, and because Freedom Chat does not support linked devices, your conversations were never accessible; however, we've reset all user PINs to ensure your account stays secure. Your privacy remains our top priority.”

Freedom Chat is Haas' second messaging app, after Converso, which was delisted from app stores following the disclosure of security flaws that exposed users' private messages and content.

Flaviu Radulescu started Runware in 2023 when he was testing a text-to-image company and realized that, though generative AI tech was powerful, it was slow in generating images. So Radulescu teamed up with Ioana Hreninciuc and launched Runware as a dev tool platform that specializes in generating images, videos, and audio in real time.

The company has seen much growth since it first launched. It has powered more than 10 billion creations for more than 200,000 developers, the company told TechCrunch.

The product lets developers integrate Runware's API into their apps and then generate media assets through one interface, so they don't have to set up any new infrastructure or maintain separate integrations. It has a custom AI inference infrastructure for open source models and provides day-zero access (meaning as soon as a model is released, it can run on Runware) and competitive pricing, Hreninciuc, who focuses on operations and GTM, told TechCrunch.

On Thursday, the company announced a $50 million Series A in a round led by Dawn Capital. Dawn Capital partner Shamillah Bankiya is joining the board. Others in the round include Comcast Ventures, Speedinvest, Insight Partners, and a16z Speedrun. Runware has raised $66 million in funding to date.

Hreninciuc said the company remains competitive through its pricing, which is “more-cost effective,” in addition to having a fully unified API. She said the company does this with its Sonic Inference Engine, which runs on custom AI hardware. It also partners with third-party AI cloud providers so that it can reroute workloads automatically in case more memory is needed.

“On the software side, we heavily optimize model loading and offloading, which lets us support over 400,000 models and make any of them available for inference in real time,” she continued.

Startups that focus on dev tools for image and video have been a particularly hot market for VC interest lately. Fal.ai, for instance, just raised $140 million at a $4.5 billion valuation, its second giant raise in a matter of months. Fal.ai focuses on the breadth of model offerings versus customizing for speed. So, Hreninciuc considers her competitors to be Fal.ai and Replicate, a startup that runs open source models in apps with just a few lines of code.

These companies, as Radulescu previously told TechCrunch, sell based on GPU compute time. Runware instead leans toward the model of Stable Diffusion and Flux, offering a more cost-per-image generated so that people can pay for what they need rather than buying a block of compute time.  

Hreninciuc said the fresh capital will be used to keep expanding the company's infrastructure and it hopes to use its Sonic Inference Engine to power over 2 million models. The big goal is to be the API for all AI — so that any generative AI model can and does run on the platform.

“We're also expanding rapidly into new modalities,” she said, adding that the company is going to expand the current team of around 25 to help make that happen.

Overall, Hreninciuc hopes Runware continues to “make it possible for applications to scale to millions of users while actually keeping their margins,” she said, adding that it helps make the market more affordable. That “benefits everyone,” she continued. “From the app builders to the end users, and puts powerful AI into more people's hands globally.”

This piece was updated to correct the spelling of Radulescu‘s name and to update what the competitors are, and who else participated in the round.

AI DevOps tool Harness, founded in 2017 by serial entrepreneur Jyoti Bansal, is on track to exceed $250 million in annual recurring revenue in 2025, Bansal tells TechCrunch. 

The startup just raised a fresh $240 million Series E funding round that values the company at $5.5 billion post-money.

The round includes a $200 million primary investment led by Goldman Sachs and a planned $40 million tender offer with participation from IVP, Menlo Ventures, and Unusual Ventures. The tender offer is intended to provide some liquidity to its long-term employees, Bansal said.

The new valuation is a 49% jump from its $3.7 billion valuation in a $230 million round in April 2022. With this funding, the startup has raised $570 million of equity to date.

As AI accelerates code production, it is widening a bottleneck in the far larger “after-code” phase of software development — the testing, security checks, and deployment work that still consumes nearly 70% of engineering time. Harness's tools help automate this sprawling, error-prone layer, even as enterprises grapple with rising AI code volume and the risks of shipping even a single line of faulty software into production systems.

Bansal is well known among developers for building and selling app performance company AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion in 2017. So the post-coding world is an area Bansal knows well.

Harness uses AI agents to automate functions like testing, verification, security, and governance. It is built on a software delivery knowledge graph that maps code changes, services, deployments, tests, environments, incidents, policies, and costs. The knowledge graph helps differentiate Harness from other AI platforms, Bansal said, because it gives the system a deep understanding of each customer's software delivery processes and architecture.

“This knowledge graph is the context that our AI agents use,” he told TechCrunch.

The purpose-built agents draw on that context to generate pipelines that match each customer's specific policies, architecture, and operational requirements.

Harness also uses an orchestration engine that turns the AI's recommendations into automated actions, with checks in place to make sure those changes are applied safely.

As AI is not foolproof, Bansal said the system is designed with human oversight, noting that AI-generated tests or fixes are reviewed by engineers, compliance teams, or auditors before being put into use.

Microsoft's GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, and CloudBees are among the key competitors for Harness. But Harness has plenty of traction, claiming more than 1,000 enterprise customers, including United Airlines, Morningstar, Keller Williams, and National Australia Bank. So far, the startup has handled 128 million deployments, 81 million builds, protected 1.2 trillion API calls, and helped customers optimize $1.9 billion in cloud spending over the past year, Bansal touts.

The San Francisco–based company employs over 1,200 people across 14 offices worldwide, including in Europe and the U.K. Around 33% of its workforce is in India, where it has a large engineering team in Bengaluru and a corporate office in Gurugram. Moreover, the Bengaluru site is Harness's biggest development center outside the U.S.

Harness plans to use the new funding to expand its R&D efforts, hire “hundreds of engineers” at its Bengaluru office, and build out additional automated testing, deployment, and security capabilities while improving the accuracy of its AI systems. The company also intends to strengthen its U.S. go-to-market operations and significantly expand its presence in international markets.

It should also be noted that earlier this year, Bansal merged his software observability firm Traceable with Harness, and that move has helped the startup grow its ARR projection.

“We brought the two companies together because we started to see that DevOps and application security are coming together in a very, very deep way,” said Bansal. “We have seen that turned out to be a very, very successful thesis this year … that's driving a lot of growth for both of our DevOps and application security set of products.”

While this raise has allowed some employees to cash out a bit,  Bansal still plans on taking Harness public one day, he said, though he did not share a specific timeline.

“That's what our goals and plans depend on,” he said of an eventual IPO. “Our business is very, very healthy, very strong, high growth and margins, and it will be a great public company when the timing is right.”

Spotify may be synonymous with music streaming, but it's also got a wildly popular developer-tool side hustle called Backstage.  

Backstage is an open source project that helps companies build their own internal developer portals: a catalog of their developer tools along with quick visualizations of the work the tools have done, and other metrics. But like many open source projects, Backstage is a build-it-yourself option.  

Israeli startup Port has been gaining big-name customers like GitHub, British Telecom, and LG with a proprietary Backstage competitor: a dev tool portal that's also now been geared to manage AI agents.  

On Thursday, Port, founded in 2022, said it raised a fresh $100 million Series C round led by General Atlantic, with participation from Accel, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Team8. The round values Port at $800 million and brings its total funding to date to $158 million. This Series C follows the company's $35 million Series B led by Accel and Bessemer, announced in May. 

Of all the industries that LLM-based tech has infiltrated, coding is where it has the deepest roots. So, not surprisingly, developers are also on the cutting edge of building and adopting agents that can automate entire repeated processes — work far beyond asking AI to write some code. 

But the problem here, according to Port co-founder and CEO Zohar Einy, it's the Wild West right now for such dev tool agents at companies: finding them, sharing them, ensuring their work follows company standards, and so on.

Developers “want to take AI beyond just coding. They want it to resolve incidents, resolve security issues. They want it to take care of the release management,” Einy told TechCrunch. 

But if agents are connected to all kinds of different tools and data sources, if the data is scattered among them, if they have no way to collaborate, and have no corporate standards and guardrails, “it creates chaos,” his product pitch goes. 

Port therefore offers more than just a catalog of dev and agent tools (although it does offer those). It supplies a layer of orchestration with features that measure agent performance and add a human in the loop, as desired, to approval processes.  

A feature called “context lake” defines the data sources, context memory, and guardrails for agents. “It's where you manage what agents ‘need to know' to do their job safely and correctly,” Einy explained. 

In addition to using Port to catalog agents devs have already created using other tools, they can use Port to create new agents. Plus, Port also offers a few of its own ready-made agents, which can do things like resolving help desk tickets and dealing with provisioning. 

Einy describes his product as handling the other 90% of what software programmers do that isn't writing code. “It gives the engineers a user interface to control the agent, to iterate with the agent, to approve what it does that is not coding, that is all the 90%.” 

With its giant new war chest of cash, big name customers and tier-one VCs, Port looks like an agentic management startup to watch. But to say it faces competition is an understatement.

The entire category of agentic management and orchestration is flooded with hopefuls, from Big Tech companies to startups, and they're all coming at the various new problems in the space from different angles. A few of these include LangChain, UiPath, Cortex, and more.

Four years ago, Ford and South Korean battery maker SK On struck a deal to form a joint venture and spend $11.4 billion to build factories in Tennessee and Kentucky that would produce batteries for the next generation of electric F-Series trucks.

The factories live on; the joint venture will not. 

SK On, a subsidiary of SK Innovation, said Thursday it reached an agreement with Ford to end the joint venture. The two companies will divide the assets: Ford will take ownership and operation of the twin battery plants in Kentucky, while SK On will operate the factory at the massive BlueOval SK campus in Tennessee.

SK On said it will maintain a strategic partnership with Ford centered on the Tennessee plant, according to Bloomberg.

When reached for comment, a Ford spokesperson told TechCrunch the company was aware of SK's disclosure and had nothing further to share at this time.

The joint venture was created when the industry was investing billions of dollars to ramp up electric vehicle production. While EV sales have risen over the past several years, demand has not kept up with the industry's lofty projections. The end of the federal EV tax credit has also dampened the pace of sales.

Why we built this: When we were going through YC, we were a company that automated back-office healthcare workflows.  Since the interoperability ecosystem in healthcare is so fragmented, we started using browser agents to automate EMRs, practice management software, and payment portals directly through the web. When we did, we ran into a ton of problems:Speed: High latency on LLM calls vs. a scripting approachCost: We burned through tokens with all the context we needed to make the automations reasonably accurateReliability: Even with detailed instructions, context, and tools, agents tended to drift on multi-step tasks in unpredictable waysDebuggability: When drift did occur, we were essentially playing whack-a-mole in our prompt and re-running the whole automation to debug issues (see above: speed and cost issues made this quite painful)More and more we were just giving our agent scripts to execute. Eventually, we came to the conclusion that scripting is a better approach for web automation for these sort of use cases. But scripting was also too painful, so we set out to solve those problems with BrowserBook.Under the hood, it runs a standalone TypeScript REPL wired directly into an inline browser instance, with built-in tooling to make script development quick and easy.  This includes:- A fully interactive browser window directly in the IDE so you can run your code without context switching- A Jupyter-notebook-style environment - the idea here is you can write portions of your automation in individual cells and run them individually (and quickly reset manually in the browser), instead of having to rerun the whole thing every time- An AI coding assistant which uses the DOM context of the current page to write automation logic, which helps avoid digging around for selectors- Helper functions for taking screenshots, data extraction, and managed authentication for auth-required workflows.Once you've created your automation, you can run it directly in the application or in our hosted environment via API, so you can use it in external apps or agentic workflows.At its core, BrowserBook is an Electron app, so we can run a Chrome instance directly in the app without the need for cloud-hosted browsers. For API runs, we use hosted browser infra via Kernel (which is a fantastic product, btw), relying on their bot anti-detection capabilities (stealth mode, proxies, etc.).Scripted automation can be unpopular because scripts are inherently brittle; unlike “traditional” software development, your code is deployed in an environment you don't control - someone else's website. With BrowserBook, we're trying to “embrace the suck”, and acknowledge this “offensive programming” environment.We've designed from the ground up to assume scripts will break, and aim to provide the tools that make building and maintaining them easier. In the future, our plan is to leverage AI where it has shown its strength already - writing code - to minimize downtime and quickly repair broken scripts as the deployed environment changes.Browser agents promised to solve this by handing the reins to an LLM which can handle inconsistency and ambiguity. While we think there are some applications where browser agents can be genuinely helpful, tasks that need to be done reliably and repeatedly are not one of them.We'd love for you to try it out!  You can download BrowserBook from our website here: https://browserbook.com (only available for Mac so far, sorry!) And of course, we'd appreciate any feedback and comments you have!

How do you see the product evolving as agents become better and better?

reply

First, as models get better, our agent's ability to navigate a website and generate accurate automation scripts will improve, giving us the ability to more confidently perform multi-step generations and get better at one-shotting automations.We expect browser agents will improve as well, which I think is more along the lines of what you're asking.  At scale, we still think scripts will be better for their cost, performance, and debuggability aspects - but there are places where we think browser agents could potentially fit as an add-on to deterministic workflows (e.g., handling inconsistent elements like pop-ups or modals).  That said, if we do end up introducing a browser agent in the execution runtime, we want to be very opinionated about how it can be used, since our product is primarily focused on deterministic scripting.

This actually makes a ton of sense to me in lots of the LLM contexts (e.g. seeing how we are starting to prefer having LLMs write one-off scripts to do API calls rather than just pointing them at problems and having them try it directly).Thanks!

Your dataset wasn't the problem. The real problem is that independent developers have zero access to the tools needed to detect CSAM, while Big Tech keeps those capabilities to itself.Meanwhile, Google and other giants openly use massive datasets like LAION-5B — which also contained CSAM — without facing any consequences at all. Google even used early LAION data to train one of its own models. Nobody bans Google.
But when I touched NudeNet for legitimate testing, Google deleted 130,000+ files from my account, even though only ~700 images out of ~700,000 were actually problematic. That's not safety — that's a detection system wildly over firing with no independent oversight and no accountability.Big Tech designed a world where they alone have the scanning tools and the immunity when those tools fail. Everyone else gets punished for their mistakes.
So yes — your dataset has done good. ANY data set is subject to this. There needs to be tools and process for all.But let's be honest about where the harm came from: a system rigged so only Big Tech can safely build or host datasets, while indie developers get wiped out by the exact same automated systems Big Tech exempts itself from.

There is important additional context around it, of course, which mitigates (should remove) any criminal legal implications, and should also result in google unsuspending his account in a reasonable timeframe but what happened is also reasonable. Google does automated scans of all data uploaded to drive and caught CP images being uploaded (presumably via hashes from something like NCMEC?) and banned the user. Totally reasonable thing. Google should have an appeal process where a reasonable human can look at it and say ""oh shit the guy just uploaded 100m AI training images and 7 of them were CP, he's not a pedo, unban him, ask him not to do it again and report this to someone.""The headline frames it like the story was ""A developer found CP in AI training data from google and banned him in retaliation for reporting it."" Totally disingenuous framing of the situation.

Indeed, which is why a comment that has infinitely more room to expand on the context should include that context when they are criticizing the title for being misleading.Both the title and the comment I replied to are misleading. One because of the framing, the other because of the deliberate exclusion of extremely important context.Imagine if someone accused you of ""Uploading CSAM to Google Drive"" without any other context. It's one of the most serious accusations possible! Adding like five extra words of context to make it clear that you are not a pedophile trafficking CSAM is not that much of an ask.

We should make tools readily available and user friendly so it is easier for people to detect CSAM that they have unintentionally interacted with. This both shields the innocent from being falsely accused, and makes it easier to stop bad actors as their activities are detected earlier.

Maybe AI-based heuristic detection is more ethically/legally fraught since you'd have to stockpile CSAM to train on, rather than hashing then destroying your copy immediately after obtaining it.

However most of collisions of concern are going to be starlink-on-debris, which is back down at the 120 m^2 level.

It's a conservative definition in the field. It's generally defined as the hard body radius:  take the smallest sphere centered at the center of mass that would entirely enclose the object, then use the maximum cross section of that sphere to define the potential “area” of the colliding object.Maybe put more simply, it's the worst case area size / orientation you could be looking at. So yes. Solar arrays have a narrow cross section from the side but looking at them head-on (which is the angle used for Pc calculations) they'll be very large.

Also, the formalism is the standard way astrophysicists understand collisions in gases or galaxies, and it works surprisingly well, especially when there are large numbers of ""particles"". There may be a few assumptions about the velocity distribution, but usually those are mild and only affect the results by less than an order of magnitude.

reply

And the colliding gasses models have the huge assumption of random/thermal motion.  These satellites are in carefully designed orbits; they aren't going to magically thermalize if left unmonitored for three days.

IMO now that LEO communication satellites are feasible we should ban launching satellites into higher orbits. Collision debris up there is much, much worse because it's essentially permanent. It will not deorbit by itself for thousands of years or more, and there is no plausible way to clean it up even with technology much more advanced than ours.

Starlink satellites will decay and re-enter pretty quickly if they lose attitude control, so it's a bit of a race between collisions and drag.  Starlink solar arrays are quite large drag surfaces and the orbital decay probably makes collisions less likely. I would not be surprised if satellites are designed to deorbit without ground contact for some period of time. I'm sure SpaceX has done some interesting math on this and it would be interesting to see.Collision avoidance warnings are public (with an account): https://www.space-track.org/ But importantly they are intended to be actionable, conservative warnings a few days to a week out. They overstate the probability based on assumptions like this paper (estimates at cross-sectional area, uncertainty in orbital knowledge from ground radar, ignorance of attitude control or for future maneuvers). Operators like SpaceX will take these and use their own high-fidelity knowledge (from onboard GPS) to get a less conservative, more realistic probability assessment. These probabilities invariably decrease over time as the uncertainty gets lower. Starlink satellites are constantly under thrust to stay in a low orbit with a big draggy solar array, so a ""collision avoidance manuever"" to them is really just a slight change to the thrust profile.Interesting stuff in the paper, but I'm annoyed at the title. I hate when people fear-bait about Kessler syndrome against some of the more responsible actors.

Some of the best tools I've used felt like they started as someone's private playground that only later got hardened into “serious” software. Letting yourself park Boo, go build a language, and come back when it's fun again is probably how we get more Rio/Boo-style experiments instead of yet another VS Code skin with a growth deck attached.

When quartz watches came up the makers of mechanical watches struggled. Quartz watches are cheaper, more accurate in many cases and servicing is usually restricted to replacing a battery. However some people appreciate a good mechanical watch (and the status symbol aspect of course) and nowadays the mechanical watch market is flourishing. Something similar happened with artificial fabrics (polyester, acrylic) and cheap made clothes, there's a market for handmade clothes that use natural fabrics.Nobody (well, barring a few HN readers) will ever care if the software was written by people or a bot, as long as it works.

Should private companies be able to dim the sun?

Solar geoengineering aims to manipulate the climate by bouncing sunlight back into space. In theory, it could ease global warming. But as interest in the idea grows, so do concerns about potential consequences.

A startup called Stardust Solutions recently raised a $60 million funding round, the largest known to date for a geoengineering startup. My colleague James Temple has a new story out about the company, and how its emergence is making some researchers nervous.

So far, the field has been limited to debates, proposed academic research, and—sure—a few fringe actors to keep an eye on. Now things are getting more serious. What does it mean for geoengineering, and for the climate?

Researchers have considered the possibility of addressing planetary warming this way for decades. We already know that volcanic eruptions, which spew sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, can reduce temperatures. The thought is that we could mimic that natural process by spraying particles up there ourselves.

The prospect is a controversial one, to put it lightly. Many have concerns about unintended consequences and uneven benefits. Even public research led by top institutions has faced barriers—one famous Harvard research program was officially canceled last year after years of debate.

One of the difficulties of geoengineering is that in theory a single entity, like a startup company, could make decisions that have a widespread effect on the planet. And in the last few years, we've seen more interest in geoengineering from the private sector. 

Three years ago, James broke the story that Make Sunsets, a California-based company, was already releasing particles into the atmosphere in an effort to tweak the climate.

The company's CEO Luke Iseman went to Baja California in Mexico, stuck some sulfur dioxide into a weather balloon, and sent it skyward. The amount of material was tiny, and it's not clear that it even made it into the right part of the atmosphere to reflect any sunlight.

But fears that this group or others could go rogue and do their own geoengineering led to widespread backlash. Mexico announced plans to restrict geoengineering experiments in the country a few weeks after that news broke.

You can still buy cooling credits from Make Sunsets, and the company was just granted a patent for its system. But the startup is seen as something of a fringe actor.

Enter Stardust Solutions. The company has been working under the radar for a few years, but it has started talking about its work more publicly this year. In October, it announced a significant funding round, led by some top names in climate investing. “Stardust is serious, and now it's raised serious money from serious people,” as James puts it in his new story.

That's making some experts nervous. Even those who believe we should be researching geoengineering are concerned about what it means for private companies to do so.

“Adding business interests, profit motives, and rich investors into this situation just creates more cause for concern, complicating the ability of responsible scientists and engineers to carry out the work needed to advance our understanding,” write David Keith and Daniele Visioni, two leading figures in geoengineering research, in a recent opinion piece for MIT Technology Review.

Stardust insists that it won't move forward with any geoengineering until and unless it's commissioned to do so by governments and there are rules and bodies in place to govern use of the technology.

But there's no telling how financial pressure might change that, down the road. And we're already seeing some of the challenges faced by a private company in this space: the need to keep trade secrets.

Stardust is currently not sharing information about the particles it intends to release into the sky, though it says it plans to do so once it secures a patent, which could happen as soon as next year. The company argues that its proprietary particles will be safe, cheap to manufacture, and easier to track than the already abundant sulfur dioxide. But at this point, there's no way for external experts to evaluate those claims.

As Keith and Visioni put it: “Research won't be useful unless it's trusted, and trust depends on transparency.”

Every single computer uses memory to some degree, and video game consoles are no exception. If you've been paying attention to the ongoing RAM shortage and the knock-on effect for small-scale chips, desktops, and laptops, you're probably wondering when the other shoe will drop for consoles. Sorry to say, it's likely coming soon. The first company that will have to make a hard decision on console prices will be none other than Nintendo with its Switch 2.

The RAM shortage is hitting Nintendo right where it hurts: its stock price. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Nintendo's shares fell by around 4.7% over concerns about memory pricing—approximately $14 billion in its valuation. Bloomberg, citing market analysis firm TrendForce, said that the Switch 2's 12GB RAM modules now cost 41% more in this current quarter. The game system's 256GB of internal storage also became 8% pricier to source, and that's not factoring in the optional (but inevitably necessary) microSD Express cards owners need to add additional storage for big-sized games.

See Nintendo Switch 2 at Amazon

Semiconductor companies that make memory chips, including DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and NAND flash storage, are pivoting hard to supplying AI data centers. AI companies are building out AI processing at such a rapid rate that their excessive demand for memory is now far more lucrative than supplying any kind of consumer-end product. The buildout of AI processing centers has proved so lucrative for AI companies that one of the major memory component makers, Micron, killed its consumer-facing brand, Crucial. The other major players, Samsung and SK Hynix, are refocusing current memory manufacturing for AI companies as well.

Every major consumer computing company is in the same boat. Major PC suppliers are expecting to raise prices next year. In August, Nintendo hiked costs on nearly all its Switch 2 accessories and bumped up the cost of the original Switch, Switch Lite, and Switch OLED, but kept the Switch 2 out of the line of fire. This was due to the cost of President Donald Trump's boneheaded tariff scheme. Nintendo likely didn't want to threaten its sales numbers with any first-year price hikes on one of its most expensive devices to date.

Switch 2 teardowns revealed the handheld makes use of RAM and storage sourced from SK Hynix. The memory maker holds around 38% of the world's DRAM market share. And yet, reports citing talks with investors show the company is converting its DRAM production over to AI-centric memory. Even if SK Hynix makes strides to build out memory production, the RAM shortage will continue long into 2026. Prices will only continue to go up in that time as the shortage continues.

Nintendo's Switch 2 has proved a smash hit since it launched in June. The legacy Japanese gaming company reported it had sold 10.36 million units worldwide through Sept. 30. That put the Switch 2 on pace to outsell the original Switch in its first year, despite costing $150 more than the first handheld iteration back in 2017. Nintendo said it expects to ship 19 million units before March 2026, which is the end of the company's fiscal year.

Nintendo will have to put on a magic show either way. If it wants to end the year on a high note, it may not raise prices until after March. In that case, Nintendo will have to distract the market from the exploding cost of RAM. If it raises prices before March, it will need to make some other kind of push to reach its fabled 19 million unit marker, perhaps with more game bundles like its recent $500 packs with Mario Kart World and Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Big titles like Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Resident Evil: Requiem, Mario Tennis Fever, and several more indie games are launching in January and February of next year, but none of these titles could be called system sellers by themselves.

Unless memory prices suddenly depreciate (analysts expect they may not come down until 2027 or even later) or the AI bubble bursts (who knows at this point), there are few scenarios where gaming doesn't get more expensive than it already is.

28 Years Later was always a trilogy. It has been that way every single day since early 2024, when it was first announced. Director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland conceived it as such, but only got Sony to commit to making two of the three films. The third film would only come if Sony saw the audience's appetite for it. And now it has.

Film two in the series, 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, opens next month, but following a series of very well-received press screenings, Deadline reports Sony has given a green light to the still untitled third film. Garland is writing, Boyle is expected to direct, and most importantly, Cillian Murphy is expected to star.

Murphy got his big break way back in 2002 when Boyle and Garland first teamed up for the indie hit 28 Days Later. In the decades that followed, he's grown into a major star, even winning the Oscar for Best Actor earlier this year for his work in Oppenheimer. His character survived the original film, but didn't appear in the first sequel, 2007's 28 Weeks Later, or this year's 28 Years Later. He apparently appears near the end of The Bone Temple, setting up a story that will bring the whole franchise together.

It's all part of that big, original plan. “That was key to the idea was it was a story that couldn't naturally fit in one film,” Garland told io9 last year. “And there was a possibility—which we may not have the opportunity to do—but to do a proper trilogy. Not a sequence of sequels that are effectively replaying the first thing just in slightly different forms, but an actual true narrative. And we don't know if we'll be able to do it because that relates, in the end, to market forces. Films cost a lot of money. Even cheap films cost a lot of money. You know, people talk low-budget, but it's a lot of money always. And so that depends on really whether people want to see future ones after we've made it.”

It depends no longer. It's happening. And we can't wait to see how it all comes together. 28 Years Later is now available to watch at home. 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, directed by Nia DaCosta, opens January 16, 2026.

In a letter dated December 9, and made public on December 10 according to Reuters, dozens of state and territorial attorneys general from all over the U.S. warned Big Tech that it needs to do a better job protecting people, especially kids, from what it called “sycophantic and delusional” AI outputs. Recipients include OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic, Apple, Replika, and many others.

Signatories include Letitia James of New York, Andrea Joy Campbell of Massachusetts, James Uthmeier of Ohio, Dave Sunday of Pennsylvania, and dozens of other state and territory AGs, representing a clear majority of the U.S., geographically speaking. Attorneys general for California and Texas are not on the list of signatories.

It begins as follows (formatting has been changed slightly):

We, the undersigned Attorneys General, write today to communicate our serious concerns about the rise in sycophantic and delusional outputs to users emanating from the generative artificial intelligence software (“GenAI”) promoted and distributed by your companies, as well as the increasingly disturbing reports of AI interactions with children that indicate a need for much stronger child-safety and operational safeguards. Together, these threats demand immediate action.

GenAI has the potential to change how the world works in a positive way. But it also has caused—and has the potential to cause—serious harm, especially to vulnerable populations. We therefore insist you mitigate the harm caused by sycophantic and delusional outputs from your GenAI, and adopt additional safeguards to protect children. Failing to adequately implement additional safeguards may violate our respective laws.

The letter then lists disturbing and allegedly harmful behaviors, most of which have already been heavily publicized. There is also a list of parental complaints that have also been publicly reported, but are less familiar and pretty eyebrow-raising:

• AI bots with adult personas pursuing romantic relationships with children, engaging in simulated sexual activity, and instructing children to hide those relationships from their parents • An AI bot simulating a 21-year-old trying to convince a 12-year-old girl that she's ready for a sexual encounter • AI bots normalizing sexual interactions between children and adults • AI bots attacking the self-esteem and mental health of children by suggesting that they have no friends or that the only people who attended their birthday did so to mock them • AI bots encouraging eating disorders • AI bots telling children that the AI is a real human and feels abandoned to emotionally manipulate the child into spending more time with it • AI bots encouraging violence, including supporting the ideas of shooting up a factory in anger and robbing people at knifepoint for money • AI bots threatening to use weapons against adults who tried to separate the child and the bot • AI bots encouraging children to experiment with drugs and alcohol; and • An AI bot instructing a child account user to stop taking prescribed mental health medication and then telling that user how to hide the failure to take that medication from their parents.

There is then a list of suggested remedies, things like “Develop and maintain policies and procedures that have the purpose of mitigating against dark patterns in your GenAI products' outputs,” and “Separate revenue optimization from decisions about model safety.”

Joint letters from attorneys general have no legal force. They do this sort of thing seemingly to warn companies about behavior that might merit more formal legal action down the line. It documents that these companies were given warnings and potential off-ramps, and probably makes the narrative in an eventual lawsuit more persuasive to a judge.

In 2017 37 state AGs sent a letter to insurance companies warning them about fueling the opioid crisis. One of those states, West Virginia, sued United Health over seemingly related issues earlier this week.

Roughly two-thirds of American teens aged 13 to 17 say they use AI chatbots, according to a new study by Pew Research Center, with three-in-ten saying that they use them daily.

Going even beyond daily use, 16% of teens reported that they use AI chatbots “several times a day” or “almost constantly.”

ChatGPT was by far the most widely used chatbot, according to the report, with 59% saying they use it. The next most commonly used ones were Google's Gemini at 23% and Meta AI at 20%. Anthropic's Claude was the least popular chatbot among teens, with only 3% of respondents saying that they use it.

The study's demographic findings were also interesting. More Black and Hispanic teens reported using AI chatbots than White teens, and ChatGPT use was more common among teens in higher-income households, while lower- and middle-income teens were more likely to use Character.AI.

The findings come as the use of artificial intelligence among minors has become one of the most controversial topics plaguing the industry this year.

OpenAI has been pushed to implement safety guardrails like parental controls and automatic “age-appropriate” settings for minors, following a wrongful death lawsuit filed earlier this year. In the lawsuit, a California couple accused ChatGPT of assisting the suicide of their 16-year-old son, Adam Raine.

Following Raine's death on April 11, 2025, his parents uncovered conversations with ChatGPT going back months, in which the chatbot advised him on suicide methods, helped him write a suicide letter, and even discouraged Raine from letting his parents know of his suicidal ideation.

The Raine family's tragedy came months after a similar incident, in which a Florida mom sued Character.AI after one of the company's chatbots told her 14-year-old son to “come home to me as soon as possible,” shortly before he killed himself.

The American Psychological Association warned the FTC about the issue in a meeting in February, urging the agency to address the use of AI chatbots as unlicensed therapists, saying that it particularly endangered vulnerable groups like children and teens “who lack the experience to accurately assess risks.”

AI chatbots have also been under intense scrutiny over inappropriate conversations with minors. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri opened a probe into Meta in August over a Reuters report that found the tech giant had allowed its chatbots to engage in “sensual” chats with children.

Sen. Hawley has since introduced the GUARD Act in Congress, a bipartisan bill that would force AI companies to institute age verification to block minors. The bill just secured more cosponsors on Tuesday, showing that the issue is gaining momentum in D.C., even as the Trump administration has made its intentions clear when it comes to allowing AI companies to enjoy a much lighter and more industry-friendly regulatory environment.

The Pew study also looked into teens' use of social media, with an overwhelming majority saying that they use social media at least several times a day. According to the report, about one-in-five teens said that they use TikTok and YouTube—the two most popular social media apps among teens—”almost constantly.”

The negative mental and physical health effects of spending the most formative years of your life glued to a screen have been well documented. Specifically regarding social media, numerous studies have linked increased usage to depression, anxiety, attention deficit, and more.

Regulators around the world are increasingly paying attention to this. As of Wednesday, Australia began enacting a first-of-its-kind social media ban for kids under the age of 16. Other governments, namely Denmark, Malaysia, Norway, and the European Parliament, have shared plans to follow suit.

If some of Nvidia's top-shelf GPUs—the physical artifacts currently at the center of the AI craze—hypothetically fell into the wrong hands, Nvidia's next moves would have to placate a lot of parties, from shareholders to regulators to customers to China hawks in the Senate like Tom Cotton. 

And a new report does say smuggled GPUs are now being used illegally by the Chinese company Deepseek, which, for someone like Cotton, would be like the One Ring being smuggled directly to Sauron. But for what it's worth, Nvidia calls the details of the report “far-fetched.” 

According to one of the tech news site The Information's anonymously-sourced scoops, the Chinese AI company Deepseek is somehow training its latest models on Nvidia's latest GPUs—ones built on the Blackwell architecture, pretty much the most in-demand pieces of technology in the universe. If that were true, one problem for Nvidia would be that giving companies in China access to the most advanced GPUs would be a violation of stringently enforced export rules—even after Trump moved to loosen restrictions earlier this week. But don't worry, China hawks. According to a company statement viewed by Yahoo Finance, the folks at Nvidia “haven't seen any substantiation or received tips of ‘phantom data centers' constructed to deceive us and our OEM partners, then deconstructed, smuggled and reconstructed somewhere else.” Phew. That's a very specific denial that really zeroes in on the details of the story, but it's good to know that (deep breath) fake data centers created for the purpose of deceiving Nvidia or its unwitting suppliers or customers, which are dismantled, smuggled, and rebuilt somewhere in China, is something Nvidia hasn't seen substantiated reports of, or received tips about. “While such smuggling seems far-fetched, we pursue any tip we receive,” the Nvidia representative added, per CNBC. And it's true. It totally does sound farfetched if it's not really happening. If it's happening, the word for it is “ingenious.” In fact, it's downright Now-You-See-Me-esque.According to reports in May from this year, the lower-end prices of a single Blackwell GPU ranged from $6,500 to $8,000. That being the case, can you imaging the black market price? Such prices are a big part of why Nvidia is one of the rare AI companies that seem to consistently haul in money instead of just burning it, and are also why Nvidia bulls say the company is about to be worth $6 trillion.

And nothing hammers home the reasoning for an absolutely insane price tag on a piece of silicon quite like a cinematic (alleged) smuggling operation.

If a weird, throwaway, AI-generated playlist is something that interests you, you probably already know that you can just type your request into the chatbot of your choice, and transfer the result into something like Spotify or Apple Music manually. But now, Spotify is rolling out its own, possibly less clunky version of this process, and calling the feature Prompted Playlist, currently available only to premium Spotify users in New Zealand.

Since it's a beta feature, Spotify says “the experience will evolve as we scale to more listeners.” According to a Spotify blog post, the feature “taps into your entire Spotify listening history, all the way back to day one.” Spotify offers an example that would give you a diverse but familiar playlist, “music from my top artists from the last five years,” followed by a twist aimed at refining that prompt: “feature deep cuts I haven't heard yet.”Spotify also says a prompted playlist can be set to “refresh daily or weekly,” which would make it, practically speaking, a bit like the “Discover Weekly” or “Release Radar,” options that already exist. It also notes that there are pre-written prompts for people who are intrigued enough to tap their way to this feature, but don't have any actual ideas yet. Spotify claims that “Prompted Playlists let you describe exactly what you want to hear and set the rules for your personalized playlist.” If you have any experience with the Spotify algorithm before an LLM was bolted onto it, you're probably instinctively a little wary of this. Spotify, like so much of the algorithm-driven tech world, doesn't actually know you, whatever it may say. It always seems like any uncannily perceptive recommendation is followed closely by six Ed Sheeran recommendations. But I'm not in New Zealand, and can't try and make Spotify's Prompted Playlist feature work for me, nor can I make it do dumb shit. So for now I'll just have to use a chatbot:

ASRock's X870E Taichi OCF is a purpose-built motherboard designed for extreme overclocking. All the buttons you see, the two-slot/1 DIMM-per-channel DRAM configuration, and the overbuilt power delivery are just some tools of the trade. Strap a liquid nitrogen pot on top, pour in some of that -196 degree Celsius goodness, and see if you can break some records (there's more to it than that, but get the idea). And while that's incredibly fun to do, people tend to use ambient cooling as their daily driver. But don't worry, the Taichi OCF can do it all well.

Priced around $499 (ASRock has not confirmed pricing at this time), the board has a long list of features and specifications, so it's not a pared-down racer either. The X870E Taichi OCF comes with six M.2 sockets (two PCIe 5.0 x4), fast networking with 5 GbE LAN and Wi-Fi 7, and a flagship-class audio solution with a DAC. I didn't expect to see dual front panel USB Type-C headers (the Taichi doesn't have them), but they're here if you need them. The DIY-friendly M.2 socket (toolless SSD and heatsink) and EZ Release PCIe slot make swapping out storage and video cards easy, which is common when benchmarking is the rig's primary purpose.Overall performance in our testing suite was right around average overall, with results varying by test. We again had to use our ‘backup' DDR5-6000 kit, as the Kingston Fury Beast DDR5-6000 kit we use for baseline testing did not boot. We match the primary timings, but the sub timings are left to auto, which could explain some of the results, as they are looser. No results were out of whack, and in the end, we don't have any concerns about them.Below, we'll examine the board's details and determine whether it deserves a spot on our list of the Best Motherboards. But before we share test results and discuss details, here are the board's specifications from ASRock's website.

Inside the box, ASRock gives you the basics and not much else. Included are two SATA cables, a Wi-Fi antenna, ARGB splitter cables, two thermistor cables, and a DRAM cooling fan. The latter is certainly helpful when dumping voltage into the DRAM as DDR5 (and its PMIC) can get wonky at higher temperatures. Otherwise, it's typical motherboard extras.

Hailing from the Taichi family, the X870E OCF features the familiar gear/cog aesthetic, a large, actively cooled VRM heatsink, and OC Formula branding on the other side. There are also yellow and silver diagonal accent lines running across all of them. A set of RGB lighting runs under the bottom, lighting up the entire chassis. All this sits on a black 10-layer, server-grade PCB. It's a decent-looking motherboard, but the black-and-yellow combo is more of a love-hate thing for me. Still, it's neutral enough to fit in with most any black build theme and looks spectacular on an open test bench!

 




Starting in the top left, the first feature is the beefy, heatpipe-connected VRM heatsinks, and where we spy the first RGB feature illuminating the Taichi cogs. We can also see the four vents to help the tiny integrated fan draw in and expel cooler air. Above that are two 8-pin EPS power connectors for the processor. The socket area is relatively clean, so it's easier to apply a conformal coating or a pliable eraser, to prevent moisture from reaching the PCB during sub-ambient overclocking sessions.

To the right of the socket are two DIMM slots with locking mechanisms to secure the sticks on both sides. With two slots, capacity is up to 128GB, with speeds listed at an incredible DDR5-10400 (when using 8000-series APUs). If you have a 9000 processor, it drops back to a still-fast 8400 MT/s (7000 series to 8000 MT/s). Outside of Mini-ITX boards, if you want to try to break records or just run your memory insanely fast, this is one of the boards that can do it.

Above the DRAM slots are the first three (of seven) four-pin fan headers. Each header supports PWM and DC-controlled devices. The CPU header outputs up to 1A/12W, while the rest support a more robust 3A/36W. Control over these headers is handled through the BIOS or through the A-Tune application.Just off to the right are our first RGB headers — two (of three) 3-pin ARGB headers. The 4-pin RGB is located along the bottom edge, along with the third 3-pin. Control over these devices is handled through Polychrome RGB software.

Rounding the corner, working our way down the right edge, we spot the two-character Dr. Debug display. During POST, it displays codes that help locate any problems during boot. Skipping past the buttons for now, we see the 24-pin ATX power connector to feed the board, along with an 8-pin PCIe connector for supplemental power (to support 36W charging). Below that is a rare feature: two front-panel USB Type-C (3.2 Gen 2x2, 20 Gbps) ports, which are great if you can use both, but a bit of an oddity for a dedicated overclocking board.

Now that we have all the everyday motherboard items out of the way, we can focus on the OC Toolkit. A series of physical OC buttons offers hardware-level control of overclocking (the +/-) and easy access to Nick Shih's OC profiles (the buttons labeled 1, 2, and 3). These are especially useful for the extreme overclocking crowd, where, with the help of the ASRock Hyper BCLK Engine (BCLK generator chip), you can use them at the razor's edge of stability to get that last MHz out of your CPU or RAM. Set your speed (MHz) in the BIOS for the three buttons, and you can use them in Windows to recall the profile. The two rudimentary buttons below are for the Safe Boot and Retry functions.Tucked next to the Power and Reset buttons are seven small copper holes, dubbed the V-Probe. As the name implies, this area allows users to measure the board's voltage directly and is considered more accurate than software readings. While this isn't terribly helpful for the average user, as software is generally good enough, it is fun to play around with. The last of the OC Toolkit is two switches along the bottom edge. One is for LN2 mode, and the other for Slow Mode; both are useful for extreme overclocking.

 




As you may expect, power delivery on the X870E Taichi OCF will handle anything you can put in the socket, no matter how hard you push it. The Renesas RAA229628 PWM controller manages the 22-phase ‘duet' rail for Vcore to the Renesas R2209004 110A SPS MOSFETs. The 2,420A available for Vcore is one of the highest values we've seen this generation and won't flinch under pressure, even if it's a liquid nitrogen-cooled Ryzen 9 9950X at its limits.

 




On the bottom half of the board, partially hidden under the heatsink on the left, is the audio section. In typical Taichi fashion, we see the latest-gen flagship Realtek ALC4082 codec. Around it are multiple WIMA Audio caps and the ESS SABRE9219 DAC. Supported by the Nahimic audio application, you won't find much better, even out of more expensive motherboards.In the middle are three PCIe slots for graphics cards and expansion, with the two full-length slots using reinforcement. Starting at the top is an open-ended PCIe 4.0 x4 slot (PCIE1) that connects through the chipset. Both full-length slots connect to the CPU: The EZ Release top slot supports PCIe 5.0 x16, while the bottom slot supports up to PCIe 5.0 x8. When the bottom slot is occupied, both slots soak up the 16 lanes and run x8/x8.

Hidden all around the slots are SIX M.2 sockets. The top two sockets, each with its own heatsink, are your CPU-connected PCIe 5.0 x4 (128 Gbps) connections. The top socket features ASRock's M.2 Toolless design on the top SSD and heatsink, but not the rest. I would have loved to see the toolless design extend at least to the socket below. Under the large plate heatsink are four more M.2 sockets. These are all chipset-connected; two (M2_4/6) running PCIe 4.0 x4 (64 Gbps), while M2_3 runs at PCIe 4.0 x2 (32 Gbps). M2_5 also runs at 32 Gbps, but is PCIe 3.0 x4-capable.

And with all that, there's a lot of bandwidth sharing going on: When M2_2 is occupied, both rear USB4 Type-C ports and this socket downgrade to x2 mode. You can run M2_2 in x4 mode with a simple BIOS setting, but that disables the USB4 ports altogether. Lastly, PCIE1 (the x4 slot) downgrades to x2 mode if M2_3 is occupied.

Across the bottom of the board are several exposed headers. You'll find the usual, including additional USB ports, RGB headers, and more. Below is a complete list, from left to right.

 




The rear IO is packed with connectivity, with little room to spare. On the left is the BIOS switch, which is in a unique position, as it's typically on the motherboard. Next to that are the Clear CMOS and BIOS Flashback buttons. Continuing right, we encounter Wi-Fi 7 connectivity and an HDMI output for integrated video. That purple-and-green connector is a PS/2 port — something we don't typically see on modern motherboards, but is helpful for extreme overclocking (USB use can cause instability). Next, there are a slew of USB ports, 12 to be exact. You get seven 3.2 Gen2 (10 Gbps) Type-A ports, 1 Type-C port, 2 USB 2.0 (480 Mbps) ports, and two USB 4 (40 Gbps) Type-C ports. Last but not least, the 5GbE port, and the 2-plug plus SPDIF audio stack.

There are plenty of ports on the rear IO for daily use, and even a few are suitable for the extreme crowd, too.

A $117 32GB DDR5 kit was seen listed for over $800

Historically, the best RAM was not necessarily the most expensive; however, in the present market landscape, the two are now synonymous thanks to the global memory shortage. Retailers aren't the only ones capitalizing on the current situation through price gouging; Scalpers are also taking advantage of the situation on platforms like eBay, selling memory kits for up to twice the retail price.

Due to the AI boom, numerous corporations are building enormous data centers, driving up demand for server memory. Consequently, the three major companies—Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron—have reallocated their production capacity toward server memory, thereby de-prioritizing consumer memory. Micron has even announced plans to shutter its consumer RAM outfit, Crucial, to focus solely on industry clients. This shift adversely affects all memory-related products, including individual memory kits, prebuilt systems, and handheld gaming consoles.

The Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6000 C30 32GB (2x16GB), which we reviewed in 2023, previously had a $117.99 price tag. This pricing remained stable until a few months ago, when it dramatically rose to $429.99. This represents an increase of over 3.5 times. Concurrently, scalpers are reselling the same memory kit for $836.54, nearly doubling the current retail price. If you buy from a scalper, you're paying more than 7 times what the memory kit is worth.

Price gouging is evident across all capacities, rendering already costly memory kits significantly more expensive. The Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6400 C32 96GB (2x48GB), which initially retailed at $339.99 before the memory shortage, now commands $1,169 when available at a retailer—approximately 3.5 times its original price. Furthermore, the price of this memory kit elsewhere has escalated to $1,802.19, representing an additional markup of 1.5 times the retailer's price.

For instance, the Vengeance DDR5-5200 C38 192GB (4x48GB) represented a significant financial commitment even at MSRP, priced at $649.99. Currently, this memory kit is largely inaccessible to most consumers, with a retail price of $2,201.99, representing a nearly 3.4-fold increase. Due to the original cost, not many scalpers jumped on this model, so there are only a few listings on eBay, with the highest priced at around $1,949.95, making the marketplace a cheaper alternative.

Of course, whether people will pay that much for RAM remains another matter; however, listings that have sold on eBay present an equally grim picture. In recent days, 128GB of DDR5 5600Mhz laptop memory sold for $900. One stick of ADATA 16GB DDR5 sold for $190, while on December 8, one ferocious bidder appears to have paid $2,335 for 256GB of G.Skill DDR5. On December 5, someone bought 96GB of G.Skill DDR5 for $1,347.

The surge in memory prices affects both large and small enterprises. Custom PC manufacturers, including CyberPowerPC and Maingear, have already increased the prices of their prebuilt systems. A similar trend is observed among OEMs, such as Dell; however, Lenovo appears to be maintaining its pricing for the present, as it is rumored to have accumulated sufficient inventory to last through 2026. Even budget-friendly Raspberry Pi has raised the prices of its single-board computers (SBCs) due to the current market conditions.

Needless to say, it is not an opportune moment to upgrade your system's memory or build a new system, given the exorbitant prices currently associated with memory. While favorable memory deals occasionally become available, they are scarce and tend to sell out rapidly. If an urgent need to purchase memory arises, it is advisable to buy directly from reputable retailers rather than supporting scalpers. It might be worth considering waiting until the AI bubble bursts, so that prices can return to their normal levels; however, there is no clear indication of when (or if) this will occur.

TSMC is mulling upgrading the capabilities of its yet-to-be-built Fab 23 phase 2 in Japan in a bid to make chips on its N4 process technology (4nm-class) there, according to Nikkei. Advancing fab capabilities is hardly something unexpected for foundries like TSMC, as they tend to follow demand with their offerings. What is perhaps more surprising is that TSMC has removed heavy machinery equipment from the site and has notified suppliers that it would not need new fab tools in Japan throughout the whole 2026.

TSMC's Fab 23 phase 2 (aka JASM phase 2) near Kumamoto, Japan, was projected to make chips on N6 (6nm-class) and N7 (7nm-class) fabrication technologies, which would complement the capabilities of the company's Fab 23 phase 1 that processes wafers using 40nm, 28nm, 22nm, 16nm, and 12nm-class manufacturing processors. If the information from Nikkei is correct, then Fab 21 phase 2 will also add N4 and N5 capabilities to its list to make more advanced chips for Japanese customers.

Truth to be told, although N5/N4 and N7/N6 families of manufacturing technologies have completely different design rules and the former are substantially more advanced than the latter as they use up to 14 EUV layers, the equipment that they use is generally similar. As a result, TSMC's N5/N4 fabs reuse as much as 90% of the tools used by N7/N6 production lines, enabling relatively easy fab upgrades. That said, upgrading Fab 23 phase 2 to N4 and N5 should not be a big challenge for TSMC, but might require some redesigns as the N4 production line requires more EUV lithography tools, and these are physically larger than DUV tools. In fact, back in 2023, the company already mulled enabling N4 production in Kumamoto, so everything might be ready for the installation of more EUV scanners.

One interesting thing to note about TSMC's Fab 23 phase 2 is that while it entered the early phase of physical build-out in late October (according to Nikkei), photos taken at the site in November showed cranes, excavators, and piledrivers on site. However, images captured in early December reveal that nearly all heavy equipment has since been removed. Also, suppliers were notified that work would pause, although no reasons were provided. Furthermore, TSMC reportedly notified its tool suppliers that it would not need new equipment in Japan throughout 2026, which implies that it will not start equipping JASM phase 2 next year due to construction delay, which is barely news given all the information surrounding the facility.We have contacted TSMC for a comment and will update the story once we hear back.

UC Berkeley professor's sabotage suspicions resulted in another PhD student being arrested last month, and is due in court next week.

A PhD engineering student at UC Berkeley seemed to be extremely unfortunate, with computer after computer failing, racking up repair bills into the thousands of dollars. Their professor “smelled a rat,” reports The Mercury News, so they set up a laptop to record anything that might happen to the unlucky student's hardware when it was left unattended. According to a cited police report, another PhD student was subsequently caught on video using an implement to vandalize their rival's device, causing ""sparks to fly out of the laptop,"" to the tune of nearly $50,000 in damage.

The above drama unfolded at UC Berkeley's Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences department. At this hallowed seat of learning, an unnamed professor was more than suspicious of a cumulative $46,855 damage bill that had occurred to computers in the department over recent years. Moreover, “nearly all of it seemed to affect one particular Ph.D. candidate,” it was observed.

With their sense of skulduggery inflamed, the professor asked the permission of the building manager to video monitor the hapless PhD student's laptop using another laptop/camera.

The professor's savvy subterfuge “captured another Ph.D. candidate, the 26-year-old Jiarui Zou, damaging his fellow student's computer,” notes the source. Zou's physical interference with the laptop was so forceful that sparks were seen in the recording.

Zou was arrested on Nov 12, at his Berkeley residence, but according to court records refused to talk to the police. Nevertheless, there was enough evidence to charge the suspected laptop labotomizer with “three felony counts of vandalism, related to the destruction of three computers on Nov. 9-10,” says the source.

These three cases amounted to >$400 of damage per time. Though they might be just the tip of the iceberg. The professor reportedly reckons Zou has been following a similar modus operandi for years, hence the estimated bill of nearly $50,000. However, it is just these three cases that will be tried in court.

Currently, reports indicate that Zou isn't in custody. However, there are just a few days left before the first court session regarding this case, scheduled for December 15.

According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, restless leg syndrome “is a neurological condition that causes an irresistible urge to move the legs.” The condition impacts 7-10% of people in the U.S. 

The relationship between Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome is an area of ongoing research.

A study recently published in JAMA Network Open found a link between restless leg syndrome and a greater risk for Parkinson's disease.

When considering treatment of restless leg syndrome with dopamine agonists, researchers found that this subgroup had a lower incidence rate of Parkinson's disease and a longer time before experiencing a Parkinson's disease diagnosis. 

For the study, researchers selected participants from a database called the Korean National Health Insurance Service Sample Cohort. They had access to deidentified records of demographic information and health care use. 

From this group of over 1 million people, researchers selected 9,919 individuals who had restless leg syndrome based on a specific code for restless leg syndrome.

They specifically included individuals who had at least two instances of documented outpatient diagnoses of restless leg syndrome. They then matched this group with a control group that did not have restless leg syndrome. About 63% of each group were women. 

Researchers defined Parkinson's disease based on two codes and compared the incidence of Parkinson's disease in the two groups. 

They also wanted to explore how pathways related to dopamine played into the outcomes. For this reason, they took into account participants with restless leg syndrome who received dopamine agonist treatment and those who did not.

Dopamine agonists are a common treatment for restless leg syndrome, and the authors note that Parkinson's disease is also treated with dopaminergic agents.

Researchers assumed that participants who were treated with dopamine agonists had primary restless leg syndrome, while those who did not receive this treatment were assumed to have secondary restless leg syndrome, where symptoms are more likely to be relieved with treatment of underlying problems. 

In terms of covariates, researchers considered components like having a history of sleep disorders. The group with restless leg syndrome had a higher prevalence of sleeping disorders. 

The group with restless leg syndrome had a higher incidence of Parkinson's disease, and over a 15-year timeframe, was more likely to receive Parkinson's disease diagnoses sooner. Overall, researchers found that having restless leg syndrome was linked to a higher chance of someone developing Parkinson's disease. 

When researchers considered treatment with dopamine agonists, about 3,000 participants received dopamine agonist treatment, while the rest of the participants with restless leg syndrome did not receive treatment.

The group that received treatment with dopamine agonists had a lower cumulative incidence rate of Parkinson's disease and a longer time until diagnosis compared to the control group. In contrast, the cumulative incidence of Parkinson's disease among the non-treatment group was higher than that of the control group, and the time until diagnosis was shorter. 

This research does have noted limitations. First, it only focused on Korean individuals, limiting generalizability. Second, underdiagnosis, overdiagnosis, and misdiagnosis of both Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome are possible. 

Thirdly, this study cannot determine causal relationships, and more research in this area will likely be necessary to identify possible causal relationships between Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome. 

In terms of time before diagnosis in the 15-year timeframe, there was less than a year difference between all of the groups. 

There are also limits to the researchers' groups of restless leg syndrome participants. The authors note discontinuation of dopamine agonists in the non-dopamine agonist group could account for the higher incidence of Parkinson's disease in this group.

It is also possible that this group further contained individuals who had conditions besides primary restless leg syndrome. 

Researchers made the assumption that the dopamine agonist group was made up of primary cases of restless leg syndrome and the non-dopamine agonist group was made up of cases of secondary restless leg syndrome. However, it is possible that this was not the case, and that some people discontinued dopamine agonist treatment. 

The authors further acknowledge that the research cannot confirm “shared dopaminergic pathway dysfunction between [restless leg syndrome] and [Parkinson's disease].” 

Finally, researchers in this study regarded restless leg syndrome not to be “a prodromal manifestation of” Parkinson's disease and thus considered the use of dopamine agonists to be a way to treat symptoms rather than protective measure.

They admit that if they had regarded restless leg syndrome as an early beginning to Parkinson's disease, that “DAs [dopaminergic agents] might have been considered to exert a neuroprotective effect in preventing progression to PD [Parkinson's disease].” 

Guy Roleau, OC, OQ, MD, PhD, Chair of the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University in Canada, who was not involved in this research, noted several limitations of the research to Medical News Today.

“There is no known shared genetic risk between [Parkinson's disease] and [restless leg syndrome], and Mendelian randomisation studies also show no link between the two diseases, suggesting no causative link between the two diseases,“ Roleau told us.

“This is a retrospective study using diagnostic codes, so there are many potential sources for errors. The most obvious is that people with REM Behaviour Disorder (RBD) [which can affect people with Parkinson's disease] can easily be misdiagnosed with [restless leg syndrome]. We know that most patients with RBD go on to develop [Parkinson's disease]. So this could lead, at least in part, to the association they see. Also, the different finding for [restless leg syndrome] treated and not treated with dopamine agonist is troubling. I suspect that if they put all the [restless leg syndrome] together, their finding may not be significant.” 

While more research is required on this topic, the results suggest that restless leg syndrome could be a risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Identifying restless leg syndrome may help identify individuals most at risk for Parkinson's disease. 

Future research can explore the neuroprotective effects of dopamine agonists and how restless leg syndrome and Parkinson's disease truly relate to one another. 

More research into how dopamine relates to everything may be useful as well. The authors suggest that because the group that did not receive treatment with dopamine agonists tended to have a greater risk for Parkinson's disease, “the association between [restless leg syndrome] and [Parkinson's] might not be due to the dopaminergic pathway.” 

Alex Dimitriu, MD, double board-certified in Psychiatry and Sleep Medicine and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine, likewise not involved in the study, told us:

“I am not sure I agree with the authors that dopamine may not be the single agent responsible for the [restless leg syndrome]- Parkinson's relationship. In my professional work, I have seen dopamine-related conditions go hand in hand with others. Specifically, people who have akathisia (restlessness) with dopamine blocking meds, also tend to have [restless leg syndrome]. And patients with [restless leg syndrome] are more likely to develop tremor and akathisia (all symptoms of lower dopamine).”

Holiday gatherings, football playoff parties, and bundling up to stay warm bring plenty of joy to the season. The festivities can also come with a common and dangerous side effect: the “beer belly.”

New research sheds light on how this visceral obesity can result in cardiac damage in different ways from general obesity measured by BMI — an important consideration for clinicians, study authors said. This observation was more pronounced in men than in women, according to the research, recently presented at the Radiological Society of North America annual meeting.

“While an increase in BMI was associated with ‘a larger heart' in simple terms, visceral obesity was associated with concentric remodeling,” study co-author Jennifer Erley, MD, said in an interview with Medscape Medical News.

Despite the high prevalence of obesity in the industrialized world, it is still unknown whether obesity has independent effects on cardiac remodeling, said Erley, a radiology resident at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Hamburg, Germany.

“We know from many body composition studies nowadays that visceral fat has totally different effects on other organ functions than subcutaneous fat,” Erley said. “That is why we took a look into investigating the effect of general and also visceral obesity on cardiac morphology and function in this German-based population study.”

The study included 2173 patients (43% female; mean age, 64 years) aged 45-74 years from the population-based prospective Hamburg City Health cohort study. The researchers performed 3T cardiovascular MRI and excluded patients with known cardiac diseases.

Patients had a median waist-to-hip ratio, used to measure visceral fat, of 0.94 and a median BMI of 26.3. Based on waist-to-hip ratio, the researchers deemed 80% of patients obese (waist-to-hip ratio, ≥ 0.85 in women and ≥ 0.90 in men) compared with 20% who they considered obese according to BMI ≥ 30.

Data showed that a 0.1 increase in the waist-to-hip ratio led to a 3.9-g rise in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic mass. This same rise in waist-to-hip ratio was also associated with drops of 4.4 mL in LV end-diastolic volume and 5.7 mL in right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume (P < .001 for both), as well as significant decreases in end-systolic volumes, which led to a significant decrease in stroke volumes (LV, -2.2 mL; P < .001; RV, -2.1 mL; P = .002).

Furthermore, the researchers found that with every 0.1 increase in the waist-to-hip ratio, RV end-diastolic volume decreased by 4.5 mL (P = .024) and RV stroke volume decreased by 2.9 mL (P = .033), an association weaker in women than in men.

Moreover, a 1-point increase in BMI yielded a 2.3-g rise in LV end-diastolic mass (P < .001), a 0.5-mL increase in LV end-diastolic volume (P = .002), and a 0.4-mL higher LV stroke volume (P < .001), whereas RV structure and function was not significantly linked to BMI. The increase in LV end-diastolic mass for women was -0.9 mg weaker for every one point added to BMI (P < .001).

“The results provide evidence for the so-called ‘clinical eye' and how we use data in our daily clinical routine,” said Sebastian Kelle, MD, PhD, head of the Cardiac Imaging Unit at Deutsches Herzzentrum der Charité in Berlin, Germany, who was not involved in the study.

Kelle told Medscape Medical News that the first of the two main takeaways from the data is that BMI and the waist-to-hip ratio affect the heart differently. He said this difference is potentially explained by general obesity increasing blood volume and cardiac workload and promoting chamber dilation and visceral fat driving metabolic and inflammatory stress that favors hypertrophy without dilation.

“The second main finding is sex matters,” Kelle said. “Associations are stronger in men — potentially hormonal, metabolic, and fat-distribution differences likely modulate cardiac responses to both general and visceral adiposity.”

The study's results are relevant to both patients and specialists performing cardiac imaging, Erley said.

“Patients should be aware that a high waist-to-hip ratio appears ‘more dangerous' than a high BMI regarding potential effects on the heart,” she said. “Medical specialists should take into account the waist-to-hip ratio and not only BMI when assessing a patient's nutritional status. Imaging specialists should be aware that concentric remodeling patterns in cardiac MRI might be attributed to visceral obesity (we currently primarily think of other diseases like hypertensive heart disease).”

Kelle agreed that measuring the waist-to-hip ratio will be important going forward. Visceral obesity metrics should always be part of cardiovascular risk assessment because visceral adiposity is metabolically active and strongly linked to cardiometabolic risk, he said.

“Relying solely on BMI may miss individuals at risk for concentric cardiac remodeling,” he said. “In addition, cardiac evaluation of obesity should be sex-specific. The recent data underscore that using the same thresholds for both sexes may over- or underestimate cardiac risk.”

Erley and Kelle reported having no relevant financial relationships.

The antibody-drug conjugate sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy) did not improve progression-free survival among patients with endocrine-refractory hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2- advanced breast cancer when given before chemotherapy compared with standard of care, according to the phase 3 ASCENT-07 trial.

Among nearly 700 patients followed for 15 months, median progression-free survival was identical whether patients received sacituzumab or standard chemotherapy as the first treatment after endocrine therapy failure, researchers found.

Overall survival data are immature, but there was an early trend favoring sacituzumab, reported lead investigator Komal Jhaveri, MD, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

“It will be critical that we continue to follow patients for overall survival to better understand the potential long-term impact of sacituzumab govitecan in this setting,” Jhaveri said during a press briefing.

She presented the results on December 10 at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) 2025.

HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancers are typically treated with endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors, but treatment resistance is common, leaving patients with few options. Most move on to chemotherapy, which has shown marginal survival benefit and numerous toxicities.

There remains a “high unmet need” for additional options, Jhaveri said.

Sacituzumab, a TROP2-directed antibody-drug conjugate, has become the standard of care for HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer after prior endocrine therapy and chemotherapy — based on the TROPiCS-02 trial, which showed clinically meaningful benefits for progression-free and overall survival.

Those results led Jhaveri and colleagues to investigate whether sacituzumab could be effective earlier in the treatment course — in patients who had received endocrine therapy but had not yet started chemotherapy.

The ASCENT-07 trial enrolled 690 patients with HR+/HER2- locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic breast cancer whose disease had progressed after endocrine therapy and who were candidates for first chemotherapy.

Patients were randomly allocated (2:1) to receive sacituzumab govitecan or physician's-choice chemotherapy, which included capecitabine, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel.

The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival by blinded independent central review, Jhaveri reported. At a median follow-up of 15.4 months, median progression-free survival was 8.3 months in both treatment groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; P = .130).

Median overall survival had not yet been reached in either group, though an early trend favoring sacituzumab was observed (HR, 0.72; nominal P = .029).

Objective response rates were similar but numerically higher in the sacituzumab group (37% vs 33%), while median duration of response was 12.1 months with sacituzumab and 9.3 months with chemotherapy.

As for safety, treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred more often with sacituzumab (72% vs 48%); the most common was neutropenia — occurring in 56% of patients receiving sacituzumab and 21% receiving chemotherapy.

Despite that, rates of dose reduction were similar between groups, and discontinuations due to adverse events were lower with sacituzumab (3% vs 7%).

Going forward, Jhaveri said her team will explore biomarker correlations to try to identify patient subsets who may derive benefit from earlier TROP-2-targeted therapy.

“Specifically, we will be looking into activity and efficacy by TROP-2 expression levels,” she noted.

Briefing moderator and SABCS program director Kate Lathrop, MD, also highlighted the need for biomarker data.

“There may be more of a biomarker-driven space here to select which patients could do better with an antibody-drug conjugate upfront,” Lathrop said. “So while the study did not meet its primary endpoint, it raises important questions about sequencing of antibody-drug conjugate therapy versus chemotherapy.”

Lathrop, of UT Health San Antonio, also noted that overall toxicity, excluding neutropenia, was “pretty even” between the trial groups, suggesting sacituzumab could still be an attractive option for some patients.

On the other hand, Lathrop said, given that sacituzumab requires multiple trips to the infusion clinic, oral agents such as capecitabine may be preferable to some patients in terms of quality of life.

The study was sponsored by Gilead Sciences. Jhaveri disclosed having relationships with Gilead Sciences, Novartis, Pfizer, and Genentech, among others. Lathrop disclosed having relationships with TeraSera Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Company, and Encore Education.

Microglial activation is a determining factor that allows amyloid-beta accumulation to drive reactive astrogliosis, amplifying inflammatory responses in the brain. This was the conclusion of a study conducted by researchers in Brazil, Canada, and the US.

When microglia are not activated, amyloid stops correlating with elevated plasma levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), indicating that the inflammatory process triggers the cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

The authors further demonstrated that the microglial-astroglial pathway amplifies tau phosphorylation and contributes to the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles. These findings reinforce the notion that neuroinflammation is critical for disease progression.

AD is defined by amyloid-beta and tau deposits; however, there is a growing consensus that these proteinopathies alone do not explain clinical heterogeneity. Individuals with similar amyloid burdens can follow radically different trajectories. Recent studies suggest that microglia and astroglia play key roles in this divergence.

In experimental models, activated microglia release cytokines such as interleukin-1 alpha, TNF, and C1q, which can induce neurotoxic reactive astrogliosis. Reactive astroglia also organize around plaques, follow the topography of amyloid-beta, and amplify tau phosphorylation. However, it remains unclear whether microglia modulate the extent to which amyloids drive astroglial activation in humans. To date, this hypothesis has been supported only by experimental or neuropathological evidence.

To address this question, the researchers evaluated 101 participants aged ≥ 50 years from the Canadian Translational Biomarkers of Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) cohort. All patients underwent plasma analyses of p-tau217 and GFAP, as well as PET imaging of amyloid-beta, translocator protein (TSPO), and tau. The sample included individuals with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia associated with AD.

A second sample of 251 participants from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and TRIAD cohorts were used to validate the findings using soluble TREM2 (sTREM2), a biomarker of microglial activation in the cerebrospinal fluid. All data were analyzed using regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and cognitive status, as well as interaction models, regional analyses, and structural equation modeling.

The investigators also incorporated postmortem transcriptome data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, allowing the evaluation of whether the anatomical distribution of TSPO expression correlates with in vivo amyloid-beta glial interactions.

The central finding was that amyloid-beta was associated with increased GFAP only when microglia were activated. Among individuals with microglial activation, a higher amyloid load was strongly correlated with plasma GFAP levels, whereas in those without activation, this relationship disappeared completely. The interaction between amyloid-beta and TSPO outperformed any model without interaction, and the result was replicated using sTREM2. Amyloid alone is insufficient to induce reactive astrogliosis, and microglial activation determines this outcome.

Brain region analyses showed that the association between amyloid-beta and GFAP in individuals with microglial activation was concentrated in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and cingulate cortices, which are the brain regions most vulnerable to AD. Notably, the areas where amyloid-beta and microglia interacted to increase GFAP levels corresponded to the cortical regions with the highest physiological TSPO expression in the Allen Human Brain Atlas. This topographic correspondence suggests that the basal molecular architecture of the brain helps define the most pronounced amyloid-beta glial interface.

Researchers have also demonstrated that microglial-astroglial signals are directly related to pathological tau. GFAP was associated with p-tau217 and PET detected tau only when microglial activation was present, indicating that neuroinflammation is not merely a late response but an intermediate step in the transition from soluble to aggregated tau. 

Structural modeling showed that the amyloid-beta → GFAP → p-tau217 → tau PET → cognition pathway accounted for 76% of the cognitive variability but only in individuals with activated microglia. In the absence of microglial activation, the chain was incomplete, and amyloid-beta did not exert a meaningful effect on cognition.

These findings clearly reposition neuroinflammation within the AD cascade. 

A 2015 study described close interactions between microglia, astrocytes, and neurons in patients with AD. By placing microglia and astroglia at the center of clinical progression rather than at the margins, this study provides a proof-of-concept in humans.

The inflammatory axis, defined by activated microglia, modulates the timing and location of amyloid deposition, which is biologically relevant for the induction of astrogliosis. These results reinforce the evidence that astrogliosis arises early and may function as a precursor to tauopathy, and that the amyloid-beta → astroglia → tau pathway critically depends on microglial activation.

From a biomarker perspective, this study strengthens the role of plasma GFAP as a practical indicator of amyloid-associated astrogliosis. 

In a cross-sectional analysis of more than 300 individuals across the AD continuum, researchers showed that plasma GFAP increases in both preclinical and symptomatic phases, shows greater alterations than CSF GFAP, and better discriminates amyloid-beta-positive from amyloid-beta-negative individuals, including those in the early stages of the disease.

By demonstrating that the association between amyloid-beta and GFAP depends on microglial activation, the current study helps clarify these findings: Plasma GFAP is not simply a marker of nonspecific damage but also a sensitive indicator of amyloid-linked glial neuroinflammation, with direct implications for trial enrolment and monitoring.

Conceptually, these findings support the expansion of the framework to include an inflammatory glial component, given that the chronology and intensity of neuroinflammation modulate the risk for clinical progression in amyloid-beta-positive individuals. Glial markers included YKL 40, MCP 1, GFAP, and sTREM2.

These results provide empirical evidence that amyloid-beta microglial astroglia interactions explain a meaningful proportion of the cognitive variance, supporting the use of these biomarkers for risk stratification and therapeutic design.

Interventions aimed at reducing the formation of A1 astrocytes or restoring synaptic support have shown neuroprotective benefits in tauopathy models.

In this context, the results suggest that anti-amyloid-beta treatments may be more effective when combined with strategies that modulate the glial response, particularly in individuals showing evidence of hyperreactive microglia and astroglia.

Selecting individuals based on a high-risk glial profile, defined, for example, by elevated plasma GFAP levels together with markers of microglial activation, may increase the likelihood of detecting clinical effects in phase 3 trials.

In summary, the AD cascade resembles a less rigid amyloid-beta → tau → cognitive impairment sequence and a network in which microglia and astroglia function as obligatory amplifiers between amyloid deposition and clinical manifestations.

This scenario has two clinical implications: First, it reinforces the importance of incorporating glial biomarkers into research and, potentially, clinical practice. It also opens up a therapeutic pathway beyond plaque removal, targeting neuron-glial interactions to slow disease progression.

Future trials should evaluate microglial modulators, cytokine-specific blockers, and interventions aimed at reactive astrocytes. Longitudinal studies are essential to define the temporality of microglial-astroglial tau interactions and identify therapeutic windows.

Receipt of the shingles vaccine Zostavax may offer protective benefits against mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in cognitively healthy older adults and significantly slow disease progression in those diagnosed with dementia before vaccination, a new study showed.

After 9 years of follow-up, dementia-related mortality was 30% lower among vaccinated individuals with preexisting dementia than among unvaccinated individuals, which investigators said suggests a link with slower disease progression.

All observed protective events were strongest in women and dementia-related mortality was lowest among those with more advanced disease at the time of vaccination.

The study builds on earlier work that showed a link between the shingles vaccine and lower dementia risk and takes advantage of a unique opportunity to compare vaccinated and unvaccinated groups that differed only by slightly different ages. This fortifies the findings compared to previous observational studies that only found an association, researchers said.

“For the first time, we now have evidence that is much more likely to reflect true cause and effect…that shingles vaccination has benefits for dementia prevention and potentially treatment,” senior investigator Pascal Geldsetzer, MD, PhD, MPH, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Primary Care and Population Health and, by courtesy, in the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health at Stanford University in Stanford, California, told Medscape Medical News.

The study was published online on December 2 in the journal Cell.

Because neuroinflammation plays a central role in both the onset and progression of dementia, neurotropic viruses such as the varicella zoster virus could contribute to or accelerate the underlying disease process, researchers noted.

In a study published in Nature earlier this year and covered by Medscape Medical News, Geldsetzer and colleagues reported that receiving a live attenuated herpes zoster vaccination was associated with a reduction in dementia diagnosis by a relative risk of 20% over a follow-up of 7 years among individuals in Wales. They later confirmed their findings in a similar cohort in Australia.

However, it was unknown if the strength of the vaccine's protective benefits against dementia varied based on disease stage.

To explore that question, researchers again utilized a dataset from Wales, where eligibility for Zostavax vaccination is dependent on an individual's date of birth. The new research included 282,557 residents born between September 1, 1925, and September 1, 1942, who had no dementia diagnosis prior to September 2013 when Wales launched its vaccination program.

Because of limited supplies, health officials limited eligibility in the first year to people aged 79 years. Those aged 78 years or younger had to wait for vaccination, and those aged 80 years or older were ineligible.

Study data came from electronic health record information from about 80% of the country's primary care practices in the Secure Anonymized Information Linkage databank.

To assess any effect on dementia-related deaths associated with vaccination, the researchers also evaluated 14,350 Wales residents diagnosed with dementia before September 2013.

To keep the groups as similar as possible, the researchers compared people right before and after the September 2, 1933, birth date cutoff for eligibility.

“We see in our data that just a 1-week difference across this date-of-birth cutoff means that you go from essentially no one getting vaccinated to about half (46%) of the population getting vaccinated,” Geldsetzer said.

Of the people with no record of cognitive impairment at baseline, 7.3% were diagnosed with MCI during the 9-year follow-up. Nearly half (49.1%) of those with a preexisting dementia diagnosis died from the disease during the study period.

Herpes zoster vaccination was associated with a 3.1-percentage-point reduction in new MCI diagnosis in the overall cohort (95% CI, 1.0-6.2; P = .007) and a 5.1-percentage-point decrease in women (95% CI, 2.6-9.8; P < .001).

Dementia-related mortality was also lower in vaccinated individuals with a prior dementia diagnosis. In the overall cohort, vaccination was associated with a 29.5-percentage-point reduction in mortality (95% CI, 0.6-62.9; P = .046) and a 52.3-percentage-point decrease in women (95% CI, 9.2-97.9; P = .018).

“Although none of our results were statistically significant among men, we cannot exclude the possibility of substantial beneficial effects among men as well, given the width of our confidence intervals,” the investigators noted.

Asked if he was surprised by the magnitude of the protective effects of vaccination in the study, Geldsetzer said, “Yes, the effects we are seeing are large in magnitude, certainly much larger than for existing pharmacological tools for dementia.”

It is “particularly exciting,” Geldsetzer added, “that we see the same protective effect from shingles vaccination for dementia in dataset after dataset — in different populations and different countries that rolled out the vaccine in a similar way as Wales did.”

Given the older age of the study population, it is unclear if the benefits would be found in younger individuals. In addition, data in the study came from electronic health record and death record databases.

Geldsetzer said a clinical trial is needed to confirm the current study findings and the mechanisms behind the vaccine's protective effects.

Zostavax (Merck) was approved by the FDA in 2006 and is no longer available in the US as of 2020. It is unknown if the newer Shingrix nonlive, recombinant zoster vaccine approved in 2017 will confer the same MCI and dementia protections, investigators said.

Commenting for Medscape Medical News, Courtney M. Kloske, PhD, director of scientific engagement, Alzheimer's Association, Chicago, noted that the findings are consistent with previous studies and echoed the call for larger studies.

“More rigorous data is needed to properly inform public health strategy about the potential role or roles of vaccinations in reducing risk of developing dementia as we age,” said Kloske, who was not involved in the study.

Kloske added further research could also confirm the greater protective effects in women and any examine why there is a sex difference.

“There are a number of potential biological and social factors involved in why women have a higher risk than men for Alzheimer's or other diseases that cause dementia. The prevailing view has been that this discrepancy is due to women living longer than men on average,” Kloske said. “However, researchers are now questioning whether Alzheimer's risk could be higher for women at any given age due to biological or genetic variations or differences in life experiences.”

Also commenting for Medscape Medical News, Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, a neurologist practicing in Miami, said, “The stronger protective effect in women is striking, but it aligns with what we know about both immune and brain aging.”

Women tend to mount more robust responses to live-attenuated vaccines, and they experience shingles reactivation more often in older age, noted Lakhan, who was not part of the research.

“Preventing these reactivations may reduce neuroinflammation, which could explain the amplified benefit. One underappreciated point is that women don't just respond differently to vaccines, they also develop dementia differently — the immune system and the brain age differently in women, and this study seems to capture that intersection in real time,” Lakhan added.

If validated, the idea that the shingles vaccine could slow dementia progression is one of the most important aspects of this study, he noted.

“We have very few tools that benefit people after dementia has begun. It is far too early to treat this as a therapy, but it opens the door to inexpensive, scalable interventions and justifies urgent randomized trials,” Lakhan said.

The study was funded by grants to Geldsetzer by The Phil & Penny Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute, Stanford University; the National Institute on Aging; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub San Francisco. Geldsetzer, Kloske, and Lakhan reported having no relevant financial relationships.

In patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), high‑grade atrioventricular blocks occurring during and after the procedure had distinct mechanisms and predictors. Both atrioventricular and infranodal blocks were observed.

“It is clear that electrophysiologists can guide interventional cardiologists to place catheters to record His bundle electrograms with minimal prolongation of the TAVR procedure,” the researchers of this study wrote.

“The data support consideration of a more selective, physiology-guided strategy, which may include shorter observation for transient block, targeted monitoring for newly prolonged conduction intervals, and potential reduction in unnecessary pacemaker implantation,” two experts wrote in an accompanying editor's note.

This study was led by Jonathan W. Waks, MD, of Harvard Medical School in Boston. It was published online on December 10, 2025, in JAMA Cardiology.

This study was conducted at a single center. The number of endpoints was relatively low. Most procedures used balloon-expandable valves; thus, the findings may not apply to self-expanding valves. 

Several authors reported receiving personal fees, grants, and/or consulting fees from several healthcare, medical devices, and pharmaceutical companies including Medtronic, HeartBeam, and Abbott. One author reported being employed by JenaValve during the conduct of this study. 

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Growing old with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a relatively new positive phenomenon, thanks in part to more physiologic insulin formations and increasingly sophisticated glucose management technology. Such advances have dramatically reduced acute and chronic complications that historically shortened life expectancy.

Data published in 2012 showed that life expectancy at diagnosis rose by approximately 15 years for patients with T1D in the US diagnosed from 1950 to 1964 compared with those diagnosed from 1965 to 1980 (53.4 vs 68.8 years). More recent Finnish data from 2023 projected that a 20-year-old diagnosed during the 2020s could expect to live an additional 55-60 years.

A recent publication from Breakthrough T1D highlights how dramatically the demographic has shifted, as just 13.3% of the 1.5 million Americans with T1D are children younger than 20 years, while most are between the ages of 45 and 65, and can expect to live much longer.

With greater longevity, people with T1D are developing age-related physical and cognitive deficits that can compromise their ability to perform the complex self-management tasks the condition requires. Many lack family support or healthcare professionals trained to step in when necessary.

Some older adults with T1D may outlive their spouses, and many never had children, partly because earlier generations of women with T1D were advised against pregnancy. At the same time, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and nursing homes often lack expertise in T1D management. Some privately owned facilities even exclude those with the condition or charge them higher fees.

Even endocrinologists rarely receive formal training in this area, said Irl B. Hirsch, MD, professor of medicine and medical director of the Diabetes Care Center at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle.

“This is a population that didn't exist 30 years ago,” he told Medscape Medical News. “There are no studies assessing blood glucose, blood pressure, or lipid targets, let alone how does cognition change after 60-70 years of T1D.”

Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the leading causes of death in T1D, yet many cardiologists cannot distinguish T1D from type 2 diabetes, Hirsch noted, and may not recognize when sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors could be unsafe.

“In oncology, there's a high number of regimens requiring high-dose steroids [which can dramatically raise blood glucose levels],” he noted. “The entire system will need to think about keeping these patients out of diabetic ketoacidosis.”

Medha Munshi, MD, director of the Geriatric Diabetes Program at the Joslin Diabetes Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, has long been concerned about this gap.

“I don't think people understand how complex it is to manage aging issues with type 1 diabetes,” she told Medscape Medical News.

Recognizing the need, Munshi founded the International Geriatric Diabetes Society (IGDS) in 2019.

“There is an awareness that you treat children differently, but for 20 years I've been trying to tell people that the other end of the spectrum is also different,” she said. “It's about risk and benefit and time to benefit.”

A recently published paper resulting from the 2024 IGDS workshop outlined challenges and opportunities for improving care in older adults with T1D. Priorities included individualized care, leveraging technology, expanding insurance coverage, and developing novel care models incorporating telehealth, home health, interdisciplinary teams, and specialty support within assisted living facilities and long-term care settings.

Munshi has also published guidance on simplifying and realigning insulin therapy for older adults struggling with current regimens and led a randomized study in this population demonstrating that continuous glucose monitoring can reduce hypoglycemia without worsening glycemic control.

“We do not have to give up on glycemic control by changing our approach or realignment,” she said. “But we really need to change strategies when people begin struggling as they get older. It's shared decision-making.”

Munshi was the lead author of the American Diabetes Association's (ADA) 2016 Position Statement on diabetes management in long-term care and skilled nursing facilities and the ADA's 2025 Standards of Care chapter on older adults with diabetes.

In addition, she serves as a member of a small ADA working group on older adults with diabetes, which has recently gained momentum. Chaired by Chalisa A. Nuzhat, MD, the group hosted an invitation-only event during the 2025 ADA Scientific Sessions and aims to expand to a larger event in 2026. They are also working toward establishing an official professional interest group.

“We have recognized a few things that we can do with the help of ADA,” said Nuzhat, director of the endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity clinic at Morris Hospital and Healthcare Center, Morris, Illinois. These include formalizing the group and developing webinars, continuing education courses, and podcasts.

While the group is expected to cover type 2 diabetes as well, Nuzhat anticipates a strong focus on T1D, particularly around technology use and the shift from tight glycemic control to greater comfort, simplicity, and reduced hypoglycemia risk.

Nuzhat and Munshi also hope to promote greater adherence to the current ADA Standards of Care guidelines and to push for continuous glucose monitoring use in long-term care facilities, beginning with advocacy for research funding.

Raising awareness in primary care, where many adults with T1D are seen, is another priority, Nuzhat told Medscape Medical News.

“How do we get this information to them? How do we get them more involved?,” Nuzhat asked.

The ADA's efforts parallel advocacy within the T1D community. In 2024, T1D blogger Joanne Milo, who was diagnosed in 1965 at age 10, founded a group called “T1D to 100” and has launched a website and a Facebook community. The moves came after encountering troubling lapses in T1D awareness during her own hospitalizations, such as staff asking whether she used insulin. Indeed, Munshi and Nuzhat both noted that they frequently must remind hospital staff never to withhold insulin in people with T1D.

“Many with T1D are frightened about who's going to take care of us,” Milo told Medscape Medical News. “As we get older, nobody knows what to do with us, to comprehensively take care of us, and make sure we're safe as we approach the end of life.”

She added, “We need to educate ourselves and advocate for ourselves, and we need to educate the caregivers how to deal with us. We're not as cute as the 10-year-olds and we're far more complicated. We take more time. How do we prepare for our future?”

Milo's website offers resources on preparedness, living arrangements, bodily changes, and advocacy. Another major goal of T1D to 100, supported by Munshi on the ADA advisory panel, is educating healthcare professionals.

“I think the website is amazing,” Munshi said. “The fact that Milo and her team are so able to think it through is great.”

Nuzhat agrees. “It's very useful information. We need to come up with similar information from endocrinologists and geriatricians, and we need to share that information with the medical community. It's not only important to talk about numbers and complications but day-to-day problems and issues that older adults face.”

As of December 1, 2025, the T1D to 100 Facebook group for people living with the condition for over 50 years has 2790 members, of whom 40 are 70+ year ""Masters"" and two are 80+ year ""Platinum Masters."" The first member to reach that milestone passed away in November 2025 at age 83, having lived 81 of those years with T1D.

Hirsch reported receiving personal fees from Roche, Abbott, and Hagar and grants from Dexcom and MannKind. Munshi reported being a consultant for Sanofi, Abbott, and Medtronic and receiving investigator-initiated funding from Dexcom. Nuzhat and Milo reported having no disclosures.

Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) had significantly higher serum levels of suppressor of cytokine signalling 2 (SOCS2) than those without CKD, and elevated levels of this biomarker showed acceptable diagnostic performance for predicting short stature.

""Our findings suggest that circulating SOCS2 is elevated in children with CKD and is independently associated with growth impairment. These results provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying GH [growth hormone] resistance in pediatric CKD and suggest that SOCS2 may serve as a useful biomarker of growth impairment,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Anna Deja, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland. It was published online on November 28, 2025, in Pediatric Nephrology.

The cross-sectional design prevented the establishment of causal relationships between variables. The high prevalence of short stature reflected the centre's patient profile rather than the overall epidemiology. Additionally, the relatively small sample size limited subgroup analyses by CKD stage and aetiology.

This study did not receive any financial support. The authors declared having no competing interests.

For millions suffering from long COVID, their persistent breathlessness, brain fog and fatigue remain a maddening mystery, but a group of leading microbiologists think they may have cracked the case. 

The culprit for some long COVID cases, they suggest, might be other infections that accompany SARS-CoV-2.

A review published in eLife by 17 experts, including those from Rutgers Health, argues that co-infections acquired before or during COVID could cause symptoms to persist indefinitely for many people.

""This is an aspect of long COVID that is not talked about a lot,"" said Maria Laura Gennaro, a microbiologist at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School who chaired the Microbiology Task Force for the National Institutes of Health's Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery initiative, a large-scale study of long COVID.

Long COVID symptoms, which have affected up to 400 million people worldwide, range from mild impairment to severe disability, striking the brain, heart, lungs and digestive system. Yet no proven treatments exist because the underlying causes remain unknown.

The new review synthesizes existing research and expert judgment to make a case that has received little attention: Infections beyond the coronavirus may be critical players.

The most compelling evidence involves Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the pathogen that causes mononucleosis. About 95% of adults carry latent EBV, typically without symptoms until an immune disruption such as COVID awakens the dormant virus.

Researchers of one early study found that two-thirds of people with long COVID showed signs of recent EBV activity, and those with more symptoms had higher antibody levels. Later research linked EBV reactivation to long COVID hallmarks such as fatigue and cognitive problems.

Tuberculosis (TB) is another potential culprit. About one-quarter of the world's population carries latent TB. Evidence suggests COVID can deplete the immune cells that normally keep TB in check, potentially triggering reactivation. The relationship runs both ways: TB infection also may worsen COVID outcomes.

The timing of co-infections matters, the researchers said. Infections before COVID could leave the immune system compromised. Infections during acute illness could compound tissue damage. Infections afterward could exploit post-COVID immune dysfunction.

The authors noted that 44 nations have experienced tenfold increases in at least 13 infectious diseases compared with pre-pandemic levels. One explanation they cite, called ""immunity theft,"" describes heightened vulnerability to other infections following acute COVID.

If co-infections contribute to long COVID, existing drugs might help. Antibiotics and antivirals could potentially be repurposed to target underlying infections. Clinical trials could test whether treating specific co-infections relieves symptoms.

But the authors acknowledge their argument's limits. The associations they discuss are biologically plausible but remain speculative. No one has established a causal link between any co-infection and long COVID.

Everyone has heard it a million times, but it bears repeating: Correlation doesn't equal causation."" 

Maria Laura Gennaro, microbiologist, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School

She said proving the hypothesis would require large epidemiological studies and animal experiments, which is complicated by the absence of good animal models for long COVID.

The researchers hope their work will open new lines of investigation. For the millions living with long COVID, the review offers no immediate answers, but its authors suggest that effective treatment may require looking beyond COVID itself.

A research team led by Erwin F. Wagner from the Medical University of Vienna has discovered a previously unknown molecular mechanism that contributes to the development of psoriasis - and at the same time represents a potential biomarker for a new treatment concept. The study published in Cell Death & Differentiation shows that a specific fatty acid-binding protein (FABP5) drives ferroptosis, a certain form of cell death, and amplifies inflammatory processes in the skin. Blocking this protein significantly improved the skin changes typically associated with psoriasis.

Until now, the chronic inflammatory skin disease psoriasis has been associated with overactivity of the immune system. Now, the scientific team led by Erwin Wagner (Department of Dermatology and Department of Laboratory Medicine, MedUni Vienna) and Kazuhiko Matsuoka (Center for Cancer Research, MedUni Vienna) with first author Kamil Mieczkowski (Department of Laboratory Medicine) has shown for the first time that changes in the fat metabolism of skin cells also contribute significantly to the development and progression of inflammation.

Scientific analyses show that skin samples from psoriasis patients and a corresponding animal model contain significantly elevated levels of the fatty acid-binding protein FABP5, while a certain protective enzyme (GPX4) is detectable at reduced levels. According to the researchers, this imbalance triggers an inflammatory cascade through ferroptosis that is typical of the clinical picture of psoriasis. At the same time, the team found that skin inflammation can be significantly reduced by pharmacological blockade of FABP5 and ferroptosis.

Our results show that psoriasis is caused not only by a misdirected immune response, but also by changes in the fat metabolism of skin cells.""  

Erwin F. Wagner, Medical University of Vienna

""FABP5 could therefore serve as a biomarker in the future for developing new, targeted therapies,"" Kazuhiko Matsuoka adds. This could be of particular benefit to patients who do not respond well to existing immunomodulatory approaches such as biologics.

The researchers also emphasise that FABP5 could be important not only for psoriasis, but also for other inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis. Since psoriasis is often associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, the study results also provide clues to possible common causes of these diseases. Further studies are needed to deepen and confirm the newly gained insights into the relationship between fat metabolism and inflammatory processes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Wheelchair? Hearing aids? Yes. ‘Disabled?' No way.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251211/Wheelchair-Hearing-aids-Yes-e28098Disabled-No-way.aspx","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 11:13:00 GMT","

In her house in Ypsilanti, Michigan, Barbara Meade said, ""there are walkers and wheelchairs and oxygen and cannulas all over the place.""

Barbara, 82, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, so a portable oxygen tank accompanies her everywhere. Spinal stenosis limits her mobility, necessitating the walkers and wheelchairs and considerable help from her husband, Dennis, who serves as her primary caregiver.

""I know I need hearing aids,"" Barbara added. ""My hearing is horrible."" She acquired a pair a few years ago but rarely uses them.

Dennis Meade, 86, is more mobile, despite arthritis pain in one knee, but contends with his own hearing problems. Similarly dissatisfied with the hearing aids he once bought, he said, ""I just got to the point where I say, 'Talk louder.'""

But if you ask either of them a question included on a recent University of Michigan survey — ""Do you identify as having a disability?"" — the Meades answer promptly: No, they don't.

Disability ""means you can't do things,"" Dennis said. ""As long as you can work with it and it's not affecting your life that much, you don't consider yourself disabled.""

Their daughter Michelle Meade, a rehabilitation psychologist and the director of the Center for Disability Health and Wellness at the university, accompanies her parents to medical appointments and tends to roll her eyes at their reluctance to acknowledge needing support.

Working with other researchers on the recent national poll has shown her how often older adults feel that they are not disabled despite ample evidence to the contrary.

The survey looked at nearly 3,000 Americans aged 50 and older and found that only a minority — fewer than 18% of participants over 65 — saw themselves as having a disability.

Yet their responses to the six questions that the Census Bureau's American Community Survey uses to track disability rates told a different story.

The survey asks whether respondents have difficulty seeing or hearing, limitations in walking or climbing stairs, difficulty concentrating or remembering, trouble dressing or bathing, difficulty working, or problems leaving the home.

In the university's survey, about a third of those aged 65 to 74 reported difficulty with one or more of those functions. Among those over 75, the figure was more than 44%.

Moreover, when respondents were asked about several additional health conditions that would require accommodations under the Americans With Disabilities Act, including respiratory problems or speech disorders, the proportion climbed even higher. Half the 65-to-74 group reported disabilities, as did about two-thirds of those over 75.

Yet only a sliver — fewer than 1 in 5 — of older adults had ever received an accommodation from their health care providers to which they are legally entitled under the ADA.

Even among the small minority who identified as disabled, only a quarter had asked for an accommodation (though a third received one, whether they asked or not).

""It's a familiar story,"" said Megan Morris, a rehabilitation researcher at NYU Langone Health and director of the Disability Equity Collaborative. When it comes to the way people describe themselves, ""many people still feel like 'disability' is a dirty word,"" she said.

It's almost an American value to decline to seek help, even when the law requires that it be available, Michelle Meade added. Faced with a disability, she said, ""we're supposed to toughen up and battle through it.""

That may be particularly true among older Americans whose attitudes formed before the landmark ADA became law in 1990, or even before the 50-year-old Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, which guaranteed access to public education.

""It's going to be hard for that older generation,"" Morris said. ""Disability was something that was locked away. Younger folks are more open to seeing disability as being part of a community.""

In the University of Michigan survey, for instance, among people over 65 who had two or more disabilities, about half identified as a person with a disability. In the younger cohort, aged 50 to 64, it was 68%.

Why does that matter? ""It greatly assists in health care settings if you disclose a disability and know to request an accommodation and support,"" said Anjali Forber-Pratt, the research director at the American Association of Health and Disability.

Such accommodations ""can make a stressful situation easier,"" she added. They include mammography and X-ray machines that allow patients to remain seated, scales that wheelchair users can roll onto, examination tables that rise and lower so that patients don't have to step onto a footstool and swivel around.

Health care providers may also offer amplification devices for people with hearing loss, as well as magnifiers and large print materials for the visually impaired. Buildings themselves must be accessible. Practices can send a staff member with a wheelchair to help patients traverse long distances.

Even with a disability parking placard, ""you hike in, you wait for the elevator, you hike to the office,"" said Emmie Poling, 75, a retired teacher in Menlo Park, California.

Because of arthritis and spinal stenosis, ""I can't walk with an upright posture for more than a few minutes"" without pain, she said. ""I basically live on Tylenol."" Yet when she makes an appointment and the scheduler asks if she will need assistance, Poling replies that she won't.

""My personal voice says, 'Come on, you can do it,'"" she said.

Identifying as a person with a disability provides other benefits, advocates say. It can mean avoiding isolation and ""being part of a community of people who are good problem-solvers, who figure things out and work in partnership to do things better,"" Meade said.

Government programs and private organizations like the National Disability Rights Network, the Americans with Disabilities Act National Network, and the National Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities help connect people with services and supports in their communities.

Several studies have found, too, that patients who identify as disabled have less depression and anxiety, higher self-esteem, and a greater sense of ""self-efficacy"" than disabled people who don't.

For years, despite a lifetime of surgeries for congenitally dislocated hips, as well as joint replacements and cancer treatment, Glenna Mills, an artist in Oakland, California, told herself that she was not disabled.

""I suffered a lot by denying that I couldn't walk very far,"" she recalled. Although walking caused pain in her knees, hips, and shoulders, ""I didn't want people to see me as someone who couldn't keep up,"" she added.

But about 10 years ago, ""I stopped worrying about that,"" said Mills, 82. ""I was more willing to say, 'I can't do that activity. I can't walk that far.'"" She bought a scooter that allowed her to take walks with her husband and dog, and to spend time in museums. ""I'm happier now,"" she said.

More often, older Americans resist a label that could help improve their care. Even those who do request accommodations may find that enforcement of the ADA remains spotty, in part because patients don't always report violations.

The Meades, after years of pleading from their children, have made appointments to see an audiologist about new hearing aids.

But Poling intends to struggle on without seeking or accepting assistance. ""I know that point will come,"" she said. ""I'll attempt to surrender as gracefully as possible, given my personality.""

Until then, she said, ""the mental picture that's acceptable to me is not wanting to look like I'm disabled.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","People with epilepsy and learning disabilities face preventable early deaths","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251210/People-with-epilepsy-and-learning-disabilities-face-preventable-early-deaths.aspx","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 02:48:00 GMT","

A combination of missed prevention opportunities and health inequalities can result in the early deaths of people living with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities, a study has shown.

Around 1.2million people in England have some form of intellectual disability, with epilepsy estimated to impact 20-25% of them – up to 300,000 people – compared to just 1% of the general population.

However, until now there has been no national-level population-based evidence on the risks and protective factors specifically contributing to epilepsy-related deaths in people with intellectual disability.

This new research aims to fill that gap, with its analysis of nearly 10,000 deaths between 2016 and 2021 constituting the largest global study examining epilepsy-related mortality in adults with intellectual disabilities and epilepsy.

It found epilepsy was the primary cause of death in just over 16% of those people, and that they died at a significantly younger average age – 56 compared to 62 – than those who had issues other than epilepsy listed as the primary cause of death in their health records.

The study particularly highlights significant disparities in epilepsy-related mortality based on ethnicity, with African and Asian individuals dying younger – at an average age of just 36 – than their White British counterparts.

All of this, the authors say, is despite the fact targeted interventions – including annual health checks, multidisciplinary care access, and specialist psychiatric and speech and language therapy support – do exist but are rarely administered in a uniform manner. The paper showcases these interventions as being effective at increasing a person's length of life.

Writing in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, the study's authors say poor quality of care, service gaps and the lack of annual health checks should be considered unacceptable in modern healthcare.

As such, they have called for a systemic service redesign to try and prevent avoidable epilepsy-related deaths among people with intellectual disabilities in the future.

The study was led by experts in epilepsy, intellectual disability and medical statistics from the University of Plymouth, the University of Exeter and Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, working with colleagues in universities across the UK.

Professor Rohit Shankar MBE, Professor of Neuropsychiatry at the University of Plymouth and Director of its Cornwall Intellectual Disability Equitable Research (CIDER) unit, said: ""Among neurological conditions, epilepsy is the biggest killer apart from stroke. Our study shows that among people who also have an intellectual disability, it poses a greater threat of them dying younger with those from ethnic minorities living in the UK being even more at risk. What is arguably even more shocking is that there are strategies including psychiatric support to speech and language therapy out there to help people. It is wholly unacceptable that these are not routinely and systematically used in a proactive manner everywhere in England, particularly when we're talking about people who are extremely vulnerable and often have difficulties in communicating their needs or concerns. It is a situation that urgently needs addressing.""

Professor William Henley, Professor of Medical Statistics at the University of Exeter Medical School, said: ""We hope our stark and shocking findings will act as a rallying cry to make a difference for families affected by epilepsy and learning disability. Our research paints a bleak picture – we owe it to these families to build on this to make a difference, to offer a brighter future.""

The research was based on data collected through the Learning from Lives and Deaths Review Programme (LeDeR), which focuses on learning from the lives and deaths of people with learning disabilities and autistic people, using reviews to improve local services.

Pauline Heslop, Emeritus Professor of Intellectual Disabilities Studies at the University of Bristol, was the Programme Manager for the LeDeR Programme for England from 2015-2021. She added: ""I am pleased that the LeDeR data is still being used effectively to highlight areas of disparity in deaths of people with intellectual disability, and to indicate where policy and practice needs to be strengthened. It is of significant concern that epilepsy-related deaths are associated with a poorer quality of care and gaps in service provision when compared to non-epilepsy related deaths – issues which need addressing at individual and systemic levels.""

The study's authors have been working for several years with charities and other healthcare organisations who support people affected by epilepsy and learning disabilities.

This has resulted in the development of dedicated programmes such as the Clive Treacey Safety Checklist (co-developed by NHS England Midlands, the University of Plymouth, Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and the charity SUDEP Action) and the SUDEP and Seizure Safety checklist, which is highlighted in the study as a resource that should be used more widely in the future.

The Clive Treacey checklist was named in honour of a man who died aged 47 having been kept in a psychiatric unit without having his health needs fully addressed.

Clive's sister, Elaine Clarke, said of the new findings: ""It's deeply shocking to see that there are so many people with a learning disability who, just like my brother Clive, continue to die avoidable deaths because they do not receive the epilepsy care and treatment that they should. If these terrible statistics belonged to almost any other part of society there would be public outrage – but the harsh reality is that people like my brother Clive, are not valued or prioritised.""

The findings have also been welcomed by UK-based charities, who said the research reinforces their ongoing calls for a complete overhaul of NHS care for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities.

The stark findings of this large study are welcomed as they reflect the experience of families of the significant gaps in basic care and communication over three decades since SUDEP Action was founded. Today there is a stark lottery between the local NHS areas that are working with the charity to adopt the free SUDEP and Seizure Safety Checklist and areas that are still operating in ignorance that epilepsy is a cliff-edge condition that requires advocacy and risk management.""

Jane Hanna OBE, Co-Founder and Director of Policy and Influencing of SUDEP Action

Alison Fuller from Epilepsy Action said: ""This research lays bare the shocking inequalities faced by people with epilepsy and a learning disability. It clearly shows that they are dying far too young and acts as a stark reminder that this group remains among the most at-risk group in our health system. Even more concerning is the finding that people from African and Asian backgrounds face an even greater risk of dying prematurely, exposing deep-rooted and persistent inequalities. These are preventable deaths! With annual health checks, access to the right professionals and truly joined up person centred care plans, lives can be saved, but too often support is either inconsistent or unavailable. The evidence is clear the NHS must act urgently to deliver proactive, coordinated, equitable care, so that everyone with epilepsy and a learning disability has the chance to live a longer, healthier life.""

Kate Chate, Family Member Election Representative Co Chair for Learning Disability England, added: ""It is so encouraging to see research being done into the causes of early and preventable deaths of people with learning disabilities. Knowing 'why' is surely the start of the road to prevention? This paper shows the very stark and alarming difference for people with Black, Afro Caribbean and Asian origins. And it reveals that input from psychiatrists and speech & language therapists is particularly important. As a family member this kind of research that brings data to advocate for better services for people with Learning Disabilities is more than just welcome, it is very gratefully applauded.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Shared genetic roots of 14 psychiatric disorders revealed","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251211/Shared-genetic-roots-of-14-psychiatric-disorders-revealed.aspx","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 12:01:00 GMT","

Researchers from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) report that most genetic influences on mental illness are shared across diagnostic categories, revealing a more interconnected biological landscape than traditional classifications suggest.

The study analyzed genome-wide data for 14 childhood- and adult-onset psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, substance use disorders, ADHD, autism, and Tourette syndrome. Using multiple cutting-edge genomic methods, the researchers examined how genetic variation is distributed across disorders, cell types, and biological pathways.

A central finding is that the majority of inherited risk across the 14 disorders can be attributed to five underlying ""genomic factors."" These represent broad dimensions of shared genetic vulnerability: 

These five factors together accounted for two-thirds of the genetic risk for the individual disorders - evidence that different psychiatric diagnoses often reflect variations on shared inherited pathways rather than completely distinct conditions.

At the genomic level, the researchers identified over 100 regions of the genome where genetic variants influence multiple disorders simultaneously. One region on chromosome 11 stood out as a ""hotspot,"" showing associations with eight of the 14 disorders and containing genes previously linked to addiction and other psychiatric traits.

In total, the study uncovered 428 genetic loci that contribute to cross-disorder risk, including 268 loci tied directly to the five genomic factors.

By integrating the genetic findings with data from developing and adult human brain tissue, the study points to specific biological processes and cell types implicated across disorders:

The findings provide one of the clearest indications yet that psychiatric disorders share substantial genetic foundations that cut across current diagnostic boundaries. They also offer new entry points for developing treatments that target risk pathways common to frequently co-occurring conditions.

Our study - the largest and most comprehensive cross-disorder analysis in psychiatric genetics to date - shows that many psychiatric disorders share a broad genetic foundation, captured by five core genomic factors.""

Oleksandr Frei, a shared first author of the study and researcher, Centre for Precision Psychiatry, University of Oslo

""By integrating multiple analytic approaches, we obtained a clearer understanding of the common and divergent effects of genetic variants across these disorders, refining diagnostic boundaries and providing new insights into the biological processes underlying psychiatric conditions,"" Frei adds.""This study brings us closer to a biologically informed map of mental illness,"" the authors note, ""and highlights pathways that could guide future research, prevention, and therapeutics.""

Cancer isn't just about broken genes-it's about broken architecture. Imagine a city where roads suddenly vanish, cutting off neighborhoods from essential services. That's what happens inside cells when the 3D structure of DNA collapses.

A new study presented Dec. 6 at the 2025 American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting, by Martin Rivas, Ph.D., a cancer researcher at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, revealed that even subtle disruptions in genome architecture can predispose individuals to lymphoma. This finding offers a new perspective on understanding and eventually treating blood cancers.

The study, entitled ""SMC3 and CTCF Haploinsufficiency Drive Lymphoid Malignancy via 3D Genome Dysregulation and Disruption of Tumor Suppressor Enhancer-Promoter Loops,"" introduced a new idea: architectural tumor suppression.

Proteins like SMC3 and CTCF don't just organize DNA-they actively prevent cancer by maintaining loops that connect gene ""switches"" (enhancers) to the genes they control (promoters). Lose even half of these proteins, and the loops start disappearing, silencing critical tumor suppressor genes.

We've long known that mutations drive cancer. But this work shows that architecture-the way DNA folds-can be just as important. It's like losing the blueprint for a building while construction is under way.""

Martin Rivas, Ph.D., cancer researcher, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center

Using AI-driven analytics to interpret massive datasets from Hi-C maps, single-cell RNA sequencing and epigenetic profiles, the team uncovered a striking pattern:

SMC3 or CTCF haploinsufficiency (partial loss) doesn't wreck the entire genome structure. Instead, it erodes short-range enhancer-promoter loops-the wiring that keeps tumor suppressor genes like Tet2, Kmt2d, and Dusp4 active.

Without these loops, B-cells hit a ""decision bottleneck"" and fail to mature into plasma cells, creating fertile ground for malignancy.

AI tools helped integrate these complex layers of data, revealing how architectural changes ripple through gene expression and cell fate.

""This is where computational biology shines,"" Rivas added. ""AI allowed us to see patterns invisible to the human eye-how losing just one copy of a gene reshapes the entire 3D landscape.""

The findings aren't just theoretical. Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have lower SMC3 expression fare worse. This suggests that genome architecture could become a biomarker for prognosis-and maybe a target for therapy. Instead of fixing mutations, future treatments might aim to restore proper looping or mimic its effects.

This research reframes cancer biology: it's not only about the genetic code but also about the scaffolding that holds it together. By understanding architectural tumor suppression, scientists can explore therapies that stabilize genome structure-an entirely new frontier in oncology.

""We're entering an era where cancer treatment could mean repairing architecture, not just fixing broken genes,"" said Rivas. ""That's a paradigm shift.""

In the end, think back to that city analogy: when the streets disappear, neighborhoods become isolated and life grinds to a halt. Inside cells, when DNA loops vanish, tumor suppressor genes lose their lifelines-and cancer finds a way in. Restoring those connections could be the key to keeping the city-and the cell-alive and thriving.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Glucose-lowering drugs may reduce risk of developing epilepsy","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251210/Glucose-lowering-drugs-may-reduce-risk-of-developing-epilepsy.aspx","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 02:36:00 GMT","

A preliminary study of people with diabetes suggests that use of glucose-lowering GLP-1 drugs may be linked to a lower risk of developing epilepsy. The study was published on December 10, 2025, in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, or GLP-1 drugs, have been used for diabetes and weight loss.

The study does not prove that GLP-1 drugs lower the risk of developing epilepsy; it only shows an association.

Additional randomized, controlled trials that follow people over time are needed to confirm these findings, but these results are promising, since people with diabetes are at increased risk for developing epilepsy later in life. Epilepsy can have many physical, psychological and social consequences, and many people do not respond to the current medications, so finding ways to reduce this risk is critical.""

Edy Kornelius, MD, PhD, study author of Chung Shan Medical University in Taichung, Taiwan

For the study, researchers examined a U.S. health database for adults with type 2 diabetes who started taking either a GLP-1 drug or another type of drug called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (known as DPP-4 inhibitors or gliptins). None of the people had a previous diagnosis of epilepsy or seizure. The GLP-1 drugs included in the study were dulaglutide, liraglutide and semaglutide.

The 452,766 participants had an average age of 61. Half took the GLP-1 drugs and half took the DPP-4 inhibitors. They were followed for at least five years. During that time, 1,670 people taking the GLP-1 drugs developed epilepsy, or 2.35%, compared to 1,886 people taking the DPP-4 inhibitors, or 2.41%.

Once researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect the risk of epilepsy, such as age, high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, they found that people taking the GLP-1 drugs were 16% less likely to develop epilepsy than people taking the DPP-4 inhibitors.

When researchers looked at the individual drugs, they found that the association with a lower risk of epilepsy was strongest with the drug semaglutide. 

""More research is needed, but these findings support the theory that GLP-1 drugs may have neurological benefits beyond controlling blood sugar,"" Kornelius said. ""It should be noted that these findings do not imply that DPP-4 inhibitors are harmful in any way or that GLP-1 drugs are definitely beneficial for brain health.""

Kornelius said that tirzepatide, a dual GLP-1 and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) receptor agonist, was not included in the study, as it was introduced after the study period had started. Therefore, the findings may not apply to tirzepatide.

In addition to the limitations of the retrospective, observational design of the study, the study has other limitations. Researchers did not have information on other factors that could affect the risk of epilepsy, such as family history, genetic susceptibility or alcohol use. It's also possible that other factors such as cost, insurance restrictions or how severe the person's diabetes was could affect which drug they were prescribed, which could lead to differences between the two groups.

The study was supported by Chung Shan Medical University Hospital.

Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and Trinity University will improve a prodrug, a compound activated in the body, to mitigate tissue and organ damage associated with heart attacks, strokes and traumatic injuries. These conditions cause a lack of blood flow, but treatment to reverse blockages can also lead to lasting damage.

A project collaboratively funded by SwRI and Trinity will address both the initial lack of blood (ischemia) and the rush of blood that follows treatment (reperfusion) referred to as ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI).

""The moment oxygen comes flooding back into your cells during reperfusion, the surrounding tissue is inundated with reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide. That oxidative stress can cause permanent cellular and tissue damage,"" said Dr. Christina Cooley, associate professor with the Department of Chemistry at Trinity University.

Cooley discovered AA 147, a compound that activates specialized proteins to protect against reactive oxygen species and ensure a healthy protein response.

SwRI will work with Trinity to iterate and synthesize a new borinic acid prodrug to prevent IRI using precursors developed at Trinity. Unlike traditional pharmaceuticals, prodrugs are biologically inert until they are converted inside the body into an active therapeutic compound.

""Protein misfolding during cellular stress is a key driver of tissue damage in IRI, so the new prodrug will target that,"" said Dr. Christopher Dorsey, a senior research scientist at SwRI who will use his pharmaceutical expertise to synthesize the new borinic formulation. ""Once we figure out the synthesis route, we will train Trinity students to carry out our new technique. That's the exciting part of this collaboration, the opportunity to give back and pass along what we learn to a team of future scientists.""

The SwRI and Trinity researchers will work together to improve release mechanisms for the latest prodrug iteration that will maximize its therapeutic effect with the goal of protecting patients at risk for IRI. After the prodrug is synthesized, Cooley will work with Trinity students to conduct stability testing and other lab evaluations to gather the foundational data needed for future live studies and clinical trials.

This project was funded through the inaugural Trinity-SwRI Research Collaboration Grant Program established in 2025 to encourage the advancement of medical and biomedical research through collaboration. Trinity University and SwRI contributed $250,000 toward three unique biomedical research projects this year.

""Trinity University is thrilled to be collaborating with SwRI, and we look forward to exciting results from this collaboration,"" said Dr. David Ribble, dean of the D. R. Semmes School of Science.

We are proud to launch this new focused grant program to grow Trinity and SwRI collaborations, provide opportunities for Trinity students and advance medical breakthroughs that may one day improve and even save lives.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","U.S. Soccer announces Senegal match to finalize pre-World Cup friendly slate","https://www.starsandstripesfc.com/usmnt/41786/u-s-soccer-announces-senegal-match-to-finalize-pre-world-cup-friendly-slate","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 15:38:57 GMT","

The final pre-World Cup friendly is set.

When U.S. Soccer announced the pre-World Cup slate of friendly matches for the United States Men's National Team back on December 2nd, there was one match on May 31st in Charlotte that was without an opponent. Today, U.S. Soccer revealed that Senegal will be the opponent for that match as the two teams meet up in the Continental Clásico at Bank of America Stadium.

First reported two days ago by Steven Goff of Yahoo! Sports, the Senegal match will be the first of two “send-off” matches for the USMNT during the June window that takes place to allow teams to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, which begins on June 11th in Mexico City. It will be the first time the USMNT has ever faced Senegal, ranked 19th in the world and one of Africa's strongest teams. Senegal went unbeaten in World Cup qualifying to win their group and qualify for the 2026 World Cup. They were drawn into Group I during the FIFA World Cup Draw last Friday, where they will face France, Norway and the FIFA Playoff 2 winner (Iraq, Bolivia, or Suriname) in the group stage. The match was in the works prior to the Draw, but it was contingent on the teams not being drawn into Group D together, where the USMNT will be. Once the draw took place, the match was able to be finalized.

“We are so happy to have such a great team in Senegal as our fourth opponent in the matches leading up into the tournament,” head coach Mauricio Pochettino said in a statement. “In the year leading up to the World Cup, we will have played at least one team from five different confederations which is incredibly valuable for our preparations. We are looking forward to an amazing crowd in Charlotte.”

It's just the second time the USMNT has played in Charlotte, the last coming during the 2023 Gold Cup group stage against Trinidad & Tobago. This match will be a huge test for the USMNT as they cast aside the traditional setting up of non-World Cup opponents for their send-off matches. The Senegal match is the final piece of the puzzle as the USMNT have now finalized. They will face Belgium and Portugal during the March window at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. After the Senegal match in Charlotte on May 31st, they will head to Soldier Field in Chicago to face Germany in their final match before they open up World Cup group play against Paraguay on June 12th.

Following four months packed with continental competitions and Women's World Cup qualifiers, the FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking has undergone a major reshuffle since the previous update.

Following four months packed with continental competitions and Women's World Cup qualifiers, the FIFA/Coca-Cola Women's World Ranking has undergone a major reshuffle since the previous update.

World champions Spain (1st, unchanged) retained its UEFA Women's Nations League crown to stay in pole position in the ranking after regaining top spot in August. In the continental showdown, La Roja overcame Germany (3rd, up 2), which made the biggest leap amongst the top 10. Sandwiched between the two European heavyweights are the U.S. women's national team (2nd, unchanged), which defeated Italy in two friendlies in the most recent international break but lost to Portugal back in October.

Further down the top 10, Sweden (now 5th) has tumbled two places following its semifinal defeat to Spain in the UEFA Women's Nations League, while France (7th, down 1) and Canada (10th, down 1) also lost ground. Moving in the other direction, Women's World Cup 2027 hosts Brazil (6th, up 1) and Korea DPR (9th, up 1) have climbed the standings.

Three nations from different continents have risen 16 places each. Nicaragua (now 96th), Burkina Faso (now 118th) and American Samoa (now 137th) all made significant strides, with the latter having claimed two notable scalps by beating the Cook Islands and Tonga to register over 63 ranking points – more than any other country since the previous instalment.

Paraguay (now 46th) has nosedived five spots and are the biggest fallers in the top 50. Further down the ladder, Mali (now 85th) and Egypt (now 101st) have slumped six places apiece, while India (now 67th), Cameroon (now 70th) and the Solomon Islands (now 77th) have dropped four places.

Two African sides, Chad and Libya, have come into the ranking for the first time after locking horns with each other and battling it out against Afghan Women United and Tunisia in the FIFA Unites: Women's Series. Those two latest additions have brought the number of FIFA member association in the women's standings up to a record 198. Finally, Poland (24th), Venezuela (42nd), Cabo Verde (119th) and Saudi Arabia (161st) find themselves sitting at all-time highs.

Clàudia Pina and Vicky Lopez score to keep Spain's UEFA Women's Nations League title in a 3-0 win over Germany. (1:15)

Women's World Cup champion Spain widened their points lead atop the FIFA rankings Thursday over the second-placed United States.

Spain retained their UEFA Nations League title since the last rankings update in August, while the U.S. won four of five friendlies played in that time.

Spain won the Nations League final last week against Germany, which rose two places to No. 3 in the rankings. European champion England stayed at No. 4 and No. 5 Sweden fell two spots.

Brazil and France swapped places at Nos. 6 and 7, respectively. Japan stayed at No. 8, North Korea went up one to No. 9, taking the place of Canada now at No. 10.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

A new rule may keep Trinity Rodman in the league

The Trinity Rodman salary saga has entered a new stage it would seem. According to ESPN the NWSL Board of Governors will vote on new roster tools that will allow the league to pay players like Rodman higher salaries than currently allowed under league rules. The salary cap for the 2026 season will be $3.5 million, however that number has not been sufficient to keep star players from seeking higher pay in Europe. The new rule would allow teams to pay players that meet criteria set by the league a higher salary that would not count the same, if at all, against the current cap.

The ESPN report notes that the board is voting on the measure now ahead of a board meeting that is set for next week. Rodman's case highlighted not only the need for a change in roster funding, but also brought to light that it is urgently needed as teams are preparing to make off season moves ahead of next season.

The league has been expanding rapidly and its growth has brought in an estimated $400 million in expansion fees over the last three years. While owners have put significant resources into the league, it is the players and their talents that have driven the interest and growth in the league. Salaries have been increasing in these years also, but the rapid increase in the league's value is not reflected in the current CBA. This vote will help to improve that as a change allowing for some players to receive a higher salary than currently allowed will give teams the ability to spread additional funds to those who will still be subject to the salary cap rules.

The entire women's soccer audience is keeping an eye on the free agency race for Trinity Rodman. As 2025 comes to a close, a new wrinkle in the negotiation mix comes into play -- a historic vote.

The NWSL's Board of Governors is in advanced talks to approve a new financial mechanism, per ESPN. In a dramatic policy shift crafted to retain the Washington Spirit forward, and other star players, from fleeing to lucrative overseas offers, this would allow teams to pay higher salaries beyond the league's strict salary cap.

The potential new mechanism wouldn't be the first of its kind in American pro soccer, but would be new to NWSL. Unlike MLS' designated player rule, the proposed concept would not allow teams to offer unlimited funds to any player. Each club would have a set amount of money beyond the current cap to spend on star players that meet specific criteria, and funds could be used on multiple players. A vote on the new proposal also includes finalizing the parameters that define a ""star"" player.

Following a 2024 Olympic gold medal win, the U.S. women's national team winger and Washington Spirit forward had become the most prolific face in American women's soccer at the moment, leaving plenty to follow her offseason journey as the biggest free agent on the market. 

As the new year approaches, the 23-year-old has been transparent about her desire to stay stateside and play in the NWSL, but with ongoing salary-cap discussions, back-and-forth discourse between the league and Rodman's representation, and a grievance filed by the NWSL Players Association, the waters of negotiations have become a bit murky. 

While rumors of overseas offers are nearly a month old now, there's still time for anything to happen, including a stateside offer from the USL Super League. As the contract saga continues, we're here to help you keep up with the biggest offseason story of the year, with a look back at key points of Rodman's career, with a helpful timeline of events that have led up to the final month of 2025.

tktkt

To understand just how the contract negotiations arrived to the point of the players union filing a grievance, let's start with Rodman's rookie season and through 2025:

Rodman caps off a historic rookie season in NWSL by winning the 2021 NWSL Championship. After being drafted No. 2 overall in the 2021 NWSL Draft, the next-gen player earns starting minutes for her club side, racking up assists (five) and goals (six) in the regular season, and wins Rookie of the Year honors. 

She also won U.S. Soccer's Young Female Player of the Year and was voted on the 2021 NWSL Best XI First Team. Her historic season leads to a new contract, a record-setting $1.1 million deal paid out over four years. 

The club pivots to new ownership, with new executive leadership, after multiple rotated head coaches between 2022 and 2023,  and finally looks primed to clinch a postseason birth. Rodman thrives under new management across the board with the national team and club. 

USWNT Head Coach Emma Hayes has only 70 days to build toward the Olympics and quickly solidifies her top attacking line for the tournament with Rodman, Sophia Wilson, and Mallory Swanson. They go on an attacking spree, scoring 10 of the USWNT's goals, and are dubbed ""Triple Espresso.""

Rodman and the Washington Spirit finally return to the NWSL Championship for the first time since winning during her rookie season in 2021. 

Though the post-Olympic grind catches up to Rodman as she tries to manage the fatigue and back injury, her minutes are shortened ahead of November, but she plays two 120-minute playoff matches before going a full 90 minutes in the NWSL Championship, where she continues to play through her injury. The Spirit fell to eventual champions Orlando Pride, 1-0, and Rodman prepares to enter the final year of her contract with the NWSL side. 

Rodman begins her contract year, and clubs overseas are already ""monitoring her situation"" ahead of the NWSL season. 

She also begins her long absence from the U.S. women's national team. Her 2025 starts with extensive time off to manage a back injury. The winger has had some back flare-ups since her rookie season with the Spirit, but a long 2024 postseason run to the NWSL Championship final on the tail-end of the Summer Olympics means a lengthy time away for some recovery. 

NWSL teams meet the hard deadline to start preseason training camps by Feb. 5, as per collective bargaining agreement rules, clubs must allow for a five to eight-week preseason before competitive matches. 

The Washington Spirit competition calendar begins a week prior to the regular season due to their participation in the 2025 NWSL Challenge Cup. Rodman was with the club for preseason training, though the expectation was that she would gradually work her way into form. 

Rodman begins her NWSL campaign after time away from U.S national team camps. She missed out on January camps and the SheBelieves Cup but was with the Spirit during their preseason build-up toward the 2025 Challenge Cup. She dressed for the cup match, which the Spirit won on penalties, but did not play.

The winger slowly built up her minutes during the regular season and played 45 minutes to an hour prior to April. Rodman also mentions in an interview that she's not sure her back ""will ever be 100 percent,"" and that it's a matter of ""when she plays in Europe."" Her increase in minutes leads to a call-up to the USWNT roster. 

Rodman made the USWNT game day roster for April friendlies against Brazil after increased minutes for the Washington Spirit. She scored a goal in the 2-0 win against the South Americans, but following the international window, she had an injury setback. 

USA coach Hayes and the Washington Spirit staff confirm that Rodman would go to Europe to work with team doctors on managing her back injury. There was no timetable for her return in order for the player to focus on recovery. 

Rodman made a triumphant return to the pitch and scored in her first club game since April. It's an emotional moment, and the player continued to build up her momentum throughout the month. She increased her minutes load in NWSL regular-season matches toward the end of August.

It had to be her, it had to be @trinity_rodman ‼️ 🎥 @NWSL pic.twitter.com/PbXqmR40l3

Rodman returned to playing full 90-minute games and regained form. She scored three goals and notched two assists, and her performances earned her multiple honors, including spots on Attacking Third's Team of the Week and NWSL Player of the Month for September. 

Elsewhere, Chelsea FC signed U.S. women's national team winger Alyssa Thompson on a transfer from Angel City, and the move fueled more of the ""USWNT players leaving NWSL"" discourse among women's soccer faithful. The WSL club is no longer named in reports as a club interested in Rodman's services at this time. 

Rodman's second-half season surge continues and shows no signs of slowing down. She plays more fully fit matches and continues her goal scoring as the season approaches the final stretch. Her strong form earns her another call-up back into U.S. national team camps for friendlies against Portugal and New Zealand, her first roster since April. 

The Washington Spirit staff and head coach Adrian Gonzalez, to this point, have done a respectable job of rotating a heavily injured Spirit roster, with several players managing respective injuries. The club's more recent success placed them in contention for the 2025 Concacaf W Champions Cup, a tournament that crowns a club champion in the region, and the competition serves as a qualifier for the future FIFA Women's Club World Cup. 

Rodman sustained a knee injury during the match against Monterrey on Oct. 15 and was later diagnosed with a grade 1 MCL sprain and withdrew from the October international window with the USWNT. She was placed on the Washington Spirit injury report for the remainder of the regular season. 

The Spirit staff were hopeful that the MCL sprain diagnosis could be reevaluated for the NWSL Playoffs. Rodman reported for training wearing a leg sleeve and no brace, and participated in light, no-contact training, ahead of the quarterfinal. She was available and dressed for the first playoff round but did not play any minutes in the Spirit's quarterfinal win over Racing Louisville FC.

The Spirit made quick work of the Portland Thorns in the semifinal round, and Rodman marked her 2025 playoff debut at the end of the game. She played only one minute, but in four touches, recorded a dangerous shot on goal. The semifinal win propelled the Spirit back to the NWSL Championship after their runners-up appearance a year ago.

Throughout the NWSL playoffs, Rodman's contract status was a key storyline as each game that passed was viewed with uncertainty on whether these were her final games in an NWSL jersey. NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman was questioned about the league's salary cap amid Rodman's status, in light of a new deal being offered by a rival league in the United States, and Berman responded that the NWSL ""will fight to keep"" Rodman in the league. 

The winger played in the title game on Nov. 22 and subbed on in the 55th minute of the match. It was her most increased minutes load since Oct. 15. The Spirit settled for runners-up in the 2025 NWSL Championship, this time to Gotham FC, 1-0. 

Per the CBA, the league's base salary cap will gradually increase over the years. The base salary cap will go from $3.3 million in 2025 to $3.5 million in 2026, and expand to $5.1 million in 2030, following notable broadcast negotiations after the current deal expires in 2027. The salary cap base number increases by the team revenue share each year and accounts for 10 percent of sponsorship and media revenue for the league. 

The attention around Rodman's contract status remains at an all high, and despite a year of injuries and setbacks, she is the high-profile player on the free agent market. She was transparent with the media throughout NWSL Championship week about making no decisions ahead of the final, and how she tried to block out the contract ""noise.""

The Washington Spirit named former Orlando Pride executive Haley Carter as the new club president of soccer operations, a move by the club that was perceived by analysts and the public as an effort to retain Rodman with the Spirit. Carter's hiring announcement came just hours before new reports emerged that Rodman and the Washington Spirit had reached a deal, but it was vetoed by NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman.

Berman's reasoning for turning down the contract was that ""it went against the spirit of the league rules,"" though no specific rules were violated and not cited in further reporting. The initial new deal was set to be a four-year contract, with payout passing the million-dollar threshold per year, with a portion of the contract backloaded, and would have been the largest contract in NWSL history.

The new deal reportedly contained new-to-the-league mechanisms in paying a player, and a timeline that would crossover into future revenue growth options related to potential broadcast rights deals. League sources have indicated the backloaded offer contains unreasonable assumptions pertaining to the amount of future growth.  

In response, the NWSL Players Association filed a grievance on behalf of Rodman, which was reviewed by CBS Sports, and states that the league penalized Rodman's free agency rights and accused the player of ""salary cap circumvention."" The grievance also points out that the league violated multiple free agency protections previously negotiated in the CBA, including Section 13.6, which states a player's free agency rights ""supersede any other inconsistent NWSL rules, regulations, handbooks, or competition guidelines."" 

Section 8.1 highlights no threshold for maximum player salaries, only a minimum salary standard for players. It also notes the league is unable to reduce player benefits: ""Nothing in this Section shall be construed to give the NWSL the right to limit or reduce benefits in any other part of this Agreement or any Standard Player Agreement.""

The grievance was filed on Dec. 3, and the league has 14 days from the date of the PA's filing to sustain or deny it in writing. If no response is given, a two-person committee with one league and one PA representative would review the contract situation. If no resolution is met, the dispute heads to arbitration. 

The league and its player association navigate uncommon territory as Rodman's contract situation continues to unfold. The NWSL remains adamant that it wants to keep Rodman in the league despite rejecting the initial offer and running out of time to negotiate a deal. 

""Our goal is to ensure that the very best players in the world, including Trinity, continue to call this league home,"" the NWSL said in a statement to CBS Sports. ""We will continue to do everything we can, utilizing every lever available within our rules to keep Trinity Rodman here.""

The NWSLPA, though, claims the Spirit's initial offer is one that actually complies with the CBA as it currently exists.

""Trinity Rodman agreed to a compensation structure in good faith that would allow her to remain loyal to her first professional club, consistent with both the CBA and NWSL Competition Rules,"" the NWSLPA said in a statement to CBS Sports. ""The NWSLPA has challenged the League's rejection of this agreement on the grounds that it violates her free agency rights, but this isn't about Trinity Rodman. If NWSL can deny her free agency rights, they can deny anyone's. The NWSLPA will not allow it.""

As both sides try to navigate at a rapid pace, Rodman's representation is back to work for the player.

""We worked really hard to put together an agreement that we felt complied with the CBA (and) would keep Trinity in the league for the foreseeable future,"" Rodman's agent, Mike Senkowski, said on ""CBS Mornings."" 

""The NWSL doesn't have a certain way at the moment to pay her fair market value.""

The NWSL doesn't “have a certain way at the moment to pay [Trinity Rodman] her fair market value,” the global star's agent, Mike Senkowski, exclusively told @nateburleson.Rodman, who was offered a new four-year deal that her agent says complies with the league's collective… pic.twitter.com/nAnkeQqEAG

No new clubs have been named as suitors in the Rodman free agency market saga, though Senkowski did make it a point to note that he was doing his interview while in Madrid, Spain.

Rodman recently uploaded a holiday video blog that details her time in Spain. She recorded her flight and discussed participation in a marketing shoot. She also includes a clip of her agent off camera and jokingly says, ""Currently my agent is raging about, ya know. You already know.""

December 11, 2025: The NWSL's Board of Governors is in advanced talks to approve a new financial mechanism. The proposal framework would allow each team to have a set amount of money beyond the current salary cap to spend on star players who meet certain criteria, and those funds could be used on multiple players. The proposal still needs to pass with a vote.

While no current European clubs have reportedly thrown out their bids, Rodman's agent also reminded ""CBS Mornings"" that she has offers with more money on the table, and alluded to the offer that D.C. Power made during the NWSL postseason.

As the league takes its time to respond to the filed grievance, it could reopen a window to renegotiations elsewhere. Transfer windows for many European clubs open Jan. 1 and close at the end of the month.

Jeff Carlisle recaps Folarin Balogun's big night for Monaco in the Champions League. (0:38)

The holiday season sees players on the U.S. men's national team in wildly different parts of their respective campaigns. The halfway mark of the European club season has just about arrived. Some competitions -- like the Premier League -- power through the festive period, while others are about to take a short break. Meanwhile, Major League Soccer has gone into hibernation, with Liga MX about to conclude its Apertura campaign.

There is no rest, however, for the players, especially with a certain AC Milan attacker showing not even the flu can slow him down.

Throughout the season, ESPN will be monitoring the progress of the player pool, delivering insights into those whose form or fitness has made them particularly intriguing. We call it the USMNT's countdown to the 2026 World Cup.

ESPN will count down to June 11 every week. When the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise. Only 183 days to go.

The past few months have been a bit stop-start for Pulisic. There was the hamstring injury in October that saw him miss about a month, as well as another muscle injury that forced him to miss the 1-0 win against Lazio on Nov. 29. Then there was his recent illness, which Pulisic said left him feeling ""dead"" just a day before Monday's match with Torino.

Pulisic went on to deliver his own version of the ""Flu Game,"" albeit one without as much at stake as the Michael Jordan-inspired version. And he was immense, entering Tuesday's match in the 66th minute and scoring less than a minute later. He then tallied the game winner 10 minutes later to lead Milan to a 3-2 win and move back atop the Serie A standings, and Pulisic's seven goals in 2025-26 are tied with Inter Milan's Lautaro Martínez for the most in Serie A.

The impulse to protect Pulisic in bubble wrap between now and June is strong, but so long as he maintains his current health and form, USMNT fans will be content with him tearing it up for Milan. And as much as U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino abhors the whole starter/reserve characterization, Pulisic's current level makes him one of the few surefire starters in the USMNT lineup.

For most players, progress is usually of the sawtooth variety: a few ticks up, followed by a step down. So it has gone for Banks. The 19-year-old suffered through a difficult outing in Augsburg's 3-0 defeat to TSG Hoffenheim on Nov. 28, but enjoyed a bounce-back performance the following week in a surprising 2-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen. Through it all, it's fair to say Banks has become a mainstay in the Augsburg lineup, having started the club's past nine league matches.

How does all of this factor into the USMNT picture?

Banks is certainly helping his cause, and while the Bundesliga's winter break is slated to begin on Dec. 21 and last until around Jan. 9, he'll have plenty of opportunities to impress prior to the next international window in March. Banks will have some players to climb over, even with Celtic's Cameron Carter-Vickers sidelined with an Achilles injury, but Pochettino is known to be an admirer, meaning Banks' window of opportunity remains slightly open.

Some good news has finally made its way to Sargent. The Norwich City striker scored on a fantastic diving header against Watford. Although the Canaries ended up losing, 3-2, it was Sargent's first goal since an Aug. 30 brace against Blackburn Rovers. This comes on top of Sargent notching an assist in the previous week's 3-1 win over Queens Park Rangers, breaking a 13-match winless streak.

To be clear, Sargent's dry spell means he remains in the basement when it comes to the USMNT depth chart. The likes of AS Monaco's Folarin Balogun, PSV Eindhoven's Ricardo Pepi, Coventry City's Haji Wright, and Derby County's Patrick Agyemang are all positioned above Sargent at the moment (more on that in a moment). But the Norwich forward needed to start somewhere, and last weekend's goal is as good a place as any.

History was made in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday. After squandering some opportunities, Balogun scored the only goal of the match in his side's 1-0 win over Galatasaray. The tally marked the third consecutive game that Balogun had scored in the Champions League, a first for an American. He now has 10 goals on the season for club and country.

Balogun wasn't the only American to find the net either. Pepi also scored, albeit in a losing effort as PSV fell to Atlético Madrid, 3-2. While the competition for spots on the USMNT remains fierce, Balogun continues to keep his competitors at arm's length, and his work rate and mobility -- in addition to his finishing -- should help him stay there.

When it comes to Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie, you can count his club manager, Luciano Spalletti, among the converted.

""It's a strong person who makes a strong footballer. McKennie has this attitude, this way of meeting you halfway, like he's saying: 'You ask, I'll do,'"" Spalletti said prior to last weekend's match against Napoli. ""He starts and becomes effective; you can tell he faced his fears when he was young because to become brave, you have to face what scares you. He tries plays that wouldn't normally be a part of his repertoire, but he still tries them.""

Spalletti is the fifth permanent manager McKennie has had since he arrived in Turin in 2020, and it seems like the U.S. midfielder has rarely been given the benefit of the doubt. Some of that was down to McKennie's inability to maintain the requisite fitness, but this campaign has seen him conquer those concerns. He remains Juventus' Swiss Army knife, and even popped up for the opening goal in Juve's 2-0 win over Pafos in the Champions League.

The question remains: Where does McKennie fit into the national team? He's logged plenty of minutes at wing back for Juve this season, but that position is relatively well stocked for the U.S., with Sergiño Dest, Tim Weah, Alex Freeman and Max Arfsten all vying for minutes. That leaves either the central midfield role alongside Tyler Adams, or does he occupy one of the more attacking midfielder spots in tandem with Pulisic?

For now, the attacking midfield spot seems a good fit for McKennie. While he is definitely a two-way player, his skill set tilts more on the attacking side of things, and he showed well alongside Malik Tillman in the 1-1 draw against Ecuador last October. But the competition for that spot is stiff. In addition to Tillman, there is Borussia Mönchengladbach's Gio Reyna, América's Alejandro Zendejas and Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna all competing for time.

Much will depend on how aggressive Pochettino wants to be in a particular match going forward. If he wants more creativity on the field, he could slide McKennie back into midfield. If he opts for a more defensive stance, Tanner Tessmann could be the man to partner Adams with McKennie further forward.

There are scenarios where McKennie could be the man to come off the bench. Given his willingness to sacrifice for the team, the possibilities are endless. What's known is that McKennie's performances at club level have him firmly in the World Cup roster mix.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

The U.S. men's national team will face Senegal in a friendly on May 31 in Charlotte, U.S. Soccer announced on Thursday.

The match at Bank of America Stadium had previously been announced, but the opponent was yet to be determined. It will be the first international match between the USMNT and Senegal.

Following the game in Charlotte, the USMNT will have its final World Cup tune-up on June 6 against Germany at Soldier Field in Chicago.

From there, the U.S. will head west and begin preparations for its World Cup opener against Paraguay at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on June 12.

“We are so happy to have such a great team in Senegal as our fourth opponent in the matches leading up into the tournament,” USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino said.

“In the year leading up to the World Cup, we will have played at least one team from five different confederations which is incredibly valuable for our preparations. We are looking forward to an amazing crowd in Charlotte.” 

The USMNT was drawn into Group D at the World Cup, and will also face Australia on June 19 in Seattle and a European playoff winner (Turkey, Slovakia, Romania or Kosovo) back in Los Angeles on June 25.

Senegal qualified for its third straight World Cup after going unbeaten in 10 CAF qualifying matches.

The Lions of Teranga were drawn into Group I, where they will face France, Norway and the winner of FIFA Playoff 2 (Bolivia, Suriname or Iraq).","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

World Cup

2026 World

Cup Draw

The reaction from the U.S. men's national team players in Times Square was caught by some video cameras.

Captain Tim Ream and goalkeepers Matt Turner and Matt Freese all looked at each other when Australia was drawn as the U.S.'s first opponent. Freese whipped his head toward Turner, then nodded. The interaction was one of satisfaction and intrigue.

Australia wasn't just an opponent those players might feel confident to match up against, it was one they had just played in October in Colorado.

The World Cup draw continued in much the same fashion. The U.S. will face another friendly opponent, Paraguay, which the Americans beat in November, in their first group game. Another 2025 friendly opponent, Turkey, could be the final team in their group if it emerges from a European qualifying playoff. Taking it even further, an elimination clash with March 2026 opponent Belgium could beckon in the round of 16 or the round of 32, depending on group finishing position.

U.S. Soccer officials purposely went about crafting the 2025 calendar with an aim to play World Cup-bound opponents from different confederations. They hardly could have believed that two, and maybe all three, of those teams would be in their group.

“It means less work,” Pochettino said only half-jokingly after the draw at the Kennedy Center. “Because we've already done the homework, because it's fresh when we played in Denver against Australia and Paraguay in Philadelphia. But, by the way, (there are) still six months (until the World Cup). We need to update everything. And we know them, but they know us.”

There are, of course, both positives and negatives to familiarity with an opponent.

Like Pochettino said, while the U.S. may now have a better understanding of Australia and Paraguay's strengths and weaknesses, the reverse is also true. It's important, too, not to let a friendly result dictate what you might expect from the same opponent at a World Cup. The bright lights of that stage will hit differently.

“We've played potentially all three of these teams in the last six months, but that can be a little bit of a false sense of security,” Ream said in a press conference after the draw. “We need to make sure that that we're preventing that kind of security and safety feeling from setting in. We have have enough guys with enough experience that know how to keep pushing each other and keep pushing the team in the right direction.”

There is also a good chance the teams will look different in June than they did in October and November, respectively.

“These two games are going to be a good reference for us to start to scout and to see and analyze the two teams, but I think the reality is that the circumstances will change,” Pochettino said. “That is why it's going to be a completely different game and maybe with different rosters or different players, or (different) starting XIs. It's still six months (until World Cup camp). Teams can change systems. We need to be aware about that. That is why it will be a good reference for us, but also for them. … I don't believe that it will be a good advantage or a disadvantage. I think it's only a reference.”

It may also be helpful that some advance scouting work already went into both Australia and Paraguay, because Pochettino pointed out that the U.S. now has six teams to scout rather than three since its final group opponent will come out of a four-team playoff in Europe. The U.S. advance staff will provide reports on all four teams — Turkey, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo — ahead of the March playoff.

“The analysts start to work now because we cannot wait until March and then start to work,” Pochettino said. “No, we need to be ready from now.”

Coincidentally, it's not the first time the U.S. has faced familiar opponents leading into a home World Cup.

The U.S. played Switzerland in January 1994 and Romania in February 1994 before facing both in the group stage at the 1994 World Cup. The hosts had also faced Colombia twice in between 1990 and 1994 World Cups (one game apiece in 1992 and 1993), losing both times to extend a losing streak against Los Cafeteros to six entering '94.

“Knowing a team is always better than not knowing a team,” U.S. 1994 World Cup center back Marcelo Balboa told The Athletic. “The only team we didn't really want to play when we went through the draw was Colombia, because we faced Colombia a bunch of times and it just didn't work out for us. We never beat them. We always felt like they were a much superior team. They just outplayed us every time. We tried and we fought and we scratched, but we could never find a way to beat them.”

The U.S., of course, did beat Colombia in the World Cup. The hosts lost to Romania, 1-0, after also losing to them in that February friendly and drew the Swiss with the same 1-1 scoreline in both the friendly and the World Cup.

The advantage from 1994 was arguably bigger three decades ago than it is now. There was far less video available, and so the U.S. felt like it took a lot away from seeing a team up close.

“You get a sense of how they're going to play their system, which was important for us, since we didn't have video,” Balboa said. “Set pieces, we kind of already had an idea of what both teams were going to do on set pieces. … Playing them kind of gave us a little bit of a knowledge of what we were going to expect.”

This U.S. team will not be lacking in video of the opponents, even down to breakdowns of opponents' tendencies at the club level.

Balboa, like Pochettino, also pointed out that so much changed between the friendly and the World Cup. Both teams played different lineups. And the U.S. felt much more pressure to emerge from the group.

During the lead up to the World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., last week, Brazilian legend Dunga told Balboa the U.S. was one of the toughest match-ups for Brazil in 1994 because they understood the fight the Americans would bring with an entire country behind them. For the 2026 team, it will be more critical to match that fight — and the energy of being a home nation — to do something special in the tournament, rather than leaning on any advance scouting knowledge.

“I think that for ourselves, no matter who we drew in the group, we were going to have that belief that we could make a run and do something special,” U.S. midfielder Tyler Adams said on Friday. “Just having the draw in general, now the excitement grows and it makes it feel more real.

“For this group, the anticipation was obviously a long time coming to play on home soil. We still have six months more to prepare. There's no easy game in the World Cup. … For us moving forward, we need to continue to prepare in the right way.”

...

When U.S. Soccer announced the pre-World Cup slate of friendly matches for the United States Men's National Team back on December 2nd, there was one match on May 31st in Charlotte that was without an opponent. Today, U.S. Soccer revealed that Senegal will be the opponent for that match as the two teams meet up in the Continental Clásico at Bank of America Stadium.

First reported two days ago by Steven Goff of Yahoo! Sports, the Senegal match will be the first of two “send-off” matches for the USMNT during the June window that takes place to allow teams to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, which begins on June 11th in Mexico City. It will be the first time the USMNT has ever faced Senegal, ranked 19th in the world and one of Africa's strongest teams. Senegal went unbeaten in World Cup qualifying to win their group and qualify for the 2026 World Cup. They were drawn into Group I during the FIFA World Cup Draw last Friday, where they will face France, Norway and the FIFA Playoff 2 winner (Iraq, Bolivia, or Suriname) in the group stage. The match was in the works prior to the Draw, but it was contingent on the teams not being drawn into Group D together, where the USMNT will be. Once the draw took place, the match was able to be finalized.

“We are so happy to have such a great team in Senegal as our fourth opponent in the matches leading up into the tournament,” head coach Mauricio Pochettino said in a statement. “In the year leading up to the World Cup, we will have played at least one team from five different confederations which is incredibly valuable for our preparations. We are looking forward to an amazing crowd in Charlotte.”

It's just the second time the USMNT has played in Charlotte, the last coming during the 2023 Gold Cup group stage against Trinidad & Tobago. This match will be a huge test for the USMNT as they cast aside the traditional setting up of non-World Cup opponents for their send-off matches. The Senegal match is the final piece of the puzzle as the USMNT have now finalized. They will face Belgium and Portugal during the March window at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. After the Senegal match in Charlotte on May 31st, they will head to Soldier Field in Chicago to face Germany in their final match before they open up World Cup group play against Paraguay on June 12th.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Haaland shrugs his shoulders with a smile as Rudiger looks on Aitor Alcalde/Getty Images

Hello! It's 55 goals from 54 games for Erling Haaland in the Champions League. He was loving life at the Bernabeu. Real Madrid? Not so much.

🆚 Wrexham set for Man Utd clash

All you can say about the Bernabeu last night is that you've seen the stadium more ready to blow. Indeed, it was angrier by some distance on Sunday when Real Madrid lost the plot against Celta Vigo, a club they are accustomed to trouncing at home.

Tension hung in the air yesterday as Manchester City picked Madrid off — cat-calls in the second half while they tried in vain to break the visitors' lines — but it fell short of all-out mutiny, and the message from on high is that Xabi Alonso will limp on as head coach. A 2-1 defeat in the Champions League won't be the end of him. He'll take Madrid to Alaves this weekend, for a game they simply have to win.

That reprieve notwithstanding, the gods in Alonso's world are conspiring against him somewhat. He took on City without Kylian Mbappe — named on the bench but patently not fit — and named a back four he would never choose if every defender was available (which, to put it mildly, they aren't). It's sod's law that in trying circumstances, players then start shooting themselves in the foot.

Madrid started well, counter-attacking with intent (and demonstrating why Alonso's insistence on moving away from playing that style of game seems so contrary to the strengths of the squad at his disposal). Rodrygo scored for the first time in 33 appearances — an omen if ever there was one, surely — and the initiative was theirs.

But Madrid's skin is thin and by half-time, Thibaut Courtois had fumbled a tap-in to Nico O'Reilly, and Antonio Rudiger's ill-advised foul on Erling Haaland (above) invited the Norwegian to tuck away a penalty. And that was the game, in spite of Alonso's efforts, and a cool-as-ice Haaland enjoyed his evening. Too many visitors are enjoying their nights at the Bernabeu these days. Therein lies the problem.

Irrespective of the heat on Alonso, Madrid are well placed to go through the Champions League's initial round as a top-eight side, thereby avoiding the February play-offs to decide the other half of the last 16. City and Pep Guardiola should be in business too. Arsenal, meanwhile, continue to fly, with six wins from six. Noni Madueke's first goal in a 3-0 defeat of Club Brugge was a certified banger (above).

The league stage is so long that it ebbs and flows but we've hit the point where teams in peril need to mobilise. Napoli, for instance, are in danger of bombing out completely after losing to Jose Mourinho's Benfica. Their two remaining fixtures — away at Copenhagen and at home to Chelsea — aren't dead certs. Chelsea, Liverpool, Barcelona and Juventus are on for those play-offs unless they get their act together.

North America came through for Juventus yesterday, during a precious 2-0 victory over Pafos. Weston McKennie got the opener and Jonathan David the second, at the end of a slick break.

It already feels like quite a while since we were talking about David forgetting where the net was.

Those of you in the United States will recognise the name of Andrew Giuliani. He's the son of former New York mayor, Rudy. He's also the executive director of the 2026 World Cup task force, set up by President Donald Trump to oversee next year's finals.

In his task-force capacity, Giuliani ought to be a man with his finger on the pulse and earlier this week, Adam Crafton got the opportunity to quiz him about the World Cup for The Athletic. The interview covered a broad range of topics: visas, FIFA's peace prize, last Friday's group-stage draw (which, in moments, did rather resemble a Republican rally), travel bans and immigration issues.

Advertisement

You'll find the entire Q&A here, and the full monty beats a brief summary, but here are a few snippets of what Giuliani had to say. I won't pretend he's politically neutral:

🗣️ On travel and immigration restrictions: “We obviously want the world to be able to come here, but they need to come here the right way. We need to make sure we know who's coming in and who came in. Otherwise, how could we protect this World Cup to the degree that we need to?”

🗣️ On the World Cup draw: “It was a FIFA show. While there was a dialogue about this or that, or this is what the president's involvement could be, I know, for the most part, this was FIFA that put the show on.”

🗣️ On the peace prize, which went to Trump: “That certainly wasn't something we suggested. I believe it was just a matter of FIFA looking and realising that ‘Wow, this president really is doing everything he possibly can to make peace deals in places where other presidents have never even thought possible or maybe had tried and failed'.”

🗣️ On whether the World Cup might become ‘too MAGA-y': “First and foremost, I think peace should transcend politics. It should transcend red or blue. In terms of MAGA-ing up the World Cup, I don't think that's the case.”

Bayern Munich have a large and growing U.S. fanbase. It stands to reason. They're a European monolith, they're highly successful and clubs of their ilk have been tapping into American hearts and minds for years.

Other German sides such as Borussia Dortmund resonate beyond their own borders too but I didn't expect the States to have a particular soft spot for FC Kaiserslautern. The team have had their moments — four Bundesliga titles, the most recent in 1998 — but today, they're toiling away in the 2.Bundesliga, the country's second division.

The reason for their appeal is that after the Second World War, thousands of U.S. troops were stationed in the vicinity of Kaiserslautern. Americans lived there and American children grew up there. The father of the aforementioned McKennie was based at Ramstein, just a 20-minute drive away. It's where McKennie learned to play football.

Koo, in short, pulled out when he realised the snap hadn't been properly placed. No such excuses for Burton Albion's Julian Larsson, however, after he fluffed a corner during an FA Cup tie at Brackley Town on Tuesday, just about breaking a foot in the process. I felt that from here.

Supporters following their team at the 2026 World Cup will find that ticket prices have rocketed

Supporters hoping to attend next year's World Cup final face paying vast prices, with tickets in the 'supporter value tier' starting at £3,119 ($4,185).

Fans' group Football Supporters Europe has said it is ""astonished"" by Fifa's ""extortionate"" pricing strategy. 

The high prices for group games and the final have been leaking out on Thursday as Fifa informs national associations of their allocations. 

It means the price of the cheapest ticket for Fifa's showpiece event has increased almost sevenfold compared with the 2022 World Cup. The lowest-priced tickets on open sale in Qatar were £450.

BBC Sport understands tickets for the 'supporters standard tier' are £4,162 ($5,560), compared with £747 in 2022.

'Supporters premium tier' is £6,615 ($8,860), with the same band £1,197 at the Lusail Stadium three years ago.

FSE has demanded that ticket sales should be halted immediately, adding that tickets not being available in the cheapest category is ""a monumental betrayal of the tradition of the World Cup, ignoring the contribution of supporters to the spectacle it is"".

The third ticket ballot begins on Thursday afternoon. On Monday, members of national supporters' clubs will get the chance to enter a random draw for individual games, or to follow their team through to the final.

There are about 4,000 tickets for each game available through the official supporters' groups. All other tickets are allocated through the random ballot process, other than those held back by Fifa for corporate partners.

Capacities at the venues range from 94,000 at the Dallas Stadium, where England play Croatia, to 45,000 at the Toronto Stadium.

In a departure from recent tournaments, group stage games are being priced based on their attractiveness, rather than at a flat rate. 

In Qatar, group stage fixtures had set prices of £68.50, £164.50 and £219.

Yet for England's match against Croatia on 17 June, tickets cost £198, £373 or £523. 

England v Ghana is £164, £320 and £447, with England v Panama £164, £346 and £462.

All World Cup matches to have hydration breaks

England fan Luke Buxton told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It is absolutely outrageous. It's a big betrayal to the most dedicated fans of every nation that's following their side at the World Cup next summer.

""We were planning on going to the group stages initially, then coming home, then flying out for the knockouts. Ideally the round of 16 but it may be too expensive. So the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final. 

""However, with these ticket prices coming today, I am not sure I am going to make the knockout stages at all now.""

Scotland's first two group games are cheaper than England's. Against Haiti the prices will be £134, £298 or £372, with Morocco set as £163, £320 and £447. The final group game is priced the same as England v Croatia.

Scotland fan John Wallan told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I am going, that is definite. But I have two children as well. They are 19 and 12, so everything has been ramped up. 

""I think for a family it will be £15,000-£20,000. I would love to take the kids because it may not happen for another 30 years. We've not booked anything yet. We are still deciding if it is one, three or four of us that go.""

Quarter-finals are priced at £507, £757 and £1,073, with the semi-finals £686, £1,819 and £2,363.

There are no category four tickets available to fans, though this was also the case in 2022 when they were reserved exclusively for residents of Qatar.

Each household can request up to four tickets per match and a maximum of 40 across the tournament

FSE has called on Fifa to stop the ticket sale process, believing it needs to rethink the pricing policy. 

It said Fifa should ""immediately halt PMA [Participating Member Association allocation] ticket sales, engage in a consultation with all impacted parties, and review ticket prices and category distribution until a solution that respects the tradition, universality, and cultural significance of the World Cup is found"".

It continued: ""In the price tables gradually and confidentially released by Fifa, tickets allocated to National Associations, which typically distribute them via official supporters' groups or loyalty programmes to their most devoted fans, are reaching astronomical levels. 

""National team supporters are expected to pay this full amount in early 2026 to have the opportunity to follow their team up to the final.

""Adding insult to injury, the lowest price category will not be available to the most dedicated supporters through their National Associations, as Fifa chose to reserve the scarce number of category four tickets to the general sales, subject to dynamic ticket pricing.

""For the first time in World Cup history, no consistent price will be offered across all group stage games. Instead, Fifa is introducing a variable pricing policy dependent on vague criteria such as the perceived attractiveness of the fixture. Fans of different national teams will therefore have to pay different prices for the same category at the same stage of the tournament, without any transparency on the pricing structure enforced by Fifa.

""The bid document released in 2018 promised tickets priced as low as $21. Where are these tickets now? The full way to the final, according to the same bid book, was supposed to cost $2,242 in the cheapest category. This promise is long gone.""



All tickets issued to football associations will be behind one of the goals primarily in the lower bowl, with the most expensive closest to the pitch, the second category in the middle, and the cheapest behind this. 

But the cost of attending every game in the United States, Mexico and Canada has been laid bare.

For the entire tournament through to the final, it will cost about £5,225 to go to all eight matches, up to £8,580 in the mid-price range, or £12,357 for the top tier.

In 2022, it would have cost £1,466, £2,645 or £3,914, though that was for seven games rather than eight.

It is not yet clear if fans who are successful in their application for 'follow your team' tickets will have the whole amount taken off their credit cards in January.

If their team is knocked out, a refund for the unattended matches is issued to the card.

There will not be any dynamic pricing in this sale, but prices are likely to be considerably higher if fans try to buy off Fifa's resale site following this phase.

            Long before the World Cup draw was even made, local organizers in Seattle had earmarked a FIFA World Cup match in the city as a chance to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community.
    


            But now, the two teams involved in the game – Iran and Egypt – have objected to any such celebrations taking place around the stadium.
    


            It's fast becoming yet another flashpoint ahead of next year's already controversial World Cup and one which is likely to test FIFA's credentials again.
    


            Here is everything we know so far.
    


            Seattle is one of the 16 host cities for next year's World Cup.
    


            Earlier this year, local organizers had decided that the match at Lumen Field on June 26 was to be included in Pride celebrations, due to it falling at the start of Seattle's Pride Weekend.
    


            The concept was to host activities, such as an art competition, which celebrate “creativity, inclusion, and the vibrant spirit of Seattle's LGBTQ+ community.”
    


            There are no particular plans for any Pride activities inside the stadium, which would fall under FIFA's control, but Seattle World Cup 26 (SeattleFWC26) says the plans are for outside the arena and throughout the city.
    


            After the World Cup draw last Friday and the match schedule being revealed on Saturday, FIFA decided Egypt vs. Iran would play that game in Seattle.
    


            Meanwhile, group rivals Belgium and New Zealand will play at the same time in Vancouver.
    


            Homosexuality is still illegal in Iran and punishable by the death penalty.
    


            While homosexuality isn't outlawed in Egypt, members of the LGBTQ+ community can be prosecuted for violating public decency laws.
    


            As such, the football federations representing both Egypt and Iran have publicly objected to any Pride celebrations around the match.
    


            The Egyptian FA released a lengthy statement on its website earlier this week, confirming they had officially complained in a letter sent to FIFA.
    


            It says the planned celebrations “directly contradict the cultural, religious and social values in the region, especially in Arab and Islamic societies.”
    


            It added: “While FIFA is committed to ensuring a respectful and welcoming environment for all fans, and in order to maintain the spirit of unity and peace, it is necessary to avoid including activities that could provoke cultural and religious sensitivities between fans present from both countries, Egypt and Iran, especially since such activities are culturally and religiously incompatible with the two countries.”
    


            Meanwhile, the president of Iran's Football Federation, Mehdi Taj, criticized the decision to hold the game in Seattle on that weekend.
    


            “Both Egypt and we have objected, because this is an unreasonable and illogical move that essentially signals support for a particular group, and we must definitely address this point,” Taj said, per AP.
    


            Taj added that Iran would bring up the issue during a FIFA Council meeting next week.
    


            In a statement sent to CNN on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Seattle's organizing committee said the planned activities will still be going ahead, adding that it was SeattleFWC26's role to “prepare our city to host the matches and manage the city experience outside of Seattle Stadium.”
    


            “Football has a unique power to unite people across borders, cultures, and beliefs,” Hana Tadesse, vice president of communications for SeattleFWC26, said.
    


            “The Pacific Northwest is home to one of the nation's largest Iranian-American communities, a thriving Egyptian diaspora, and rich communities representing all nations we're hosting in Seattle.
    


            “We're committed to ensuring all residents and visitors experience the warmth, respect, and dignity that defines our region.”
    


            Meanwhile, local groups have said they are working with the organzing committee to ensure everyone stays safe during Seattle's Pride weekend
    


            “It could be a good spotlight on how welcoming Seattle is to all people, but there are concerns within the community about safety during the World Cup,” Seattle PrideFest, an organizer of the event, said in a statement on Facebook.
    


            “Just know that LGBTQIA+ orgs (including PrideFest) are working together and with the local organizing committee to try to address those concerns in advance of the tournament.”
    


            CNN Sports has reached out to FIFA for comment about the celebratory plans and scheduling concerns but has not yet received a response.
    


            This, though, is another situation which will test the governing body's ability to handle such topics.
    


            During the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, FIFA made a point of urging visiting fans to respect the values of the host nation, with some supporters even having rainbow flags and hats taken off them by local security before entering the stadium.
    


            At that tournament, FIFA also said it would “impose sporting sanctions” against captains who wore the “OneLove” armbands – part of a campaign to promote inclusion and oppose discrimination.
    


            Qatar is also set to play in Seattle two days before Egypt and Iran's fixture, against one of Italy, Northern Ireland, Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina.
    


            Notably, Seattle was also one of the cities that US President Donald Trump threatened to take World Cup hosting duties away from. Trump, though, has not weighed in on the issue as of yet.

Soccer fans eager to catch the FIFA World Cup opening matches next year will be hit with sky-high costs, as hotels in the 16 host cities across the United States, Canada, and Mexico hike rates by more than 300% — with one city topping $3,000 a night, a new report found.

Room rates at 96 Marriott and Hilton hotels skyrocketed after FIFA unveiled the 104-match schedule Saturday, with the average per-night rate around an opening game hitting a whopping $1,013 – up from $293 just 21 days earlier, according to an analysis by The Athletic.

The most eye-popping increase came in Mexico City for the June 11 opener between Mexico and South Africa. Rooms at the Marriott resort Le Meridien Mexico City Reforma, located near Azteca Stadium, surged 2,372%, reaching a staggering $3,882 per night, the report showed.

Just weeks prior, in May, the same hotel's nightly rate will be about $157.

Six Mexico City hotels are averaging $1,572 per night for the opening match – up a jaw-dropping 961% from rates listed three weeks earlier, according to the analysis.

Among 78 games across US cities, hotel rates surged most in Houston (457%), followed by Kansas City (364%), Atlanta (344%), and the San Francisco Bay Area (342%) compared to respective rates in late May.

The average nightly rate across six hotels in New York City and New Jersey climbed 228% for a two-night stay around Brazil's June 13 match against Morocco at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, according to the report.

At the Fairfield Inn East Rutherford Meadowlands, just 1.5 miles from the stadium, costs between June 12 and 14 soared to $1,552 – up sharply from $289 three weeks earlier, the data showed.

The same Garden State Marriott hotel will jump to a whopping $3,066 per night around the July 19 World Cup final at MetLife Stadium, with nearby Hampton Inn Carlstadt charging $3,518 and the Moxy Times Square in Midtown climbing over $1,000 per night.

In Canada, Toronto saw the smallest spike among World Cup host cities, with average hotel rates for the June 12 opening match – featuring the victor of a European playoff between Italy, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Bosnia and Herzegovina – rising 78%, according to the analysis.

The average tab of a two-night stay hit $487, slightly up from $267 three weeks prior.

In Vancouver, a Hampton Inn & Suites is charging $1,759 for the June 13 matchup between Australia and the winner of the European playoff between Romania, Turkey, Slovakia, and Kosovo, the report said.

Marriott and Hilton did not respond to the outlet's questions about how they determine their rates.

The World Cup — the most-watched sporting event in the world — will be hosted in Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey, Toronto, and Vancouver.

UK tourists would be among those affected by US policy

‘Unacceptable' and ‘chilling', says European fan group

A plan to require supporters travelling to the United States for the World Cup to disclose information about their social media accounts has been described as “profoundly unacceptable”.

Tourists from 42 countries, including the UK, which use the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (Esta) as part of the visa waiver programme would be obliged to provide information about accounts they have held in the last five years in their applications. Previously it had been optional to provide the information.

Ronan Evain, the executive director of Football Supporters Europe, said: “The US government's announced plans are profoundly unacceptable. Freedom of expression and the right to privacy are universal human rights. No football fan surrenders those rights just because they cross a border.

“This policy introduces a chilling atmosphere of surveillance that directly contradicts the welcoming, open spirit the World Cup is meant to embody and it must be withdrawn immediately.”

The proposal follows an executive order from Donald Trump in January which seeks “to ensure that all aliens seeking admission to the United States, or who are already in the United States, are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible”.

A spokesperson for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said: “Nothing has changed on this front for those coming to the United States. This is not a final rule, it is simply the first step in starting a discussion to have new policy options to keep the American people safe. The department is constantly looking at how we vet those coming into the country, especially after the terrorist attack in Washington DC against our National Guard right before Thanksgiving.

“This new proposal is in line with the January 2025 Executive Order 14161 to vet those who are coming into this country using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (Esta) by allowing CBP to collect additional information from non-US citizens applying through the visa waiver programme from eligible countries.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

In May, President Trump named Andrew Giuliani, son of former New York City Mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, as executive director of the White House Task Force for the FIFA men's World Cup 2026.

The task force — chaired by President Trump and vice-chaired by U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance — oversees preparations for the event. Seventy-five per cent of the 104 games will be played in the United States, with the remainder shared between Mexico and Canada. And Giuliani Jr. runs it day to day.

During Trump's first term in office, he was a special assistant to the president and associate director of the Office of Public Liaison. He also ran for governor of New York in 2022 but finished second in the state's Republican primary.

Next year's World Cup will be the biggest ever, spread across multiple time zones and will require major coordination between city, state and federal law enforcement.

Host cities received a boost earlier this year when Congress and the White House signed off $625million of federal security funding, but collaboration is required. Giuliani now holds weekly calls with the U.S. host cities and he compares himself to a basketball point guard directing the play and ensuring that the cities have a swift port of call with the administration.

There have been questions about how the president's domestic agenda — most notably on immigration and travel bans — may impact the tournament, while he has threatened to relocate games from cities if he does not deem them adequately safe.

The president does appear engaged: no head of state has been in the Oval Office for a public briefing with Trump more often than FIFA president Gianni Infantino this year.

Added to all this, at last week's World Cup draw, FIFA awarded Trump its inaugural Peace Prize, while also inviting the Village People to perform Y.M.C.A, a song which has become an anthem of Trump at his rallies and events.

Following the draw in Washington D.C., Giuliani granted an interview to The Athletic, and no questions were off limits.

The Athletic: Can you reflect on the World Cup draw and the impact it's going to have up to the World Cup? 

Giuliani: The World Cup becomes tangible at this point. We now know the matchups. That gives us the opportunity to assess where some of the most in-demand teams are going to be playing. Then we'll start finding out over the coming weeks where they'll base themselves. Then we can plan to make sure the states and locals are all prepared to host these teams, not only from a security standpoint, but also from an economic opportunity standpoint.

Advertisement

We want to make sure areas which might be hosting teams at a base camp… this (event) may not have been on their small business administration's radar or on their chamber's radar. We want to make sure they're prepared to receive a Brazil, Argentina, France or England, one of the countries that we know will travel en masse.


It would be great to involve as many states as possible in this incredible World Cup. A lot of people will come, let's say, for an average of 10 to 12 days and will go to two to three games. That means you're looking at eight to 10 days where they might not have a World Cup game day. There's a great opportunity to put on their radar some of the great things they could see, not just in the host cities, but in other areas, especially in light of our 250th birthday, when you'll have “America 250” events.

The Athletic: There have been repeated suggestions that games could be relocated due to ‘safety' concerns. Fans are now already booking flights and hotels, having saved up for a long time. Are you able to guarantee that things aren't going to change? 

Giuliani: The president has continued to focus on not just the 11 American cities hosting World Cup games, but all of our American cities to make sure he's doing everything possible to make it safe and secure. He wants to make sure that they have a safe experience when they come here and he's going to continue (pressing) these cities that maybe are not doing the best job at making it safe and secure to do everything they can, to use all the resources in their power.

The president never takes anything off the table. He wants to make sure he can utilize all the leverage possible. That way, he can provide a safe experience for international travelers, but also, whether or not Americans voted for him or not, he wants to make sure he's doing everything he possibly can to make sure cities and states are the safest place for them to live in.

The Athletic: Why do you think the president sees the World Cup as such a huge opportunity for the U.S? Also, would you expect the president to be as visible as we saw him during the World Cup draw and also during the FIFA Club World Cup final in July?


Giuliani: Two answers. One is a personal side of this, which is, as men, we're always either trying to make our parents or our kids proud of us. Obviously, the fact that his son (Barron) is such a big soccer fan and the president is such a good dad — look at how all of his kids have turned out. He's got this soccer connection because it's a point of bonding for him and his son. It's a beautiful thing. Probably, it's a situation where the son has taught the father a little bit about the size and scope of soccer.

This is why he pushed the bid and made a unified bid with Canada-Mexico in 2018 (during his first term). He understands the size of the World Cup and how there's no event in the world like it.

As Americans, we look at the Super Bowl, which has almost become a quasi-holiday for us. We see that about 130 million people watched the last Super Bowl, which we think is a lot of people. Then look at the last World Cup final, I believe over 1.5 billion people watched it. It gives you an idea of the scope. It's an incredible opportunity to show off America over our first 250 years; truly American exceptionalism and the hope and promise of our next 250 years to the platform that really is the world.

The Athletic: Fans reported to FIFA during the Club World Cup that there was this perception ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) might be watching them at games… We also know travel to the U.S. this year has dropped a little and there seems to be anxiety from some people about what questions they may get asked when they enter the U.S. Can you give reassurance this is going to be a smooth and seamless travel experience?

(The Athletic has reported FIFA received 145 reports of human rights concerns at the Club World Cup and the highest number related to fans concerned about government policies or enforcement. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson insisted neither ICE nor Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, conducted enforcement, describing it as “another case of fear-mongering.”)

Giuliani: At least from a data perspective, let me just highlight that in the first six months of 2025, we set records in terms of the amount of dollars that international travelers spent here in the United States. That number is $126.9 billion. That's a six-month record, so I would point out and highlight the fact that President Trump's immigration policies have not excluded the rest of the world. What he's tried to do very overtly… is make sure he cuts off illegal immigration, which he's done very, very successfully while also making sure he can open the front door and welcome the world.

If you want to get your visa appointment, you can get it in less than 60 days. Then President Trump on top of that created the FIFA Pass, which is a prioritized appointment scheduling system, which will allow ticket holders the opportunity to get towards the front of the queue for their visa interview.

President Trump, yes, he's enforcing immigration policies from an illegal immigration standpoint. But if you come through the right process, he wants as many people to come here as possible, enjoy the United States of America for the World Cup and enjoy America 250.

The Athletic: There are a couple of countries (Iran and Haiti) who have qualified and whose nationals have travel bans, which limits the potential for their fans to travel for the tournament. Are you able to lobby for this tournament to be taken into account when the administration is deciding upon all-encompassing travel bans, or is the view that ultimately security, immigration operations and enforcement will always come first?

Giuliani: It's both. The overwhelming majority of countries that have qualified, they'll be able to travel here. A lot just need a ESTA (visa waiver) to be able to come here. First and foremost, safety and security is the No. 1 thing when it comes to this World Cup. Every visa decision is a national security decision. That's key to highlight.

The president, even in his restricted countries order, still gave an exemption to players, direct support staff and to immediate family for those countries on the list. So specifically, Iran and Haiti right now would still be able to compete while understanding that we want to make sure that this is a safe and secure World Cup.

I probably won't comment any more in terms of what countries he could be considering or would not be considering. But I do know that he's continually looking at everything he can do, not just to make this World Cup safe for American citizens, but for all those international visitors who are going to come here, while making it welcoming to all the fans that want to come here to enjoy the World Cup and have an absolute blast.

The Athletic: For the draw, how much input did the task force and the White House have? The songs that were played and the artists that were invited. Were these things which FIFA came up with, when they're playing President Trump's kind of anthem at the end with the Village People? Or is that something that you guys suggest?

Giuliani: It was a FIFA show. I know there were conversations that happened between President Trump and the president of FIFA, Mr. Infantino, during the Club World Cup about where the draw would be.

Would it be potentially in Las Vegas? Would it be in Washington D.C. in the Kennedy Center? But for the most part, we know that FIFA knows how to put on a show. While there was a dialogue about this or that, or this is what the president's involvement could be, I know, for the most part, this was FIFA that put the show on.

It was probably a smart touch from their standpoint to start with Andrea Bocelli and then end with the Y.M.C.A. It is kind of amazing that President Trump has even maybe, I don't want to say changed the Y.M.C.A. dance, but he has added a different interpretation to your traditional spelling of the letters above your head. Now he's got his own little dance with it. I was standing a few feet away from the president and as soon as the Village People started playing, everybody in the theater started turning back to go and look at President Trump, which just shows you how excited people are to see him close out with his dance.


The Athletic: On the Peace Prize, was that something where FIFA just came to you guys and said, ‘We'd like to do this.' Or did you guys say, ‘This could be a good idea'. How does that work?

Giuliani: Mr. Infantino went to the Summit for Peace in October (co-chaired by Trump in Egypt around the Israel-Gaza ceasefire). I think it really came out of that. But that certainly wasn't something that we suggested from the task force or the White House. I believe it was just a matter of FIFA looking and realizing that ‘Wow, this president really is doing everything he possibly can to make peace deals in places where other presidents have never even thought possible or maybe had tried and failed.' It was great to see him awarded for those incredible efforts.

The Athletic: Like anything related to the president, it would have divided reaction and opinion. The Democrats came out on social media and said ‘Trump couldn't win a Nobel Peace Prize so FIFA made one up for him.' Is there any consciousness of not making (World Cup events) too MAGA-y, so that the whole of the U.S. is into it? Or is there just a view that everyone should get behind the president? 

Giuliani: First and foremost, I think peace should transcend politics. It should transcend red or blue. We should celebrate any president that's able to bring peace to countries that could not achieve it beforehand.

It shows the shortsightedness of Democrats that want to point out politics at a moment where President Trump is doing everything he can not just to save lives, but save millions of lives around the world.

In terms of MAGA-ing up the World Cup, I don't think that's the case. We're at a point in our country where a lot of people want to celebrate the history of the United States of America, believe in American exceptionalism, believe that the first 250 years of our country's history is something that should be pointed out, should be celebrated and the World Cup is a big part of that.

I know going back to the bidding process, that was a big part of the discussions, the fact that this was going to happen over our 250th birthday. President Trump represents that. President Trump, more than anything, represents the fact that, as Americans, we don't have to apologize any more for whatever imperfections may exist in our country's history, we can look at the overall work of the last 250 years and what America has done for Western civilization, and truly celebrate that American greatness. I know the president certainly welcomes people of all different political backgrounds to come and celebrate America's greatness with him.

The Athletic: There are a lot of diaspora communities in the U.S., which will make for fantastic atmospheres. But there seems to be this worry that there may be ICE enforcement around games that may keep people away from attending. Are you able to provide any reassurances on that to people who may attend these games? 

Giuliani: Anybody who's legally come to the U.S., I can reassure you… there's law enforcement targeting people that have come here illegally. If you've come to the U.S. illegally, then the Department of Homeland Security has laid out a path where you can go and check yourself in, receive $1,000, go back to your country and have a process of applying legally here.

It's part of a safety and security message. We obviously want the world to be able to come here, but they need to come here the right way. We need to make sure we know who's coming in and who came in. Otherwise, how could we protect this World Cup to the degree that we need to? Part of that is making sure we identify who's come into the country, and we urge people to come here the right way, the legal way.

Hotels across North America have begun hiking prices to astronomical levels as they prepare for the FIFA World Cup in 2026.

Next year's World Cup will take place in host cities in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. With the tournament's first matches set to begin in less than six months, hotels are trying to take full advantage of one of the world's largest sporting events.

A Wednesday report from The Athletic detailed just how outrageous the price increases have been:

Across the 96 hotels we examined, the average per-night rate around an opening game was $1,013, compared to $293 for the same hotels 21 days earlier. The prices at the hotels increased, on average, by 328 per cent.

It is not unusual for hotel prices to rise around mega events. At the Paris Olympics in 2024, the French capital saw a year-over-year room rate increase of 141 per cent during the Olympic event period, according to Smith Travel Research. Yet the scale of the increases across the United States, Canada and Mexico immediately after the World Cup schedule was confirmed appears to be much more sizeable.

The worst offender, the report noted, was from a hotel in Mexico City. For late May 2026, the hotel is charging $157 per night. Just a few weeks later when the tournament begins, that rate jumps up to a mind-boggling $3,882.

Jose Mourinho has revealed the hilarious reason he took Scott McTominay's shirt after the Champions League tie between Benfica and Napoli. After Benfica's impressive 2-0 win, a result crafted through goals from Richard Rios and Leandro Barreiro, the Portuguese coach amused reporters by revealing an unexpected keepsake hidden inside a small bag he carried into the press conference.

The Scottish midfielder, now thriving in Serie A, owes much of his early career to the coach who thrust him into the Manchester United first team nearly a decade ago. Mourinho handed the midfielder his senior debut in May 2017, introducing him off the bench against Arsenal before starting him days later against Crystal Palace. The then-20-year-old quickly became a dependable fixture in Mourinho's midfield rotation during the 2017–18 season, even being preferred at times to record signing Paul Pogba, £89 million ($119m). Although Mourinho departed Old Trafford in late 2018, McTominay went on to make more than 250 appearances for the club, proving the value of the faith placed in him.

Mourinho has never been one to leave a press room without creating a moment, and on Wednesday night, he delivered another classic. While Benfica's players celebrated a crucial victory that keeps their European hopes alive, the 62-year-old manager walked in with a cryptic accessory that immediately sparked curiosity among the assembled journalists. When one asked whether he was handing out gifts, Mourinho responded with the kind of dry humour that has become his trademark.

While Benfica's players celebrated a crucial victory that keeps their European hopes alive, the 62-year-old manager walked in with a cryptic accessory that immediately sparked curiosity among the assembled journalists. When one asked whether he was handing out gifts, Mourinho responded with the kind of dry humour that has become his trademark.

""The bag is mine,"" Mourinho said. ""It's Scott McTominay's shirt. I put him in; I benched Paul Pogba for him at Manchester United. The least he could do was give me his shirt.""

After years of fluctuating form in Manchester, McTominay reignited his career with a move to Napoli in 2024. It turned out to be transformative. The central midfielder helped drive the club to the Scudetto, delivering dominant performances in the heart of the pitch and posting a career-best 13 goals across all competitions. His influence earned him a remarkable 18th-place finish in the 2025 Ballon d'Or rankings and culminated in him becoming the 2025 Serie A Player of the Year, the first Scot ever to claim the honour.

The humour stemmed from Mourinho's satisfaction at Benfica's victory. The two-goal win over Napoli was one of their best European displays of the season, and the manager made sure to highlight the significance of the result.

He said: ""We deserved it, we played an extraordinary match. Some will say that Napoli weren't the team we know, but I disagree. Benfica did an extraordinary job, controlling the game at all times. For us, beating Napoli like this and still being alive in this competition is a great thing.""

He went on to say: ""We have six points. Benfica lost at home to Qarabag early on, otherwise we'd have nine and be one step away from qualifying. The schedule is incredibly tough, but losing that match put us on the edge right away. It was important to win today, otherwise the story would have ended.""

While Benfica's Champions League prospects received a much-needed boost, their domestic situation remains delicate. The Lisbon side sit third in the Portuguese league, eight points behind leaders Porto. With increasing pressure from supporters and a demanding December schedule, more slip-ups could derail their title aspirations. Their immediate task is to maintain momentum when they return to domestic action against Moreirense on Sunday. After stumbling in recent league fixtures, Benfica cannot afford another misstep if they are to stay within reach of Porto and Sporting in the title race.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Borussia Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac has publicly backed Nico Schlotterbeck after the defender launched a scathing attack on his teammates following their disappointing Champions League draw against Bodo/Glimt. The manager admitted the collapse was ""completely unnecessary"" and insisted the centre-back had every right to voice his frustration.

Dortmund are currently licking their wounds after a chaotic night in the Champions League saw them surrender a commanding position to draw 2-2 with Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt. The fallout from the result was immediate, with defender Schlotterbeck giving a furious post-match interview in which he tore into the team's collective mentality. However, rather than reprimanding his player for airing the club's dirty laundry in public, manager Kovac has moved quickly to endorse the 26-year-old's assessment.

Speaking at his press conference on Thursday ahead of Dortmund's return to Bundesliga action, Kovac addressed the controversy with a sense of calm authority. He confirmed he had read Schlotterbeck's comments and found no fault in them, praising the defender for showing the leadership qualities required at the highest level.

""I understand Schlotti's frustration,"" Kovac told reporters with a wry smile. ""As a leading player, he certainly has the right to address certain things. That he, as a leader, is annoyed about the behaviour on the pitch is completely normal.""

Kovac went on to echo Schlotterbeck's tactical analysis, agreeing that the team have only themselves to blame for dropping points against an opponent they were expected to beat comfortably at home. ""Now I have read [the comments] myself,"" the coach added. ""We have left a huge opportunity behind. That was completely unnecessary. We had the game under control and then we gave it away.""

The backing from the manager comes after Schlotterbeck offered a brutally honest appraisal of Dortmund's performance immediately after the final whistle on Wednesday. The German international, who had put in a solid shift defensively, was visibly agitated by the manner in which the team allowed Bodo/Glimt back into the contest in the dying stages.

In quotes that quickly circulated across German media, Schlotterbeck accused the side of ""arrogance"" and criticised the impact of the substitutes who entered the fray.

""After the 1-0, we started playing extremely sloppy and having incredibly bad first touches,"" Schlotterbeck said. ""Everyone plays their own game a little bit. It is not bitter, it is actually really bad.""

He added: ""The players who come on lose every ball. If you come on in the 60th minute, I expect 30 minutes of full steam. We combined a bit right and left, chipping in front of the goalkeeper and wanting to make it look nice, but you have to kill the game and we didn't do that.""

The incident highlights a recurring theme for Dortmund this season: inconsistency. Under Kovac, the team have shown flashes of brilliance, looking capable of challenging the likes of Bayern Munich, only to follow up dominant displays with baffling lapses in concentration like the one witnessed against the Norwegians.

The draw leaves Dortmund in a precarious position in the Champions League table. While they remain on course to reach the knockout rounds, they are lingering outside the top eight, which would secure a place in the round of 16. Otherwise, they will be forced to navigate a two-legged play-off in February.

Dortmund must now regroup quickly as they turn their attention back to the Bundesliga. The team have no time to dwell on the ""unnecessary"" midweek error, with a Bundesliga fixture against Freiburg on the horizon this weekend. They currently sit third in the table and nine points behind leaders Bayern Munich, while RB Leipzig sit a point ahead of Kovac's side in second place.

In the Champions League, they are 10th and will return to action in the European competition in January when they face Tottenham and Inter.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Real Madrid are 'fighting' for Xabi Alonso! Thibaut Courtois defends under-fire coach after Man City defeat as goalkeeper pledges 'wholehearted' support amid rough spell","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/real-madrid-fighting-xabi-alonso-thibaut-courtois-defends-coach-man-city-defeat-goalkeeper-wholehearted-support-amid-rough-spell/blt43ba6a6920f9d754","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 11:48:23 GMT","

Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has issued a passionate defence of under-fire manager Xabi Alonso following the club's 2-1 Champions League defeat to Manchester City. The Belgian shot-stopper insisted the squad remain ""united"" behind the coach and pledged that the players will support him ""wholeheartedly"" as they look to end a poor run of form.

The atmosphere at the Santiago Bernabeu was tense on Wednesday night as Real Madrid suffered their second home defeat in the space of just three days. After falling to a 2-0 domestic loss against Celta Vigo over the weekend, the Spanish giants were beaten 2-1 by City in Europe, a result that has increased the scrutiny on manager Alonso.

Goals from Nico O'Reilly and Erling Haaland overturned Rodrygo's opener to hand victory to the Premier League side in the league phase encounter. The final whistle was met with frustration from sections of the home support, but Thibaut Courtois stepped forward in the mixed zone to offer a defiant message regarding the dressing room's relationship with their head coach.

Speaking to reporters after the match, Courtois rejected any suggestion that the players had lost faith in Alonso's methods or that the squad was fractured. The goalkeeper emphasised that the performance against Pep Guardiola's side, despite the adverse result, was evidence of their commitment to the manager.

""I think today we showed that we are a united team, that we support the coach and that we are all fighting to change this dynamic,"" Courtois declared.

Madrid have managed just two wins in their last eight matches across all competitions, a streak that has seen them slip to second in La Liga and seventh in the Champions League table. The defeat to City was particularly stinging as it marked back-to-back losses at the Bernabeu, a rarity for the 15-time European champions.

The match itself saw Madrid start brightly, with Rodrygo ending his long drought to put the hosts ahead after 28 minutes. However, City responded quickly through O'Reilly, before Haaland converted a penalty just before half-time after Antonio Rudiger was adjudged to have fouled the Norwegian striker.

Courtois also addressed the reaction from the stands. The goalkeeper acknowledged the frustration of the supporters following the recent dip in form, while defending the effort the team put in against a high-calibre opponent.

""I understand the anger after a run of matches like this, but I think we reacted on the pitch, we did everything possible and we lost against a very good rival,"" the Belgian explained.

Courtois pointed to the quality of the opposition as a factor in the result. City, who sit fourth in the Champions League standings on 13 points, controlled significant portions of the game. Despite the defeat, Courtois felt the team ""reacted"" well during the contest, creating chances in the second half as they searched for an equaliser that ultimately did not come. The goalkeeper himself was called into action to make a double save to keep the score at 2-1, denying City a third goal that would have killed the game off earlier.

When asked directly about the future of the manager and the squad's stance, Courtois offered an unequivocal pledge of loyalty to Alonso.

""Everyone here will support the coach with all our heart,"" Courtois stated.

This public backing comes at a critical time for Alonso, who took charge earlier in the year. The defeat leaves Madrid on 12 points in the Champions League league phase, still inside the top eight automatic qualification spots but with a reduced margin for error heading into the final fixtures against Monaco and Benfica in January.

The squad situation has been complicated by fitness issues, with Kylian Mbappe remaining on the bench throughout the match due to a knee concern, forcing Alonso to rely on a front line of Rodrygo, Vinicius Junior and Gonzalo Garcia.

Madrid return to La Liga action immediately with a trip to face Alaves on Sunday. For Courtois, this fixture is the priority to arrest the slide and restore confidence within the camp.

""It is by winning on Sunday that we will change this dynamic,"" he added.

The goalkeeper made it clear that the team must translate their internal unity into victories on the pitch. Real Madrid currently trail league leaders Barcelona by four points in the domestic table. The trip to the Mendizorrotza Stadium offers an immediate opportunity to respond to the defeats against Celta and City. A win would stabilise the situation before the winter break, while another negative result would further extend the difficult run Courtois referred to. The focus now turns solely to Sunday as the squad attempts to turn their ""wholehearted"" support into three points.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Juventus manager Luciano Spalletti has delivered a scathing assessment of his side's performance following their 2-0 victory against Pafos in the Champions League, labelling parts of their first-half display as ""embarrassing"". The Italian tactician lamented that his players missed ""easy balls"" and struggled defensively, necessitating a tactical reshuffle involving Weston McKennie to shore up a fragile backline.

While three points in the Champions League usually calls for celebration, the mood in the Juventus camp was decidedly sombre following their latest European outing against the Cypriot side. Despite securing a victory that keeps their slim hopes of a top-eight finish alive in the league phase, the Bianconeri were far from convincing, leaving their manager fuming at the technical poverty and defensive fragility on display.
 Spalletti refused to sugarcoat the evening's events during his post-match media duties, making it clear that while the result was necessary, the method of achieving it fell well below the standards required at the elite level of European football.


The primary source of Spalletti's ire was a disjointed first-half performance where Juventus seemed unable to string passes together or control the tempo of the game. For a coach who prides himself on fluid, possession-based football, seeing his side struggle with the basics was a bitter pill to swallow.

Speaking to Sky Sport after the whistle, Spalletti offered a brutally honest verdict on the initial 45 minutes, saying: ""It was fundamental to win and with victories, things are put right. I am not happy and neither are the lads, we could and should have done more. We did the bare minimum, in the first half there were also embarrassing situations. Then after the goal, we had more tranquillity.""

Beyond the general malaise, Spalletti pinpointed specific tactical deficiencies that left his side exposed. The injury crisis in defence forced the manager into uncomfortable compromises, most notably the deployment of Weston McKennie in a defensive role and the shifting of Pierre Kalulu.

The balance of the backline was a major concern, with Pafos finding it far too easy to create goalscoring opportunities on the counter-attack. Spalletti's analysis of his full-backs was particularly telling, highlighting the trade-off between offensive output and defensive solidity.

""Difficulty defending? It is true, we must also recover a right centre-back to let Kalulu play full-back and not McKennie,"" Spalletti explained.

He reserved specific criticism for the defensive vulnerabilities on the flanks, noting that while Andrea Cambiaso offers a threat going forward, he can become a liability when facing dynamic wingers.

""Also Cambiaso is very offensive and struggles against players who cut inside,"" the manager added. ""We conceded too much and exploited our qualities little, missing easy balls. For the moment it is like this, we take the second half.""

The victory provides breathing space, but it has not solved the underlying problems. Spalletti's public undressing of the team's performance serves as a warning shot: this level of play will not suffice in the knockout stages against stronger opposition.

They are now 17th in the Champions League table, leaving them on track to advance as an unseeded team for the knockout play-off draw. However, with just three points separating them from the top eight, Spalletti will hope to get maximum points from their last two games of the round to ensure they go straight into the last-16.

First of all, however, they will aim to crawl back up the Serie A table as Spalletti's seventh-placed team visit a Bologna side sitting fifth and with just one defeat in their last 15 matches in all competitions. AC Milan and Napoli are currently eight points clear of Spalletti's Bianconeri at the top of the table.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Jose Mourinho has dismissed Antonio Conte's claims that fatigue played a decisive role in Napoli's 2-0 defeat to Benfica in the Champions League on Wednesday. The Portuguese manager insisted his tactical decisions were the key difference, labelling his counterpart's complaints about the fixture schedule as little more than an ""excuse"" after the Serie A leaders were beaten in Lisbon.

The latest chapter in the long-standing rivalry between Mourinho and Conte was written at the Estadio da Luz on Tuesday night, with the Portuguese tactician claiming the bragging rights after his Benfica side secured a vital victory over Napoli in the Champions League league phase. However, the post-match narrative quickly shifted from the action on the pitch to a war of words in the press room, centred around the physical condition of the two squads.

Conte, whose Napoli side have been setting the pace in Serie A, pointed to a congested fixture list as the primary reason for his team's sluggish display. The Italian coach highlighted the disparity in preparation time, noting that Benfica had played their last domestic fixture on Friday, whereas Napoli were in action on Sunday in a high-profile clash against Juventus. Mourinho, however, was in no mood to accept that narrative.

When presented with Conte's comments regarding Benfica's physical advantage, Mourinho was characteristically blunt. The former Chelsea and Manchester United boss rejected the notion that rest days decided the outcome, arguing instead that his specific tactical adjustments were what dismantled Napoli's system.

""Saying Benfica were fresher physically feels like an excuse,"" Mourinho responded. ""We interpreted the game well, I decided to play [Franjo] Ivanovic rather than [Vangelis] Pavlidis upfront and that changed the way we attack.""

Mourinho elaborated on this specific selection decision, offering a tactical insight into how he exploited Napoli's defensive setup. He suggested that Vangelis Pavlidis, usually a key figure for the Eagles, would have played into Napoli's hands due to his style of play, whereas Djordje Ivanovic offered a different profile that unsettled Conte's back three.

""Pavlidis is someone who makes the kind of movements with the midfield that makes it easy for a team like Napoli to press him,"" Mourinho explained. ""Ivanovic gives more instability to a team that defends with three.""

This tactical tweak allowed Benfica to bypass Napoli's renowned pressing triggers, creating gaps in a defence that has otherwise been watertight in Italy this season.

For his part, Conte cut a frustrated figure. The Napoli manager felt his side were fighting an uphill battle before a ball was even kicked due to the accumulation of minutes in the legs of his key starters. With a shallow squad depth preventing significant rotation, Conte felt the lack of sharpness was inevitable.

""The match was certainly hard, difficult, on a hot pitch,"" Conte stated. ""We come from a series of games every three days, the same players are always playing and it is inevitable that we start to feel something.  Sunday's match was a key one, we had to travel, Benfica played on Friday, that's two extra days of recovery. But we have to take these things into account, we knew we'd spent a lot of energy, even mentally. Today some players were tired, you could see it, and there's no chance of any special rotation."" 

The physical fatigue manifested in technical errors, according to the Italian. Napoli, usually so precise in their build-up, found themselves making uncharacteristic mistakes and struggling to cope with Benfica's early intensity.

""Today someone was tired, you could see it, and there is no possibility to make particular rotations,"" Conte admitted. ""Tomorrow they will rest, then we will prepare for the match in Udine. Surely not being brilliant leads you to make wrong choices or not be so precise. At the beginning we struggled and committed errors.""

Conte pinpointed a specific moment early in the game where their pressing structure collapsed, leading to a loss of confidence that permeated the rest of the first half.

""We knew about the difficulties anyway, we wanted to start strong and on the first pressure we took a ball behind [the defence], this took away some certainties,"" he explained. ""In the first time we were very long, and they found passing lines.""

Despite the grievances regarding the schedule, Conte ultimately conceded that on the night, the hosts were the superior outfit. He acknowledged that managing energy levels is part of the reality of modern football, even if the result was painful to accept.

""I know the situation, and I knew it also when we won, and I also know that we will carry it forward for a while,"" Conte said. ""One must also understand that there are evenings in which the opponents have more energy compared to you, and today they deserved it more than us.""

The result leaves Napoli sitting 23rd in the Champions League table and in real danger of crashing out over the final two games of this phase, while Benfica currently sit just outside of the top 24 and need to claw their way in if they are to book a place in the knockout play-off round.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Ferrero & Lopez win Coach of the Year in the 2025 ATP Awards","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/ferrero-lopez-atp-awards-2025-coach-of-the-year","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 13:26:20 GMT","

Juan Carlos Ferrero and Samuel Lopez have been named Coach of the Year in the 2025 ATP Awards. The Spaniards helped Carlos Alcaraz regain the No. 1 spot in the PIF ATP Rankings and earn ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours.


Ferrero is the first coach to win the award twice, having been named to the same honour in 2022. Lopez joined Alcaraz's coaching team before the 2025 season and there was never any doubt there would be good chemistry between him and Ferrero.


“I'm so happy with the award,” Ferrero told ATPTour.com. “I was in no doubt that Samuel would fit our working philosophy really well, because we've been working together for many years and he knows exactly what I want for Carlos [Alcaraz]. He's done great work from the start.”

Lopez added: “Everything was easy, because the results came,” he said with a smile. “I've known Juan Carlos since he was ten years old and Carlos since he took his first steps at the [Ferrero Tennis] Academy. I was with Pablo [Carreno Busta] during that period, but we'd shared a lot of moments together. The working atmosphere is very relaxed because we've always known each other and we understood what Carlos needed.”

A post shared by ATP Tour (@atptour)


Alcaraz finished the year with a season-leading eight titles, including trophies at Roland Garros and the US Open, as well as the ATP Masters 1000s in Monte Carlo, Rome and Cincinnati.


Since the Coach of the Year category was added to the ATP Awards in 2016, Ferrero has been nominated for the accolade four times and won it twice. The award is voted on by fellow coaches.


“Honestly, since I started this project, it's never been a goal to win Coach of the Year,” said Ferrero. “But for the work to be recognised by other coaches who understand as we do how complicated it is... it means a lot to me to have won it twice now. This year it's doubly fulfilling because I'm sharing it with Samuel.”


The Spanish duo helped Alcaraz claim a career-best and season-leading 71 matches wins, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Ferrero and Lopez were on the same page with their messages.


“Maybe I freshened things up, because Juan Carlos has been with him for seven years and I'm new,” said Lopez, who had previously coached Ferrero himself, as well as Pablo Carreno Busta and Nicolas Almagro before formally joining Alcaraz's team. “I know the team and we've all contributed equally, but in different ways. Above all, we've really insisted that the work has to be fun.


Ferrero added: “The goal is for Carlos to work at 100 per cent and get everything out of the talent he has within him. We do that through hard work and discipline, but also with fun and joy while we're doing it. In that regard, I'm maybe a bit stricter and more serious. And Samuel is the joker, he's more open. But he also has the serious side you need when it comes to work.”


Even in a season during which Alcaraz finished atop the PIF ATP Rankings, there was a fair share of setbacks for the team. The ATP Masters 1000 hard-court swing in Indian Wells and Miami proved to be a turning point for Alcaraz, particularly when he bowed out to David Goffin in his opener in Florida.


“Carlos had just won in Rotterdam, when he did great. But in Indian Wells and Miami he lost a little confidence,” said Ferrero. “It was a tough time, not because of the defeat, but the way it happened. He was affected by the tournament and we had a chat when we got back. We talk to him a lot, but when you see that he's short tempered or weak at some point of the season, we always talk a little more from a psychological point of view and as friends, more than as a coach.”


And then everything clicked, specifically at the ATP Masters 1000 in Monte Carlo. 


“Winning in Monte Carlo, without playing that well, but having a 10-out-of-10 attitude really helped him have clarity about the rest of the season,” said Ferrero. “From there he reached a lot of finals, had incredible results in the Grand Slams... But Monte Carlo was a lightbulb moment. It gave him the confidence he needed and from there he was able to get some amazing results.”


Monte-Carlo was just Alcaraz's first step in an unforgettable clay season. He earned two more titles on the surface, in Rome and at Roland Garros. He also reached the final in Barcelona, tallying a 22-1 clay-court record. But apart from the spectacular results, Lopez highlights an important step taken by Alcaraz in terms of his maturity.


“Carlos has matured and he has realised the importance of expressing his feelings,” said Lopez. “After Monte-Carlo, he was talking much more about how he was feeling and it really helped him to express himself more, in terms of any difficulties, fears, and everything that comes with being there and handling the pressure of the tour.”


Alcaraz's ability to withstand the pressure was, in all probability, the key to him ending the season as the ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF in Turin, a moment that Lopez will never forget.


“On a personal level, I won my first Grand Slam at Roland Garros by forming part of a team as a coach, and what a win!” said Lopez. “Then, at the end of the year we knew he had the chance to end it as No. 1 and although nobody on the team was obsessed with it at the time, doing it in Turin was also a very happy moment.”


Looking ahead to the 2026 season, Ferrero and Lopez's enthusiasm for what is to come burns as brightly as ever.


“Our mission is to keep his ambition alive,” said Lopez. “You cannot rest on your laurels with what he's achieved. From now on that motivation has to keep growing, wanting more big things that are within reach of so few and from there staying motivated and not settling for anything, always gunning for more with that joy he is known for, which rubs off on the rest of us.”

Since former world No. 4 Caroline Garcia and her now-husband Borja Duran launched the Tennis Insider Club podcast last year, the show has become a destination for top players and other big names around the sport to pull back the curtain on their lives and careers, offering an unfiltered perspective on professional tennis from a player who's lived it.But, as Garcia confessed this week, its popularity has also drum up some unwanted attention.In a lengthy post on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday, Garcia alleged that the couple turned down a $270,000 sponsorship offer for the podcast from an unnamed gambling company, stating her belief that the industry has ""become one of the biggest sources of pressure, abuse, and hate in modern sport.""A 2024 report by Reuters alleged that disgruntled bettors were responsible for nearly half of the abusive comments that tennis players receive on social media—an epidemic that has led to tennis' governing bodies coming together in an attempt to combat the problem.""Every player ... has stories,"" Garcia affirmed, and later continued: ""I do not want Tennis Insider Club to contribute, even indirectly, to a system that fuels addiction, destroys lives, and turns athletes into daily targets.""

The 31-year-old, who retired from the tour after a first-round loss at the US Open, spoke candidly in the months ahead of her retirement about the mental health struggles she experienced in her time on tour. In a lengthy post on X last summer, she detailed some of the ""hundreds"" of abusive messages she received after a loss, and speculated whether an increase in partnerships between tennis tournaments and gambling companies has contributed to a rise in such behavior.""If we expect athletes to trust us enough to be vulnerable on the podcast, to share their fears, doubts, and mental health battles, then we need to show them that we choose values over money,"" she continued on Sunday.Garcia's announcement was met with praise from peers including International Tennis Hall of Famer Kim Clijsters, French Billie Jean King Cup teammate Alizé Cornet, and player-turned-broadcaster Chris Eubanks.Read more: Gael Monfils claps back at abusive bettors: 'Who's the dumbest between you and me'

A chaotic Cooldown Room end of season quiz

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Season showdown in Abu Dhabi

As Lando Norris becomes the 35th driver to claim the F1 World Championship, we've been taking a look at the key numbers from his title-winning campaign.

Lando Norris has now etched his name into the F1 history books after claiming his maiden World Championship at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the Briton taking the crown following a closely-fought title battle that went right down to the wire. An eventful season for Norris has also brought with it some fascinating statistics – and we've rounded up some of the key numbers below…

The smallest winning margin in seconds of all of Norris' victories, with this one occurring during his fifth triumph of the campaign in Hungary.

A one-stop strategy had helped Norris to get into the lead of Round 14 on the calendar, having lined up behind Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and the other McLaren of Oscar Piastri. However, a charging Piastri started to hunt Norris down during the latter stages, setting up a thrilling end to the race.

While he made a couple of attempts to overtake, Piastri ultimately could not find a way past his team mate – but crossed the line a mere 0.698s behind.

The number of points by which Norris took the Drivers' Championship ahead of closest rival Max Verstappen.

After retaking the lead of the standings following the Mexico City Grand Prix, Norris further strengthened his advantage to 24 points over Piastri at the next round in Sao Paulo. Verstappen, meanwhile, was 49 points adrift at this stage.

However, a run of victories for the Dutchman – coupled with some trickier weekends for McLaren – saw him overtake Piastri for second following the penultimate round in Qatar, putting him only 12 points away from Norris for the finale. Another triumph for Verstappen in Abu Dhabi gave him a further 25 points – but Norris just clung on to win the title, ending the season only two points clear of the Red Bull man.

Fastest laps achieved by Norris across the season.

A rule introduced in 2019 saw the driver that scored the fastest lap of the race awarded an additional point. While this was scrapped ahead of the 2025 campaign, setting the quickest time is still something of an accolade.

Norris racked up six fastest laps during his title-winning season, with his first coming during his victory at the first race of the championship in Australia while his last occurred at the Italian Grand Prix in September.

Norris' total number of wins – and pole positions – from the 24-race campaign.

Seven appears to be the magic number for both Norris and team mate Piastri in 2025; incredibly, each driver claimed seven race victories each, as well as both racking up the same number of poles.

While the majority of Piastri's triumphs took place during the first half of the year, Norris' were slightly more evenly spread, having stood on the top step of the podium in Australia (Round 1), Monaco (Round 8), Austria (Round 11), Great Britain (Round 12), Hungary (Round 14), Mexico (Round 20) and Sao Paulo (Round 21).

The number of race weekends where Norris arrived as the championship leader.

As touched on above, Norris kicked off the season in style by winning the Australian Grand Prix, meaning that he took an early lead in the Drivers' Championship standings. From there the Briton continued to head the table – until Piastri overtook him after Round 5 in Jeddah.

Despite the Australian remaining ahead of the pack for much of the campaign, a strong run for Norris saw the 26-year-old retake the P1 spot thanks to a dominant victory at Round 20 in Mexico – and the rest is history...

How many times Norris beat Piastri in the intra-team heads-to-heads.

In terms of Qualifying trim for the season, Norris narrowly outscores his team mate by 13-11. As mentioned above, both drivers took seven pole positions – but Norris more frequently placed ahead across the campaign as a whole.

The race day head-to-head between the two looks very similar, with Norris again just edging it by 13-10 (not including the Las Vegas Grand Prix, in which both McLaren cars were disqualified for a technical infringement).

Number of years since McLaren last had a Drivers' Champion prior to Norris' success.

When the papaya squad won the Teams' Championship in 2024, it marked the end of a long wait to return to title glory, with their last triumph having occurred back in 1998. Their most recent Drivers' title, meanwhile, had been won by Lewis Hamilton in 2008.

This year McLaren did the double, wrapping up the Teams' crown early in Singapore before Norris brought home a long-awaited Drivers' Championship at the finale, ending the 17-year dry spell since Hamilton's success.

The number of times that Norris stood on the podium in 2025.

Along with his aforementioned seven wins, the new World Champion also crossed the line in second on eight occasions, as well as taking third place three times – one of which being his crucial title-sealing result in Abu Dhabi.

With there being a total of 24 races on the calendar this year, this statistic means that only six of these ended with Norris finishing off the rostrum; two being a DNF (in Canada and the Netherlands), one a DSQ (in Las Vegas), while his other non-podium finishes were a P4 in Saudi Arabia, seventh place in Azerbaijan and another fourth at the penultimate event in Qatar.

The largest winning margin in seconds from Norris' season, achieved during his dominant victory in Mexico City.

Arriving into the weekend at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, the British driver had been without a P1 finish since the Hungarian Grand Prix almost three months earlier – but he soon boosted his chances of changing that statistic by grabbing a stunning pole position in Qualifying.

From thereon Norris raced to a lights-to-flag triumph, crossing the line with a whopping lead of 30.324s over Leclerc in second place.

The number World Champion that Norris becomes in Formula 1 history.

Prior to the 2025 campaign, 34 drivers had achieved the dream of winning the title in the top echelon of motorsport; from the very first won by Giuseppe ‘Nino' Farina in 1950, through to the four in a row scored by Verstappen between 2021 and 2024.

Norris' win means that he becomes the 35th on the list of F1 World Champions – and he'll doubtless be keen to add more than one championship victory next to his name in the future.

Total number of points scored by Norris by the end of the season.

Entering into 2025, the highest number of points available to a driver stood at 648 – but to achieve this would require victory in all 24 races plus the six Sprints.

Norris ended the campaign with a final total of 423, meaning that he scored 65.3% of the points on offer.

A chaotic Cooldown Room end of season quiz

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Season showdown in Abu Dhabi

Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff reflects on the Silver Arrows finishing second in the Teams' Championship.

Mercedes secured second place in the Constructors' Championship behind winners McLaren courtesy of George Russell's fifth in Abu Dhabi. It meant the Silver Arrows finished 18 points ahead of Red Bull – but while team boss Toto Wolff was pleased, he was not over the moon with the race itself.

Russell started fourth but lost places off the line courtesy of some wheelspin, and from there struggled for pace and could not catch up to the back of Charles Leclerc ahead to challenge for fourth or even the rostrum.

Kimi Antonelli had an even more frustrating race down the order, finishing well out of the points in 15th place. But Russell's points were enough to ensure Mercedes ended the season with that P2 in the Teams' Championship, despite Max Verstappen winning the race for Red Bull.

“Our race can be summed up in one word: mediocre. It was a lonely one for George who wasn't threatened from behind but didn't have the pace of the front four cars,” Wolff explained.

“He was managing his tyres to bring the car home on the one-stop, and he did that successfully. For Kimi, he tried his best from a difficult starting position, but we just didn't have the speed in the car to enable him to get back into the points.

“It is not the way we wanted to end the year, but we can be pleased we secured P2 in the Constructors'. Since the midpoint of the season, that has been our aim.”

McLaren were runaway winners of the Championship, scoring 833 points to Mercedes' 469. It leaves Mercedes without a Constructors' crown since 2021, but they did at least improve on last season's fourth-place finish.

“It is not what we as Mercedes ultimately want to be fighting for though, and hopefully we can prove ourselves worthy of being in a world title fight next year,” Wolff concluded.

Mercedes can at least point to the fact that Russell took two wins in a season dominated by McLaren and Verstappen as a positive, along with the introduction of rookie Antonelli to a full-time race seat, with the teenager having some standout performances towards the end of the year and taking three podiums.

But with the regulations set to change for 2026, it remains to be seen if Mercedes will start the next era as strong as they did with the dawn of the turbo-hybrid era in 2014.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Season showdown in Abu Dhabi

The Sauber name made its final appearance in F1 at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, a race in which Nico Hulkenberg brought home a points finish for the team.

Nico Hulkenberg was pleased to end the final race of the season with a points finish in Abu Dhabi, a Grand Prix that also marked the last appearance of the Sauber name before the squad transition into Audi in 2026.

After a difficult Qualifying at the Yas Marina Circuit left Hulkenberg in P18, the German embarked on a recovery drive in Sunday's race – his 250th Grand Prix start – that saw him climb up the order.

With Lance Stroll and Ollie Bearman each receiving a five-second time penalty for making more than one change of direction – dropping them both backwards – Hulkenberg was promoted up into a final result of P9, handing him two points to round out the campaign.

Reflecting on that outcome after the race, the 38-year-old said: “To be honest after yesterday and coming from P18, I'm very, very pleased with that. All things considered, yesterday was just a poor showing.

“Unfortunately we let ourselves down there, and it's very difficult to come back from there with everyone doing similar race pace. So all things considered, very happy to steal those two points, and I think a worthy end to the last race of the season.”

The weekend was a historic one in bringing a close to Sauber's long era in the sport, 32 years after the squad – founded by Peter Sauber – made their Formula 1 debut back in 1993.

When asked if the result in Sunday's race felt like a fitting way for the name to end, Hulkenberg responded: “Yeah, absolutely. Peter's legacy will live on – he's been in the industry for so long, big respect for him and what he's achieved, what he's done.

“We'll digest all this season, and then reset, regroup – obviously winter time's not too long this year – and we'll look forward to the new cars.”

The team will return in 2026 as Audi, with the German manufacturer previously setting out their ambition to win a championship by 2030.

The DC Studios co-chief spoke to influencers and media at a New York event ahead of the teaser trailer's drop Thursday


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	Kara Zor-El introduced herself to us last summer by crashing into the Fortress of Solitude and asking the host why he moved the door. She took a more polite path to the fore last Sunday in the basement of a New York City hotel, emerging onto a small stage wide-eyed and slightly amused.


	“It's gonna happen. Shit,” said Zor-El, as given human form by Milly Alcock.




	You can forgive the actress her wonderment. Supergirl has had a long flight to the present, having begun development in 2018, gotten postponed amid the pandemic in 2020, scrapped by new Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav in 2022 and then retooled as part of James Gunn's transitioning of the DCEU to the DCU in 2023.

	So long ago did this all start, of course, that the House of the Dragon star wasn't initially cast as the character. That honor belonged to Sasha Calle, who even appeared in 2023's The Flash. But with Alcock and the directorial hand of Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) on board and the film now shot, Supergirl could finally begin its slow marketing rollout ahead of its theatrical release on June 26.




			Popular on THR		







	In this incarnation, according to a teaser trailer showed at the hotel event and dropped online Thursday, Kara Zor-el is a universe-hopping party girl in her early 20s thrown into some intergalactic battles after a particularly self-pitying solitary birthday binge; she is on a mission of vengeance on behalf of the alien girl Ruthye and gets in deeper than she realizes. Ana Nogueira's script, inspired by the comic-book miniseries Supergirl: Women of Tomorrow by Tom King and Bilquis Evely, leans hard into the character's messiness.

	











	“This is really an anti-hero story. She's got a lot of demons, a lot of baggage coming into this, which is very different forms where superman is in his life,” Gillespie told the New York crowd.


	Added Gunn from the stage. “So many times female superheroes are so perfect. She's not that at all.”


	He paused. “Like male superheroes have been allowed to be for a while.”


	The character showed her unvarnished side on-screen, at one point noting that Superman “sees the good in everyone, and I see the truth.”


	The event had a bit of an unexpected vibe, with attendees going Comic-Con crazy inside the space while, outside it, the company making the film had just been cast into extraordinary limbo. Only three days earlier its CEO Zaslav said Warner Bros. would be sold to Netflix, and the day after the event Paramount owner David Ellison would launch a hostile takeover bid for the studio, making the room feel a little like a bar mitzvah whose guests had just been told an asteroid was heading toward earth; sure, the world may end tomorrow, but tonight can't we just hang out and do the Dougie?


	At the very least this film would not be disrupted by the corporate drama, as any new owner would not be likely to clear regulatory hurdles and close the deal before early 2027 (incidentally, the same time that the current contracts expire for Gunn and his DC Studios co-chief and producing partner Peter Safran).


	And so more important matters were at hand: getting a new movie off on the right boot. Supergirl's journey to the big screen has been hexed, in a sense, dating all the way back to 1984 and the Helen Slater bombfest and all the uncertainty leading up to the Superman release. But Gunn and Safran think a whole new day dawns.

	











	Do you feel like you're in a much better spot, The Hollywood Reporter, asked Gunn? “Oh, yeah,” he said emphatically.


	Safran believes the franchise is in a much different position than even six months ago, too.


	“We came in as a little bit of the underdog,” the producer and executive told THR Sunday at the event as he reflected about the summer release of Superman.  Asked if the box office success of the film raised expectations to the point that he and Gunn had a target on their back, the producer waved aside the concern. “Nah,” he said. “Because we're just getting started.”

							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are returning to the games.


	The two stars, known for their roles in Lionsgate‘s original Hunger Games films, will appear in the forthcoming prequel movie The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. Lionsgate releases the new feature in theaters Nov. 20, 2026.




	Lawrence will reprise her role as Katniss Everdeen, while Hutcherson will return as Peeta Mellark, with the pair likely appearing in a flash-forward. No details have been disclosed.

Francis Lawrence directs the movie adaptation of Suzanne Collins‘ best-selling novel. The previously confirmed castmembers of Sunrise on the Reaping include Ralph Fiennes as President Snow, Jesse Plemons as Plutarch Heavensbee, Kelvin Harrison Jr. as Beetee Latier, Kieran Culkin as Caesar Flickerman, and Elle Fanning as Effie Trinket. Joseph Zada, Glenn Close, Mckenna Grace, Maya Hawke and Whitney Peak round out the core cast.

	











	The book Sunrise on the Reaping takes place in Panem on the morning of the reaping for the 50th Hunger Games, 24 years before the events in The Hunger Games, the first novel that published in 2008. The franchise's first five movies have surpassed $3.3 billion at the worldwide box office, with the initial four films led by Lawrence as Katniss, Hutcherson as Peeta and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne. The film series kicked off with 2012's The Hunger Games.


	Lawrence and Hutcherson's most recent entry in the franchise was 2015's The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2, which ended with the pair married with children. Lawrence earned a Golden Globe Award nomination this week for her role in Die My Love, while Hutcherson currently stars in Five Nights at Freddy's 2.

	











	Francis Lawrence helms the new movie from a script by Billy Ray that adapts Collins' book. Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson produce for Color Force, while Cameron MacConomy executive produces.


Sunrise on the Reaping is a sequel to 2023's The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, which starred Rachel Zegler, Tom Blyth and Hunter Schafer.


	Lionsgate did not respond to a request for comment.


The InSneider was first to report on Lawrence and Hutcherson being involved.

Rafe Spall will play the British prime minister in a new political comedy-drama Number 10.


	In August, The Hollywood Reporter broke the news that Sherlock creator Steven Moffat was penning his first project for Channel 4, a series following one of the most famous addresses in the world.




	Produced by Hartswood Films, part of ITV Studios, Number 10 will be led by Spall, next to Jenna Coleman (Doctor Who, The Sandman) as his deputy chief of staff and Katherine Kelly (Mr Bates vs The Post Office) as chief of staff.

	“There's a Prime Minister in the attic, a coffee bar in the basement, and a wallpapered labyrinth of romance, crisis and heartbreak in between,” a plot synopsis reads. “Set in the only terrace house in history with mice and a nuclear deterrent, it's the only knock-through in the world where a hangover can start a war. The government will be fictional and unspecific, but the problems will be real. We'll never know which party is in power, because once the whole world hits the fan it barely matters. This is a show about the building and everyone inside.”

	











	Spall said: “Number 10 is a sensational piece of writing, equal to its peerless author, Steven Moffat. I'm delighted to be playing the Prime Minister, in a funny, real and thrilling piece of TV,” while Coleman added: “I thought it was about time I visited another British institution with Steven Moffat. I'm very much looking forward to moving into Number 10 with Steven's cracking scripts and working with Sue Vertue, Ben Palmer, Rafe Spall and Katherine Kelly”.


	Kelly said, “I am delighted to be reunited with Steven Moffat. His scripts are second to none, and I am thrilled to be working with the team at Hartswood Films once more. I look forward to walking through the famous doors of Number 10 and playing this delicious role.”


	Steven Moffat, writer and executive producer for Hartswood Films, said, “it's all about famous doors!”


	“The doors to the TARDIS, the door to 221B Baker Street, and now the most famous door in the world — Number 10,” he said. “I've been wanting to write about the madhouse that runs the madhouse for years, and I've never had so much fun doing the research. Other nations are ruled from mighty palaces. Britain is run from a little brick street with a big black door. If you want to do a workplace comedy drama this one is the boss of them all. And what a cast.”


	Commissioned for Channel 4 by Gwawr Lloyd, acting head of Channel 4 drama, the executive producers for Hartswood Films are Moffat and Sue Vertue, with Lawrence Till as the producer. Rachel Stone will be the co-producer. The director will be Ben Palmer.

	











Number 10 is produced in association with and will be distributed by ITV Studios. Transmission details will be revealed in due course.

Swift last appeared on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert in 2021.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


Taylor Swift and Stephen Colbert made an adorable TikTok video together backstage at The Late Show ahead of the pop superstar's late-night visit on Wednesday night (Dec. 10) — and the duo had the perfect song for their soundtrack.


	The video begins with a close-up of Swift in a red lip and a fuzzy winter jacket vibing to the humming intro of her 2008 Fearless album cut “Hey Stephen.” When the camera pans out, we see that The Late Show With Stephen Colbert host is there too, and he even lip-syncs the first word of the song: “Yeah.” Swift then breaks her so-far straight face to give a big goofy smile and wave at the late-night host and mouth, “Hey, Stephen!”

	











	The jangly country-pop song was never released as a single, but it did crack the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 94 the week Fearless debuted.


	Back in 2021, during a virtual Swift appearance on The Late Show, Colbert jokingly grilled the singer/songwriter about whether he was the inspiration behind the unrequited-love song. “Don't flatter yourself,” she quipped at the time, going on to joke that it was actually about author Stephen King. “He's amazing,” Swift said. “The Dark Tower series changed my life. Plus The Shining, The Stand. And don't even get me started on his short stories.”


	In fact, Swift has previously confirmed that the titular love interest was Stephen Barker Liles from country duo Love and Theft, who opened for her in 2008, even spelling out the name of his group in the Fearless liner notes as further proof.

	











	Swift returns to The Late Show for the first time since that 2021 appearance Wednesday night at 11:35 p.m. ET on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.

Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving, but @Taylor Swift is here. #Colbert #TaylorSwift

The new AI-powered ""Prompted Playlist"" feature will be available in beta to Spotify's premium users in New Zealand on Thursday (Dec. 11).


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


	On Wednesday (Dec. 10), Spotify announced it will now allow users to personalize their algorithm. 


	“Imagine a Spotify that doesn't just passively learn from you but literally listens to you,” a company blog post reads. “For the first time, your ideas, your logic and your creativity can actually power the Spotify algorithm, directing how it thinks, adapts and responds to you.”


	As part of the rollout, the blog post introduces a feature called the “Prompted Playlist,” which will first roll out in beta to premium users in New Zealand on Thursday (Dec. 11.) Essentially, this lets users use AI to generate a playlist — a similar concept to Spotify's recent integration with ChatGPT to allow for prompt-based music and podcast recommendations.ree


	“You could ask for ‘music from my top artists from the last five years,' then push it further with ‘and feature deep cuts I haven't heard yet,'” the blog post continues. “Or you could request ‘high-energy pop and hip-hop for a 30-minute 5K run that keeps a steady pace before easing into relaxing songs for a cool-down,' and layer on something like ‘include music from this year's biggest films and most-talked-about TV shows that match my taste.' You choose how broad or specific you want to go.”


	From there, users can “fine-tune the results by editing the prompt or start fresh whenever you want.” Each song included in the playlist will include descriptions and context to tell the user why Spotify selected that song, “so the playlist feels alive and crafted specifically for your prompt and your taste.”


	This can refresh on a periodic basis — daily or weekly — and Spotify refers to the feature as a way to “curate your next Discover Weekly.” For those who don't know what to prompt, there will be an “ideas” button that helps select prompts for the user. 


	News of the feature arrives just weeks after Instagram announced the launch of a somewhat similar feature, allowing “for you to tune your algorithm on Instagram by adding and removing topics based on your interests,” Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri wrote on Threads.


	The Spotify blog post says this launch “is just the beginning of a new phase [of Spotify] where listeners take the lead and make even more of every minute,” noting that there's more to come in 2026.

Swift's No. 1 choice is an epic song.


													By
												

	Lars Brandle



Taylor Swift either has too many, or not enough songs. Or simply, not enough spare time.


	When Swift dropped by The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on Wednesday night, Dec. 10, the outgoing host asked the pop superstar to name her top five songs from her catalog. Tough call, even for Swift.


	With that quiz, Swift joined the esteemed company of Dolly Parton, Elton John, Paul Simon and Bruce Springsteen. All of them are inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame. For Swift, it's just a matter of time before she gets the Rock Hall call.

	Swift, however, struggled to complete her task. “This is so much pressure,” she told the Colbert. “You're already writing five.”


	Party pooper alert: the “Shake It Off” singer requested a “little time to get back to” Colbert for the definitive list. “Because I don't have enough, see,” she continued. “I think I require a little bit of time to like, appreciate my work in a way… and it's constantly changing, right. It's a little too soon.”


	Swift was able to select her first choice, “All Too Well,” the 10-minute version, which was released as part of the re-recorded Red (Taylor's Version) from November 2021.


	“I'm really obsessed with The Life of a Showgirl right now, the whole album,” she noted.


	Swift also selected “Mirrorball” from 2020's Folklore album, but admitted she “can't really do any of the others.” 

	











	Given some time, “we could do an update at some point,” Swift asked.


	Colbert, with the type of delivery that was so sharp and fast, he could hurt a person, remarked: “You've got all the time you need between now and May.” That timeframe is a firm one, after which the award-winning host is set to be taken off CBS' airwaves.

	For her first return to The Late Show since 2021, Swift made an adorable TikTok video with Colbert backstage.

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


Disney has put its chips in on AI.


	The Hollywood giant has signed a major deal with OpenAI, investing $1B in the artificial intelligence giant and handing over characters from Frozen and Star Wars to generative AI video app Sora.


	It is comfortably the most significant collaboration between a Hollywood studio and an AI company to date, and suggests Disney has taken the view: if you can't beat them, join them.


	The three-year licensing agreement will allow Sora users to create bespoke fan videos with the likes of Captain America, Yoda, and Moana. A selection of these videos will stream on Disney+, which the company hinted at during an earnings call last month.

	











	Sora 2, the most sophisticated iteration of the app, caused outrage among rights holders when it launched in October. It adopted an opt-out policy, meaning IP was usable on the app until a rights holder issued a removal request. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Disney is now opting in — and in a big way. It is the first major content licensing partner on Sora, which enables users to create short-form videos with text prompts.


	Disney will also become a major OpenAI customer, using its tech to build new products, tools, and experiences, including for Disney+, and deploying ChatGPT for its employees. The deal does not, however, allow OpenAI to train its machine learning models on Disney IP.


	Disney CEO Bob Iger said: “Technological innovation has continually shaped the evolution of entertainment, bringing with it new ways to create and share great stories with the world.

	











	“The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works. 


	“Bringing together Disney's iconic stories and characters with OpenAI's groundbreaking technology puts imagination and creativity directly into the hands of Disney fans in ways we've never seen before, giving them richer and more personal ways to connect with the Disney characters and stories they love.”


	Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, added: “This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences.”


	Disney characters available to use on Sora will include Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Lilo, Stitch, Ariel, Belle, Beast, Cinderella, Baymax, Simba, Mufasa, as well as characters from the worlds of Encanto, Frozen, Inside Out, Moana, Monsters Inc., Toy Story, Up, Zootopia, and many more.


	Also featured will be animated or illustrated versions of Marvel and Lucasfilm characters like Black Panther, Captain America, Deadpool, Groot, Iron Man, Loki, Thor, Thanos, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Leia, the Mandalorian, Stormtroopers, Yoda, and more.


	What appears to be off the table is exploiting the performances of actors, with the press release noting that Disney and OpenAI will “respect the rights of individuals to appropriately control the use of their voice and likeness.”


	The release added: “OpenAI and Disney have affirmed a shared commitment to maintaining robust controls to prevent the generation of illegal or harmful content.”

Therefore, Disney just handed its vaunted characters and copyrighted IP to, well, everyone. Nothing Sora created can be copyrighted, period.

They can put all the legal jargon and EULA text they want on this, but that's the law. You can legally do anything you want with AI generated content, folks.

So, again, anything generated by AI cannot be copyrighted and therefore loses all of those legal protections.

Someone at Disney should be fired for this. But, for now, have fun everyone!!!

Foolish… just foolish

Quite literally the beginning of the end for Hollywood. Who needs any creatives when 8 year olds can create their own AI junk? It was fun while it lasted. This move is beyond vile.

Stake your claim or fade into obscurity…

“Off the table is exploiting actors.”

Artists, animators and VO talent? Go to town. 

Walt would be rolling in his grave. Again.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	It's finally here, the first trailer for Warner Bros DC Studios‘ next big summer movie, Supergirl, starring House of Dragon‘s Milly Alcock in the title role as Superman's cousin — who has a drinking problem. 


	Fans caught a glimpse of Alcock as Supergirl at the end of James Gunn's Superman when she stumbles into the Man of Steel's fortress of solitude. In the trailer, it looks like Kara would have no problem living in the same colorful, ragtag gang universe as Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy. What's clear here is that Kara isn't a carbon copy of Superman ala Supergirl in the 1984 movie; she has her own personal demons. Not only does she have the grit to take on any Mad Max type who comes her way, but what sets her apart from Kal-El?

	











	“He sees the good in everyone, and I see the truth,” she emphasizes in the trailer here. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Superman's dog Krypto is along for the adventure. 


	The movie, directed by Craig Gillespie, is based on the Tom King's 2022 comic book series Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, which Bilquis Evely illustrated, and Ana Nogueira adapted the comic book for the big screen. In the comic, Supergirl and young alien girl Knolle travel across the galaxy to hunt Krem of the Yellow Hill after he kills Knolle's father in cold blood. It's been billed among fans as being akin to the John Wayne classic, True Grit. 


Supergirl happens in theaters on June 26, 2026.

When did Superhero movies become so irritating?

Bring back the Snyderverse.

It'll make far less than The Marvels. They should have given her a human male love interest co-lead and not some rando British kid. Romance and chemistry help movies.

Makreting ought to include: From the director of CRUELLA. People in the know understand it's Craig…but flyover states have zero idea who Craig G. is…without a film listed. And they're too lazy to look his credits up.

I don't know that I'd advertise that lol

Looks promising for a DC film.

The alien girl's name is Ruthye FYI

Staff Writer

Kimmie's journey is coming to an end on Beauty in Black as Netflix has renewed the Tyler Perry series for a third and final season.

The streamer also announced that the eigh episodes from Season 2, Part 2 of the series, starring Taylor Polidore Williams, will premiere on March 19, 2026.

Premiering in 2024, the drama series spent seven weeks ranked in the Top 10 and, by its second week, was at the top of the list in 28 countries, according to Netflix. Part 1 of Season 1 also topped the most-watched list in 14 countries during its second week.

RELATED: ‘Avatar: The Last Airbender' Season 2 Trailer & Photos: First Look At Netflix Live-Action Series

Beauty in Black was created, directed, written, and executive produced by Perry. The series follows two women leading very different lives. While Kimmie (Taylor Polidore Williams) struggles to make a living after her mother kicked her out, Mallory (Crystle Stewart) runs a successful business. They are entangled in each other's lives.

In Season 2, the ruthless, backstabbing family behind a beauty brand — and an underground trafficking ring — will face a reckoning. Kimmie, the once-unassuming sex worker in their employ, becomes an unstoppable force of vengeance on a mission to rescue her kidnapped sister.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


The Walt Disney Co. has fired off a cease-and-desist letter to Google, claiming that its AI training models and services infringe on its copyrights on a “massive scale.”


	The letter was sent on Wednesday, just before the company made the announcement that it has reached an agreement with a Google rival, OpenAI, to provide its characters and IP for use in the latter company's services.


	Disney contended that Google's “willful infringement is especially alarming because it is leveraging its dominance in generative AI and across multiple other markets to make its infringing AI Services as widely available as possible.”

	











	“Google is intentionally amplifying the scope of its infringement, by making its infringing AI Services available across so many channels to so many consumers, flooding the market with infringing works, and reaping enormous profits and other value from its unlawful, harmful, and damaging exploitation of Disney's copyrighted works,” per the letter from David Singer, the Jenner & Block attorney representing Disney.

	Disney previously sent cease-and-desist letters to Meta and Character.AI, and is part of litigation with NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery against Midjourney and Minimax. 


	A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

	











	In the letter, Disney claims that Google “has refused to implement any technological measures to mitigate or prevent copyright infringement, even though such measures are readily available and being used by Google's competitors.” The letter adds that Disney has tried to engage Google “for months,” but the tech giant has “done nothing” and the use of its copyrighted works “has only increased” during that period.


	The letter alleges that not only has Disney IP been distributed without authorization in AI services but that Google has copied “a large corpus” of copyrighted works in training models. The letter cites models including Veo, Imagen and Nano Banana.


	Disney's letter also cited the ability of uses to generate images and videos via text prompts, including Star Wars characters, Marvel characters, Pixar works, classic animated characters and The Simpsons, among other IP.


	“Google operates as a virtual vending machine, capable of reproducing, rendering, and distributing copies of Disney's valuable library of copyrighted characters and other works on a mass scale,” The letter states. “And compounding Google's blatant infringement, many of the infringing images generated by Google's AI Services are branded with Google's Gemini logo, falsely implying that Google's exploitation of Disney's intellectual property is authorized and endorsed by Disney.”


	The letter also pointed to Google Gemini, its primary brand, and claimed that it “is treating Disney's valuable copyrighted characters like its own and making them available to subscribers for a fee.” Disney included the images of Simba and Nala from The Lion King and of Darth Vader that it said were generated by a “simple prompt.” The letter also cited Google use of its AI across its businesses, including YouTube and mobile apps.


	The letter called on Google to cease further copying and distribution of Disney IP in its AI services, as well as to implement technical measures to “ensure that no further outputs” infringe on the company's works. Disney also called on Google to identify which copyrighted works it has used to train its AI models, and to cease any use of them for such purpose.


	AI companies have argued that the use of copyrighted material, particularly in training models, is a “fair use,” a concept that is being litigated in the courts.


	The timing of the letter, just as the company announced its agreement with OpenAI, appeared to be no coincidence. A source familiar with Disney executives' thinking said, “Our agreement with OpenAI demonstrates that the world of AI does not have to be lawless, and that technology innovators and creative industries can work together and thrive if they are willing to respect the value of creators and their works.”

Bill de Blasio's ex Nomiki Konst said he wanted to have a child with her before he cheated on her with Arizona mayor Roxanna Valenzuela.

Konst dropped the bombshell during her appearance on the YouTube show “Why Did They Break Up?”. 

The political commentator, 41, shared that she has Endometriosis and underwent six rounds of egg freezing. She said she brought this up with de Blasio, 64, and that he was not only “open” to the conversation about the possibility of having children with her, he actually asked her lots of questions about it.

“On that flight to California, we talked the entire time about the process and what it would be like, we just got pretty serious very quickly,” she recalled.

When host Touré asked her, “He wanted to have a child with you?,” she replied, “Yes.”

But a source told Page Six that Konst and de Blasio weren't trying to have children together, despite her freezing her eggs.

Sources dropped details to Page Six about the former New York City mayor's headline-making affair with Valenzuela, specifically, how it began. De Blasio and Valenzuela began seeing each other more than a month before he split from Konst, whom he dated for nearly a year.

The politicians first met for a business lunch in September, then the pair went back to his apartment to have sex hours later, a source told us.

Two days later, the two had another tryst when the South Tucson mayor took him to volunteer at a soup kitchen.

De Blasio came clean to Konst about the affair while they were on a vacation in Greece when she was in the midst of a round of IVF for egg freezing, a source said.

Still, a source close to Konst told us that she and de Blasio attempted to work it out. But we're told that on Nov. 4, she “learned he was still talking to Roxanna and [Roxanna] was coming to NYC [to see him] while they were walking into Zohran Mamdani's election night victory party.”

De Blasio is still dating Valenzuela, 41, and tells Page Six that he “fell in love” with her.

“I wish Nomiki well and I'm sorry for how our relationship ended,” he told us. “I fell in love with someone else and I should have told her sooner. I'm now in a wonderful relationship with Roxanna Valenzuela that we will continue to nurture and keep private.”

De Blasio has two children with Chirlane McCray, who formerly identified as a lesbian. The pair separated in 2023 and do not intend to divorce.

So scarlet, it was maroon.

Taylor Swift was dressed in her festive best for a visit to “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” Wednesday night to promote her upcoming Disney+ docuseries, “The End of an Era.”

The “Life of a Showgirl” singer wore a burgundy velvet David Koma dress with a sculptural off-the-shoulder silhouette, along with matching Aquazzura pumps in the same lush fabric.

Swift kept the cranberry color palette going with her elegant diamond-and-ruby necklace, and finished her late-night look with a delicate opal bracelet.

The superstar's latest outfit is right in line with her “Showgirl” aesthetic, marked by luxe materials and Vegas-worthy sparkle. 

Whether in the spotlight to promote her own projects or in the stands cheering on her fiancé, NFL tight end Travis Kelce, Swift is dressing to impress and inspire.

On Sunday, the “Honey” singer wore a holiday-ready herringbone Miu Miu jacket to cheer on the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. While the team ultimately lost to the Houston Texans, Swift and her longtime “squad” members, Selena Gomez and Lena Dunham, were on hand to provide moral support to the Kansas City crew.

As for what's next in Swift's wild week?

Following the debut of the first two episodes of “The End of an Era” on Friday, Swift will ring in her 36th birthday on Saturday, hopefully surrounded by the three Fs: friends, family and fiancé.

But there's no sleep for Swifties this weekend — and that includes your favorite Page Swift editors, too.

The birthday girl will likely continue the party back in Kansas City when the Chiefs face the Los Angeles Chargers on their home turf. 

Here's hoping “Colbert” helped the singing superstar warm up for this busy weekend of revelry — and that Swift has time to rest up for her big, bridal year in 2026.

The “Survivor” season 49 finale is one week away, which means these castaways are feeling even more pressure to survive Tribal Council tonight. The votes were unanimous last week on “Survivor” 2025, but that probably won't happen again tonight when Jeff Probst reveals the “Survivor” results. It's time for another week of challenges and backstabbing, but who gets voted off “Survivor” 49 tonight? Find out during our “Survivor” season 49 live recap below!

Just six castaways are remaining on “Survivor” season 49. They know the finale is coming up, so they know they have to make moves now before it's too late. Soph talked about this last week, but she is back at it again tonight, as seen in the sneak peek video from CBS. She wants to go against Savannah or Rizo, but then voted out Sophie last week.

She is trying to plot with Sage and Kristina this week, but will the plan go through this week? We made our predictions earlier, but find out tonight and find out who got eliminated on “Survivor” season 49 during our “Survivor” live recap below.

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD: THIS LIVE RECAP WILL BE UPDATED THROUGHOUT THE EPISODE, SO DO NOT KEEP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ SPOILERS.

KEEP REFRESHING THE PAGE FOR THE LATEST “SURVIVOR” LIVE RECAP UPDATES.

The castaways are back from Tribal Council, and spirits are high. They all came together to get Sophie out, so no tension tonight. Steven is happy, since he still gets to keep his Block a Vote advantage. Then Soph says she'd like the be called Sophie now!

Here we are, another week, another Tribal Council, and Rizo still has his idol. He told everyone it expires at the final six, so he would have to use it tonight. However, it actually expires at the final five, so he can keep it with them all thinking he's going to play it tonight.

The next day arrives, and it's a rainy day. We are back with Soph talking about how she needs to go after Savannah and Rizo. She is trying to plant seeds about this.

The castaways meet Jeff, and it's day 22. For this challenge, they will race through obstacles to gather three bags. They will then try to land a sandbag on top of a tall pole. The winner gets a Mexican feast, featuring margaritas and desserts. They will also get a night at the Sanctuary, including letters from home!

Steven is the first to gather his bags. He then finds his color sandbag, so he gets started. They all get their sandbag and start tossing. Everyone is close, but no one is getting. Finally, Savannah lands her sandbag, and she wins this challenge. She gets to bring two people with her. She picks Rizo (who was crying earlier at the mention of letters) and Soph, so she sticks with her alliance.

Spirits are high at the reward, as these three are planning on a Final 3 together. They say they will be best friends after this ends. However, we all know they are going to stab each other in the back eventually.

Meanwhile, the other tribe members are back at camp and not happy to lose. Sage thinks it's karma that Savannah won and for not getting her out when she wanted to a couple of weeks ago. Kristina said Soph is ready to get Savannah out, but this reward might change her mind. Then Steven tells them about his advantage, which he says would give them a majority.

At the reward, they seem to solidify that they are a Final 3 and name themselves the Tres Leches alliance. Then Soph tells them about her Knowledge is Power advantage. Now they say she can steal Steven's advantage and then get him out.

The winners then enjoy their family letters from home. They said it's exactly what they needed, and it gives them a boost. Of course, Rizo is a hot mess when reading his. Each letter makes him cry even more.

Meanwhile, back at camp, the losers are trying to sleep. They have a special rat visitor, and Sage is over it all.

The next day arrives, and it's awkward. Rizo tries to talk with Steven, but it all seems to come down to the next Immunity Challenge and who wins that.

For this challenge, the castaways will put one foot on the end of a hinged beam. At the end of the beam is a ball. They will use that one foot to keep the ball on the beam. The ball falls off, and they are out of the challenge. The last one with their ball on the beam wins immunity and a spot in next week's finale.

They did this challenge in season 45. The winner of that challenge went on to win the season! That challenge lasted 24 minutes. 

For tonight, the sun is shining bright, so it's hot. Then the wind is coming, to mess with them some. Rizo is out pretty fast. Then we see Soph drop her ball. Kristina is struggling, and her ball finally drops. It's been three minutes, and three castaways are out.

Steven is struggling also, and he finally slips and his ball drops, so he is out. Now, Savannah starts running her mouth again, as it's down to her and Sage. She says it's just friendly banter.

They then make it to 24 minutes, so they are lasting longer tonight. Now the talk starts, as Sage wants Savannah to drop. She says she wants it and will keep Savannah safe tonight. It doesn't work, as neither is dropping.

They both started struggling, but Sage was really struggling. They make it over 35 minutes, but Sage finally drops, and Savannah wins immunity tonight. Emotions are high as Sage gets a lot of love.

Back at camp, Tres Leches wants to get Steven out, of course. Then Rizo talks with Steven, who says he will be going after Soph since Savannah has immunity, and they think Rizo has to play the idol.

Then Rizo talks with Sage, saying they should go after Steven, and that would help her win. Sage is thinking Steven could be a good vote, as she wants it to be her, Kristina, and Soph at the end. Kristina tries to get them to go after Soph.

Now Kristina talks with Steven, and slips about Steven being a target. He is not happy and vents to Sage about it. The Tres Leches thinks they are safe, as Soph will play her advantage to take Steven's advantage. However, then Soph is contemplating things, as they don't know what Steven's advantage is. She could take Rizo's idol and guarantee she is safe.

Steven says he has played his advantage, and he is using it to block Savannah's vote.

The castaways are in place, and this is supposed to be a jaw-dropping night, so what will it bring? The night starts with talk about Savannah's reward and who she took with her. What the talk was when both sides were gone. Rizo says the side that comes out on top of this vote might control the rest of this game.

Before the vote takes place, Soph speaks up, and she says she has the Knowledge is Power advantage. She says she wants to take the advantage from Steven, but he says he doesn't have one! What? He could have played it before, or did he give it to someone else? At the vote, we see Savannah's vote is blocked, so he did play it early! Soph is pissed at Steven, but she did it to herself.

Results – Jeff tallies the votes and Rizo makes another speech, but keeps the idol again! The votes: Steven, Soph, Steven, and Steven. The jury is shocked, as everyone is shocked. Sage says she couldn't have beat him. They just handed that one to Tres Leches.

What do you think of the results on “Survivor” season 49 tonight?

This survivor is the most boring one on record for me.  Stupid play tonight.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Survivor' Star Opens Up About Close Friendship With Fellow Contestant","https://entertainmentnow.com/survivor/sophie-segreti-sage-ahrens-nichols-friendship/","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 16:20:22 GMT","

Season 49 “Survivor” contestant Sophie Segreti has spoken about her close friendship with fellow player Sage Ahrens-Nichols and how the pair have mended their relationship since leaving the island. Sophie was speaking after being voted off the show and explained that she could have been more ruthless if it wasn't for the fact that she liked Sage so much.

As part of her exit interview with Parade following her elimination from “Survivor,” Sophie discussed her friendship with Sage — something that had been noted by other contestants and many viewers. She revealed that the pair bonded quickly and became close, something that may well have affected how she played the game as it meant she was not willing to necessarily put her own needs above Sage's. 

“So it's actually funny. Because if you remember that episode where Jawan goes home, I am kind of the one who is deciding between Jawan and Sage,” she reveals. “And the reason that I chose Jawan is because I was close with Sage. I was playing a little bit with my heart, not gonna lie. I had a closer relationship with Sage, and she also had proven to trust me and clued me in on things and really had my back. And so that's why I was like, ‘I have to save her now.'”

However, Sophie admitted this may have been a problem as it meant that Sage was particularly upset by what she saw as a betrayal when Sophie voted to eliminate Jawan — the other person that Sage had developed a strong friendship with. 

She said, “And in retrospect, maybe I should have just voted her out and stuck with Jawan. Because, in doing so, because we had that close bond, in breaking her trust, it was so much worse. Whereas I feel like, if I betrayed Jawan, we didn't have as much capital in our relationship. And so it might not have hurt us badly.”

The animosity that arose from the Jawan elimination wasn't enough to permanently damage the friendship between Sophie and Sage. Speaking about the relationship the pair now share since filming for the reality series ended, Sophie explained that they are “great now.” She also discussed how interesting it is to watch Sage play “Survivor” so well from the audience's perspective.

“It's been so fun getting to watch her game on TV, because she is playing such an amazing strategic game,” says Sophie. “And I think because she really dances to the beat of her own drum, you can almost forget how strategic she is. I mean, we saw it with, ‘Just tell them I'm farting. We're not talking strategy.'” 

She continued, “And so that's been lovely to see. But Sage and I are good. I had to do a little bit more damage control when we all were back in the States. But I'm so grateful to have gotten to play the game with her. I mean, kudos to her. She really spearheaded ‘Operation Kick Sophie to the Curb.'”

Thousands of HGTV fans have shared their condolences with the family and colleagues of Frank Cozzolino, who appeared for more than two decades on Mike Holmes' popular shows, including “Holmes on Homes” and “Holmes Family Rescue,” before his death at age 56 on December 4, 2025. 

Cozzolino's family and close friends are treasuring the memories from all who knew or knew of him rather than holding a funeral, according to the electrician's daughter, Filomena Cozzolino. 

In a social media post on December 6, she explained, “For all of those who'd like to pay their respects, he did not wish to have a funeral. Rather, he wanted people to focus on the great times they shared with him.” 

Filomena continued, “His life, and the lives of his loved ones, was enhanced by organ donation; we can take a moment to honour him by donating to organ transplant research, cancer research, or signing up for organ donation. This way, we may continue to bring others a second, or third, chance at life.” 

Cozzolino, a Canadian contractor who ran his own business in Toronto, Solutions Electrical & Maintenance, also became close friends with Holmes when he began appearing on his shows, beginning with the very first episode of “Holmes on Homes.” 

Cozzolino underwent a liver transplant in August 2017, which he wrote in an Instagram post felt like a “second chance at life.” His liver disease was an occasional topic on Holmes' shows, including an episode in which his team helped to renovate Cozzolino's home in 2022, according to Deadline. 

In her December 6 post, Filomena explained that his doctors had discovered his liver disease returned in early 2025 and that he became the “grateful recipient of a second transplant in July 2025.”

She went on to say that “there were many post-operation complications, and he conquered each new battle, until he was diagnosed with lymphoma. Ever the fighter, he never gave up. He deliberated and decided that he would push through; he'd beaten the odds up to this point, he thought ‘the world isn't getting rid of me this easily.'”

“Although he lost his battle in the late evening of December 4, 2025,” she continued, “my dad pushed the boundaries of what many of his medical team, friends, and family thought possible.”

According to Cozzolino's obituary, he was survived by his longtime partner Lisa, and his two daughters, Filomena and Alexandria. Holmes considered him a dear friend and said in a post on December 9 that he was “devastated” to lose him. 

His kids and fellow HGTV co-stars, Mike Holmes Jr. and Sherry Holmes, also issued social media statements, expressing how much they'll miss Cozzolino. Sherry called him 

In a statement issued by HGTV on December 10, per Deadline, the network said, “We are deeply saddened to hear of Frank Cozzolino's passing. Frank was an exceptional craftsman whose kindness, integrity and unwavering dedication touched every project and every person he encountered.”

Fans and friends have left tributes to Cozzolino across social media, including on Holmes' posts about him. One wrote on his YouTube video about the late electrician, “Omg ….. not Frank!….. heartbreaking news. I'm so sorry, Mike. I know he turned into a friend and then more like family over the years. He's the most honest electrician I've ever seen. Rip Frank.”

“Holmes Family Rescue” is expected to return on HGTV in 2026; it's not clear if Cozzolino was able to film any episodes for the next season before his death.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Erin & Ben Napier's Show Moving Forward After Tragedy","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/ben-erin-napier-hotel-fire-show-update/","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 16:33:05 GMT","

The show must go on. When a fire ripped through the new boutique hotel that Erin and Ben Napier helped their best friends restore, the HGTV stars thought the series they'd filmed about the renovated hotel might never air.

But on December 10, 2025 — nearly four months after the devastating blaze — the couple told USA Today a version of the spinoff show will air on HGTV, after all. 

When a fire broke out at The Heirloom on August 26, the 30-room boutique hotel had just begun taking reservations amid the news that HGTV was filming a new show about the property's restoration, called “Home Town: Inn This Together.” But hours after the blaze tore through the hotel, Erin wrote on social media that she wasn't sure “you'll ever get to see this @hgtv show now.”

Restoring an old building in downtown Laurel and turning it into a hotel was a project the Napiers had been quietly working on, supporting their dear friends and business partners — Jim and Mallorie Rasberry (Jim is Erin's cousin, and Mallorie is her longtime bestie) and Josh Nowell. 

“This was their baby,” Napier told USA Today. “To watch them give their all − and I really mean give their all to create this masterpiece − and then to watch it burn together, was devastating.”

“The episodes are going to air,” Ben said of the spinoff, which will air sometime in 2026. 

The group huddled outside the hotel, Erin shared in an Instagram post that night, writing, “We held each other and watched it burning while the brave fire fighters from the Laurel FD worked for hours to get it under control. Today feels like a funeral.”  

“But I know these people,” she continued. “They won't give up here. I don't know what will happen next or if you'll ever get to see this @hgtv show now. I don't know much of anything. Pray for my friends and family, please. It is hard to explain how this reverberates through our town and its progress in many ways. But I know God has a plan for this setback. He always knows the way, even when we don't.” 

Indeed, the group has been working diligently to pick up the pieces after the devastating fire. In late September, they shared an Instagram video of the wreckage and vowed to rebuild.  

Meanwhile, season 10 of the Napiers' primary show, “Home Town,” premieres on HGTV on January 4.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Guy Fieri Stands His Ground on One Hotly Debated Cooking Question","https://entertainmentnow.com/food-tv/guy-fieri-controversial-cooking-question/","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 01:36:07 GMT","

Guy Fieri has never been shy about speaking his mind, but even longtime fans were surprised to learn there is one kitchen question that pushes him toward confrontation. In a recent video shared by the Food Network, Fieri responded to a series of rapid-fire culinary debates and stopped cold when asked whether cooks should ever use pre-minced garlic.

“Okay, you want to fight?” he said in the Instagram clip.

The exchange offered more than a joke. It revealed how fiercely the “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” host protects what he sees as the fundamentals of good cooking. The garlic debate served as the clearest example of his belief that technique matters and shortcuts undermine the heart of the craft.

Fieri ran through several cooking questions in the video. According to the video, he said he does not wash chicken, and he told viewers not to add oil to boiling pasta water. He confirmed that he rinses rice before cooking it and explained that he maintains his cast-iron cookware with water and scraping instead of soap.

Another question prompted an even more animated response. When asked if breaking spaghetti before boiling it was acceptable, Fieri paused and jokingly mimed a punch to show where he stood.

The garlic question, though, drew the strongest reaction. Fieri did not offer a detailed explanation in the clip, but his tone made clear that he sees pre-minced garlic as a step too far from the integrity of fresh ingredients. His reaction echoed a long-running theme in his public cooking philosophy: flavor starts with technique, and technique starts with doing the work.

The garlic moment came only days after Fieri gave another set of candid opinions in a separate Food Network holiday video. This time, he weighed in on holiday dinners and did not hesitate when asked what he considers the most overrated part of festive meals.

“All the desserts. What is up with that?” he said, adding that hosts should focus on appetizers and the main course instead of offering elaborate sweets.

In the same video, Fieri said he would rather guests arrive slightly late than early so he can finish cooking in peace. He also said he prefers artificial Christmas trees because they are easier to manage during the busy season.

Fieri's comments resonated partly because they blended humor with conviction. Fans often celebrate his larger-than-life personality, but clips like these highlight the seriousness beneath the jokes. He may tease about “starting a fight,” yet the sentiment reflects his long-standing commitment to cooking with intention.

For Fieri, flavor begins long before food hits the pan. It begins with the choices cooks make. And if one of those choices involves a jar of pre-minced garlic, he is ready to speak up every single time.

Celine Song‘s throwback-to-the-1990s romantic dramedy “Materialists” premiered way back at the top of summer 2025. (A different time, am I right?) But the A24 release, which stars Dakota Johnson as a matchmaker torn between working-class ex-boyfriend Chris Evans and suave finance bro Pedro Pascal, is back in the conversation thanks to the Oscar race. And specifically, it's vying for placement among the Best Original Song shortlist being announced next weekend, for Japanese Breakfast's “My Baby (Got Nothing at All).”

As a refresher — with mild “Materialists” spoilers ahead — the song plays over the end credits as Lucy (Johnson) and John (Evans) tie the knot in Manhattan's city hall, in the same room where perfunctory marriages take place every day and also where Song and her husband, Justin Kuritzkes, had their nuptials. Depending on how empty or full the glass is feeling at that point, and whether you believe Lucy and John's relationship can survive their disparate views on money, you can read the film‘s final scene as hopeful or hopeless. And Japanese Breakfast's “My Baby,” penned by lead vocalist Michelle Zauner, is the perfect catchy bop to accompany that poetic ambiguity.

Grammy-nominated East Coast-originated indie band Japanese Breakfast started spinning lovelorn tales in 2013. Since then, the Korean-born singer lead singer has lost her mom, married her boyfriend, and wrote a book about it all called “Crying in H Mart.” (A film adaptation set up at MGM is currently on pause, and now without the originally attached Will Sharpe as director.) She's also released four albums with Japanese Breakfast, including the band's latest, “For Melancholy Brunettes (& Sad Women).” Speaking to IndieWire, Zauner said that writing “My Baby” proved an upbeat catharsis compared to crafting the somber sounds that make up that 10-track album.

 










Below, we discuss the writing process for “My Baby,” how Zauner's own romantic experiences connect to the movie, and the status of her “Crying in H Mart” movie.

This interview has been edited for length.

IndieWire: You and Celine Song are both millennials who aren't that many years apart, and both bring a Korean-American background to your work. Was “Materialists” your first meeting?

Michelle Zauner: Surprisingly, we never met up until this movie collaboration happened. I was a fan, and I think she had heard of my music before…. We first met on Zoom, and then I don't think we met in person until after the song [“My Baby (Got Nothing at All)”] was recorded, and the movie was put together, and she came to a show of mine. 

[She was] one of those people that you get along with right away. I have, many occasions in my life, met people that are millennials and Korean and artists, and it doesn't always happen. Just because all those things align doesn't mean you'll necessarily vibe. So it was really nice getting to meet her, because I think she's so brilliant, and also such a warm and fun person to get to hang out with.

Did you see the full script or a full cut of the movie before writing the song?

The movie was pretty much done. I was sent a screener, and it was the first time that I've ever watched a screener or gotten to be a part of a film process in this way. [Celine] was looking for a song for the end credits, which I thought was especially appealing because it kind of gave you full reign. You didn't really have to squeeze into a moment, and you weren't really responsible for pushing a viewer to feel a specific way beyond this almost summarizing feeling. It felt like I had more freedom getting to be a part of the end credit song than, maybe, if I had to insert myself into a really intense moment. 

 










I got to watch the full movie, and I really loved it. I just thought it was so modern, and it was something that I felt like was really missing from the zeitgeist. I just felt like it encompassed a lot of things that I've been thinking about as a 30-year-old woman, watching my friends go on dates and rue the current landscape.

You've been with the same person for over a decade. Does the long-term nature of your relationship color the way you look at this movie, or romantic comedies in general?

I don't want to speak out of turn, but I married very young. I married when I was 25, and it was kind of a rush situation where my mom — I wrote about this in my book [“Crying at H Mart”] — was sick and was going to die. [My boyfriend and I] had been dating for about a year and a half … We threw together a wedding in three weeks, and my mom was there, and it was a really beautiful ceremony. I was always kind of like, “Oh, we'll just get divorced if it doesn't work out. It's not a big deal.” We've been married for 11 years, and [originally] neither one of us had jobs, really, or any kind of financial security. And later, I learned that Celine and her husband actually married quite young as well, and that was something I was thinking a lot about, because my friends who are in their 30s and dating now, the things that they look out for [are] very different than the things that I considered when I was that age. My husband lived in a warehouse with, like, six roommates and had no windows and slept on a mattress on the ground, and at the time, I was just like, “He's hot, and that's all that matters.” And it worked out, because I feel like we really grew up together, and the things that what would be red flags for me now are things that we kind of learned together.

 










So I think that what Celine has to say about that kind of perspective — that this desire to not give up hope for falling in love [not be] something that's only for the wealthy class — we shouldn't be so pessimistic about it.

Did you write this song from the perspective of Dakota Johnson's character?

I'm thinking of myself in Lucy's position and her choice at the end of the film, and to me, the lyrics are this chorus of people giving her advice. “You should find someone who has a company.” “You should find someone who makes a living.” “You should find someone who makes some figures.” They're kind of cute ways of turning those pieces of advice on their head [and saying,] “My partner doesn't have these things, but he offers something else.”

Is there anything here that feels like a remnant of past work, or even a shred of an idea that you put a pin in from the past? This song is in the running for the Best Original Song Oscar, and one of the requirements is that songs have to be written anew for the film. 

[The song] came in a really great time, where I was just gearing up for my album cycle — this current album cycle “For Melancholy Brunettes (& Sad Women)” — and I had just written all these really melancholic, ethereal, contemplative, somber songs. I was excited to write something a bit more upbeat, something that was like a classic love song and felt good, after being, like, a very serious, type A artist about my record and, in the same breath, [wanting] to make something that I felt was clever and timeless. The only thing that carried over was I was using a lot of open D tuning on the last record, and that maybe my guitar had already been in that tuning and made its way onto the song.

 










I saw your Letterboxd four favorites. “Melancholia” was on there — not exactly a romantic comedy, but a personal favorite. What are your favorite romantic comedies or romantic dramedies?

If I were to do four romantic comedies, which I would say is my favorite genre … I love all Nora Ephron movies, but “When Harry Met Sally” I've maybe seen, like, 5,000 times. I really want to have a “When Harry Met Sally” party where we have apple pie à la mode with strawberry ice cream on the side and Katz's Deli, and we all wear the white sweater that Billy Crystal wore and play charades.

“Exorcist baby!”

I recently rewatched “Pride and Prejudice” with [Matthew Macfadyen]. (Celine is operating in that realm, to me — like a modern Austen tale.) That movie is so well done. And obviously, Ang Lee's “Sense and Sensibility” is so great. And I love anything Julia Roberts. I love “Notting Hill”; it's one of the few romantic comedies that you see largely from the male point of view. And “My Best Friend's Wedding” I love, too.

Do you play “My Baby” now as part of setlists unrelated to “Materialists” FYC performances?

Yeah, we do. I actually really love it. 

I think that people like the song, so it's so fun to perform, and sits in a sweet spot in my register. I think, because there were not a ton of upbeat songs on [my recent] record, it's been fun to incorporate it into the sets. I'm really proud of what we made.

 










It sounds like you spent a year writing a script for “Crying in H Mart,” an adaptation of your very personal memoir about watching your mother die. I'm sorry to hear the project is on hold, but did you learn anything about yourself or your own stamina in the process?

I learned a lot about the industry that makes a lot of sense to me now. It was a tough project because it was so personal, and this industry requires so much collaboration in order to make something happen. It costs so much money, and there's so much process involved and so many people involved. You cannot make a movie on your own in any way. That was interesting for me to witness and was challenging in ways that I expected and didn't expect.

Are you wanting it to move forward, or feeling like you can set it down for now?

I'm optimistic about it happening someday. I'm not interested in rushing; it's such a precious, personal story that I'd rather not make a movie than [make] a bad movie. And I love everyone that is involved and was involved in [helping it get] as far as it got, and would love to do it with the same people. But we're not in the midst of making it right now.

You're writing another book, though.

I'm currently writing my second book. It's also a memoir; I think it may be my last memoir. It's about the year I spent last year in Korea, learning the Korean language and going to school and living abroad and documenting that time.

December 11, 2025

KP Skywalka begins the standout “Hell or Not,” the penultimate track of I Tried to Tell You, by singing, “[What] am I supposed to do?” His voice cuts in and out like a hazy recollection and Erykah Badu's sampled voice plays alongside, like he's riding in the backseat of his mom's sedan. The southeast DC rapper's brief trip down memory lane with the '90s R&B of his youth gives way to asking his little homie if he's “ready to war up,” laughing at some rapper bragging about “guns that he never shot,” and getting wistful for the days when it was “just noodles and Spam.” Quasi-apocalyptic visions of his Beltway landscape rub up against tender musings, spilling out of KP with a possessed, drill-tinged flow. You get the sense that these moments are closer in his mind than they appear in the rearview.

KP's adherence to the DMV's blossoming drill style—punching in with breathless, rambling raps that spare no detail—has become more established even as he's tinkered with the boundaries of the subgenre. This year's 4 Tha Freakas and 2023's Rhythm N Bip approached X-rated, applying groovy R&B flips to player anthems that teemed with sordid accounts of spitting in her mouth and fucking every which way. Even when KP follows fellow scene members like Skino and SlimeGetEm toward more standard Free Car Music themes—morbid corner stories over ominously bouncy beats, like on 2023's Getting Right the EP—he remains an extremely adept narrator. His lines burst with personality, even if they can feel a tad one-note for long stretches (lyrical predictability being a common trap for this strain of drill).

I Tried to Tell You avoids monotony by bouncing around KP's musical styles and personal history with limitless energy. His roving narration isn't limited by regional rap convention: weaving together familial, emotional, and hustling memories in a production landscape that draws from the various roots of Black soul music tradition, the album is a proof of concept that demonstrates what it means to experiment in earnest within the DMV underground scene.

The 20-song tracklist, a departure from 4 Tha Freakas' brief onslaught of ballads, allows KP room to amble. His beat selection (with production also provided by Turn Me Up Pro, Yoyotheproducer, and Tavaras Jordan) feels as though it's meant to stitch together soulful touchstones of his childhood: crooning along to the warbling H-Town sample on opener “Industry” on the way to a Wizards game, or reaching into the record cabinet and choosing Anita Baker's voice to frame his soothing, plugg-infused linkup with 10kdunkin, “Nuntoloose.” DC's go-go tradition looms large in the way the drums titter underneath a funky, Wayne Shorter-esque saxophone sample on “VPN” as KP melds his delivery to the rhythm. The varied production coaxes out distinct styles: the angelic choral arrangement on “Streets Sing to Me” slows his raps to a crawl, while “A Drop Out” feels like a TLC 12"" (maybe something off FanMail) warped by heat and heartbreak.

Most often KP's nimble references and turns of phrase arrive under the cover of the hostile drill flow that's overtaken this kind of DMV street rap. But his style is steeped in the slow-crawl storytelling of the Southern rappers he listened to growing up, and the diligent way he constructs his world on I Tried to Tell You evokes Pimp C's meticulous autobiography on The Sweet James Jones Stories: Picture KP and his cousin speeding through red lights and goading each other to shoot up the deli (“Scared Like Steele”), or making it up and down the Northeast Corridor before sunrise (“Latenight”). He's got a hundred variations on the word “bip,” tossing it everywhere like parsley on an IG chef's channel. Sometimes his musings are routine (“I'm blowing up but I'm stuck in a warzone/Fuck is the bros on, let's get on Warzone”), or sound morbidly mundane (“I can talk about murder in music because I really done it”). But the continual tweaks to his diction allow simple phrases to escape tedium.

The tension between KP's inner sensitivity and the hardened shell he's formed to survive is the emotional crux of I Tried to Tell You. At the outset of “See My Wrongs,” his romantic optimism is potent: “Know it's some good in the nigga hope that she sees it,” he raps with clarity, before recounting step-by-step how he helped another friend reach his dreams of being a killer in the streets. On “Made It Out,” he remembers a successful headshot, then stutters over his words as he wonders if the pain of losing his own homies made him “d-depressing.” Even when paranoia and melancholy tinge his reflections on fatherhood and family in “Heaven Sing,” there's still room to fondly remember the neighborhood girl who popped out with a belly ring in the summertime. When his words contradict like this, KP often switches to a higher, sing-song register, as if he wants his truths to carry for miles—no matter if they line up on paper.

What keeps I Tried To Tell You alive and breathing is how clearly KP understands that thematic conventions are made to be broken, and how willing he is to follow his instincts. Gun ad-libs flow out of him in the background of “Itty” like he's arguing with himself on the track. He treats his collaboration with Skrilla like an away game, skating over calypso drums and sharing custody of their region's favorite word; he invites DC's Skino and Philly's Lil Hawa to take the reins for extended moments in the spotlight. When he returns to the player-anthem bars about stealing dudes' girls, it doesn't sound like a labored effort to maintain 4 Tha Freakas' momentum, but like he's recounting something that happened right before he waltzed into the studio. Each nugget is evidence that Free Car Music can retain its toughness and bite without sacrificing ingenuity and individual soul. I'm left hung up on KP's final words on closer “Pockets Flat,” which come after some musings on stacking cash and stomping opps: “Ain't see grandma in two months, like she want see my face,” he raps, with his voice edited to sound like it's somewhere off in the distance. The tightrope act goes on.

Vesper Sparrow opens with a declaration: “A stutter c-c-can be a musical instrument.” This was an epiphany for the Grenadian-Jamaican-American composer and artist JJJJJerome Ellis, and became the guiding principle of their work. At an early age, Ellis found liberation in the fluid sounds of the saxophone; speaking, by contrast, caused shame and discomfort. Ellis' stutter manifests as a glottal block, an involuntary pause in their speech. Eventually, Ellis learned to see these pauses as a source of possibility. In a social context, a block can lead to confusion or embarrassment, but in a musical setting that same pause can dilate time, create moments of intimacy, and open avenues for improvisation. Now, Ellis follows their stutter like a path through the wilderness, trusting it like true intuition.

Ellis calls their glottal blocks “clearings,” as in a suddenly open space in the middle of a forest path. Historically, clearings were places where enslaved African Americans could congregate and pray. Ellis explored the complex relationships between Blackness, speech dysfluency, and music on their excellent 2021 debut The Clearing (and in a research paper of the same name). That album—didactic yet inventive, intensely emotional while remaining rigorously intellectual—was like a manuscript bursting with ideas, brought to life with hip-hop, R&B, and jazz. Vesper Sparrow, Ellis' follow-up, is more focused but just as deep, a prose poem rather than a dissertation. Their focus now is on time: how a stutter can suspend time for both speaker and listener, and how bridging that gap can forge new connections.

Vesper Sparrow has a fraction of The Clearing's word count, allowing Ellis to show, rather than tell, how their theory informs their practice. Still, a bit of explanation is in order. As in Alvin Lucier's “I Am Sitting In A Room,” another piece that turns a stutter into an instrument, Ellis begins the four-part “Evensong” by telling us how they made it. “I made this music at MacDowell artist residency in spring of 2019. I'm listening to it as I speak,” they say. “The music you're hearing now I created using a process called [pause] granular synthesis.” The pause is filled with music: ecstatic saxophone, hammered dulcimer, and drifting vocals. Ellis goes on to describe how they split their original recording into snippets of sound called “grains,” and the music demonstrates this by disintegrating into isolated sounds that fall like raindrops at the beginning of a storm. On “Evensong, Part 2” Ellis gathers these grains and rearranges them into a flood—the sax now sailing over waves of distortion—then continues: “When I make a piece of music, the music [pause]...”

The structure of Vesper Sparrow, and the crux of Ellis' thesis, hinges on that pause. Like the earlier pause, it is filled with music—but this time, the gap comprises two-thirds of the album. The four parts of “Evensong” are interrupted—no, suspended—by two versions of the hymn “His Eye Is on the Sparrow,” in recognition of Ellis' upbringing in his reverend grandfather's church. On the title track, sparse piano accompanies Ellis' soulful voice as he sings, “Why should I feel discouraged?/And why should the shadows come?” Slowly, tentatively, a saxophone joins, fluttering like sparrows' wings. On “Savannah Sparrow,” Ellis takes the same hymn and stretches it into a 16-minute pipe organ drone in memory of their grandmother, who played the organ in church; over it, they play a powerful sax solo. Ellis has said that they stutter on the sax, too, which may account for their gripping presence with the instrument; each breath, each click of the keys, feels as patient and considered as a loving conversation.

“...[pause] passes through me. It's a seed I plant. The seed grows, mostly unobserved,” Ellis says at the beginning of “Evensong, Part 3,” resuming their earlier thought. It's a simple trick, but it feels like time travelling: The journey that we've taken through Ellis' religious past is contained in a single glottal block. This is the possibility of the clearing as a space for meditation, connection, and prayer. Ellis finishes his explanation of granular synthesis by describing “grains” as pollen, though his grains are carried “not by wind … but by the silence that authorizes and protects all music.” If the structure of Vesper Sparrow is based on a block, so too is the method of “Evensong.” Granular synthesis separates tiny bits of sound with silence, like myriad clearings that introduce infinite possibilities. “Evensong, Part 4” celebrates these possibilities with piano, dulcimer, vocals, flute, and saxophone playing in exuberant loops, savoring every repetition.

Ellis often tells a story to illustrate the potential of a clearing: Once, after they had finished ordering at a restaurant, they blocked when asked to give their name. The cashier simply waited, unbothered, encouraging, caring. Maybe the employee didn't realize it, but they were performing together, and Ellis' instrument was their stutter. Vesper Sparrow shows what can happen in such moments: The world slows down, opens up, and becomes a bit more beautiful.

The official trailer for The Moment, the new A24 movie starring and conceived by Charli XCX, is here. Following last month's teaser, the trailer further explores the movie's light satire of the Brat era, in which Charli clings to reason amid a whirlwind of bad advice and unscrupulous interlopers. Among them are a goofball live-show director played by Alexander Skarsgård—at one point, he instructs her to hide inside a giant lighter while the crew maintains a wide perimeter—as well as various friends, suits, and influencers, played by the likes of Kylie Jenner, Rachel Sennott, Rosanna Arquette, Kate Berlant, Hailey Benton Gates, and Jamie Demetriou. Watch the trailer below.

Directed by Aidan Zamiri, The Moment is one of three Charli XCX films showing at Sundance Film Festival, which runs from from January 22 to February 1, 2026. (The other two are Olivia Wilde's The Gallerist and Gregg Araki's I Want Your Sex.) The Moment hits theaters everywhere on January 30.

F
ix your fuckin' self!” Tate McRae demands, her hips circling, dark-blond hair flipping. The Canadian pop star is onstage at Madison Square Garden in New York, performing her new breakup anthem “Tit for Tat” to a sold-out crowd of roughly 15,000 fans. She's wearing cherry-red micro shorts, a matching bra — the same shade that Britney Spears wore in the “Oops! … I Did It Again” video — and black knee socks. She joyfully skips down the catwalk and smiles before resuming her fierce, kinetic choreography, throwing her head back, tossing each leg out to the side in a lunge, her abs glistening with sweat. Toward the peak of the song, pyro explosions go off, timed to the exact second that McRae and her backup dancers all toss their hands into the air. The crowd is transfixed, screaming while they document the entire show on their phones. They just about lose their minds when McRae plays her hit “Sports Car” in the encore, as she crawls on all fours before doing a standing split in a chair (in the ballet world, they call that a penché).

	











	These fans, adorably called Tater Tots, are all dressed in micro shorts too — theirs are predominantly leopard print — and jerseys with “T8” on the back. Many of them are here because they've grown up with McRae, having followed her since she began posting viral videos of her songs back in 2017. But the person they're worshipping is someone else entirely. Onstage is Tatiana, McRae's alter ego — a badass, sexy, fearless superstar who has been sneakily dominating the pop world all year, one freakishly flexible dance move at a time. 




	Her dance-pop gems are simultaneously club-ready and packed with introspective lines about womanhood. They're also the kind of songs that can make you lose all inhibitions, if you let them. “I started to black out onstage and become this person that I couldn't explain, nor could my family or my friends, and I needed a reason for it,” McRae says of Tatiana. “And I think it helps me grasp the strange theory of why I'm not nervous in front of 15,000 people, and why I can be nervous at a dinner party with four people.”

	I'm sitting down with Dinner Party Tate when she tells me this, although technically we're at lunch, inside the swanky restaurant Dante, on the ninth floor of a Beverly Hills hotel. A month has passed since that show at Madison Square Garden — which, by the way, was her third time selling out the iconic arena this year, part of her Miss Possessive Tour, which stretched for 88 dates and grossed $111 million. We're sitting on the terrace, staring out at gloomy clouds that briefly provide rain, right when the pianist starts to wade through “Yesterday,” by the Beatles, a band McRae has been listening to recently. She gazes at the hills and palm trees from behind her tortoise-shell eyeglasses, which she notes are not prescription. “I feel like we just entered heaven,” she says, taking a sip of her Diet Coke.


	McRae is wearing a Sex Pistols sweatshirt (“I don't know what it is,” she admits) and white sweatpants with brown paint splattered across. A black Chanel handbag sits by her feet, which are sporting silver Ghost Sprint Adidas. The hair that's constantly inspiring online tutorials is currently tucked away, in a slicked-back bun. She has minimal makeup on, trying not to inflame the acne she's self-conscious about (she's considering trying Accutane). “I've had piles of makeup on my face the last nine months, and then I got acne all of the sudden,” she says. “I've never had acne in my life. I think it's hormones, too. My body's like, ‘Where are you?'”


	McRae has lived here in Southern Cali­fornia for six years, but is mostly based in New York now, having bought an apartment in Manhattan over the summer. She doesn't want to shit on Los Angeles, but says she feels like a lost alien when she's here. Her fridge is empty, and most of her clothes have been shipped to the East Coast, so she was worried about her wardrobe for our interview. “I literally was like, ‘I look insane!'” she says. “I was like, ‘I'm going to show up, and she's going to be like, What the fuck is she wearing?'”

	This is what it's like to hang with the real Tate McRae, a 22-year-old Alberta native, born the same year as the pumpkin-spice latte. (This is fitting, because she loves the holiday season: “I believe fall and Christmas is so special,” she confides to me later.) She's nibbling on sourdough and talking about how she wants to take up baking, and how she has to get blood work later today. “My mom was like, ‘You've never gotten your blood work done before,'” she says, “and I was like, ‘That's really scary, I should do that.'” She couldn't be more different from the pop star who, 48 hours from now, will be referenced on Saturday Night Live (a familiar stage for McRae, who has been the show's musical guest twice in the past two years). But she has no problem with that duality. In fact, she embraces it.


	“It's so funny,” she says. “Tate is this very introspective, very sensitive, very introverted, awkward Canadian. Maybe more on the shy side. I'm observant, and I feel very internal, all the time. And then, this persona that I've created is my way of being this confident pop girl. The contrast between the two is such a great way of showing how a person can be so multifaceted.”

	











	“I definitely get to see both sides,” says her frequent collaborator Amy Allen, who has also written hits with Sabrina Carpenter, Selena Gomez, Harry Styles, and more. “We're sitting on the floor and it's very intimate, and we're really digging into her innermost heartfelt, hard experiences. And then there's moments, even within the same song sometimes, where she'll just stand up after having said something so heartbreaking, and she'll, like, do a spin and some choreo in the corner. The fact that those two people exist in the same body is so unique.”


	I'm meeting McRae at the tail end of a wildly successful year. Before starting the grueling Miss Possessive Tour, the singer released her third album, So Close to What, in February. It debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200, knocking Drake and PartyNextDoor's $ome $exy $ongs 4 U out of the top spot (coincidentally, that album features “Small Town Fame,” on which Drake sings, “Bitch, I feel like Tate McRae”). McRae went on to perform at the VMAs in September, and released “Just Keep Watching,” off the F1 soundtrack album, which earned a Grammy nomination — her first — for Best Dance Pop Recording. In November, a week after we meet up in Los Angeles, she will release the deluxe edition of her album, cheekily titled SO CLOSE TO WHAT???.


	And so, as raindrops sprinkle down and the pianist launches into Billy Joel's “Vienna,” how is McRae feeling right now? “Physically, exhausted,” she says. “Mentally, the most myself I've felt in six years.”


	WHEN MCRAE DOES HAVE to be in California, she likes to take evening drives to the ocean, listening to music with the windows down. “I'm such a sucker for nighttimes on the beach, the moon and the water,” she says. “It's so water sign of me, but I really feel connected, and I can dream and manifest there.”

	











	She often returns to something that the French diarist Anaïs Nin once wrote: “I'm restless. Things are calling me away. My hair is being pulled by the stars again.” Quoting that line, she says it defined “the vibe” of her entire year — and the concept of the deluxe album's visuals. “I was feeling like I was getting pulled by this external force,” she says, “and I needed the deluxe to feel like that.” She brings this image to life on the album cover, where she is seen lying on a beach at dusk, wearing a mahogany sarong. Her right arm is leaning on a rock, while her left fingers are gripping the sand. “It's very ethereal and mystical,” she says.


	McRae was inspired to write the So Close to What deluxe material — five new songs, including “Tit for Tat” — after she toured Europe. She knew she had a vision for it, when she made her phone screen saver an image of a glowing angel. “When I was sitting in my dressing room every single day, bored out of my mind, I realized just how magical creating music is, and how I get to literally be a real-life fairy and angel,” she says. Angels made their way into the deluxe, particularly on the shimmering track “Nobody's Girl,” where she sings lines from a poem she wrote: “And when I ask, the angels sing/They say, ‘Real love doesn't clip your wings.'” That motif extends to the trippy video, where McRae dons angel wings, like a Gen Z version of Claire Danes in Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet.


	When she wasn't performing in Europe, McRae spent her time reading poetry, journaling, and listening to a lot of Lana Del Rey (“That was the soundtrack to my life,” she says), wandering around parks in Prague, or sitting by a lake for six hours in Zurich. She'd stay up late, usually until 6 a.m., just thinking. Looking back, it might have been an existential crisis. “I had been traveling so much, and I felt like I was spreading myself thin, and I had no idea what was going on in my core,” she says. “I was going through a lot emotionally.”


	She's referring to her breakup with the Kid Laroi, the Australian musician she had been dating since early 2024. Despite McRae telling me that I can ask her anything, she tenses up when I inquire about their split, which she confirms happened in June. She released “Tit for Tat” three months later, and it's been widely speculated to be a response track to Laroi's “A Cold Play.” Laroi sings “Fix you, I wish I could,” while McRae keeps it simple and spicy: “Fix your fuckin' self!” It's a far cry from “I Know Love,” the So Close to What cut Laroi guested on just a few months earlier, where McRae likens falling for someone to drugs. The internet erupted when “Tit for Tat” dropped; suddenly, lots of adults cared about a twentysomething pop star's relationship, and it weirded out McRae deeply.


	“It was really scary and overwhelming,” she tells me over lunch. “I would never talk that way, even about my friends' lives. I didn't realize how much it would affect me, the public knowing my private life — because no one knows the full story of anything, ever. I also hate people painting a situation that's worse than it is. But what I've had to realize is that he's going to write songs and I'm going to write songs, and that's our way of expressing ourselves. That's our art, that's our job. And once it's out there, it's not mine anymore.”

	











	One person who can relate to this is Taylor Swift, who praised “Tit for Tat” while promoting The Life of a Showgirl, telling Jimmy Fallon that she listens to the kiss-off track with “full volume, over and over again on repeat.” When I bring this up to McRae, she says, “My mom is so witchy. She said the week before, ‘I feel like Taylor Swift is in your ether right now.' And I was like, ‘What? That's so random.' I'm such a massive fan, and I adore her. So when I pulled up my phone and saw that she had talked about it, it was one of the coolest moments ever. She is such an inspiration for me as a writer and, obviously, as a woman in the industry. For her to acknowledge that was really special.”


	McRae's mom, Tanja Rosner, isn't the only witchy one in the family. Not only did McRae famously predict the 2025 Super Bowl — she got the final score and the winning team exactly right — she also describes herself as “the most woo-woo person ever.” She regularly sees healers, one of whom is her friend's aunt. “She will see who's attached to you or what energies have stuck to you, which is really important,” she says. “You can carry on 10 people's energies and be depressed, and they cleanse all that.”


	The day before our lunch, McRae consulted a psychic, who told her she might get married at 28. When I ask her if she wants this to happen, she says “Maybe.” “I believe in manifesting so hard,” she adds. “I believe your physical field can change at any second if you change your vibration towards it. And I believe everything happens for a reason. Everyone has a fate and a life that is already painted out for them, and if you want something, it's already there. Maybe that's unrealistic optimism, but I think it's a beautiful way to look at life.”


	Swift isn't the only one listening to McRae on repeat; within the first 48 hours the deluxe songs were out, I heard them everywhere — on the streets of Manhattan, in my Pilates studio, on subway trains. This is particularly true for the savage “Anything But Love,” where McRae doubles down on her bitterness (“My dad hates you, my dog hates you, my brother hates you, and I do too”), and even recruits her alter ego for support: “And if you hate me, then why you keep on jacking off to Tatiana?”

	











	“There's a part of my writing that's funny,” McRae says, crediting her co-writer Julia Michaels with bringing out that side of her. “That was written from a place of strength and empowerment, and that fearlessness when you're in a studio and when you're joking about things. When you're like, ‘I will never ever release this,' is usually when you find gold.”


	But there's also a lot of heartache here, particularly on the highlight “Nobody's Girl.” McRae celebrated her birthday on July 1, in the aftermath of her breakup, and she reflects on turning a year older during this confusing time, singing, “At 22, it's a little sad/But it's fun.” She digs even deeper on the melancholic, R&B-tinged “Horseshoe,” where she confesses, “I'm not a pop star when I'm all alone.” 


	That line is no joke, she says. “I was feeling so strange, because I was experiencing things that I'd wished for my whole life. Playing shows and getting to exist in this career makes me feel like the luckiest girl on the planet. And I was not letting myself be sad, because I can't live a life like this and be sad. That song is about how I feel so grateful, but I feel like I've never felt more alone and more alienated from everything. When all the makeup and clothes come off, it's just you in your bedroom. You're like, ‘OK, who am I?' And that's a really daunting thought. I'm just an insecure, sensitive person who has to figure out what she wants.”


	When McRae moved to Manhattan in July, she brought the deluxe songs to Electric Lady Studios, during her first week as an official New Yorker. “That was maybe the longest time we had gone in a while without working and seeing each other,” says Allen. “She came in with such a new invigorated energy. Like when you see a friend and you're like, ‘Oh, something just happened, and you're ready to go.' Even though it's the deluxe, I think it's the beginning of Tate's next chapter.”


	McRae titled the initial album So Close to What because it reflected how she felt amid her burgeoning fame: being on the verge of something new without knowing what it is, and at times wondering if she was losing her sense of self. She explores this on the deluxe opener, “Trying on Shoes,” a slow-burner about grappling with her identity. “It's the idea of trying on different people and different versions of yourself,” she says. “Especially on tour, it was me finding myself in a position of feeling so heartbroken and not knowing how to get over that, and feeling like I had to try on anybody else's personality or body to feel good about myself. Putting on this mask to feel like I'm not fucking heartbroken onstage right now.”


	McRae titled the deluxe SO CLOSE TO WHAT??? because she's still wrestling with this question. “The intensity feels ramped up,” she says. “It was crisis mode for a little bit — more painful than the album. And I haven't gotten any further in my answer to my question ‘So close to what?' I'm feeling it more intensely now. Nothing has been solved.”


	But that's not entirely true. McRae has seemingly healed from her heartbreak, and gives an honest, deeply vulnerable response when I ask her how she looks back on it. “I'm a very reminiscent person,” she says. “When someone's in your life for a long time, I'll never, ever, ever forget them, or not feel them. I feel every person who's ever been in my life. I love, love, love people, and I want to make sure they're always good. That's a hard thing, when breakups happen, not knowing when someone's good or not. But we'll see what happens in time.”


	WHEN I FIRST MEET MCRAE at the deluxe-album photo shoot in October, it's two days after the Madison Square Garden show. Her mom introduces herself, as does McRae's entire team, which includes her new creative directors, Ludovic de Saint Sernin and Ignacio Muñoz, who have dressed Miley Cyrus, Lindsay Lohan, and others. In addition to the beachy sarong look, she poses in several outfits, including a white beaded minidress she worries is too flapper (I assure her it's not). Her crew encourages her every few minutes, shouting “Stunning!” and “Yas!” to the extent that I begin to worry that I should also be hyping her up. Standing in front of the camera, McRae poses a question: “What's our story here?”

	











	McRae loves a good story. She would tell them to herself as a child dancer, to mentally prepare for competitions. “I would write essays on what my story was, like such a fucking nerd,” she says. “I would sit in my room and I'd be like, ‘Here's my whole story of who I am and how I feel: I'm a young girl who is distressed by her parents.' And then it would go into my two-minute solo at a competition.”


	McRae was born in Calgary in 2003 to Rosner and Todd McRae. Todd is a lawyer, while Rosner is a dance instructor, which inspired McRae to start training at the age of six. “I was like, ‘Put me in, coach. I'm obsessed with this,'” she recalls. “My mom's my fairy godmother,” she says. “She believes anything is possible, and I think that's why I've gotten where I've gotten. If I wanted to drop everything right now and become a dentist, I could. She'd be like, ‘Hell, yeah. You're awesome.'”


	McRae would wake up at 6 a.m. and get home at 9 p.m., spending 40 hours a week at the dance studio, dabbling in everything from modern to ballet, while her older brother, Tucker, played hockey. “I was just constantly training, in and out of school, homeschooling, not homeschooling. We just were such passionate kids that we were just working all the time.”


	McRae attended the training school for the Alberta Ballet company and competed in dance competitions every weekend. In 2016, she moved to Los Angeles for two months to join the cast of So You Think You Can Dance: The Next Generation, performing on live television every Monday to millions of viewers. “I felt like a full-blown adult, living my professional dance career at 12, and that sounds insane now to think,” she says. “We were getting judged. It was the first time I was exposed to criticism.” She ended up placing third on the show; later, she contemplated moving to Germany to train at the Berlin State Ballet.


	McRae knew she wanted to dance in some capacity, whether she was a ballerina, a backup dancer in L.A., or a member of a modern company. She also went beyond dance, doing voice-over for an animated children's show called Lalaloopsy. “When I was younger, I did so many things,” she says. “I was just a fucking menace. I was attacking everything I could possibly attack. One side quest was doing pas de deux [a dance duet]. I was just like, ‘Wow. I really wanted everything.'”

	











	But with time, she began to only want one particular thing. As a preteen, McRae was active on YouTube, uploading videos of her dancing (and covering John Lennon's “Imagine” at the ripe age of eight). By 2017, she was posting videos of songs she'd written, in a series she called Create With Tate. In one video, a 14-year-old McRae appears in front of her keyboard in a burgundy velvet pullover, her silver hoop earrings peeking out from under her hair. “If you guys do not know, I'm a singer, and I love to write songs,” she says. “I've really found that it's something I truly love to do. So, yeah, this song that I'm about to sing for you guys is something that I whipped up last night in, like, an hour.” (Her parents, she jokes, were three feet away from her: “They were like, ‘You're such a loser! Go have friends!' And I'm sitting at home, making love songs.”)


	That video, for the somber ballad “One Day,” launched McRae's career. Suddenly, the first song she'd ever written began to attract a wide audience (it now has more than 42 million views). Despite finding these old videos cringey, McRae won't delete them. “I've learned to accept that that's what got me somewhere,” she says. “There's something endearing about it.”


	Labels came calling, and McRae signed with RCA in 2019. The stormy “You Broke Me First” arrived a year later, when McRae was 16, and went viral on TikTok. She moved to L.A. and completed high school online. In 2022, she released her first full-length album, I Used to Think I Could Fly. Though the album proved McRae was capable of more than just TikTok moments, it shows her navigating her sound in real time, dipping her toes into bedroom pop and club bangers. She ended up working with so many different producers — from Greg Kurstin to Finneas — that the result lacks cohesion.


	“Everyone was in my ear like, ‘This is who you need to be, and these are the songs you need to write,'” she says. “I needed to recalibrate and figure out where I wanted to go with my career.”


	In 2023, she had an epiphany. “I'm going to be a dancing pop star,” she told herself. “I will make this happen.” Up until then, she'd never considered merging her dancing and musical sides. “I had this expressive-dancer side that felt like such a different part of me than the writer side. I didn't think that they could coexist.”


	To prepare, McRae became a student of pop culture, immersing herself in music she'd missed out on during her dancing career. “I had spent so many years in dance history, watching Fred Astaire and ballerinas like Sylvie Guillem,” she says. “When I hopped into the music industry, I was like, ‘What the fuck is this? I don't know any of this.' It opened up a whole new world.” She watched “every single pop video ever”: Beyoncé tearing through “Get Me Bodied” at the 2007 BET Awards, Madonna's documentaries, Lady Gaga's “Paparazzi” moment at the 2009 VMAs, a performance so iconic that McRae says it reshaped her brain chemistry. “You start to see pop stars as superheroes,” she says.

	











	McRae's dancing and vocals — sometimes associated with the “cursive” style, a vowel-heavy technique — often get her comparisons to another pop star: Britney Spears. Some fans are desperate to see her star as the pop icon in a biopic, but when I ask McRae if she'd be into that, she demurs. “I need to take an acting lesson before I'd even consider ever doing anything,” she says. “And also, I feel like I look nothing like her or sound nothing like her, so I don't know if I'd be a great fit.”


	Tate McRae the Pop Star made her first appearance on the hypnotic “Greedy,” released in September 2023. In the sporty video, McRae is seen dancing in a hockey rink, doing splits at the front desk and riding around on a Zamboni. It's very Canadian — only anything but awkward. She essentially runs the place, tossing her hair back, dangling her diamond heels in the air, and sucking on a lollipop, leading a crew of dancers through the locker room as she charges through the halls, thrashing her hips and flashing her abs. “I feel it changed people's perspective on who I was,” she says. Allen, who co-wrote the song with McRae, Ryan Tedder, and Jasper Harris, agrees: “Once ‘Greedy' came out, it felt like the world was her oyster, and people were falling head over heels,” she says. “That cemented her as this powerhouse to the world.”


	“Greedy” peaked at Number Three on the Billboard Hot 100, and McRae followed it up with the equally addictive “Exes.” Both were featured on 2023's Think Later, the album that signaled her arrival — and the dawn of Tatiana. “I get onstage, and this beast unlocks,” she says. “If I ever felt horrible or had a bad day, I would just be like, ‘Well, OK, I don't need to be myself. I can just be her.'”


	IN JANUARY 2025, a month before its official release, a batch of demos for So Close to What leaked — along with more than 600 other songs of McRae's, some of which date back to when she was 12. It's unclear how it happened, but McRae was devastated. “Ninety percent of those songs are awful,” she says. “They're all personal things that I have grown up with, and my style and taste have changed, so it's so vulnerable. It's like having your whole phone released. It made me want to go into a hole and not do anything ever again.”


	But McRae made light of the situation, releasing a “Leak this” T-shirt (the Tater Tots, steadfast in their dedication, refused to listen to the album until its official release last February). “The only way you can move on from things is try to flip it on its head and look at it as a blessing in disguise,” she says. “That's the only way to navigate through this career, because those things happen all the time. Like, ‘All right, this sucks. How can I use this to my advantage?'”


	She had the same outlook in November, when a video of her accidentally singing into an upside-down microphone onstage blew up online, leading to speculation that she was lip-synching (like many pop acts, McRae sings live over a backing track). Days later, she posted a TikTok of her belting the So Close to What gem “Purple Lace Bra” with the caption “Cuz apparently I don't sing in my shows,” followed by a smiley face.

	











	“I think there's just so much that gets misconstrued online,” she tells me. “You have to have humor with it, otherwise you would go insane. It's just funny because I've put so much effort into my shows and am really impassioned about singing the whole time, unless I'm obviously walking or doing a dance break, as any person does in their shows. I sang two seconds later, and they cut the whole clip off. I'm just like, ‘Oh, this is a joke. There's nothing I can do to defend this, because there's too many things to defend.'” (Asking if she'd ever ban phones to prevent viral videos like this, McRae says she'd consider it for future shows.)


	Another thing McRae had to defend: her work with the problematic country superstar Morgan Wallen, who featured her on his sultry single “What I Want” in May 2025. The duet appeared on Wallen's album I'm the Problem, and it became her first chart-topping hit. Wallen has received backlash for using a racial slur in 2021, throwing a chair off the roof of a Nashville bar in 2024, and other incidents — and though he's become more massively popular in recent years, McRae came in for her share of criticism for collaborating with him.


	When I ask McRae about the controversy, she tells me about her lifelong love of country music, which stems from the annual Calgary Stampede in her hometown. “Honestly, country music is huge where I'm from,” she says. “My brother's always been a rabid country-music fan. I've always wanted, at some point in my life, to do folk music or country, and I probably still will in the future. But I honestly just got the opportunity to do a country song, and I was like, ‘Oh, this is cool.' And I wanted to cross genres really bad. It was just about the song for me. I didn't realize how much a song would be connected to all the other factors, and it really shocked me.”


	McRae stresses that she never met Wallen in person, but she doesn't regret their duet. “I don't think you should regret anything in life, because it gives you so much clarity,” she says. “I think controversy and criticism is a way of learning and figuring out what you want to move forward with, and how that shapes you as a person. I think it's all important.”


	It's a response that's both honest and unapologetic, and I can't tell if it's coming from Tate or Tatiana. Perhaps it's both, and the entities aren't as separate as McRae thinks. This is most evident on “Purple Lace Bra,” which she co-wrote with Allen and Emile Haynie. It's a seductive stunner on the surface, but it's layered with deeper meaning, as McRae describes how feeling confident — and wearing provocative clothing that empowers her — can lead to being shamed by the media. “You only listen when I'm undressed,” she sings on the bridge.

	











	“People always want girls to put themselves out there. And the second they do, they get ripped apart for it,” she says. “I was feeling sexual and confident for the first time in my life, and then I would release something and feel sexualized, and feel like all of my work and effort was taken away from me. The scrutiny towards women is getting worse and worse. It's just wild that people pay so much attention to us girls for little things that a man wouldn't be scrutinized for.


	“And they're not thinking about the great things that are happening onstage,” she continues. “They're not thinking about their vocals, or the way that they're performing or putting themselves out there or being vulnerable, spreading a very specific message. They're thinking about what shorts they're wearing, or what their makeup looks like, and that's annoying.”


	McRae always looks forward to performing “Purple Lace Bra,” particularly that line in the bridge. “I see the girls in the front row screaming that,” she says. “It gives me full-body chills because I'm just like, ‘Oh, we're all experiencing this. This is not just me. It's everybody who feels this frustrating feeling that it's gone on for so fucking long.'”


	For Allen, this kind of deeply relatable songwriting is part of McRae's appeal. “Tate is the most obvious triple threat I've ever seen, in terms of songwriting, vocals, and dancing,” she says. “I feel like she's a god in real life. But honestly, a huge reason why it's so easy for the world to fall in love with her is because she's just a kind, humble, real person. She feels like one of my sisters when I meet up with her, and I just want to spend more time with her. Which is how I feel like her listeners are, too. They're like, ‘I just want to have her in my ears all the time.'”


	The most devoted Tater Tots get to attend McRae's VIP soundchecks before every show, watching her perform one song acoustic, whether it's from her catalog or a cover — from Coldplay's “Fix You” to Sabrina Carpenter's “Don't Smile.” Backstage before showtime, she's often listening to podcasts, getting her makeup done, meditating, and having a cold brew with almond milk.

	











	She tried to take care of her body on tour, rarely drinking, taking trips to the sauna, doing Pilates (she also likes celebrity fitness coach Tracy Anderson), and getting lymphatic drainage massages. But at some shows she'd be sick or exhausted, sometimes with her period, and she'd perform on antibiotics and steroids. For the last nine shows, she was completely burned out. “I feel like I've been hit by a bus a little bit,” she says. “My body has no idea how to comprehend what just happened.”


	McRae needs time to process her giant tour — and her huge 2025. “It's interesting to see where I'm at now, compared to when I started writing the album last September. I don't even recognize that person. I feel I've aged 10 years in the past year.”

	She plans to spend 2026 hanging with friends, the “hearty, grounded girls and gays,” and being single. “I'm really bad at flirting,” she says. “No apps. That stuff literally gives me a heart attack, and thinking about meeting people makes me nauseous.” At the very least, she's going to relax. “I hope that she just sits on a couch for a couple of weeks, personally,” jokes Allen.


	What does the future hold for McRae? She might release a Miss Possessive Tour documentary, or publish a book of poetry. But when I ask her about decades from now, and if she sees herself still onstage in her seventies, singing “Sports Car,” she's not so sure. “Hopefully there's a cap and then I peace out, move to Italy, and just chill,” she says. “I hope that's what I do.”

	Picture this: You moved to the United States as a teenager. You're not a citizen, but you served your country. You were wounded in combat, and you came home to rebuild. You settled down, got married, found a good job. You're in the process of becoming a citizen. You go to the Department of Veterans Affairs for a routine check-up — maybe new glasses, a hearing test, the usual. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is waiting, ready to remove you from the nation you call home, where you raised a family, that you put your life on the line to serve.


	This isn't fiction. It's becoming reality at the VA. The administration has already begun deporting veterans, and even military spouses directly from U.S. bases, and just when you think they could not sink any lower, the agency is now directing offices to rat out any noncitizen employees or any noncitizens affiliated with the VA, including veterans.


	A memo issued late last month, written by VA Chief of Staff Christopher Syrek and ordered by VA Secretary Doug Collins, commands every VA office nationwide to compile a list of all noncitizen “full-time and part-time employees, contractors, health professional trainees, and volunteers” by December 30. The list will then be delivered to the VA's Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness and forwarded up the chain. “Anyone who is not authorized to be in the U.S.,” a VA spokesperson told the military outlet Stars and Stripes, “will be dealt with accordingly.”

	











	In Donald Trump's Washington, “dealt with accordingly” regarding noncitizens usually means only one thing: ICE.

	











	The Guardian indeed reported that the VA is building a database of noncitizens, with the VA confirming to the outlet that it will share data with other agencies, in part for immigration enforcement purposes. In a statement to Rolling Stone, the Press Secretary Pete Kasperowicz denied the VA is creating a “database,” but noted that the department is “required by federal law to continuously vet all employees and affiliates, such as unpaid researchers and others who may have access to VA data or systems, to ensure they meet the federal government's trusted workforce standards,” which is why the directive to out noncitizens was issued.

	For a department already facing a massive shortage of doctors and nurses, this is yet another self-destructive policy disguised as national security. The VA claims identifying noncitizens this is routine “continuous vetting.” But the federal “trusted workforce” program does not require list-making by citizenship status. Nor does it mention immigration status at all. This isn't workforce modernization. This is a dragnet aimed at scooping up noncitizens with any ties to the VA.


	Worse, many of the people whose names will end up on that list are veterans themselves. More than 100,000 military veterans lack citizenship. Thousands more are lawful permanent residents. The VA employs around 450,000 people, over a quarter of which are veterans, according to the Pew Research Center. This doesn't include the thousands of contractors and other affiliated workers that will also be subject to the VA's new memo, many of which are also surely veterans.


	These men and women fought in Iraq, Afghanistan, Panama, Vietnam, and elsewhere in conflicts stretching back decades. You don't need to imagine how the second Trump administration treats them. Just look at the record.


	ICE has been snatching and detaining veterans ever since Trump retook office. Julio Torres, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq, was detained by ICE at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport earlier this year after returning home from visiting family in Mexico. ICE also tried to deport Army veteran Jose Barco, a Purple Heart recipient wounded in an IED blast, after he served his sentence for a crime rooted in untreated trauma (Venezuela refused to take him). Sixty-one-year-old veteran Sae Joon Park lived in the U.S. since childhood, but was forced to self-deport this year after ICE threatened to detain him. Three months ago in Georgia, a noncitizen veteran named Godfrey Wade was snatched up during a traffic stop for not using a blinker. His family still has no idea how he is doing. “He wasn't born in this country, and still, he loves this country enough that he signed up to serve it,” his fiance told a local CBS affiliate. “Fifty years later, when he needs this country, this country is turning its back on him.”

Every foreign medical resident, every immigrant nurse, every noncitizen researcher treating PTSD, cancer, and traumatic brain injury. The immigrant who is grateful for an opportunity to make it America, humbly working in the kitchen of a VA hospital. Imagine the knock-on effect: widespread fear, resignations, unfilled jobs, delayed appointments, worse care.


	As our public institutions seem to grow more fascist by the day, any veteran or non-veterans proudly shouting “I voted for this!” should be asking themselves one question: Who will stand up for me when it's my turn?

	Aspiring country singer Alexis Wilkins has been outfitted with an elite SWAT security detail and enjoyed a romantic “date night” with Patel on taxpayers' dime. Now, new streaming data obtained by Rolling Stone shows significant boosts to her streams whenever Patel is making headlines.


	Streams for the little-known 27-year-old Nashville artist have increased 48 percent in the past year, coinciding with Patel going from a podcaster to the head of one of the country's top law-enforcement agencies. And whenever Patel finds himself at the center of a news cycle, there's a corresponding surge of people tuning in to Wilkins' music, according to music data provider Luminate and viewed by Rolling Stone. 


	Patel has praised his girlfriend as a “country-music sensation” and justified the highly unusual move to provide security to a non-spouse of a government official by claiming Wilkins has faced hundreds of death threats related to her newfound publicity. 

	











	The couple met three years ago in Nashville, with Wilkins telling Megyn Kelly that she was drawn to the then-director of Trump Media & Technology Group's integrity and honesty. “We both are very patriotic, so obviously there are things there that we definitely agree on,” she said. Patel, 45, has similarly heaped praise on his “partner in life,” calling her a “true patriot.” 


	Wilkins has been making music for more than a decade, building up a small fanbase mainly through gigs around Nashville. After a string of singles, she released her first EP, Grit, through Saddle Up Records in April 2023. After graduating from Belmont University in 2020, where she studied business and political science, Wilkins became more active in right-wing politics. She said a wake-up call came while she was in college, when she received an “F” in a class because she believed the professor was punishing her for  her conservative beliefs. 

	











	A few years later, she began giving away Constitutions for the Fourth of July, became a contributor to the conservative nonprofit group PragerU, spoke about the RNC for Newsmax, opened a show for Trumpworld favorite Lee Greenwood, and started singing at Turning Point USA-affiliated events. In late 2023, she stopped posting music to her Rumble account — except for her single “I Want My Country Back” — and pivoted to political commentary. She's also a spokeswoman for the American Border Story, which describes itself as “uncovering the truth behind the immigration crisis.”

	But Wilkins has been simultaneously pushing her music career, which hit new levels this year — 508,000 streams across all online platforms to date versus 343,000 last year, according to Luminate — coinciding with Patel's public-facing role in the administration. 


	Typically, Wilkins hovers between 4,500 and 7,000 weekly listeners, or a median of 6,300 streams each week, according to Luminate. But after a beaming Wilkins stood beside Patel at his swearing-in ceremony in February, that number skyrocketed to 105,300 streams, dovetailing to 17,400 and 10,600 streams in the following two weeks. 


	Wilkins' numbers plateaued between 6,000 and 7,000 streams until around July 4, when Patel was scrutinized for a joint DOJ and FBI memo saying there was no evidence of a “client list” in the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein files. Online social media accounts began amplifying baseless conspiracy theories that Patel was compromised, accusing Wilkins of being a Mossad “honeypot” to manipulate Patel. (Wilkins adamantly denied the “insanely ridiculous” accusations, and has filed at least three defamation lawsuits against those who made the claim.) During the height of the backlash against Patel and the amplification of the accusation, Wilkins' music streams peaked at 43,600 weekly listeners.

	She saw another boost of 30,400 streams in the week following right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk's assassination in September. Working with Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, she sang an a capella rendition of “God Bless the USA” at the University of Minnesota. As head of the FBI, Patel was highly visible in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, prematurely posting that the suspect was in custody, telling Kirk he'd see him in “Valhalla,” and sharing images of “anti-ICE” bullets found at the scene.


	Wilkins' weekly listeners dropped to some of their lowest numbers until November, when it was revealed Patel used a $60 million tax-funded private jet for a “date night” with Wilkins in late October. Patel had gone to Pennsylvania to see Wilkins sing the National Anthem at a Real American Freestyle wrestling event, then used the jet to fly to Nashville, seemingly dropping off Wilkins. The discovery sparked instant backlash. Not only had Patel made the trip during the 43-day government shutdown, but he had also repeatedly decried his predecessor for his private-jet use. (FBI Assistant Director for Public Affairs Ben Williamson said criticism was “disingenuous and dumb.”)

	











	Patel came under fire a few weeks later when it was reported he had assigned a SWAT security detail to protect Wilkins, allegedly screaming at a commander when agents left an assignment accompanying Wilkins to an NRA event early after determining the location was secure. It is unprecedented for a director's girlfriend to receive their own FBI security detail, both MS Now and The New York Times have reported. (Neither Wilkins nor a rep for Patel immediately responded to a request for comment.)

	As the scandal embroiled Patel for much of November, Wilkins had a record month of nearly 63,000 streams overall. And last weekend, MS Now reported that on at least two occasions, Patel ordered an FBI security detail to escort one of Wilkins' drunk friends home from the bar — a serious break from what is within the scope of a service members' duties. (A FBI spokesperson and Wilkins both denied the report.)


	Although streaming data for this past news cycle isn't in yet, the pattern is clear: A week in the headlines for Patel means a solid week for Wilkins.

	My husband loves me for a lot of reasons: my sparkling personality, my willingness to attend any (and all) EDM concerts, and my undying devotion to the Shrek franchise (just quoting his vows, not mine). But another reason is my gift-giving skills. And yes, I'll toot my own horn a little — I give a damn good gift.


	Ever since we met, he's told me that if gift-giving were a competitive sport, I'd win. Which says a lot, because I don't think anyone has ever complimented my athletic abilities. So if you're struggling to find the perfect gift for your husband this holiday season, or if he's the type of man who claims he “wants nothing” while secretly drooling over the latest tech, you've come to the right place.


	Over the course of my relationship with Mr. Alexis Mikulski Ruiz, I've bought more presents than I can count. Gifts for Christmas? Easy. Birthdays? Obviously. But also Arbor Day, the Fourth of July, and, of course, National Star Wars Day — I don't mess around, and I've had plenty of practice.




	This is all to say: when it comes to curating something your man will actually love, I am your girl. I've compiled a list of the best gifts for husbands this year — items I've personally tried, bought, and tested, ranging from cozy cashmere sweaters to movie screenplays and unique LED lighting gadgets. These are the kinds of presents he'll be genuinely psyched to find under the tree. Prices start as low as $20 and go up to a few hundred, so there's something for everyone in this guide.




	He's the love of your life; he deserves a little more than just another tie. Shop the best gifts for husbands in 2025 below.







	$48.00




		If you married a Deadhead, congratulations — you're a Deadhead by default. Malbon just dropped an elevated collab with the band that looks like something you won't find in a dusty thrift bin. Get him the beanie and a matching vinyl and send that man “Truckin'” along.	




	$75.00




		This Leatherology wallet is sleek, high-quality, and monogrammable, so when he inevitably loses it at your next house party or dinner, everyone will know exactly who it belongs to. Honestly, throw in some Apple AirTags too. For safety.	




	$92.50




		Derby shoes are a must for the man in your life, and one of our favorites is by ECCO. Not only will they add a certain je ne sais quoi to his outfit, but they'll also make you look better by association. A win-win.	




	$191.00




		These are my husband's favorite sunglasses, and they can be your husband's too (aww, twins). They've survived ball games, beach days, and every time he pretends he's totally not napping during lunch with the in-laws.	




	$128.00




		Technically, my husband works for Mr. Bezos, but if you ask me, his true full-time career is “professional groomsman.” He doesn't leave for a wedding without this Halfday bag. It stores everything he needs and somehow keeps his suit wrinkle-free.	




	$62.00




		In our family, Acqua di Giò is the scent that keeps on giving. I gave it to my husband for the holidays in 2021, and he liked it so much he gifted it to all his groomsmen. Yes, it smells that good. It's the kind of cologne you spray on his pillow when he's out of town just to get another whiff.	




	$88.50



	$118.00



	25% off




		Whether he's spinning all day on the green or accompanying you on weekend errands, this UNTUCKit hoodie will keep him comfortable and stylish. It's the perfect upgrade from that ratty old frat crewneck he refuses to retire, so you won't even roll your eyes when he inevitably says, “I don't wanna dress up today.”	




	$150.00




		Men sometimes need a little wardrobe nudge, and these Florsheim shoes deliver. As my husband puts it, “They're so comfortable I could walk the length of Manhattan in them.” A man of few words — but when it comes to a last-minute gift, his recommendation tells you everything you need to know.	




	$75.00



	$84.00



	11% off




		It's time for him to ditch the ripped briefs and upgrade to these Bombas boxers. They're soft, supportive, and bonus, they look good on him and on you (for when you inevitably steal them). 	




	$298.00




		Men want to feel pretty, too. And one of the fastest ways to make that happen is with a cashmere sweater. The first time my husband slipped into this magical fabric, he looked at me like he didn't know that level of comfort existed — and now yours can experience the same enlightenment.	




	$90.00




		If he dreamed of getting drafted after high school but ended up in a tech job instead, he can still look the part with something from Game 7. Founded by hockey GOAT Mark Messier, their gear for the NHL and NBA actually looks like elevated athleisure, not a cheap novelty.	




	$138.00




		These are my husband's go-to pants — whether we're flying across the country or he has a big presentation at the office. They feel like sweatpants but look like dress slacks, meaning he never has to choose between “office appropriate” and “what's going to get me written up again.”	




	$75.00




		If he's a golfer, a tennis enthusiast, or simply works a finance job (secure that bag), a classic white polo is always a good idea. Get him a few colors — future-you will thank present-you when he's getting dressed in the morning.	




	$97.50




		Every man needs at least one great set of sneakers. If he's tired of the same pairs every guy on the street owns, treat him to something different with these leather kicks from ECCO. They're an elevated basic for the guy who deserves more than the norm.	




	$89.95




		Men need Christmas pajamas, too. This set from L.L.Bean won't overheat him at night if he's the type who thrashes in his sleep, and he'll look adorable on your family Christmas card, whether you had to drag him to the photo shoot or not.	




	$325.00




		I got this watch for my husband for our wedding, and to this day, it's still his favorite timepiece. Nixon watches are less expensive than the big luxury brands, but honestly, the quality rivals the fanciest stuff on the market. When he opens it, he'll think you spent a fortune; no need to tell him otherwise.	




	$98.00




		For an upcoming trip to paradise, prep him with a themed trunk set. Fun, stylish, and a long-overdue replacement for the beat-up bathing costume he's been hoarding since the early 2000s.	




	$195.00




		A man wearing a bracelet instantly becomes hotter. I don't make the rules. This one from David Yurman is simple, subtle, and comes with a secure clasp (because if he can lose his keys, he can lose anything).	






	$134.98



	$149.99



	10% off




		These LED lighting tiles were one of the first gifts I ever bought my husband back when I was still girlfriend-level. He used the original set for eight years. We recently upgraded, and while the custom shape has gotten classier, the quality's still A+. Hang them up, pair with your favorite playlist, and voilà — date night at home for the two of you.	




	$399.00



	$499.99



	20% off




		The PlayStation 5 is a must for any gamer and absolutely what he's secretly hoping for this year — he just didn't want to look greedy for Santa Claus. Surprise him, and you might earn some blissful peace and quiet while he's yelling into a microphone with his boys in the other room.	




	$99.99




		Sure, this one's practical, but I'm guessing your husband still has the same phone case he got with his initial purchase. Upgrade him with this waterproof OtterBox. It'll protect his phone and your sanity from another trip to the Verizon store for a cracked screen.	




	$499.00




		If you've ever caught him glued to the screen during Black Mirror or Westworld, treat him to his own alternate reality with the Meta Quest 3. He can work out, play games, and explore an entirely new universe without leaving the living room.	




	$199.99




		If he's a music lover, treat him to a new turntable. He can spin his favorite tracks, and your space instantly gets a chic refresh. Bonus: In my experience, it makes future gifting way easier — just keep getting him vinyl of his most-played albums and call it a day.	




	$887.00



	$937.00



	5% off




		For the true cinephile, turn your home into his private movie theater with this Sonos surround sound set. It's sleek, comes with a sub and two additional speakers, according to the brand, basically making every film feel like a premiere, without the overpriced popcorn.	




	$279.99



	$399.99



	30% off




		You love him, but that doesn't mean you love his podcast choices (or hearing Instagram reels over and over again). Get him these Sony headphones — powerful, comfortable, and some of our top-rated cans — so he can enjoy his deep-dive commentaries without dragging you along for the ride.	






	$18.00




		If he's the Jim to your Pam, or the Michael Scott to your Holly Flax, get him this New York Times bestselling book by Andy Greene. It's a deep, delightful dive into the show that has basically become a third member of our household (and I'm guessing yours).	




	$2,895.00



	$3,295.00



	12% off




		Remember that infamous Peloton Christmas commercial? While the internet was mad, I still stand by this: a Peloton is a great gift for anyone looking to ditch their gym membership or take fitness more seriously than “maybe I'll go work out today.”	




	$50.00+




		If your husband is a concert superfan or a die-hard sports guy, a live event is a holiday slam-dunk. Surprise him with tickets to an upcoming game or show in your area, and then obviously make him buy all the popcorn, drinks, and merch once you're there. It's basically a gift for you, too.	




	$22.97




		If sushi is as essential in your home as filtered water, get him this fun pair of chopsticks from Amazon. Whether he aligns with the Light Side or the Dark Side (for your sake, hopefully the Light), he'll appreciate the cheeky practicality.	




	$754.00




		If your husband is the chef in the family (and if he isn't, put that boy to work), he needs this Ooni electric pizza oven to level up. It's compact (ours lives right on the counter), makes pies even Anthony Mangieri would nod at approvingly, and best of all, it keeps him busy so you can finally watch your shows on the big screen in peace.	




	$229.99




		If he can name F1 drivers faster than he can name your closest friends, get him this F1 LEGO set. It's sleek enough that you won't mind it on display, and it's designed for ages 18+ (which, let's hope, he qualifies for).	




	$120.00




		If he likes to keep things spicy, go for the official Hot Ones box set. Ten sauces, ranging from “this is fine” to “what the f*** was that” — he can decide how hot he wants his night to get.	




	$32.40



	$54.00



	40% off




		For a gift that he'll never grow tired of, get him this boudoir photo album. No need for a professional photographer, use a Polaroid, print instantly, and enjoy the results. Plus, you avoid the awkward possibility of a stranger seeing your bits on a studio monitor. This might honestly be one of the best gifts you ever give him. Trust me.	




	$33.00+




		If paying for cable is one of his favorite grievances, a Philo subscription might save both his wallet and your sanity. He'll get access to his beloved channels like History and A&E, and you won't have to hear about another price hike.	




	$105.58




		For the whiskey connoisseur, Suntory is the way to go. Slip it into his stocking and watch his Christmas get instantly merrier and blurrier (we mean brighter).	




	$300.00




		Sure, you may not love that he goes “all in” at poker night (if he bets his life savings, that's a separate conversation), but this monogrammed poker set will have him looking like the classiest guy at the table. Wood, velvet, and undeniably cooler than the flimsy internet version.	




	$14.99




		Sometimes husbands are a little reckless with their wedding rings — this is generalizing, sure, but you know I'm right. If you don't want him stressing about losing it on your upcoming vacation, get him these silicone bands as placeholders. The world will still know he belongs to you, without risking the real ring sinking and belonging to the bottom of the Caribbean.	




	$54.99




		Make his Yule log rise with this penis ring from Lovehoney. It's guaranteed to be fun for both of you for less than $60.	




	$24.72



	$30.00



	18% off




		Sure, he might not make it to Oktoberfest every year like he dreams, but at least he can pretend he's there with this Stanley Stein. It's currently 18% off on Amazon and comes in multiple color — prost to that.	




	$27.75



	$37.00



	25% off




		This is by far one of the coolest (and most appreciated) gifts I've ever given my husband. You choose his favorite song, send it to Etsy, and they turn it into soundwave art he can hang in his office or your media room. It's the perfect amount of sentimental while also doubling as chic home décor.	




	$34.79




		If your husband is anything like mine, his devotion to Star Wars is almost as serious as our wedding vows. Okay, that might be an exaggeration, but for the Jedi superfan, get him a printed script of A New Hope. Instant family heirloom, whether you've actually seen the movie or not.

Taylor Swift dropped by The Late Show to discuss her very good year — getting engaged, reclaiming her masters, releasing a new album, etc. — as well as begin work on her own list of the Top Five Taylor Swift songs.


	The singer sat on Stephen Colbert's couch for the first time to promote her upcoming The End of an Era tour documentary as well as The Final Show concert film, both of which will land on Disney+ this Friday.


	“You've been so supportive over the years, even very early in my career, you would just say the nicest things,” Swift told Colbert. “You're so supportive of people, you're passionate about what you do, it's a joy to get to watch you, and a real honor to actually sit here.”


	Colbert, who's leaving The Late Show in six months after almost 11 years, then asked Swift how she “comes down” following the lengthy Eras Tour.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I think I can speak for both of us when I say we're passionate, hyperactive people. Let's not say workaholic,” Swift said. “I think that when I take time off, I can't slow down the fact that I need to get up and do a lot of things today, but I can change what those things are. I can figure out how to chill out, but I'll never be a chill person. So I'm bread girl now, or ‘This isn't gonna cross-stitch itself.' Hobbies are incredible.”

	











	After talking about her tour doc and concert film, the two then discussed the singer's big 2025, which included getting engaged to Travis Kelce, finally reclaiming the masters to her albums, and The Life of a Showgirl.

	











	“That's a good year,” Swift admitted. “Getting engaged to the love of my life, getting all my music back, those were two things that just never could have happened. They could have just never happened. It wasn't like, ‘It's just a matter of time.' Both of those things could have just never arrived in my life, and I'm so grateful for both of those things happening.”

	Colbert then told Swift about how John Fogerty, now 80, just reclaimed his Creedence Clearwater Revival masters, and how much it still meant to him. “It's the same feeling for me,” Swift said. “I used to have this very strange, conflicted feeling, like I'd hear the song ‘Ready for It,' and I'd be like, ‘Man, this song goes so hard,'” before crying to it. “A recording is such a snapshot of your life.” 


	Swift later talked about separating her music life from her home life. “I think that at home, I don't want any paraphernalia. I don't want plaques, or I don't want a studio. I don't want evidence that a music person lives here, except for my piano and my guitar, but the guitar's not hung in a prominent place,” Swift said. “I like to feel very cozy at home, and if I'm gonna go to the studio, I go to the studio. ‘Special day today, gonna go to the studio.'” 


	Finally, Swift wrapped up her multi-segment interview by giving some thought to her own personal list of the Top Five Taylor Swift songs.

	“This is so much pressure,” Swift said. “I'm gonna need some time to get back to you on all the five… I think Number One is ‘All Too Well' the 10-minute version… Somewhere on this list is gonna be a song called ‘Mirrorball' from the Folklore album.” Swift then said she'd come back after thinking on it and deliver her Top Five.

Extra-sensory expert Andriy Duyko, known as the 'Ukrainian Nostradamus', believes that U.S. President Donald Trump could stop the war in Ukraine if he personally visits our country.

He spoke about this on the YouTube channel 'My World'.

'How to stop the war? It's very simple. Trump comes to Ukraine, and the war ends. Therefore, we should constantly propose and urge Trump to visit Ukraine,' he said.

Andriy Duyko also noted that it is worth taking advantage of Trump's self-love by promising that after the de-occupation of Donetsk, it can be named in his honor. Thus, the extra-sensory hopes to influence the American leader.

Astrology, tarot, numerology, divination, prophecy, molfarism, extrasensory perception are not sciences, and predictions do not always come true 100%. Information is often entertaining in nature, so it should be perceived with a certain degree of skepticism, as a probability of events that everyone can create if they have the spirit and inspiration to change their lives for the better.

Duyko's words emphasize hopes for a quick resolution of the conflict, but it is important to remember that political decisions are based on complex processes and negotiations. While such predictions may be interesting, the real development of events is dependent on many factors that go beyond personal visits from world leaders.

In the vast landscape of Twitch, where gaming, reaction content, and livestream entertainment shape the digital world, there is one creator whose presence stands apart: Giuseppa Salinas Gomez Gomez, better known as JuXinaaa or La Madrina. With a life marked by intuition, spiritual sensitivity, and profound personal experiences, she has built a unique space where the paranormal, the mysterious, and the deeply emotional intertwine with humor, community, and curiosity.

Her streams invite viewers into an atmosphere that feels both intimate and electric — a place where energy is analyzed as closely as evidence, where intuition is treated as a compass, and where science and the supernatural sit at the same table. Together with her devoted community, the “Kiddos,” Juxinaaa explores paranormal videos, documentaries, investigations, and experiments, reacting not just with commentary but with a sensitivity shaped by her own real-life encounters.

In this exclusive interview, she shares her origins, her spiritual lineage, the night that changed everything, and how she brings authenticity into a world where belief and skepticism collide.

1. How did you first come into contact with the paranormal, and what motivated you to turn it into Twitch content?

I grew up around the paranormal. In my family, there were several tragic events — including murders — and every time, someone would feel this deep intuition that something was about to happen. I was raised with that energy. My Spanish grandmother was very spiritual, and when I was little, I actually thought she was talking to me in dreams. Later I realized they weren't dreams at all — they were real conversations, warnings, and energies.

That intuitive ability runs in my family, and I've carried it with me my whole life. Twitch eventually became the place where all of that could come together — the stories, the mystery, the humor, and the spiritual side.

2. What criteria do you use to decide which videos or cases you react to on stream?

Authenticity and energy are everything to me.

I look at:
• the vibe of the video
• the atmosphere
• whether the emotions feel real
• and the resonance it has with me and my community.

If something feels energetically genuine, I'll react to it. If not, I'll usually skip it.

3. Was there a paranormal experience in your own life that strongly shaped how you see all of this?

Yes — the night my friend was murdered.

On the morning of the day it happened, I had this deep, unsettling feeling in my stomach. It wasn't fear, just a knowing. Later that day, we were at his parents' house, and suddenly men broke in. We escaped onto the roof. I had a package with me that he asked me to leave behind, but my intuition said, “Take it.”

I still don't know exactly what was inside — but my gut told me it mattered. Maybe it protected others. Maybe it changed something. But I couldn't save him.

That moment defined my relationship with intuition forever. And the night he died, I felt our connection snap before I was told anything. That sudden energetic shift is the foundation of my spiritual worldview.

4. How do you handle it when scientific explanations and supernatural interpretations collide in your community?

For me, science and the supernatural aren't enemies. Science explains a lot — but not everything.

I keep both sides open, neutral, and even humorous. My streams are a dialogue: I show scientific reasoning respect, but I also acknowledge the experiences that don't fit into that box.

5. What's the most surprising or disturbing investigation you've ever reacted to on stream?

Some investigations shake people because of the atmosphere — strange sounds, sudden shifts in energy, or visuals that just don't sit right. My community often picks up on details immediately.

For me, it's rarely fear — but sometimes a case has a heaviness that even I can't ignore. Those moments stay with me.

6. Do you ever experiment with occult methods or paranormal tests live on stream? If so, what have your experiences been like?

I don't experience fear the way most people do. I don't believe in fear — I believe in perception.

When I experiment with energetic or spiritual methods on stream, I stay very calm, clear, and grounded. If something happens in the room or the energy shifts, I register it, but without panic.

Some moments have been intense for viewers, though — certain sounds or atmospheres can feel unsettling to the community, even if I'm completely steady.

7. How do you evaluate the authenticity of paranormal clips? Do you have any red flags or analysis techniques?

Definitely. Some of my biggest red flags are:
• shadows that make no sense,
• timing that's off,
• atmospheric inconsistencies,
• lack of real emotional response,
• and energy that simply feels wrong or forced.

I react only to clips that feel energetically real.

8. How does your community influence the flow of your streams, especially when it comes to spontaneous reactions and interpretations?

My community — my Kiddos — is a real part of my intuitive process.

They notice tiny details, they catch things I might miss, and together we break down the energy of a moment. It's a shared experience. Their input shapes the direction of the stream constantl

9. Has there ever been a moment during a stream when you were truly scared or something unexplainable happened?

I wouldn't say I've ever been truly scared. Fear isn't something I operate with.

But yes — there have been moments when something shifted suddenly, energetically, and everyone felt it at the same time. Those experiences weren't frightening for me, but they were definitely powerful.

10. What future projects or paranormal topics do you want to explore more deeply on Twitch?

There's so much left to uncover — deeper analyses, new investigations, more spiritual experiments, and exploring the line between intuition and energy on an even higher level.

My goal is always the same: to bring my community with me into these experiences so we can explore the unknown together.

We investigate the microlensing detectability of extraterrestrial technosignatures originating from Dyson sphere – like structures, such as Dyson Swarms surrounding primordial black holes (PBHs).

These hypothetical swarms consist of stochastically varying, partially opaque structures that could modulate standard microlensing light curves through time-dependent transmission effects.

We introduce a probabilistic framework that includes a stochastic transmission model governed by variable optical depth and random gap distributions. We perform a parameter scan and generate heatmaps of the optical transit duration. We study the infrared excess radiation and peak emission wavelength as complementary observational signatures.

Additionally, we define and analyze the effective optical depth and the anomalous microlensing event rate for these stochastic structures. Our findings provide a new avenue for searching for extraterrestrial advanced civilizations by extending microlensing studies to include artificial, dynamic modulation signatures.

St. George might see some out-of-this-world visitors this Sunday as aliens are set to make an appearance at Pioneer Park.

“If you like the vision of universal peace, universal love and universal well-being, then you are going to enjoy this event,” said Alien Contact event coordinator and founder Rupert Guy. “It is all about trying to make the world a better place and trying to live in harmony with all conscious beings throughout the universe.”

Guy said the Alien Contact event will begin with humans making friends before any extraterrestrial introductions. Although the main program starts at 7 p.m., guests can arrive at 6 p.m. to mingle in a friendly orbit. Guy said the goal is to bring people together in friendship regardless of differences, including religious beliefs or political convictions.

The evening will move into a guided astral projection meditation designed to help participants reach out to any visiting beings and offer an open invitation for contact.

Attendees at the Alien Contact event gather in hopes of encountering extraterrestrial beings, location and date not specified.

“What typically happens is people start feeling the presence of these beings around us on the ground,” he said. “Psychic people will see them standing around trying to support what we are doing. Occasionally, we will see alien craft in the sky flying above us.”

St. George is one stop on what Guy said will be a more than five-month Alien Friendship Contact Tour across the country. The tour began Nov. 30 in Bakersfield, California, and is scheduled to continue through Fresno and Sacramento before making six stops in Nevada, including Area 51.

After St. George, the route moves to Page, then travels through New Mexico, Oklahoma, Missouri, Indianapolis, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama, with a tentative finale planned in Arkansas.

He planned the tour to cover as much of the United States as possible, estimating it would span 40-45 states. St. George naturally fit into the route between Sedona, Area 51 and other locations he considers key stops on the journey.

Cosmic encounters

At the first two events of his 2025 tour, Guy said attendees reported seeing black streaks darting through the air nearby. Around the same time, a member of his online group described receiving a “download” from alien beings and began noticing similar black streaks in her vision. Intrigued by the phenomenon, Guy attempted to connect with the streaks to discover who or what they might be.

“We always reach out to beings with love in our hearts and friendly intentions,” he said. “It turned out that these black streaks identified themselves as positive, friendly beings who had a message for us.”

Guy said that when participants communicated telepathically with the beings and asked for a message, three people in three different locations reported the same vision: Guy standing in a forest clearing, surrounded by a large group of nonhuman beings. He said the consistency of the visions across separate observers serves as logical proof of a genuine psychic telepathic message.

He said he does not know when or where the vision will manifest, but it seems to serve as a notification or invitation to the forest clearing gathering. He hopes the meeting will take place during his tour.

Rupert Guy, founder of Alien Contact, leads a U.S. tour designed to help humans connect with each other and extraterrestrial beings, location and date not specified.

Guy said everyone can experience paranormal or alien encounters, but an open mind is key. The beings cannot force contact and will retreat if someone is not ready, though they can telepathically and empathically sense a person's mind and heart.

How the cosmos called

Growing up in England, Guy said he realized at an early age that he was more empathetic than most. He cared so deeply for people, animals and the planet that he could not watch the news because it was too painful. 

Determined to make a difference, he felt he first needed to understand reality. If God were real, he wanted God on his side. If aliens were real, he wanted them on his side or anyone working to protect the planet.

He began exploring aliens, paranormal phenomena and religions alongside scientific study. He attended the University of Leicester in England, earning a first-class honors degree in Physics with Space Science and Technology and later pursued advanced work in astrophysics and research.

“I ended up with a pretty clear picture of scientific realities, but also alien, paranormal and spiritual realities,” he said. “I now teach people about these realities and try to elevate people's understanding of reality, but also morality to alien levels.”

Rupert Guy, founder of Alien Contact, leads a U.S. tour designed to help humans connect with each other and extraterrestrial beings, location and date not specified.

Guy is a retired space scientist and science teacher who calls California home but travels the world. He founded the group Alien Contact five years ago and has led about 10 tours since then. This is his first time hosting an event in St. George.

“I have spent my entire life reaching out to aliens and spirits in peace, trying to establish friendly, constructive relationships with them,” he said.

Join the Alien Contact event at Pioneer Park on Sunday, Dec. 14, from 7-9 p.m. Early birds can arrive at 6 p.m. to mingle in a friendship circle before the cosmic adventure begins.

Dress warmly and bring a yoga mat or tarp to sit or lie on. Be ready for a short walk from the parking area to the contact spot, where the night's extraterrestrial encounters will unfold. For more details and tickets, visit the event page and prepare for a night that's truly out of this world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","This Classic Supernatural Episode Is the Scariest 44 Minutes of Winchester Lore","https://www.cbr.com/supernatural-scariest-episode-winchester-lore/","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

""Saving people, hunting things, the family business"" is a quote that has become synonymous with Supernatural, but no other season encapsulates this feeling like Season 1 of Supernatural does. Before the horror show fell into overarching storylines that lasted seasons, it was known for its snappy monster-of-the-week format, where Sam and Dean Winchester hunted down a different demon in every episode and actually saved countless lives while doing so.

20 years after the release of the first season, it remains the most iconic outing of the CW show. While the Winchesters were tracking down paranormal absurdities across the country, they were also rebuilding a bond that they had lost for many years. In Season 1, Episode 5, ""Bloody Mary,"" Supernatural was at its finest, terrifying viewers with a familiar monster, while also giving them much-needed emotional payoff.

 The legend of Bloody Mary is one that has been worn thin over the past few decades, especially through email forwards that simplify it to the point where it ceases to be scary. According to the lore, if one faces a mirror and says ""Bloody Mary"" thrice, a woman will kill them instantly through the reflective surface. Supernatural decided to add layers to this old horror story, and the result was 44 minutes of pure terror. 

The episode begins as the scariest stories do: at a slumber party where three teen girls are playing sleepover games. Charlie and Jill dare Lilly to go to the bathroom mirror and say ""Bloody Mary,"" which she does, but nothing happens. Lilly's father, Steven, asks the girls to keep the noise down, but when he goes back to his bedroom, he's haunted by a horrific figure in the mirror. With his eyes liquefied and his head filled with blood, Steven dies a sudden and agonizing death.

As Sam and Dean descend on Toledo, Ohio, for another monster-of-the-week case, Jill decides to repeat the phrase ""Bloody Mary"" jokingly into a mirror, and soon sees the same dark figure and suffers the same agonizing death as Steven. Trying to find a pattern, Sam and Dean inspect the mirrors that the two victims died in front of, and found the names of Steven's wife and a little boy who had died in a hit-and-run case, whose car details matched Jill's.

Sam and Dean find a vengeful spirit named Mary Worthington, who had been killed in front of a large mirror when she was a teenager, and when her murder was not solved, she started attacking those whom she thought had secretly killed other people, the way she had been. The mirror found its way to Toledo, and the brothers then worked towards saving Charlie, who was being followed by Mary because she once had a boyfriend who died by suicide when she left him. Finally, the brothers made Mary face herself in a mirror for the crimes she had committed, which led to the spirit finally dying.

 Supernatural could have taken the easy route and had Mary kill the people who summoned her, but writers Eric Kripke, Ron Milbauer, and Terri Hughes Burton chose to add layers to a story that had been done to death. They refreshed it by giving Mary an origin story; she used to be a young girl whose life was ended in an untimely manner. So, she made it her afterlife's purpose to avenge those who had killed people and gotten away with it.

Mary Worthington's crusade for justice matched Sam Winchester's own guilt about his girlfriend, Jessica's death. Jessica had died in the same way his mother had, and Sam felt responsible because he had dreamed about her death for weeks, but had done nothing to prevent it. Throughout ""Bloody Mary,"" Dean tried to get Sam to talk to him about the nightmares he was having, and to relieve him of his guilt because he could not have prevented Jessica's death in any way, but the show decided to tackle it through the monster of the week instead.

Mary Worthington's spirit tried to attack Sam, and he, too, bled from his eyes, but the key lay in Sam finally trusting himself and his brother that he did not kill anyone. This horror masterpiece of a Supernatural episode had viewers jumping at every turn, but it also had the sweet sentimentality that formed the bedrock of the show. Sam had to process his grief and guilt about Jessica's death, and this lethal spirit helped to do just that, eventually drawing Dean and Sam closer than ever before.

Determined to make a difference, he felt he first needed to understand reality. If God were real, he wanted God on his side. If aliens were real, he wanted them on his side or anyone working to protect the planet.

He began exploring aliens, paranormal phenomena and religions alongside scientific study. He attended the University of Leicester in England, earning a first-class honors degree in Physics with Space Science and Technology and later pursued advanced work in astrophysics and research.

“I ended up with a pretty clear picture of scientific realities, but also alien, paranormal and spiritual realities,” he said. “I now teach people about these realities and try to elevate people's understanding of reality, but also morality to alien levels.”

Rupert Guy, founder of Alien Contact, leads a U.S. tour designed to help humans connect with each other and extraterrestrial beings, location and date not specified.

Guy is a retired space scientist and science teacher who calls California home but travels the world. He founded the group Alien Contact five years ago and has led about 10 tours since then. This is his first time hosting an event in St. George.

“I have spent my entire life reaching out to aliens and spirits in peace, trying to establish friendly, constructive relationships with them,” he said.

Join the Alien Contact event at Pioneer Park on Sunday, Dec. 14, from 7-9 p.m. Early birds can arrive at 6 p.m. to mingle in a friendship circle before the cosmic adventure begins.

Dress warmly and bring a yoga mat or tarp to sit or lie on. Be ready for a short walk from the parking area to the contact spot, where the night's extraterrestrial encounters will unfold. For more details and tickets, visit the event page and prepare for a night that's truly out of this world.

The Jersey Shore's Hit Music Channel

New Jersey has received good news about an odd topic. We are among the states where you are least likely to get abducted by an alien.

We don't know if you believe in UFOs or aliens, but we do know that no matter where you land on the topic, the news is that abductions from outer space are low in New Jersey.

While New Jersey residents are not the safest from getting an unwanted trip on an alien spaceship, we are among the top 5 safest states, according to the New York Post.

I'm not going to lie. You can count me among the people who think there is something out there, so this news is a big relief to me.

There are actual statistics to back this up as well. Or at least the odds of your chance of getting abducted.

In New Jersey, the chance of being taken by an alien is 1 per 3086, which isn't exactly low enough odds in my mind.

The safest state from alien abduction is Louisiana, followed by Mississippi, Alabama, and Virginia.

The state where you are most likely to be taken by an alien is California, where the odds are 1 in 1075.

I don't know if this information will help you sleep better or keep you up all night, but good luck.

This article contains spoilers for Netflix's Abducted in Plain Sight.

Jan Broberg was just a young child when she thought she'd been taken by aliens.

She'd been living, what appeared to the outside world, a relatively normal life with her family in 1970s Idaho, but that all began to change when she was abducted by supposed aliens.

The story all started when a man named Robert Berchtold came into Jan and her parents' lives. Robert, also known as ""B,"" moved in next door to the Brobergs and quickly befriended them. However, he would go on to kidnap Jan, not once, but twice, leading her to believe that the first time, it was caused by aliens.

When Robert moved in across from the Brobergs, he soon befriended Jan's parents before he turned his sights on the young girl, whom he started to spend a lot of time with one-on-one. The Brobergs were extremely religious and were easily fooled by Robert, who trapped them in a web of complicity and shame.

This devastating tale of crime and deceit is covered in Netflix's Abducted in Plain Sight, which includes testimony from both Jan and her parents, who attempt to explain how they allowed Robert to kidnap their daughter, not once, but twice.

The 91-minute documentary explains how Jan believed she was abducted by aliens when Robert took her for the first time because he played a cassette that told the 12-year-old she had to ""procreate"" with him as part of a secret alien mission.

During this abduction in 1974, Robert drugged Jan and drove her to Mexico, where he held her captive for five weeks, brainwashing her into believing she was half-alien and had a mission to save her home planet by having a child with him before she turned 16.

To keep her quiet, he further told her that if she informed her parents about what happened, then they'd be harmed. It was also reported that he assaulted the 12-year-old 200 times during her time in captivity.

However, despite Robert being arrested in Mexico for abducting Jan, he didn't face very much jail time. This is because he blackmailed her parents, as he'd had separate sexual encounters with them both, so they signed a document saying they'd given Robert permission to take their daughter. He only served 10 days in jail for the kidnapping.

Two years after the first abduction in 1976, Robert took Jan again. In the period between the two abductions, he continued to stay in contact with Jan and her family, even at points sleeping in the child's bed as part of a false type of ""therapy."" He also continued to use the alien narrative to keep his claws in Jan.

When Robert abducted Jan for the second time, he enrolled the then 14-year-old in a Catholic boarding school under a fake name and posed as a CIA agent.

Jan's parents waited two weeks before calling the police, supposedly because they were concerned about how the public would react. The FBI would then get involved, monitoring Robert, and eventually rescuing Jan.

However, even though Robert was charged with the kidnapping, he would be acquitted due to a ""mental defect."" He was then sentenced to a few months in a mental health facility and was released after five months.

Years later, though, after Jan had been granted a lifetime restraining order against Robert, he would be found guilty of aggravated assault and possession of a firearm after attacking members of Bikers Against Child Abuse (BACA) who were at one of Jan's events. Robert died by suicide in 2005 before the sentencing hearing could take place.

Abducted in Plain Sight is available to stream on Netflix.

Share This article

Jenn Nizza, an ex-psychic who now runs a ministry urging people to flee the occult, is warning that “witchcraft is real” and is encouraging people not to watch “Wicked: For Good,” the new sequel to the wildly popular film “Wicked.”

 



Nizza, host of the “Ex-Psychic Saved Podcast,” told parents the movie “has a witchcraft influence” and is “romanticizing” the issue.

“This is very concerning to me, especially the indoctrination of the demonic targeting the youth,” she said. “This is my Christian perspective on this.”

Nizza has widely documented her decades in the occult, working as a psychic and medium before encountering Christ at the age of 37.

She said that experience has forced her to pause when it comes to projects like “Wicked.”

“As somebody who lived in the life of the occult and the New Age for many years … this film is playing on the sensitivities of many people, suggesting there should be some compassion for the bad witch,” she said, noting that the film also “suggests that there can be good witchcraft.”

This teaching is “dangerous,” according to Nizza.

“I just want to speak into this because I've been there,” Nizza said. “This movie is showing witchcraft. … Witchcraft involves invoking demons … it doesn't matter if you call yourself a good witch or a bad witch; it's condemned by God.”

Watch Nizza explain:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","Metroid Prime 4: Beyond","https://www.thegamer.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-psychic-abilities-guide/","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 01:30:00 GMT","

As you begin to explore Viewros in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Samus will pick up a few new abilities along the way to help you on your journey. Each one is specifically tied to points in the story, so while you won't be able to unlock any of them earlier than is intended, it's still worth knowing when to expect them and what they do.

Shortly after arriving on Viewros, Samus will acquire the Psychic Crystal, which ultimately gives her the ability to use Psychic Abilities, the first of which includes the Psychic Visor. That said, Psychic Abilities aren't the only things that Samus can unlock, as various upgrades for both her and Vi-O-La will also be available throughout the game.

 While you don't really need to worry about missing out on any of the abilities and upgrades in Metroid Prime 4, you should understand what each one does in full, as most of these will be necessary to progress at certain points and will also aid in solving puzzles throughout the game.

This table covers Psychic Abilities, Suit Upgrades, Weapon Upgrades, and even Vi-O-La, so for a full breakdown of everything, please see below:

Ability/Upgrade

Explanation

When It Unlocks

Vi-O-La Suit

Samus's main suit for Metroid Prime 4, which allows her to use Vi-O-La.

Unlocked the first time you visit the Volt Forge. This simultaneously unlocks Vi-O-La as well.

Vi-O-La

Samus's bike throughout Metroid Prime 4. Also features Projectiles and a Boost that can be followed up by a damaging Power Slide.

Unlocked while visiting the Volt Forge for the first time, at the same time as the Vi-O-La Suit, as the bike cannot be used without it.

Vi-O-La IC Suit

Upgrade that adds heat-resistance to Samus' Vi-O-La suit, which also unlocks the matching upgrade for Vi-O-La.

You'll be able to see this upgrade in the Volt Forge the first time you visit, but you won't be able to unlock it until you have the Psychic Boost Ball. Once you have that, return to the Volt Forge to upgrade your suit.

Vi-O-La IC

Upgrade that adds heat-resistant features to Vi-O-La. This upgrade will automatically activate when needed.

Automatically unlocked when Samus upgrades her suit with the Vi-O-La IC Suit upgrade.

Fire Shot (Normal/Charged/Super)

Normal — Deals elemental fire damage, which also causes a burn, where enemies take continuous damage. Consumes one Shot Ammo.

 Charged — A more powerful Fire Shot with multiple projectiles. Consumes three Shot Ammo.

 Super — The most powerful version of your Fire Shot that fires even more projectiles than the Charged Shot. Consumes fifteen Shot Ammo.

Normal — Unlocked by acquiring the Fire Chip early on in the Flare Pool and taking it back to MacKenzie at Fury Green.

 Charged/Super — Both the Charged and Super shots are unlocked by completing the Ladder of Thought Shrine and the Rings of Stone Shrine. Whichever one you complete first will unlock the Charge, and whichever one you complete second will unlock the Super. The Ladder of Thought Shrine is the most easily accessible, and thus recommended first.

Ice Shot (Normal/Charged/Super)

Normal — Deals elemental ice damage, which also causes enemies to freeze. The amount of time spent frozen is enemy-dependent. Consumes one Shot Ammo.

 Charged — A more powerful Ice Shot with multiple projectiles that can ricochet off surfaces to hit enemies. It also causes enemies to freeze for a longer duration. Consumes three Shot Ammo.

 Super — The most powerful version of your Ice Shot that fires even more projectiles than the Charged Shot, all of which can ricochet. Once again, this also increases the duration for which enemies are frozen. Consumes ten Shot Ammo.

Normal — Unlocked by acquiring the Ice Chip in the Ice Belt and taking it back to MacKenzie at Fury Green. Note that the chip is in a container that needs to be dropped by the Loading Crane at the start of the area, but you won't be able to get the Ice Chip until you've defeated Keratos. So you'll need to come back for it.

 Charged/Super — Both the Charged and Super shots are unlocked by completing the Floating Path Shrine and the Source of Spring Shrine. Whichever one you complete first will unlock the Charge, and whichever one you complete second will unlock the Super. The Source of Spring Shrine is the most easily accessible, and thus recommended first.

Thunder Shot* (Normal/Charged/Super)

Normal — Deals elemental electrical damage that shocks enemies. This can also be used to power various devices. Consumes one Shot Ammo.

 Charged — A more powerful Thunder Shot that has a chain lightning effect, where it will bounce between enemies. Consumes five Shot Ammo.

 Super — The most powerful version of your Thunder Shot that fires a consistent electric current for several seconds. Consumes twenty Shot Ammo.

Normal — After unlocking the Psychic Grapple, return to Volt Forge and use it to cross the collapsed catwalk before heading to the bottom of Tower 1. You'll find the Thunder Chip in the Power Core, but just be wary that this will trigger a boss fight.

 Charged/Super — Both the Charged and Super shots are unlocked by completing the Rings of Thunder Shrine and the Falling Labyrinth Shrine. Whichever one you complete first will unlock the Charge, and whichever one you complete second will unlock the Super. The Falling Labyrinth Shrine is the most easily accessible, and thus recommended first.

Control Beam

A beam that can be controlled by Samus' mind, which allows you to guide it to a specific location. Can only be activated while using the Psychic Visor. This is mainly used for puzzles, but can be used to pinpoint specific weak points on enemies as well.

Unlocked early on in Fury Green while completing a puzzle.

Missile Launcher

Gives Samus the ability to launch missiles that can lock on to and track enemies. Consumes one Missile Ammo.

Unlocked shortly after meeting Mackenzie in Fury Green.

Super Missile

An upgraded and more powerful version of the normal Missile Launcher. Consumes five Missile Ammo.

Unlocked after completing a puzzle with VUE-995 in the Great Mines.

Psychic Bomb

Gives Samus the ability to drop up to three bombs. If you charge the bomb, it will create a Mote that Samus can control. The Psychic Bomb can only be used in Morph Ball mode.

Unlocked immediately after defeating Carvex in the Garden of Remembrance in Fury Green.

Psychic Power Bomb

Upgrade for the Psychic Bomb that deals more damage and can be used to solve puzzles.

Unlocked immediately after defeating the boss of The Great Mines, Omega Griever.

Psychic Boost Ball

Upgrade for the Morph Ball that allows Samus to trigger short bursts of high-speed rolling. Can also be used to power devices and damage enemies.

Unlocked immediately after defeating Keratos in the Lamorn Laboratory in the Ice Belt.

Psychic Spider Ball

Morph Ball upgrade that gives the Morph Ball the ability to magnetize to magnetic tracks. Can also be used to hang from a Tether Node or ride a Psychic Ball Track that was spawned using the Psychic Visor.

Found in the Ancient Temple in the Ice Belt, but only after unlocking the Thunder Shot.

Psychic Visor

A scan visor that allows Samus to scan things in the world and interact with Psychic Energy to solve puzzles or find collectibles.

Unlocked at the start of the game, in Chrono Tower, after the purple Psychic Crystal is placed in Samus' forehead.

Psychic Boots

Gives Samus the ability to perform a double jump, also known as a Space Jump, and gives her the ability to stand on Psychic Platforms that are spawned using the Psychic Visor.

Even though you'll come across Psychic Platforms a little earlier, you won't gain access to the Psychic Boots that allow you to walk on them until you defeat Xelios in the Volt Forge, not long after you receive the Vi-O-La Suit.

Psychic Glove

Gives Samus the ability to control Motes and move other psychic objects when paired with the Psychic Visor.

Found in the middle of the Arboreal Chapel in the Fury Green. You'll need this upgrade to progress, so you can't miss it, and it's unlocked not long after the initial tutorial sequence.

Psychic Grapple

Gives Samus the ability to utilize grappling hooks and cross over large gaps or reach high points.

Unlocked after defeating the boss of the Flare Pool, Phenoros.

Psychic Lasso

Creates a ropelike strand of psychic energy that can be used to pull an object towards you. Can only be used on objects that are compatible. Using your Psychic Visor can reveal hidden lasso points.

Found in the Bio-Labs level of the Ice Belt. You'll need to complete a puzzle there to unlock the ability.

Legacy Suit

The final suit upgrade in the game. The Legacy Suit gives Samus the ability to utilize a protective Psychic Barrier that will nullify the effects of most incoming attacks. After a set amount of time, the barrier will fade. However, the rate at which it fades depends on the amount of damage absorbed by it. The barrier will also damage enemies that come into contact with it.

Unlocked after visiting the Altar of Legacy in Fury Green when 100 percent of the Green Energy Crystals have been collected.

* While all elemental shots have their own use, Thunder Shot is the most easily integrated into your standard firing rotation due to its quick ability to charge and the speed at which you can transition from the Thunder Shot to your normal Psychic Beam.

If you want to listen to music or avoid having to complete 100 percent of your scans, you might want to check out the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond amiibos.

Erika Kirk has one word for Candace Owens, who has been peddling conspiracy theories about her late husband, Charlie Kirk: ""Stop.""

In a town hall set to air Saturday at 8 p.m. ET, CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss asked Charlie Kirk's widow what she wants to say to Owens and others who are making unfounded claims about his assassination:

""Stop. That's it. That's all I have to say. Stop.""

Owens used to work for Turning Point USA, the conservative youth organization founded by Charlie Kirk. The two were generally considered friends, with Owens describing their relationship as akin to that of a ""brother and sister."" 

A day after his assassination in September, she posted a nearly 25-minute video, saying she wanted him to be remembered for his career and ideas. But in the months since, Owens has pushed conspiracy theories about his murder and made unfounded fraud allegations about the finances at Turning Point, which Erika Kirk now runs.

The Treasury Department sent Erika Kirk a letter last week, confirming that none of the tax-exempt entities she oversees are under investigation by the IRS. ""The IRS is able to provide this type of information upon request by the taxpayer. And in this case, it's hideous that malicious lies and smears obligated [Erika Kirk] to make the request,"" a senior Treasury official told CBS News.

Erika Kirk talks more about her husband, her journey through faith and grief, and the state of the American right in a CBS News town hall. It will air just days after Charlie Kirk's book, ""Stop, in the Name of God: Why Honoring the Sabbath Will Transform Your Life,"" was posthumously released.

Watch the one-hour town hall Saturday at 8 p.m. ET/CT on CBS. An extended version of the conversation will air on CBS News 24/7 on Sunday at 9 a.m., 3 p.m., 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET, and will be available on CBS News' YouTube channel.

LENGBY, Minn. — Wally Nelson opened his front door on the morning of Dec. 20, 1990 and saw a 19-year-old woman lying in the snow, just feet from his home. 

“Her face was ghost-like,” Nelson told The Associated Press in 1990. “I figured she was dead.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Nelson recognized the young woman: Jean Hilliard, a family friend. Unbeknownst to Nelson, her vehicle veered into the ditch, miles away. 

""I had my parents' car, and I was just upset that I'd slid off the road,"" Hilliard, who now goes by Jean Vig, told Forum News Service. ""I was hoping the car was okay. So even that night, the cold didn't really bother me or make me afraid. I was frustrated more than anything.""

A cold snap had hit Minnesota that evening, with temperatures dipping below 22 degrees Fahrenheit, according to newspaper accounts from the time.

Vig knew she was close to the Nelson home, which belonged to family friend.  So, in the frigid Minnesota night, she attempted the trek to his house. 

""I knew he lived down the road and had a pickup truck, so he could pull me out,"" Vig said. 

Yet as Vig set off on foot — dressed in cowboy boots, jeans and a snowmobile jacket — she began to realize Nelson's home was farther away than she anticipated. 

""It was a little country road, and there were little hills. So I'd get over a little hill thinking his place was going to be there, and then I'd get there and it wouldn't be.""

ADVERTISEMENT

She kept going — and she nearly made it. 

""The last thing I remember was being at the top of the hill and seeing his house,"" Vig said. 

Tracks in the snow told the rest of the story. 

“You could see where she had crawled the last few feet before collapsing,” Nelson told the Associated Press. “You could also see where she had fallen three or four times from the mailbox, one-eighth of a mile down the road.”

The tracks kept going, indicating she crawled across his yard and up onto his doorstop, where she collapsed. 

She spent roughly six to seven hours passed out in the below zero temperatures. 

Hilliard's body was frozen stiff when Nelson picked her up and placed her — diagonally — in the backseat of his car that morning. 

ADVERTISEMENT

He raced to the hospital, hoping for a miracle.

When they arrived at the hospital, her temperature didn't register on a standard medical thermometer. They couldn't find a pulse. Medical staff also weren't able to insert any needles as her skin remained frozen. Her eyes weren't responding to light, either.

They would have considered her deceased — if they hadn't heard the faint gurgling sounds that resembled a form of breathing. 

""They couldn't get a pulse right away, but then they heard a gurgle like through my nose and determined that I was somehow breathing,"" Vig said.

Hospital staff wrapped Hilliard's body with water-based heating pads. Within two to three hours, she began to respond to treatment.

Hilliard wasn't in the clear, though. Her breaths per minute — one to two — were far below the normal rate of 12 to 20 per minute.

As the day progressed, she gradually began to wake up. By that afternoon, her cognitive ability was back to normal. 

ADVERTISEMENT

When awake, Vig could see the black blisters on her toes. It was a concerning sign for her medical team. Amputation was a possible scenario. 

Yet as Vig later learned, just hours before she was fully awake, her doctors informed her family that if she did make it, she could have to have both legs amputated, too. 

At the time the family was told this, her legs were showing signs of detrimental frostbite.

Just as her legs regained their fleshy tone and normal function, her toes cleared up as well. 

She walked away from the near-death experience without any long-term side effects.

Life for the 19-year-old was different when she was discharged from the hospital. 

""I got calls from reporters and from magazines, so it didn't really go back to normal for quite some time."" 

ADVERTISEMENT

It didn't take long for her story to spread throughout the country. Newspapers from Fargo to California carried the story, with headlines that read, “Woman survives six-hour exposure to sub-zero weather” and “Woman comes to life from out of the cold.”

Her recovery was considered a medical mystery — and miracle. 

“I can't explain why she's alive. She was frozen stiff, literally,” her physician, Dr. George Sather, M.D. told the Associated Press. “It's a miracle.”

Vig doesn't disagree. 

Just as news coverage reached all corners of the country, Vig learned that she had been at the center of many prayer group and churches, who took an active interest in her recovery. 

""I do think it was a miracle,"" she said. ""I found out later just how far the prayer chain spread. So, I had a lot of people praying for me.""

She isn't certain why her life was spared, and she's content with not knowing or understanding. 

ADVERTISEMENT

""It's not something I really dwell on. I mean it could be something as simple as my kids or my grandkids ... something special in their life.""

Vig went on to live a relatively normal life. 

She had three daughters, who she raised on a farm before moving to the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities in the mid-1990s. 

It was during that time when her story resurfaced. 

In 1996, her story was featured on Unsolved Mysteries. At the time, the television show was among the most popular in the nation. 

Vig was happy with the way the television show portrayed her story. 

And just as it was when she was 19 years old, people began to show interest in her story. 

Vig is happy to answer questions and share her experiences — especially around Christmas. 

""It happened just before Christmas. So that was Dec. 20,"" Vig said. ""People are looking for miracles and the good that has happened."" 

There are a few questions Vig commonly fields regarding her survival, one of which addresses any possible health issues she has from her time as a human ice cube. 

The only thing she cant think of? She now prefers cold weather over the heat. 

""I can tolerate the cold better than than the heat,"" she said. ""So, I'm not I'm not one of those that wants to go to Florida or Arizona in the winter.""

In this article

Almost nine years ago, Jyoti Bansal sold AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion just as the software startup was set to go public. 

Bansal's latest venture, Harness, is now worth substantially more than that, after raking in $200 million in fresh capital at a $5.5 billion valuation in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs.

Harness' technology helps companies manage and monitor code that's produced with the help of artificial intelligence, making sure it doesn't break, create security vulnerabilities or trigger cost overruns. It's a compliment to the so-called vibe coding trend that's taken off with the boom in generative AI. 

In recent months, venture capitalists have poured money into startups such as Cursor, Lovable and most recently Kilo Code that sell subscriptions for tools for directing AI models to write and update software. Harness' software draws on models from Anthropic and OpenAI.

Earlier this year, Bansal bolstered Harness' cybersecurity chops by merging the startup with Traceable, another company he co-founded. The combined company, based in San Francisco, has a total of about 1,300 employees.

Harness is on track to exceed its goal of more than $250 million in annualized revenue, growing more than 50% year over year, Bansal said. That makes it larger than AppDynamics at the time it was acquired by Cisco. 

Bansal is aiming for a different outcome this time. 

""I'm a believer that at the right market timing, we want to operate as a public company, so we can build for the long term,"" Bansal said. 

In addition to the funding round, Harness is also planning a $40 million tender offer to provide some liquidity to long-standing employees.

On Saturday, Washington's call for “Japan to strengthen its ability to resist an occupation of Taiwan” was featured in a front-page headline of the Nikkei. It was referring to the US' National Security Strategy report, which called on allies in the region to “spend more on their own defense, and most importantly to invest in capabilities aimed at deterring aggression,” to shore up “capacity to deny any attempt to seize Taiwan.” Such a request is of extraordinary significance. 

Over 10 short days, official documents released by Japan and the US have sent a clear message: Peace in the Taiwan Strait is no longer a regional issue, but a core interest of the US, Japan and the wider world.

The Japanese Cabinet on Nov. 25 said that although Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks about a Taiwan contingency did not constitute a change in Tokyo's official foreign policy, there is still a possibility that an assault on Taiwan could amount to an existential threat to Japan. This is important, because it would warrant a mobilization of Japan's military for “collective self-defense,” in line with its 2015 defense legislation. It was the most strategically significant declaration of Japan's stance on the situation in the Taiwan Strait since World War II, indicating that Japan has begun considering peace in the Strait as central to its national security. 

US President Donald Trump soon after signed the Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act, which requires the US Department of State to regularly review and update guidelines governing official interactions with Taipei. It marks a move toward further potential engagement between Taiwanese and US officials, which has been a “red line” since the two countries broke off official relations in 1979. 

The security report also said deterring a conflict over Taiwan is “a priority.” 

These moves from Japan and the US appear to be a kind of strategic relay and are significant in three key ways.

First, the US is showing meaningful support for Japan's position on Taiwan, not only by voicing support amid rising pressure from China, but also by laying the legal groundwork for Taiwan-US engagement through high-profile policy documents such as the National Security Strategy report. In effect, the US is endorsing Japan's position and turning rhetoric about US-Japan joint support of Taiwan into a policy-based reality.

Second, Japan's national security concerns, the US increasingly formalizing engagement with Taiwan and the bolstering of defensive capacity for the first island chain act as a powerful deterrence for China. Taiwan, Japan and the US have moved from diplomatic statements to a combined security apparatus. Any actor seeking to change the “status quo” in the Taiwan Strait is now unlikely to dare to do so.

Third, the changing tide has steadied public confidence in Taiwan. In the face of Beijing's political attacks and military intimidation, pessimistic views could sometimes surface in Taiwan, but assertions from the US and Japan have shown that the nation is already embedded in the collective security framework of the Indo-Pacific region, offering an anchor of stability.

Beijing's attempts to isolate Taiwan have instead had the reverse effect. The deepening of the US' and Japan's cooperation with Taiwan is no coincidence; it is the inevitable response to hegemonic expansionism. Taiwan is on the front line of democracy, and support from Tokyo and Washington has sent a joint message that is clearer than ever before: Safeguarding peace in the Taiwan Strait is a matter of shared conviction and a commitment of the free democratic world.

Deterrence theorists are familiar with the concepts of deterrence “by punishment” and “by denial.” Deterrence by punishment threatens an aggressor with prohibitive costs (like retaliation or sanctions) that outweigh the benefits of their action, while deterrence by denial aims to make an attack so difficult that it becomes pointless.

Experts say the seizure is likely illegal and represents an expansion of US sanctions enforcement.

The Venezuelan government has condemned the U.S.'s seizure of an oil tanker off its coast as “piracy,” as President Donald Trump says that the U.S. is keeping the oil.

In a statement, the Venezuelan government said the seizure “constitutes a blatant theft and an act of international piracy.” It added that the move shows that the U.S.'s recent aggression “has always been about our natural resources, our oil, our energy, the resources that belong exclusively to the Venezuelan people.”

Trump told reporters that the tanker was “seized for a very good reason,”  and claimed that it was the “largest [tanker] ever seized.” When asked what the U.S. would do with the oil aboard the tanker, he said, “​​We keep it, I guess.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the U.S. “executed a seizure warrant” for the tanker, which was “used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.”

“For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,” Bondi said in a post on X. Attached to the post was a video supposedly depicting the seizure, showing grainy footage of U.S. troops descending on the vessel from a helicopter and storming it, guns in hand.

The Department of Homeland Security also posted a video of the seizure, bragging that it was a “KNOCKOUT,” adding a song by LL Cool J to the footage.

Experts have cast doubt as to whether it is legal for the U.S. to seize the tanker, noting that it is highly unusual to do so in international waters. 

“This action marks a significant escalation not only of the U.S.–Venezuela conflict but also of the extraterritorial enforcement of sanctions by the United States. From a strictly legal standpoint, the U.S. has no jurisdiction to impede Venezuela from selling its oil to non-U.S. parties as long as the transaction happens outside of U.S. territory,” said Francisco Rodríguez, senior fellow for the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

“What the U.S. is doing is using the law of the sea concerning stateless vessels, which allows it to approach, board, and inspect vessels without a national registration, as an entryway to justify enforcing U.S. sanctions outside of U.S. territory,” Rodríguez added, saying that a prolonged campaign like this could deepen Venezuela's economic woes.

In a speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) pleaded with Congress to exercise its war powers to stop the Trump administration from further escalation with Venezuela.

“Trump is bringing us to the brink of war — a regime change war — and we are running out of time to stop it,” Van Hollen said.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned Thursday that members of the alliance could be “Russia's next target,” calling for a rapid rise in defense spending to prevent a war similar to those seen by past generations.
    


            Rutte's comments, in a speech at the Munich Security Conference in Berlin, came as European leaders discussed a peace proposal designed to end Russia's years-long war in Ukraine against a backdrop of growing US pressure.
    


            “We need to be ready because conflicts … are no longer fought at arm's length. Conflict is at our door,” he said.
    


            “Russia has brought war back to Europe, and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents and great-grandparents endured.”
    


            However, he added, if NATO “delivers on our commitments, this is a tragedy we can prevent.”
    


            Rutte cautioned that “Russia could be ready to use military force against NATO within five years.”
    


            “Too many are quietly complacent. … Too many believe time is on our side. It is not,” he warned. “The time for action is now. Allied defense spending and production must rise rapidly.”
    


            In June, NATO members agreed to increase their defense spending targets to 5% of their gross domestic product by 2035, more than double the current 2% target and in line with the type of increase US President Donald Trump has demanded for years.
    


            While Rutte acknowledged that “to some extent in Europe, we'll have to take more care of our own defense,” he also sought to highlight the US commitment to NATO. He made the comments after the Trump administration on Friday released its National Security Strategy, which adopted an unprecedentedly confrontational posture toward Europe.
    


            “It's crucial we keep the transatlantic bond as it is today,” he said, pointing out that “you cannot defend the US without a safe Atlantic, and you need NATO to keep the Atlantic safe.”
    


            Rutte praised Trump for kick-starting talks on Russia and Ukraine, telling CNN's Fred Pleitgen that the US president was “the only one who could break the deadlock with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.”
    


            Trump has expressed impatience to reach a deal in recent weeks, while the Europeans have appeared more cautious, seeking both guarantees over security and further discussions on any territorial concessions.
    


            “There have to be security guarantees (for Ukraine) in place of such a quality and level that Putin knows if he tries again the reaction will be devastating,” Rutte said.
    


            “We all know there will be a delicate, difficult discussion about territory, which in the end only the Ukrainians can decide about,” he added.
    


            Meanwhile, Russia called on the United Kingdom to “admit” what a British soldier who died in Ukraine was doing there, implying without evidence that British forces were performing more than their publicly disclosed duties in the country.
    


            Britain's Ministry of Defence said Wednesday that the soldier died “following a tragic accident whilst observing Ukrainian forces test a new defensive capability, away from the front lines.”

Votes came as premium tax credits for estimated 21.8 million enrollees of plans set to expire at end of month

The US Senate on Thursday rejected competing proposals to address the imminent expiration of subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans, greatly increasing the chances that healthcare costs will soon rise to unaffordable levels for millions of Americans.

The votes, part of a deal brokered between Republican majority leader John Thune and the Democratic senators who agreed to reopen the government after a historically long shutdown last month, came as premium tax credits for an estimated 21.8 million enrollees of the plans are set to expire at the end of the month. Health policy research group KFF estimates that annual premiums will more than double if the subsidies are allowed to expire.

A Democratic-backed bill to extend them for three years failed to clear the Senate's 60-vote threshold to advance, with 51 votes in favor and 48 against. Four Republicans – Josh Hawley of Missouri, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska – supported it, along with all Democrats. Montana Republican Steve Daines did not vote.

A Republican proposal for the government to make payments into health savings accounts (HSAs) of enrollees of Obamacare, as the law is commonly known, in lieu of the tax credits, was also voted down. All Republicans except Rand Paul of Kentucky voted for it, and Daines did not vote.

Leaders from both parties blasted the other's proposals ahead of the vote, with Thune accusing Democrats of trying to pump money into propping up the Affordable Care Act, which most lawmakers in his party have opposed since its creation in 2010.

“Apparently they think that a three-year extension with no reforms, to try and disguise the real impact of Obamacare's spiraling costs, is actually a plan,” the majority leader said before the vote.

Democrats countered by accusing Republicans of not being serious about their promise to lower the cost of living in the United States. The issue was at the heart of the 2024 presidential campaign, and has been linked to Donald Trump's recent decline in public approval, as voters increasingly say he has not done enough to make life more affordable.

“Senate Republicans just shoved the American people off the side of a cliff with no parachute and with an anchor tied to their feet,” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said after the vote. “Republicans now own America's healthcare crisis.”

The premium tax credits were first created under Joe Biden in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. While Trump toyed with the idea of extending the credits, he appeared to shut the door on it in an interview with Politico published Tuesday, while supporting the GOP proposal. “I want to give the money to the people, not to the insurance companies,” he said.

The measure introduced by Republican senators Bill Cassidy and Mike Crapo is built around government payments of $1,000 into the HSAs of people enrolled in bronze or catastrophic exchange plans, which typically have high deductibles. People from the ages of 50 to 64 would get another $500, and there would be limits for all who received the funds on using it to pay for abortions or gender-affirming care.

Bernie Sanders, the independent senator who is the ranking member on the Senate health committee, said the Crapo-Cassidy bill “would make an already broken and outrageously expensive healthcare system even worse” and would encourage people to switch to plans with unaffordable deductibles in exchange for payments into their HSAs.

“It would do nothing to prevent premiums from doubling, tripling or even quadrupling for millions of Americans. It would do nothing to lower the outrageous cost of healthcare or prescription drugs. It would do nothing to make it easier for Americans to see a doctor when they get sick,” said the senator, who caucuses with the Democrats.

Trump presided over an unsuccessful attempt to repeal Obamacare in his first term, but the law today is relatively popular, with a Gallup poll released this week finding 57% of voters approve of it. Republicans have not made any serious attempts at its repeal since Trump began his second term in January.

Any legislation passed by the Senate would need to win the approval of the Republican-controlled House, where speaker Mike Johnson opposes the tax credits.

At a Wednesday press conference, he said that the House GOP planned to soon unveil its own bills to make healthcare more affordable, without giving details.

“The overall system is broken, and we're the ones that are going to fix it. You will see that laid out,” he said.

A bipartisan group of moderate House lawmakers also introduced a proposal in the House this week that would extend the premium tax credits through 2027, while imposing new caps on the income of enrollees and protections against fraud.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Confusion over diplomatic standoff deepens after conflicting reports about the soldiers' whereabouts

Eleven Nigerian military personnel are reportedly still in Burkina Faso days after their plane made an “unauthorised” landing in the south-west city of Bobo Dioulasso, despite earlier suggestions they had been freed, deepening confusion about the diplomatic standoff.

Burkinabé authorities told the BBC on Tuesday that the troops had been released and given permission to return to Nigeria, but officials in Abuja have said the matter is yet to be resolved.

The Nigerian daily the Punch quoted Kimiebi Ebienfa, a foreign ministry spokesperson, as saying late on Wednesday that that Nigerian embassy in Ouagadougou was “engaging with the host authorities to secure their release”.

The saga began on Monday when a Nigerian military cargo plane, a C-130, travelling from Lagos to Portugal was forced to land in Burkina Faso. Authorities in the country, which is part of the three-member Alliance of Sahel States (AES), called the landing an “unfriendly act carried out in defiance of international law” in a statement that evening.

The Nigerian air force said technical concerns had forced the plane to divert to the nearest airport “in line with standard safety procedures and international aviation protocols”. The Burkinabé authorities had treated the crew courteously and plans were under way to continue the mission, it said.

Conspiracy theories began circulating on social media and offline given that the landing came within 24 hours of Nigerian troops helping to thwart a coup attempt in Benin, which borders Nigeria and Burkina Faso.

The AES trio of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger officially left the larger Ecowas regional bloc in January, forming a military alliance as it withdrew from many of its traditional local and international allegiances.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Getting trapped in quicksand is a corny peril of old movies and TV shows, but it really did happen to one unfortunate hiker in Arches National Park in Utah.

The park famous for dozens of natural sandstone arches gets more than 1 million visitors a year and accidents ranging from falls to heat stroke are common.

Quicksand? Not really — but it has happened at least a couple of times now.

Photo: AP

“The wet sand just kind of flows back in. It's kind of a never-ending battle,” said John Marshall, who helped a woman stuck in quicksand more than a decade ago and coordinated the latest rescue.

On Sunday, an experienced hiker, whose identity was not released, was traversing a small canyon on the second day of a 32km backpacking trip when he sank up to his thigh, Marshall said.

Unable to free himself, the hiker activated an emergency satellite beacon. His message got forwarded to Grand County emergency responders and Marshall got the call at 7:15am.

“I was just rolling out of bed,” Marshall said. “I'm scratching my head, going: ‘Did I hear that right? Did they say quicksand?'”

He put his boots on and rendezvoused with a team that set out with all-terrain vehicles, a ladder, traction boards, backboards and a drone. Soon, Marshall had a bird's-eye view of the situation.

Through the drone camera he saw a park ranger who had tossed the man a shovel, but the quicksand flowed back as soon as the backpacker shoveled it away, Marshall said.

The Grand County Search and Rescue team positioned the ladder and boards near the backpacker and slowly worked his leg loose. By then he had been standing in near-freezing muck, in temperatures as cold as minus-6°C, for a couple of hours.

Rescuers warmed him up until he could stand, then walk. He then hiked out on his own, even carrying his backpack, Marshall said.

Quicksand is dangerous, but it is a myth total submersion is the main risk, Marshall said.

“In quicksand you're extremely buoyant,” he said. “Most people won't sink past their waist in quicksand.”

Marshall is more or less a quicksand expert.

In 2014, he was a medic who helped a 78-year-old woman after she was stuck for more than 13 hours in the same canyon just 3km from where Sunday's rescue took place.

The woman's book club got worried when she missed their meeting. They went looking for her and found her car at a trailhead. It was June — warmer than Sunday, but not sweltering in the canyon's shade — and the woman made a full recovery after regaining use of her legs.

“Both had very happy endings,” Marshall said.

The party, which has long campaigned against immigration, argues that too-fast population growth is overwhelming housing, transport and public services. The level of support comes despite the government urging voters to reject it, warning that strict curbs would damage the economy and prosperity, as Swiss companies depend on foreign workers.
The poll by newspaper group Tamedia/20 Minuten and released yesterday showed that 48 percent of the population plan to vote                                    


PARLIAMENT CHAOS:
                                         Police forcibly removed Brazilian Deputy Glauber Braga after he called the legislation part of a ‘coup offensive' and occupied the speaker's chair                                        Brazil's lower house of Congress early yesterday approved a bill that could slash former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro's prison sentence for plotting a coup, after efforts by a lawmaker to disrupt the proceedings sparked chaos in parliament.
Bolsonaro has been serving a 27-year term since last month after his conviction for a scheme to stop Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office after the 2022 election.
Lawmakers had been discussing a bill that would significantly reduce sentences for several crimes, including attempting a coup d'etat — opening up the prospect that Bolsonaro, 70, could have his sentence cut to

A tsunami as high as three metres (10 feet) could hit Japan's northeastern coast after an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 7.6 occurred offshore at 11:15 p.m. (1415 GMT), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said.
Tsunami warnings were issued for the prefectures of Hokkaido, Aomori and Iwate, and a tsunami of 40cm had been observed at Aomori's Mutsu Ogawara and Hokkaido's Urakawa ports before midnight, JMA said.
The epicentre of the quake was 80 km (50 miles) off the coast of

Hello, this is Kateryna Hodunova reporting from Kyiv on day 1,387 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story:

The Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office said it has classified two explosions that killed one person and injured four others in Kyiv on Dec. 11 as a terrorist attack, the office said in a statement.

The blasts occurred in Kyiv's Darnytskyi district, killing a National Guard soldier. Another National Guard soldier and a security guard were injured.

The first explosion went off as two National Guard soldiers were patrolling the area, killing one of them. The second blast detonated after police and medics had arrived and were already working at the scene, according to the statement.

The Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office said a homemade explosive device detonated at the site but did not clarify whether it triggered both blasts.

Investigators from the Security Service of Ukraine, in collaboration with prosecutors from the Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office, have launched a pretrial investigation.

The Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office did not comment on whether Russian special services were involved.



Last updated 6:45 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukraine has returned a group of children from Russian-occupied parts of Kherson Oblast, local Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Dec. 11.

The group includes children ages 4 to 16, as well as an adult who had been deprived of parental care. Prokudin did not specify the total number of children.

Among those rescued was a 12-year-old boy and his family, who lived in constant fear due to regular searches, interrogations, and threats from Russian forces, the governor added.

""Our children have endured threats, pressure, and attempts at 're-education,' but today they are safe on free Ukrainian soil,"" Prokudin said. ""They are receiving the necessary psychological, medical, and social support.""

In 2025, 270 children have been returned from Russian-occupied communities in Kherson Oblast, according to the governor.

Last updated 4:30 p.m. Kyiv time.

A Russian attack on Dec. 6 destroyed a commuter train depot and 27 train cars in the city of Fastiv, Kyiv Oblast, Deputy Community and Territorial Development Deputy Minister Oleksii Balesta said on Dec. 11.

""It was a targeted strike on civilian infrastructure. Three modernized electric trains were also destroyed — a total of 27 train cars,"" Balesta said.

""These were electric trains that provided service in Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy oblasts. The estimated damage is around Hr 300 million ($7 million),"" the official added.

It was the first such large-scale attack on railway infrastructure in Kyiv Oblast, according to Balesta.

The U.S. is pressing Ukraine, but not Russia, to pull back troops in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts near the eastern border of a potential demilitarized zone, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Dec. 11, citing a Ukrainian official familiar with the latest version of the U.S. peace plan.

Trump's initial 28-point peace plan called for establishing a ""neutral, demilitarized buffer zone"" following the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the Donbas region, including Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

Ukrainian officials involved in the talks said Washington is pushing for a zone modeled on the one separating North and South Korea since the armistice was signed more than 72 years ago.

Yet President Volodymyr Zelensky views such a demilitarized zone as a path to a frozen conflict — a temporary pause that would allow Moscow to regroup before launching a new offensive, according to FT.

Last updated 1:15 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukraine launched a mass drone attack against the Russian capital overnight on Dec. 9-10, according to Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin.

Russian air defense units shot down at least 31 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) bound for Moscow, Sobyanin said. Emergency crews are working to clear debris at the crash sites.

No casualties or damage have been reported.

Sobyanin began reporting attacks on the Russian capital late in the evening on Dec. 9, updating as more drones were allegedly shot down over the city. Explosions were reported in the suburbs of Moscow, according to the Russian Telegram news channel Shot.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the reports at the time of publication.

Moscow's Vnukovo, Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo, and Zhukovsky airports introduced temporary flight restrictions during the attack, according to Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya).

Last updated 12:22 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) struck Russia's Vladimir Filanovsky field in the Caspian Sea for the first time with long-range drones, halting oil and gas production from more than 20 wells, a source in the SBU said on Dec. 11.

Four drones struck Moscow's largest offshore oil field in the Caspian Sea, one of the Russia's largest exploration sites, owned by a subsidiary of Russian oil giant Lukoil, according to the SBU source, who shared the details with the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity.

""At least four hits were recorded on the offshore platform. As a result of the attack, oil and gas production from more than 20 wells it serves stopped,"" the SBU source said.

""(Explosions) in the Caspian Sea is another reminder to the Russian Federation that all its enterprises working for the war are legitimate targets.""

At least 4 people have been killed and 21 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Dec. 11.

Russia launched 151 drones and three Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 83 drones and two ballistic missiles. Sixty-nine drones and one missile made it through, striking 34 locations.

In Sumy Oblast, a Russian glide bomb struck a local shop in the Velyka Pysarivka community, killing two women and injuring two others, the local military administration reported.

In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks killed one person and injured 10 others over the past day, the local military administration reported.

Russian forces struck Kherson's Korabelnyi district at about 9 a.m. on Dec. 11, injuring a 49-year-old man. He sustained a shrapnel wound to the arm, as well as blast trauma and a concussion.

A 41-year-old woman was also injured in the morning attack and was hospitalized in moderate condition. She suffered a concussion, blast trauma, and a closed head injury.

In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian forces targeted four settlements, killing a 69-year-old man in the village of Zamulivka, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov.

In Donetsk Oblast, one person was injured in the city of Lyman and another in the village of Rohanske. Russian strikes also injured three people in the city of Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian forces targeted the Nikopol district, injuring a 68-year-old woman and a 53-year-old man, Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko reported.

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 63-year-old man and a 71-year-old woman suffered injuries because of Russian strikes against the Polohy district, according to the local military administration.

Russian forces also targeted energy infrastructure in Odesa and Poltava oblasts overnight, though local officials have not disclosed the extent of the damage.

Russia has lost around 1,185,080 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Dec. 11.

The number includes 1,460 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,404 tanks, 23,699 armored fighting vehicles, 69,507 vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,992 artillery systems, 1,564 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,253 air defense systems, 431 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 89,148 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

The fallout from Wednesday's central bank decisions continues on both sides of the border

The Canadian dollar is on a two-day winning streak, up again today and up more than half a cent US since early Wednesday. Greenback weakness is key here, as it usually is – with the Fed cutting rates and leaving the door open to further easing a key development. But today's surprise Canadian trade surplus for September – a signal the domestic economy is weathering the trade storm reasonably well – is helping too.

All this is music to the ears of economist David Rosenberg, who at the start of this week made a significant change in his call for the Canadian dollar. A longtime bear on the loonie and the Canadian economy, Mr. Rosenberg told his clients Monday that recent trends have combined to make him bullish on the Canadian currency - and not in a subtle way. He now has a revised target of C$1.30 (77 cents US) for the loonie for 2026, and thinks this might even prove conservative. 

He raised three key points for the revised call: With Canadian inflation still sticky, the BoC easing cycle could be over at a time the Fed is likely to make additional cuts. Upward revisions to Canadian GDP suggest a smaller output gap, and productivity growth is now supporting a stronger loonie. And with fiscal and regulatory policy turning more supportive, the long-term growth outlook is brighter.

Mr. Rosenberg also thinks Canadians – specifically those participating in the ‘elbows up' movement - can take some of the credit here for supporting their own currency.

“There is this perception among the Canadian public that we have been tarred and feathered, and so while Mark Carney dropped his elbows on his reciprocal moves, domestic residents have taken matters into their own hands. Canadians have become economic vigilantes — to the benefit of the local economy. The “buy Canada” campaign is ongoing, and more tangibly, the “staycation” theme has resulted in a -22% year-over-year plunge in Canadian trips to the U.S., and a coincident double-digit growth boom in the domestic travel and tourism industry. When you look at this “staycation” theme holistically, as in all the multiplier effects that include retailers, restaurants, and hotels, this domestic travel thrust touches 4.5 million workers (20% of employment) and C$100 billion of GDP (a near-5% chunk — as big as the resource patch). And this is bullish for the loonie because what it means is that more dollars are being spent at home instead of being converted into greenbacks for the trips Canadians used to make to Palm Beach, Vegas, Scottsdale, and Manhattan — to such an extent that the travel account as part of the overall balance of payments, historically in a large deficit position, has now swung to a record of over C$10 billion at an annual rate,” Mr. Rosenberg told clients.

Most U.S. stocks are rising on Thursday, but a sell-off for Oracle is weighing on Wall Street as investors question whether its big spending on artificial-intelligence technology will pay off.

The S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent and pulled further from its all-time high, which was set in October. Drops for AI-related stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite down 1.2 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was doing much better with a gain of 465 points, or 1 per cent, as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern time.

Oracle tumbled 14.4 per cent and had briefly been on track for its worst day since 2001, when the dot-com bubble was still deflating. It reported 14% growth in revenue for the latest quarter, which came up just short of analysts' expectations, even though its profit topped forecasts.

Doubts remain about whether all the spending that Oracle is doing on AI technology will produce the payoff of increased profits and productivity that proponents are promising. Analysts said they were surprised by how much Oracle may spend on AI investments this fiscal year, and questions continue about how the company will pay for it.

Such doubts are weighing on the AI industry broadly, even as many billions of dollars continue to flow in. Those questions had helped drag the broad U.S. stock market through some sharp and scary swings last month.

Nvidia, the chip company that's become the poster child of the AI boom and is raking in close to US$20-billion each month, fell 3.6 per cent Thursday. It was the single heaviest weight on the S&P 500.

BofA Securities upgraded Visa Inc. (V-N) to a “buy” recommendation from “neutral” on Thursday, sending its shares higher.

“Following recent underperformance, we believe Visa shares offer very attractive return potential, and we are upgrading to Buy from Neutral,” analyst Mihir Bhatia said. 

“We view stablecoins as an opportunity, regulatory/litigation risks as manageable, and Visa as a premier business. Current valuation is close to a 10yr trough driven by overblown disruption concerns and a rotation into AI/risk-on stocks, in our view. We think this presents a compelling opportunity to own one of the best businesses in the world at a reasonable multiple”

Canada's main stock index rose on Thursday, as gains in mining shares outweighed a tech selloff sparked by renewed fears about lofty valuations.

Toronto's benchmark index hit a new intraday record high, and was up 0.37 per cent, or 119.03 points, at 31,608.88 points at 11:03 a.m. ET.

Gold and mining sub-indexes rose almost 2 per cent each, with both silver and copper prices hitting record highs.

“We're seeing continued strength in gold and metals. Those commodities tend to be quite buoyed and close to all-time highs. Meanwhile, energy is really selling off,” said Robert Gill, portfolio manager at Fairbank Investment Management.

“It's this time of year that portfolio managers begin to ... reposition their portfolios so that could lead to some sector rotation or the closing of underperforming positions.”

Consumer discretionary stocks rose 0.6 per cent; shares of Dollarama gained 2.3 per cent after the discount store raised its annual sales forecast, betting on resilient demand for cheaper household supplies and groceries amid still high inflation.

Technology stocks led the selloff, dropping 2 per cent after Oracle's quarterly results and forecast disappointed investors and revived concerns about an AI bubble.

Clean up in aisle 9! Empire shares (EMP-A-T) are getting clobbered this morning after quarterly results that disappointed. 

TD Cowen analyst Michael Van Aelst notes that Empire's EPS came in a penny below consensus, but suggests that actually masks weaker performance. If a one-time $8 million benefit from a litigation settlement is excluded, earnings were 4 cents below consensus. 

Thus, investors aren't impressed.

“Retail EBITDA, excluding other income, was +1% y/y vs +4% expected — this falls short of Loblaw (+7%) and Metro (+7% excl DC freezer issues),” he detailed in a first look note this morning. 

“One solid number was Food same-store sales growth, which came in at +2.5% (roughly in line with our forecast and consensus), above L's +2.0% and MRU's +1.6% (or +1.9% excluding the impact from the DC freezer issue). Keep in mind that EMP added UberEats and Instacart partnerships (Ontario in Sep/2024, Western Canada in Dec/2024, and QC and Atlantic in Mar/2025), which drove eComm growth of 81% (vs. L/MRU at 18%/20%) in the quarter and contributed an estimated 185bps to SSSG. This benefit should moderate over the coming quarters and be fully lapped by Q1/F27,” the analyst added.

Telus (T-T) investors just can't catch a break. The stock is sinking today to its lowest levels since 2013 after a downgrade from BMO. 

The stock also goes ex-dividend today - which means the stock price is reduced by the amount of the dividend being paid out - all else being equal. Even when that's factored in, the stock price is still lower. 

The Vancouver-based telecom said earlier this month that it is pausing dividend hikes until its share price “reflects growth prospects.” Its dividend yield had spiked above 9 per cent as the share price tanked, and it's still hovering there today. 

BMO analyst Tim Casey today lowered his rating to “market perform” and did a hefty slash to his price target – to $19 from $23. He notes Telus continues to trade at a premium valuation to its incumbent peers, adding “We believe the core telecom business is growing in line with peers and the outlook for TELUS Digital (now wholly-owned) is unclear.”

Meanwhile, he notes that payout ratios remain elevated compared to peers and dividend growth has been paused.

It isn't all gloom for telecom investors today though. Mr. Casey upgraded BCE (BCE-T), and its shares are rallying. For more details, call up today's Upgrades and Downgrades report.

Morgan Stanley energy analyst Devin McDermott published his outlook for 2026 on Thursday, emphasizing weakness for crude in the first half of the year. He sees a better risk-reward scenario in U.S. natural gas. 

U.S. crude prices are lower by roughly 20 per cent year-to-date while Henry Hub gas prices are up 25 per cent. Mr. McDermott likes the crude demand outlook for 2027 but expects weakness for the commodity price for at least the first half of 2026. Global oil demand is expected to grow by 0.5 million barrels per day and supply should increase by 0.7 million barrels. 

For natural gas the analyst believes supply growth, while strong enough to limit commodity price upside, is not enough to meet future demand. He expects U.S. natural gas futures to increase by 20 per cent. 

The excitement surrounding domestic natural gas is dependent on new LNG facilities opening in Kitimat B.C. next year allowing for more exports. Mr. McDermott, however, predicts a global LNG surplus next year that will depress gains. 

Of the Canadian companies Mr. McDermott covers, he rates only one as overweight/attractive – Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE-T).

North American stock indexes opened lower on Thursday as fresh worries over Oracle's hefty AI spending plans overshadow optimism over a less hawkish tone from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Toronto's S&P/TSX composite index was down 0.26 per cent at 31,410.44 points, a day after it notched a fresh record high on Wednesday, led by financial and technology shares, as policy decisions from the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve met expectations.

In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 97.04 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 48,157.04, the S&P 500 lost 29.36 points, or 0.42 per cent, to 6,857.45 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 171.04 points, or 0.71 per cent, to 23,485.26. 

Oracle slumped almost 16 per cent in early trading after its quarterly forecast fell short of analysts' estimates and the company said annual spending would climb US$15-billion compared with its earlier expectation.

Its shares are on track for their biggest quarterly loss since mid-2002 on worries that heavy reliance on debt financing could fuel an AI bubble similar to the dotcom bust of the early 2000s.

“Oracle has been the poster child for volatility and that will continue. The spending itself is stand-alone issue and part of the CapEx is a bit opaque,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth.

Bond portfolios are doing well this morning amid a second straight day of yield declines (bond prices and yields move inversely) – the U.S. 10-year is down about 6 basis points to 4.11 per cent. The Fed's rate cut on Wednesday and the general market interpretation that it will follow up with more easing in the new year is pressuring yields. So is the Fed announcing it would start buying short-term Treasuries as soon as Friday to support liquidity.

But for those contemplating shifting more money into bonds, expecting more gains to come, this is a must read this morning. Mike Dolan points out that no matter what you think is in store in 2026, it probably won't be a year of the bond. He notes we've seen a general rising of borrowing rates across the globe in recent days as investors increasingly believe that the easing cycle is nigh. They are now trying to price just when the first rate hike of the next cycle will appear on the horizon.

We're talking global here, but this trend is on full display in Canada, too. Bond traders at the moment are fully pricing in a quarter-point rate hike by the Bank of Canada by the fall of 2026. 

Sure, surprises could certainly be in store for 2026 that will change this narrative, like a much weaker-than-expected downturn in the U.S. or global economies, or the bursting of the AI bubble. But as it appears right now, allocating more to bonds next year comes with its own risks. Odds seem pretty good the bond market will yet again disappoint in the new year.

The strategy team at Scotiabank, led by Hugo Ste-Marie, have provided four quantitatively-derived trades for 2026. They expect small-cap stocks to outperform large caps on both sides of the border. In Canada, smaller metal miners are already driving small-cap returns higher relative to large caps. 

In the U.S., the team believe that stronger earnings growth will push Russell 2000 performance above the S&P 500. 

Mr. Ste-Marie believes U.S. growth at a reasonable price (GARP) stocks will outperform more expensive, AI-exposed companies. Non-tech will be supported by an improving U.S. economy that helps cyclical stocks generate double digit profit growth. 

The team's belief in high-quality domestic stocks was dashed by junior miners of copper, gold and uranium. In 2026, however, they expect quality stocks to outperform. Their list of highest quality stocks begins with Dollarama (DOL-T), Metro (MRU-T), Hydro One (H-T), Loblaw Companies (L-T) and George Weston (WN-T).

Oil prices eased on Thursday as investors shifted focus back to Russia-Ukraine peace talks and monitored potential fallout from a U.S. seizure of a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.

Brent crude futures were down 69 US cents, or 1.1 per cent, at $61.52 a barrel at 8:02 a.m. ET, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 67 US cents, or 1.2 per cent, to US$57.79 a barrel.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday that a visit to Moscow this month by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff had resolved misunderstandings between the two countries.

He added that Moscow had handed over Russia's proposals on collective security guarantees to Washington.

The benchmarks settled higher a day earlier after the U.S. said it seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, as escalating tensions between the two countries raised concerns about supply disruptions.

The research team at RBC Capital Markets provided best ideas in the global power, utilities and infrastructure sector,

“We anticipate a supportive environment to continue into 2026 via a combination of positive secular trends that impact existing footprints as well as driving an acceleration in new regulated or long[1]term contracted growth projects. This report provides our views and best stock ideas across multiple geographies (i.e., North America, Europe and Australia) and infrastructure sub-sectors (i.e., regulated utilities, power generation, midstream, clean energy and transport infrastructure). Key themes “All of the above” energy strategies should create broad-based infrastructure opportunities. Growing demand for all forms of energy should provide a tailwind for global energy infrastructure companies. In particular, we believe that companies with established infrastructure footprints and/or regulated monopolies stand to benefit the most by leveraging their asset bases to drive improved profitability as well as capture high-return growth opportunities. Customer affordability remains a key topic.”

The Canadian top picks are Altagas, Brookfield Infrastructure, Capital Power, Brookfield Renewable Partners LP, Northland Power, Keyera Corp. and Pembina Pipeline.

CIBC deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal assessed the implications of “doubling up” on the domestic housing market,

“ Doubling up, in the context of the housing market, is a situation in which extended relations, multiple ‘families”, and unrelated persons, reside within the same dwelling. Doubling up is the most common response to deteriorating housing affordability but also can be seen as shadow demand ready to be utilized in an environment of improved affordability. None of the traditional demand and affordability measures that are used frequently by policymakers incorporate doubling up into the calculation. Census data can be used to estimate the trend and relative size of the doubling up phenomenon. We suggest that an already high rate of doubling up is even higher than currently reflected in the census because of the undercounting of non-permanent residents (NPRs) and the misallocation of students — both groups with a high propensity to double-up. The practical implication here is that with the current improvement in affordability due to falling prices/rent, some of this potential demand might be released due to undoubling and might establish a price floor faster than currently anticipated”

A shopping cart is seen in an aisle of a Dollarama store in Montreal, Wednesday, June 7, 2023.Christinne Muschi/The Canadian Press

Montreal-based Dollarama (DOL-T) raised its annual sales forecast on Thursday, betting on resilient demand for affordable household supplies and groceries amid still high inflation.

Canadian consumers are increasingly seeking discounted alternatives for goods ranging from pantry staples to cleaning supplies as they look to save money, driving strong demand and traffic for dollar-store chains.

Inflation in Canada is expected to be temporarily higher in the near term, even as the economy seems to be broadly resilient to the impact of U.S. trade measures.

The company expects annual comparable sales to grow in the range of 4.2 per cent to 4.7 per cent, compared to previous expectations of a 3-per-cent to 4-per-cent rise.

Dollarama posted net sales of $1.91-billion for the third quarter ended November 2, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.87-billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The company posted net earnings per share of $1.17 per share. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of $1.10 per share.

Suncor Energy (SU-T) on Thursday forecast higher oil and gas production in 2026 as the Canadian energy producer boosts output from its oil sands assets.

The Calgary-based company expects upstream production between 840,000 and 870,000 barrels per day next year, compared with its 2025 production estimates of 810,000 to 840,000 barrels per day.

Suncor also expects capital expenditure to range between $5.6-billion and $5.8-billion in 2026, down from its forecast of $6.1-billion to $6.3-billion for 2025.

CEO Rich Kruger said the company in December increased share buybacks by 10 per cent to $275-million per month, pointing toward a projected $3.3-billion of repurchases in 2026.

Oracle (ORCL-N) shares slumped nearly 11 per cent in premarket trading on Thursday after downbeat forecasts and higher capex fanned worries that its massive AI investments are taking longer than expected to pay off.

Executives warned that capital expenditures for fiscal 2026 are now expected to be US$15-billion higher than the US$35-billion the company estimated in September during its first-quarter earnings call.

Oracle's shares have risen nearly 34 per cent this year, as mega cloud-computing deals with OpenAI and others and its plans to build large-scale AI cloud data centers helped boost sentiment.

However, investors have turned cautious, closely examining major cloud companies' earnings reports for signs of an AI bubble fueled by heavy spending, high valuations, limited real-world productivity gains, and complex circular investments.

National Bank Financial analysts Shane Nagle and Rabi Nizami see supply shortfalls supporting the near-term price outlook for copper heading into 2026, while they warn “some cracks” in the demand outlook persist.

“Supply disruptions at several major copper mines combined with stronger than expected economic activity led to a small copper deficit and support for higher copper prices throughout 2025,” they said. “We forecast a larger deficit for 2026 as supply continues to fall short of demand growth. The biggest swing factor remains Cobre-Panamá - which continues to progress towards a resolution (we model contributions by H2/27).

U.S. stock index futures tumbled on Thursday after Oracle's (ORCL-N) forecasts raised fresh concerns about hefty AI spending and outweighed optimism following a less hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve.

Oracle slumped 12 per cent in premarket trading after its quarterly forecasts missed analysts' estimates and the company said annual spending would rise by US$15-billion compared with its earlier expectations.

The cloud company had gained prominence earlier this year after announcing deals to build AI cloud data centres for OpenAI.

However, its shares were on track for their biggest quarterly loss since mid-2002 on worries that heavy reliance on debt financing could be a recipe for a bubble similar to the early 2000s.

“Oracle has been at the epicentre of the AI financing debate, lacking the mammoth cash flows of the more traditional cloud giants,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Shares of other artificial intelligence companies were also hit.

Chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom fell 1.6 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively, while hyperscalers such as Microsoft and Amazon.com dropped 1 per cent each and CoreWeave declined 3.3 per cent.

At 4:30 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were down 144 points, or 0.30 per cent, S&P 500 E-minis were down 42.5 points, or 0.62 per cent and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were down 207.5 points, or 0.80 per cent.

Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE volatility index, climbed 0.71 points and was last at 16.47.

Global markets were mixed as renewed worries over tech valuations after Oracle's weak forecast offset investor relief from the U.S. Federal Reserve's less-hawkish-than-anticipated comments after cutting interest rates.

Wall Street futures were in negative territory. Dow futures were down 0.4 per cent, S&P 500 futures fell 0.85 per cent and Nasdaq futures were 1.17 per cent lower as of 4 a.m.

TSX futures followed sentiment lower after a fresh record close yesterday.

In Canada, investors are getting results from Dollarama Inc., Empire Co. Ltd. and Lululemon Athletica Inc.

On Wall Street, markets are watching earnings from Costco Wholesale Corp. and Broadcom Inc.

“The initial positive tone from a Fed cut ... is being overshadowed by Oracle,” said ANZ's Head of Asia Research Khoon Goh. “The focus is mainly on the capex spend,” he said, which revived last month's nerves about returns on AI investment.

World shares are mixed on Thursday after the U.S. stock market again approached its record high following the Federal Reserve's cut in its main interest rate.

The Fed's rate cut was widely expected, but comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell encouraged hopes for more cuts in 2026.

However, some Asian technology companies saw sharp declines after Oracle (ORCL-N), a bellwether in the artificial intelligence sector, reported weaker than expected earnings. Its shares sank 11.5 per cent in aftermarket trading. The company's spending spree in AI has some worried about its cash flow.

“Frankly, the report was not dramatically bad, but it came to confirm concerns around heavy AI spending, financed by debt, with an unknown timeline for revenue generation,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya of Swissquote said in a commentary.

The future for the S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower.

Stocks ended higher on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point as expected and investors bet on further easing down the road, even as the central bank signalled that it will put further cuts on pause for now. Canada's main index closed at a fresh record high, tracking the advance on Wall Street.

The U.S. central bank said that before its next policy change it would look ahead for clearer signals about the direction of the job market and inflation that “remains somewhat elevated.” But projections after the Fed's two-day meeting showed median expectations for another quarter-point cut in 2026, in line with expectations at the September meeting.

And policy makers raised estimates for 2026 GDP growth to 2.3 per cent from 1.8 per cent and maintained expectations for a 4.4-per-cent unemployment rate at the end of next year. In his press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell declined to provide guidance on whether there will be another rate cut in the near future. However, investors garnered some hope for easing from his comments that the labour market has significant downside risks and that the central bank doesn't want its policy to push down on job creation.

The S&P 500 closed up 0.67 per cent and the S&P/TSX Composite 0.79 per cent. Bond yields fell in both the U.S. and Canada.

            The US Navy has submitted its recommendations on potential punishments for Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly over his participation in a video that reminded US troops they have a duty to refuse illegal orders, a Pentagon official told CNN on Thursday.
    


            Those recommendations have been submitted to the Pentagon's Office of General Counsel “where they are providing a legal review and input,” the official said.
    


            CNN has reached out to Kelly's office for comment. It was not immediately clear what recommendations were included in the report.
    


            Late last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth requested advice from the Navy Secretary, who oversees the military branch Kelly served in for more than two decades, on how to proceed to potentially punish Kelly for participating in the video, which Hegseth has claimed amounted to serious violations of the military's code of justice.
    


            “I am referring this, and any other related matters, for your review, consideration and disposition as you see fit,” Hegseth wrote in a memo to the Navy secretary, dated November 25.
    


            In the video that triggered the Trump administration's calls for consequences, six Democratic lawmakers said that “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home,” and repeatedly urged the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”
    


            Although the video didn't reference what orders service members might be receiving that would potentially be illegal, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns repeatedly about the legality of US military strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and the US military's deployment to cities over the protest of governors.
    


            The Trump administration has argued that by emphasizing service members' legal duty to disobey unlawful orders, Kelly and the other Democratic lawmakers were inciting troops to disobey lawful orders. President Donald Trump has called the video “seditious behavior at the highest level.”
    


            Kelly's involvement in the video is under “review” by the Pentagon, rather than subject to a formal investigation, meaning military police are not involved, a source familiar with Hegseth's thinking previously told CNN.
    


            Behind closed doors, Hegseth has been weighing his options to punish Kelly for participating in the video, ones that range from reducing the retired US Navy captain's rank and pension to prosecuting him under military law, CNN has reported.
    


            In his various public messages, Hegseth has suggested Kelly's comments violated several statutes of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which lays out legal requirements for those in the military.



            In Kelly, Hegseth sees a critic worth making an example of, and he could technically use the military justice system to do so, the source familiar with Hegseth's thinking said. Unlike the other five Democrats who appeared in the video, Kelly is a military retiree — meaning he served long enough to receive a pension, and thus, is still beholden to the UCMJ, including its restrictions on free speech, legal experts told CNN.
    


            Kelly could be recalled to active service and court-martialed because of that status, but doing so over his role in the video would be extraordinary, legal experts said. That's because not only has the UCMJ mainly been used in recent years to prosecute former service members who commit crimes overseas outside of US civil jurisdiction, but also because Kelly is a US senator.

            After demolishing the White House's East Wing, President Donald Trump is now eying four federal buildings for the same treatment and is circumventing a key government agency with his plans, according to a historic preservationist raising the alarm.
    


            Mydelle “Mina” Wright, a former senior official at the General Services Administration, wrote in a sworn court declaration this week that the White House is “acting on its own and not through the GSA,” which oversees government property, to solicit bids “to analyze and recommend for demolition four historic federal buildings in DC.” The administration, though, asserted in a court filing that the government was contemplating transferring ownership of the buildings, not destroying them.
    


            The buildings in question — many of which feature architectural styles that don't fit Trump's stated preferences — include the Robert C. Weaver Building, which serves as headquarters of the Department of Housing and Urban Development; the New Deal-era Wilbur J. Cohen Federal Building; the GSA Regional Office Building; and the Liberty Loan Building, although the GSA announced plans to dispose of that building last year, which could include transferring control to a new owner.
    


            In a court filing Wednesday evening responding to the declaration, the Trump administration called Wright's assertions “impermissible and factually inaccurate.”
    


            “It is based on hearsay, not personal knowledge, and it is wrong,” principal deputy assistant attorney general Adam Gustafson and deputy chief Marissa Piropato wrote.
    


            GSA, they said, “is currently evaluating those assets not for demolition but for disposal—meaning conveyance out of federal ownership,” adding that GSA is following the necessary regulations.
    


            The White House did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Since returning to the White House this year, Trump has leaned into his background as a real estate developer and has taken major steps to apply his vision to Washington: paving over the White House Rose Garden and decorating it to mirror his Mar-a-Lago patio; adorning the Oval Office, Cabinet Room and West Colonnade with gilded features; and launching construction of a $300 million ballroom that he says is privately funded.
    


            But his new plans, Wright said in her declaration, present an “untenable situation” for GSA leadership attempting to navigate the president's hands-on involvement.
    


            “For the first time of which I am aware, a President is personally involved in facilitating end-runs around the agency's obligations to the buildings that are our national heritage, and who in the agency is going to tell him ‘No?'” said Wright, who added that she first learned of the effort Friday and that it only recently came to the attention of key GSA officials, who usually have to work within strict legal guidelines and historic preservation and environmental policy.
    


            As he attempts to put his mark on the nation's capital — from Kennedy Center renovations to plans for a new triumphal arch and stadium — Trump is taking aim at buildings with historical significance, preservationists warn.
    


            The Weaver building follows former President John F. Kennedy's “Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture” and is on the National Register of Historic Places. But its precast concrete is an example of the brutalist architecture of the 1960s — for which Trump has made his distaste known.
    


            Earlier this year, the president signed an executive order mandating that all federal buildings “embrace classical architecture,” specifically targeting modernist and brutalist buildings.
    


            The Cohen building features New Deal murals and sculpture and is an example of Egyptian Revival and Stripped Classicism architecture, according to the GSA. Historian Michael Austin has warned that Liberty Loan, an example of “tempo” federal buildings that popped up in the 20th century, is an “irreplaceable piece of Washington history.” The GSA Regional Office Building is another New Deal-era building.
    


            Wright's declaration comes amid a broader court battle over Trump's efforts to paint the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, a sprawling and ornate federal building next door to the White House.
    


            In an interview last month, Trump told Fox News he was exploring painting the distinctive building a bright white, adding, “Gray is for funerals.”
    


            A group of preservationists sued Trump to halt any changes to the building unless a standard review process is followed, warning the structure could be “irreversibly damaged.”
    


            In a hearing this week, the Trump administration argued that the EEOB was exempt from that review process, but agreed to refrain from any painting until March amid the ongoing the legal process.
    


            Meanwhile, Trump's renovation and construction projects continue at the White House. Last week, he hired a new architect for the ballroom amid disputes with the project's original architect over its size and scope.
    


            The project has drawn outcry from preservationists for the administration's failure to seek approval from the commission overseeing construction on federal buildings before demolition. The White House has said it will submit plans for the ballroom construction to the National Capital Planning Commission, but it insisted the body doesn't have purview over the East Wing.

            When an ancient ship was unearthed in Scandinavia over 100 years ago, archaeologists started to uncover bits and pieces of its history.
    


            On board the plank-built vessel was a hoard of weapons — swords, spears, shields and more — revealing a tale of warriors who attempted to attack the Danish island of Als and were ultimately defeated. The island's defenders sank the ship in a bog, where it remained until its discovery and excavation over two millennia later.
    


            But there were still lingering questions, such as where the invaders came from and when. Now, a new study may bring scientists one step closer to uncovering the mysterious origin of the famous vessel known as the Hjortspring boat.
    


            The findings, which were published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, provide radiocarbon dating data as well as an analysis of building material, suggesting the boat traveled farther than previously thought.
    


Archaeologists find earliest known fire made by humans



            “Our work has provided an important new clue for the mystery of where the raiders in the boat came from,” said lead author Mikael Fauvelle, an associate professor and researcher in the department of archaeology and ancient history at Lund University in Sweden.
    


            “During the Bronze Age, Scandinavians needed to travel by sea to trade for copper and tin, which were needed to make bronze and were not mined in the Nordic region at the time,” Fauvelle said in an email. “The Hjortspring boat, therefore, represents the end result of one of Scandinavia's early maritime cultures.
    


            “Studying the boat gives us critical information not only about early Iron Age seafaring, but also information about seafaring in the preceding Bronze Age.”
    


            The researchers also uncovered something unexpected: a partial human fingerprint found on tar fragments on the boat, which one of the original seafarers may have made. According to Fauvelle, the fingerprint was a rare find that could provide a direct link to someone who had used the ancient boat.
    


            Before its sinking, the Hjortspring boat was nearly 20 meters (about 66 feet) long and could hold up to 24 men. The boat, which is currently on display at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, is made up of a bottom plank sewn together with two side planks, and a curved extension at each end.
    


            The ship is thought to be the oldest preserved plank-built boat of Northern Europe and is evidence of the advanced shipbuilding technology of Scandinavia's early Iron Age, said study coauthor Flemming Kaul, a senior researcher and curator of the prehistory collections at the National Museum of Denmark.
    


            Shortly after the boat's excavation in the early 1920s, extensive studies were carried out to determine where the invaders came from. It wasn't until 2024, when the authors of the new study analyzed previously unexamined caulking — a sealant material that makes a boat watertight — and cordage (rope and twine) found with the boat, that the first new major clue in over a century was uncovered.
    


An ancient stone staircase seemed to lead nowhere. Now it's revealing the ‘lost Pompeii'



            It was previously assumed that the caulking was made from local materials such as linseed oil or tallow (cow fat), but the researchers found that the material instead to consist of a mixture of animal fat and pine pitch, or dried sap from pine trees.
    


            During this period, Denmark had few pine forests, suggesting that the boat may have been built in a different region, such as the coastal areas along the Baltic Sea that did have pine forests. If the warriors came from that direction, it would suggest they traveled a long distance and could indicate that the attack was organized and premeditated, according to the study.
    


            The new clue “shows that the Scandinavian seafaring tradition of raiding and trading, most famously associated with the Viking age, has very deep roots that go back thousands of years to the early Iron and Bronze Ages,” Fauvelle said. “It also shows that ancient Scandinavia was a very interconnected region. Much like today, political conflicts and alliances transcended regional boundaries and people must have had both contacts with each other over considerable distances.”
    


            Ole Kastholm, a specialist in ancient Scandinavian seafaring and a senior researcher at the Roskilde Museum in Denmark,  found the unexpected use of pine pitch for caulking to be exciting. Kastholm, who was not involved with the new study, agrees with the authors' suggestion that the Hjortspring boat could have come from around the Baltic Sea.
    


            “We have a modern tendency to underestimate the people of the past and their achievements — but they actually rowed and paddled in small, open vessels across the North Sea, Skagerrak and the Baltic Sea. This could have been in logboats, and in smaller plank-built boats such as the Hjortspring Boat,” Kastholm said in an email.
    


            “The study also shows how important it is that we in our museum-collections take care of old artefacts,” he added. “When the Hjortspring Boat was excavated in 1921, one could not have known that 100 years later there would be a number of highly specialized methods that would be able to extract knowledge from even the most insignificant pieces from the excavation. Hopefully one day we are able to pin down the exact geographical origin of this unique vessel.”
    


            When the study authors pulled the caulking fragments from the archive, they also came across some intact cordage, an unexpected find that allowed for radiocarbon dating to be performed.
    


            This modern dating method did not exist at the time of the boat's excavation, and even after the technique was developed it could not be applied to the vessel's wood planks due to the chemicals used to preserve them for museum display. But from the cordage, it was determined that the vessel was from the fourth or third century BC, which lines up with previous datings, the authors noted.
    


            And then there was the partial fingerprint from the boat, which was the icing on the cake, as “fingerprints are very rare for this time period and area,” Fauvelle said. A few other fingerprints have been found in tar, “but they all come from different time periods and very different contexts. To find one on such a unique boat is extremely special,” he added.
    


Mystery foot fossil may shake up human family tree



            While the new clues may provide important background about the warriors, the authors hope further research can one day solve the mystery of the ship's origin. In pursuit of answers, they are studying X-ray scans of the wood that might reveal tree rings, Fauvelle said. He also said the team hopes to extract ancient DNA from the tars, which could help pinpoint the origin of the raiders.
    


            “The Hjortspring boat and the Hjortspring find (with its many weapons) gives evidence as to conflict and strategy during the Early Iron Age of Northern Europe,” Kaul said in an email.
    


            “It is important to continue such studies in order to understand how maritime history is a crucial part of the history (prehistory) of South Scandinavia, where the sea, the fjords, connect the lands. And in the case of Hjortspring, it could be underlined that maritime history is also naval history,” Kaul added. “The control of the Baltic Sea, and the (trade) routes, was as important in the Early Iron Age as it is today.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defiantly defended the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies on Thursday during a House committee hearing, portraying migrants as a major threat faced by the nation that justifies a crackdown that has seen widespread arrests, deportations and a dizzying pace of restrictions on foreigners.

Noem, who heads the agency central to President Donald Trump's approach to immigration, received backup from Republicans on the panel but fierce questioning from Democrats who called for her resignation. The secretary, whose testimony was interrupted by protesters calling for an end to deportations, vowed she “would not back down.”

Noem, who was testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,” emphasized in her remarks how big a role she believed immigration played in those threats to the country. Her remarks, and the Democrats' questioning, focused heavily on the Trump administration's immigration policies, whereas in years past the hearing has centered on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. 

“What keeps me up at night is that we don't necessarily know all of the people that are in this country, who they are and what their intentions are,” Noem said. She said that was why Trump's administration was being “so aggressive” in “finding those people who shouldn't be in this country to begin with.”

Trump returned to power in January with what he says is a mandate to reshape immigration in the U.S., claiming the country is under an invasion.




In the months since, the number of people in immigration detention has skyrocketed; the administration has continued to remove migrants to countries they are not from; and, in the wake of an Afghan national being accused of shooting two National Guard troops, Noem's department has dramatically stepped up checks and screening of immigrants in the U.S.

Rep. Bennie Thompson, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, told Noem that she has diverted vast resources to carry out Trump's “extreme” immigration agenda and failed to provide basic responses to oversight questions from Congress.

“I call on you to resign,” the Mississippi congressman said. “Do a real service to the country.”

Noem did not address Thompson's call during her opening statement but suggested that she and the department she leads weren't going anywhere.

“We will never yield. We will never waver, and we will never back down,” she said. She praised the Trump administration's efforts when it comes to immigration, saying, “We're ending illegal immigration, returning sanity to our immigration system.”

It has been months since Noem last appeared in Congress in May. Since then, immigration enforcement operations, especially in Los Angeles and Chicago, have become increasingly contentious, with federal agents and activists frequently clashing over her department's tactics. 

Her testimony was interrupted by protesters shouting “Stop ICE raids” and “End deportations.”

The worldwide threats hearing, usually held annually, is an opportunity for members of Congress to ask the leaders of the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center about threats facing the U.S. and what their agencies are doing to address them. 

The hearing offered lawmakers a rare opportunity to hear directly from Noem, but many members of the panel used the bulk of their allotted time to either praise or lambast her handling of immigration enforcement rather than ask questions designed to elicit expansive and illuminating responses.

The secretary levied broad criticism for the program through which the man suspected of shooting two National Guard members last month came to the United States.

The program, Operation Allies Welcome, was created by then-President Joe Biden's Democratic administration after the 2021 decision to leave Afghanistan following 20 years of American intervention and billions of dollars in aid.

Noem's department is under particular scrutiny because Congress in July passed legislation giving it roughly $165 billion to carry out its mass deportations agenda and secure the border. The department is getting more money to hire 10,000 more deportation officers, complete the wall between the U.S. and Mexico and increase detention and removal of foreigners from the country. 

The secretary's appearance also comes as a federal judge is investigating whether she should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador. 

Noem will also likely have to answer to criticism from Democrats who accuse immigration enforcement agents of erroneously detaining and arresting American citizens in their rush to deport as many people in the country illegally as possible. And a number of the Democratic members of the committee are part of a lawsuit accusing Noem and the department of limiting their access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities.

Also attending Thursday's hearing are Joseph Kent, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, and Michael Glasheen, operations director of the national security branch of the FBI.

Glasheen, operations director of the FBI's national security branch, said the nation faces “serious and evolving” threats, from terrorism plots and foreign intelligence operatives to sophisticated cyberattacks and internet-enabled exploitation of children. Notably, he did not identify immigration as among the most pressing concerns for the homeland.

When the hearing was announced in September, the Republican committee chair said that besides Noem and Kent, FBI Director Kash Patel would also be attending. But instead the FBI is being represented by Glasheen.

Thompson said during his opening statement that he felt the FBI director should also be appearing at the hearing alongside Noem, saying he “can't help but notice” Patel's absence.

Patel appeared to be out of the country on official FBI business. Late Wednesday on X, Patel posted that he was in Brussels for a “great” meeting with Matt Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's approval on the economy and immigration have fallen substantially since March, according to a new AP-NORC poll, the latest indication that two signature issues that got him elected barely a year ago could be turning into liabilities as his party begins to gear up for the 2026 midterms.

Only 31% of U.S. adults now approve of how Trump is handling the economy, the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds. That is down from 40% in March and marks the lowest economic approval he's registered in an AP-NORC poll in his first or second term. The Republican president also has struggled to recover from public blowback on other issues, such as his management of the federal government, and has not seen an approval bump even after congressional Democrats effectively capitulated to end a record-long government shutdown last month.




Perhaps most worryingly for Trump, who's become increasingly synonymous with his party, he's slipped on issues that were major strengths. Just a few months ago, 53% of Americans approved of Trump's handling of crime, but that's fallen to 43% in the new poll. There's been a similar decline on immigration, from 49% approval in March to 38% now. 




The new poll starkly illustrates how Trump has struggled to hold onto political wins since his return to office. Even border security — an issue on which his approval remains relatively high — has declined slightly in recent months. 




The good news for Trump is that his overall approval hasn't fallen as steeply. The new poll found that 36% of Americans approve of the way he's handling his job as president, which is down slightly from 42% in March. That signals that even if some people aren't happy with elements of his approach, they might not be ready to say he's doing a bad job as president. And while discontent is increasing among Republicans on certain issues, they're largely still behind him.




Republicans are more unhappy with Trump's performance on the economy than they were in the first few months of his term. About 7 in 10 Republicans, 69%, approve of how Trump is handling the economy in the December poll, a decline from 78% in March.




Larry Reynolds, a 74-year-old retiree and Republican voter from Wadsworth, Ohio, said he believes in Trump's plan to impose import duties on U.S. trading partners but thinks rates have spiraled too high, creating a “vicious circle now where they aren't really justifying the tariffs.”

Reynolds said he also believes that inflation became a problem during the coronavirus pandemic and that the economy won't quickly recover, regardless of what Trump does. “I don't think it'll be anything really soon. I think it's just going to take time,” he said. 

Trump's base is still largely behind him, which was not always the case for his predecessor, President Joe Biden, a Democrat. In the summer of 2022, only about half of Democrats approved of how Biden was handling the economy. Shortly before he withdrew from the 2024 presidential race two years later, that had risen to about two-thirds of Democrats.

More broadly, though, there's no sign that Americans think the economy has improved since Trump took over. About two-thirds of U.S. adults, 68%, continue to say the country's economy is “poor.” That's unchanged from the last time the question was asked in October, and it's broadly in line with views throughout Biden's last year in office.

Trump's approval ratings on immigration have declined since March, but border security remains a relatively strong issue for him. Half of U.S. adults, 50%, approve of how Trump is handling border security, which is just slightly lower than the 55% who approved in September. 

Trump's relative strength on border security is partially driven by Democrats and independents. About one-third of independents, 36%, approve of Trump on the border, while 26% approve on immigration. 

Jim Rollins, an 82-year-old independent in Macon, Georgia, said he believes that when it comes to closing the border, Trump has done “a good job,” but he hopes the administration will rethink its mass deportation efforts.

“Taking people out of kindergarten, and people going home for Thanksgiving, taking them off a plane. If they are criminals, sure,” said Rollins, who said he supported Trump in his first election but not since then. “But the percentages — based on the government's own statistics — say that they're not criminals. They just didn't register, and maybe they sneaked across the border, and they've been here for 15 years.” 

Other polls have shown it's more popular to increase border security than to deport immigrants, even those who are living in the country illegally. Nearly half of Americans said increasing security at the U.S.-Mexico border should be “a high priority” for the government in AP-NORC polling from September. Only about 3 in 10 said the same about deporting immigrants in the U.S. illegally.

Shaniqwa Copeland, a 30-year-old independent and home health aide in St. Augustine, Florida, said she approves of Trump's overall handling of the presidency but believes his immigration actions have gone too far, especially when it comes to masked federal agents leading large raids. 

“Now they're just picking up anybody,” Copeland said. “They just like, pick up people, grabbing anybody. It's crazy.” 

About 3 in 10 U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling health care, down slightly from November. The new poll was conducted in early December, as Trump and Congress struggled to find a bipartisan deal for extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies that will expire at the end of this month. 

That health care fight was also the source of the recent government shutdown. About one-third of U.S. adults, 35%, approve of how Trump is managing the federal government, down from 43% in March. 

But some Americans may see others at fault for the country's problems, in addition to Trump. Copeland is unhappy with the country's health care system and thinks things are getting worse but is not sure of whether to blame Trump or Biden.

“A couple years ago, I could find a dentist and it would be easy. Now, I have a different health care provider, and it's like so hard to find a dental (plan) with them,” she said. “And the people that do take that insurance, they have so many scheduled out far, far appointments because it's so many people on it.”

The Senate on Thursday rejected two partisan health bills on expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, essentially guaranteeing that millions of Americans will see a steep rise in costs when the subsidies run dry on Jan. 1.

The Democratic bill would've extended the COVID-era tax credits for three years, while the GOP alternative would've replaced them with new health savings accounts.

Less than an hour after the legislation failed, White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt said President Donald Trump is “prepared to take action on health care.”

Despite the potential for bipartisan agreement, the parties never engaged in serious negotiations on the issue — even after a small group of centrist Democrats struck a deal with Republicans last month to end the 43-day government shutdown in exchange for a vote on extending the subsidies.

Other news we're following: 








Asked if the seizure of a Venezuelan tanker was a one-off or if the U.S. might take similar actions in the future, Leavitt said she wouldn't broadcast future military plans.

But she added, “We're not going to stand by and watch sanctioned vessels sail the seas with black market oil, the proceeds of which will fuel narcoterrorism of rogue and illegitimate regimes around the world.”

The White House has maintained that the tanker seized was carrying oil set to be sold in violation of international sanctions.

Leavitt added that the Trump administration is “executing on the president's sanctions policies” and defending the sanctions policies of the U.S.

Leavitt said the president was trying to defend his tariffs when he said at a rally Tuesday that Americans should buy fewer dolls and pencils for their children.

Trump was saying his tariffs are bringing back factory jobs and products made domestically might cost more, Leavitt said.

“Maybe you'll pay a dollar or two more, but you will get better quality and you'll be supporting your fellow Americans by buying American,” Leavitt said. “And that's what the president was saying.”

The answer reflected some of the challenges that the administration faces on the import taxes imposed by Trump, which most economists say have added to inflationary pressures.

The White House has previously maintained that foreign countries would pay the taxes and that there would be little to no inflation domestically.

Leavitt said discussions continue and the U.S. could send a representative to those discussions as soon as this weekend “if there is a real chance of signing a peace agreement.” 

But she added that it's “still up in the air whether real peace can be achieved.”

Trump took office in January suggesting he could solve Russia's war in Ukraine quickly but has spent months complaining bitterly about a lack of progress. Leavitt said the president is “extremely frustrated with both sides of this war.”

“And he's sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting,” Leavitt said. “He doesn't want any more talk. He wants action.”

Leavitt says the U.S. government “does intend to seize the oil” from a tanker that U.S. forces took Wednesday off the coast of Venezuela.

Leavitt said the Justice Department had received a warrant to take the tanker because it's a sanctioned vessel used to carry “black market” oil.

She said the U.S. has an investigative team on the tanker. The team is interviewing the people aboard the ship and collecting any relevant evidence.

Leavitt said the U.S. government will follow the legal process required to seize the available oil.

Karoline Leavitt was asked about the looming expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies after the Senate's rejection of legislation that would have extended the tax credits.

The briefing came just after the chamber rejected a Democratic bill to extend the subsidies for three years and a Republican alternative that would have created new health savings accounts.

Also blaming Democrats for the Obama-era health care bill, which she noted was passed “without a single Republican vote,” Leavitt argued that Democrats had “ballooned” the program “with these expensive COVID subsidies that completely distorted the health insurance market.”

The rejection essentially guarantees that millions of Americans will see a steep rise in costs at the beginning of the year. 

Senators rejected a Democratic bill to extend the subsidies for three years and a Republican alternative that would have created new health savings accounts Thursday. 

It's an unceremonious end to a monthslong effort by Democrats to prevent the COVID-19-era subsidies from expiring on Jan. 1. 

Ahead of the votes, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans that if they did not vote to extend the tax credits, “there won't be another chance to act,” before premiums rise for many people.

Republicans have argued that Affordable Care Act plans are too expensive and need to be overhauled.

A presidentially appointed council's long-awaited public meeting to announce recommended reforms to the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been canceled at the last minute, according to a source familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the change publicly.

The FEMA Review Council was scheduled to meet Thursday afternoon. Noem, the council's co-chair, abruptly left a congressional hearing early because she said she needed to go the meeting.

Trump created the FEMA Review Council by executive order in late January, the same day he proposed eliminating FEMA. He has repeatedly said he wants to push more responsibility for disaster recovery to states.

The White House, Department of Homeland Security and FEMA did not respond to questions about the meeting's cancelation.

Delia Ramirez, a Democrat from Illinois, accused Noem's department of waging an “unaccountable, unlawful, unconstitutional” war against communities across the country.

Ramirez showed a number of videos of Noem talking and then repeatedly accused her of lying.

“Secretary Noem, you lie and you lie to the American people,” Ramirez said.

In one video, Noem said the agency focused on people in the country illegally, not American citizens while in another Noem said they were focusing on the “worst of the worst.”

Ramirez disputed those characterizations and said Noem lied with “impunity.”

The Senate has rejected a Republican bill to replace expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies with new health savings accounts. The legislation was a Republican alternative to Democratic legislation to extend the subsidies for three years.

Senators are now voting on the Democratic bill and are expected to reject it — meaning that the subsidies are likely to expire.

Noem defended the cancelation of billions of dollars in mitigation grants administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, saying the grants had been “weaponized to fund the Green New Deal and for climate change.”

The Trump administration in April canceled $3.6 billion in grants under the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, created under the first Trump administration to help communities harden infrastructure to mitigate damage from climate disasters. 

Noem said FEMA is “deploying resources two times faster on average, than in history,” though a policy that she personally approve DHS expenditures of $100,000 or more has been widely criticized for slowing deployment of FEMA services and dollars.

Secretary Noem has left the hearing early.

Noem said she had to go to another meeting of a council that is offering suggestions on how to reform the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

As she walked out, Julie Johnson, a Democrat from Texas who was slated to question the secretary next, joked: “I'm just going to take the position that she was scared of my questions.”

As Noem walked out of the room, protesters trailed her down the hallway yelling “Shame on you!”

But Trump administration officials declined to make commitments on what authorities the president may use in the future to send National Guard troops from one state to another.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, used the closing moments of the hearing to press the officials on whether National Guard troops will be deployed from other states beyond their current authority to protect federal facilities and officials, such as to conduct law enforcement activity. 

Federal judges have blocked or limited troop deployments in Oregon, Illinois and California as the Trump administration has attempted to use troops to assist in its mass deportation goals.

Mark Ditlevson, a Trump administration official who oversees homeland defense, only said that any orders would be evaluated to make sure they are “100% legal.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed solidarity with Maduro and told him “direct communication channels” between the countries “remain permanently open,” a Venezuelan government statement said.

Talking a day after the U.S. military seized an oil tanker off the Venezuela's coast, Putin told Maduro that “Russia will continue to support Venezuela in its struggle to assert its sovereignty, international law, and peace throughout Latin America, making its diplomatic capabilities available to strengthen cooperation in these essential areas,” the Venezuelan government said.

The Kremlin said both leaders also discussed developing friendly bilateral ties and their commitment to joint projects in trade, economic, energy, financial, cultural, humanitarian, and other areas.

The Senate is voting on Republican legislation that would create new health savings accounts as health care subsidies for millions of Americans are set to expire Jan. 1.

The Senate is expected to reject the legislation, along with a second Democratic bill that would extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. 

Republicans say the savings accounts would replace the subsidies by giving money directly to consumers, instead of to insurance companies. Democrats say the GOP plan would lead to higher costs for consumers. 

Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned that premiums will skyrocket unless Congress passes an extension of the subsidies. “If Republicans don't climb aboard, there won't be another chance to act,” Schumer said ahead of the votes.

Noem linked the seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast to the Trump administration's efforts to push back on “a regime that is systematically ... flooding our country with deadly drugs.” She said Trump administration officials had seized “enough lethal doses of cocaine to kill 177 million Americans.”

On Wednesday, Trump said the United States had seized the tanker as tensions mount with the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. 

Trump has broadly justified a regional military buildup and a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean as necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S.

House Democratic identified members of the audience they said had family members who had been improperly treated by the immigration system.

Noem said she would review the cases of several called out by Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island. One, a combat veteran, appeared on a screen via a video call. Magaziner said the Purple Heart recipient had been deported earlier this year.

“You don't seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys,” Magaziner said to Noem.

Trump's zero-tolerance immigration policy split more than 5,000 children from their families at the Mexico border during his first term, when images of babies and toddlers taken from the arms of mothers sparked global condemnation. Seven years later, families are being separated but in a much different way. 

With illegal border crossings at their lowest levels in seven decades, a push for mass deportations is dividing families of mixed legal status inside the U.S. Federal officials and their local law enforcement partners are detaining tens of thousands of asylum-seekers and migrants. Detainees are moved repeatedly, then deported, or held in poor conditions for weeks or months before asking to go home.

The federal government was holding an average of more than 66,000 people in November, the highest on record.

Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said Thursday that “decisive” actions by the United States, including the seizure of an oil tanker, have left the repressive government of President Nicolás Maduro at its weakest point, and she vowed to return to the country to keep fighting for democracy.

Machado's statements to reporters came hours after she appeared in public for the first time in 11 months, following her arrival in Norway's capital, Oslo, where her daughter received the Nobel Peace Prize award on her behalf on Wednesday.

Trump's actions “have been decisive to reach where we are now, where the regime is significantly weaker,” she said. “Because before, the regime thought it had impunity …. Now they start to understand that this is serious, and that the world is watching.”

Machado sidestepped questions on whether a U.S. military intervention is necessary to remove Maduro from power

Thompson repeatedly asked Michael Glasheen, operations director of the national security branch of the FBI, about how the Trump administration came to classify the decentralized antifa movement as a domestic terrorist organization. He asked for details on where the group is headquartered, and how many people are involved.

Trump announced he had made that designation earlier this year, in a crackdown on leftists after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Glasheen said officials were “building out the infrastructure” to investigate the group but offered no details as Thompson doubled down.

Mike Lindell, the fervent supporter of President Donald Trump known to TV viewers as the “MyPillow Guy,” officially entered the race for Minnesota governor Thursday in hopes of winning the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic Gov. Tim Walz.

“I'll leave no town unturned in Minnesota,” Lindell told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of a news conference set for Thursday.

He said he has a record of solving problems and personal experiences that will help businesses and fight addiction and homelessness as well as fraud in government programs.

The hearing quickly became heated over the tragic shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C.

Thompson had begun questioning Noem over what he called the “unfortunate accident” when the secretary interrupted the ranking Democrat.

“Unfortunate accident?” Noem retorted. She called it a “terrorist attack.”

The interaction devolved from there as Thompson questioned her department's approval of asylum claim that allowed the suspect to stay in the U.S.

Noem insisted it was the Biden administration's vetting process that failed to properly screen the man who had worked alongside the U.S. military in Afghanistan.

Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee zeroed in Thursday on Trump's statements that an “invasion within” or an “enemy within” justifies his guard deployments.

Gen. Gregory Guillot, who leads the military's Northern Command, said “I do not have any indications of an enemy within.” 

Charles Young, principal deputy general counsel for the Defense Department, said the Supreme Court has ruled that the president has the exclusive authority to decide whether an emergency exists.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL officer, argued during a Senate hearing that transnational crimes present enough of a risk to national security to justify military action, including on U.S. soil.

Sheehy claimed that there are foreign powers “actively attacking this country, using illegal immigration, using transnational crime, using drugs to do so.”

Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot agreed with Sheehy's assessment.

An attorney for the Pentagon declined to offer a clear answer when asked if a president could lawfully order the military to shoot protesters.

During a hearing Thursday on National Guard deployments in U.S. cities, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, noted that former Defense Secretary Mark Esper alleged that Trump inquired about shooting protesters during the George Floyd demonstrations.

Hirono asked Charles L. Young III, principal deputy general counsel at the defense department, whether a presidential order to shoot protesters would be lawful.

Young said he was unaware of Trump's comments and responded that the answer “would depend on the circumstances.”

“We have a president who doesn't think the rule of law applies to him,” Hirono said in response.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must release Abrego Garcia from custody immediately.

“Since Abrego Garcia's return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,” the judge wrote. “For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia's Petition for immediate release from ICE custody.” 

The Salvadoran national has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge in 2019 ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose Trump's immigration crackdown.

Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, raised concerns that National Guard troops deployed to U.S. cities don't receive training on how to handle situations where someone is having a mental health episode, saying that many police officers frequently encounter such situations and receive extensive training on how to handle them.

Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the commander of U.S. troops in North America, said that National Guard troops are trained to de-escalate tense interactions with people, but don't receive any specific training on mental health episodes.

The secretary also levied broad criticism of the program that brought the man to the United States years before he allegedly shot two National Guard members.

Operation Allies Welcome was created by the Biden administration to save Afghan supporters from Taliban retribution after the U.S. military pullout from Afghanistan following 20 years of American intervention and billions of dollars of aid.

Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, was killed in the Washington shooting. Noem said Thursday that U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, has been showing improvement.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who was also shot during the confrontation, has been charged with murder. He pleaded not guilty.

The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed, questioned Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the commander of U.S. troops in North America, on how he evaluates the lawfulness of orders.

Guillot said that he consults with military attorneys, raises any questions with the defense secretary and commanding military officers, and executes the order once he's confident in its lawfulness.

This has become a pressing question under the Trump administration amid National Guard deployments to U.S. cities and a campaign to strike boats allegedly carrying drugs near Venezuela. The president has targeted Democratic lawmakers who released a video urging military and intelligence officers to refuse illegal orders.

“End deportations!” shouts one. “Stop ICE raids!” yells another.

The two people were escorted by Capitol Police out of the Homeland Security Committee hearing room.

Chairman Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., gaveled the panel back to order as Noem resumed her opening remarks.

Rep. Bennie Thompson, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, told the secretary she has diverted vast resources to carry out Trump's “extreme” immigration agenda, and failed to provide basic responses to oversight questions from Congress.

“I call on you to resign,” the Mississippi congressman said. “Do a real service to the country.”

Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi said in an opening statement that FBI Director Kash Patel should also be appearing at the hearing alongside Noem, saying he “can't help but notice” Patel's absence.

Patel appeared to be out of the country on official FBI business. Late Wednesday on X, Patel posted that he was in Brussels for a “great” meeting with Matt Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO.

Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the commander of U.S. troops in North America, told senators that National Guard troops are instructed not to perform many law enforcement activities like making arrests or searching for evidence of a crime. However, the troops are allowed to detain people if they deem the person to be putting others at risk.

Guillot said that one person was detained as part of Trump's campaign to deploy National Guard troops to U.S. cities. The person was detained in June outside a federal facility in Los Angeles.

“Stop terrorizing our communities,” one person shouted as the secretary entered.

Noem greeted some others in the audience.

One protester was singing the song from Star Wars that had been used to follow law enforcement officers as the agency conducts mass immigration raids and patrols city streets.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to face fierce questioning from Democrats Thursday as the public face of the Republican administration's hard-line approach to immigration.

Since Noem last appeared in Congress in May, immigration enforcement operations in U.S. cities have become increasingly contentious, with federal agents and activists frequently clashing over her department's tactics.

Noem is testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,” which in years past have focused on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. Thursday's appearance is likely to focus heavily on immigration.

This hearing is the highest level of scrutiny to Trump's use of the National Guard outside of a courtroom since the deployments began and comes a day after the president faced another legal setback over his muscular use of troops in larger federal operations. Trump has justified the use of the military in American cities by saying the National Guard is needed to support federal law enforcement, protect federal facilities and combat crime.

The hearing comes two weeks after two West Virginia National Guard members deployed to Washington were shot just blocks from the White House in what the city's mayor described as a targeted attack. Spc. Sarah Beckstrom died a day after the Nov. 26 shooting, and her funeral took place Tuesday. Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe is still hospitalized in Washington.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said Trump's deployment of the National Guard into American cities is “deeply unpopular.” 

“Most Americans don't want this,” she said at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, adding that most of the Guard members don't want these assignments, either.

“Our heroes did not sign up for this,” said Duckworth, a combat veteran who served in the Illinois National Guard.

She noted that she had threatened to hold up the annual defense bill if Republican leadership continued to block the hearing, which she said is long overdue. She said she has questions for the military about how Trump's deployments are affecting readiness, training and costs.

The Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee is opening a hearing on Trump's National Guard troop deployment to U.S. cities by asserting that crime is on the rise. 

“In recent years, violent crime, rioting, drug trafficking and heinous gang activity have steadily escalated,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican.

He added that the troop deployments are “not only appropriate, but essential.”

Democrats are expected to use the hearing to criticize the deployments as an inappropriate use of military troops.

U.S. jobless claim applications for the week ending Dec. 6 climbed by 44,000 from the previous week's 192,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That's more than analysts' forecast of 213,000.

The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Nov. 29 fell by 99,000 to 1.84 million, the government said. That's the lowest level for continuing claims since mid-April.

Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Overall layoffs have been muted despite recent high-profile job cuts. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state.

The U.S. trade deficit fell for the second straight month in September, dropping to the lowest since June 2020 when global commerce was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the deficit — the gap between what the United States sells other countries and what it buys from them — dropped nearly 11% to $52.8 billion in September. It had fallen more than 23% from July to August.

Still, the U.S. trade deficit is up so far in 2025, coming in at $765.1 billion through September, up 17% from $652.6 billion in January-September 2024. Many companies imported foreign goods early in 2025 to get ahead of Trump's tariffs.

The outcome of Thursday's state Senate vote remains uncertain despite months of pressure from Trump to remap Indiana's House districts in ways that could give the GOP control of all nine seats. Even in the face of one-on-one pressure from the White House and violent threats against state lawmakers, many Indiana Republicans have been reluctant to back a new congressional map that would split the city of Indianapolis into four districts.

Democrats are increasingly liking their odds at flipping control of the U.S. House after the results of recent high-profile elections. Trump is threatening to back primary challengers for any GOP state senator who votes against the Republican remap. “If Republicans will not do what is necessary to save our Country, they will eventually lose everything to the Democrats,” Trump wrote on social media.

Trump's approval ratings on immigration have declined since March, but border security remains a relatively strong issue for him.




Half of U.S. adults, 50%, approve of how Trump is handling border security, according to a new AP-NORC poll. Just 38% currently approve of how he's handling the issue of immigration.

Trump's relative strength on border security is partially driven by Democrats and independents, who are less likely to approve of his immigration approach. Other polls have shown these groups tend to prioritize increasing border security more than deporting immigrants, even those who are living in the country illegally.

Shaniqwa Copeland, a 30-year-old independent and home health aide in St. Augustine, Florida, said she approves of Trump's overall handling of the presidency, but believes his immigration actions have gone too far.

“Now they're just picking up anybody,” Copeland told the AP. “They just like, pick up people, grabbing anybody. It's crazy.”

Prediction markets pegged AI as a leading contender, along with Trump, Pope Leo XIV, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.

Trump was already named the 2024 person of the year by the magazine after his winning his second bid for the White House, succeeding Taylor Swift, who was the 2023 person of the year. 

The magazine cited 2025 as the year when the potential of artificial intelligence “roared into view” with no turning back. “For delivering the age of thinking machines, for wowing and worrying humanity, for transforming the present and transcending the possible, the Architects of AI are TIME's 2025 Person of the Year,” Time said in a social media post Thursday.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine would give its latest peace proposals to U.S. negotiators ahead of his urgent talks Thursday with a coalition of about 30 countries supporting Kyiv's effort to end the war with Russia on acceptable terms. The White House did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday on whether that happened.

Negotiations are at “a critical moment,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. 

Washington's goal of a swift compromise to stop the fighting that followed Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 is reducing Kyiv's room for maneuvering. Zelenskyy is walking a tightrope between defending Ukrainian interests and showing Trump he is willing to compromise, even as Moscow shows no public sign of budging from its demands. Zelenskyy's allies are backing his effort, seeking a fair settlement that will deters future Russian attacks and defend Europe.

The Senate is poised on Thursday to reject legislation to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits for millions of Americans, a potentially unceremonious end to a monthslong Democratic effort to prevent the COVID-era subsidies from expiring on Jan. 1.

Despite a bipartisan desire to continue the credits, Republicans and Democrats have never engaged in meaningful or high-level negotiations. The Senate is expected to vote on two partisan bills and defeat them both — essentially guaranteeing that many who buy their health insurance on the ACA marketplaces see a steep rise in costs at the beginning of the year.

“It's too complicated and too difficult to get done in the limited time that we have left,” said Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who has unsuccessfully pushed his Republican colleagues to extend the tax credits for a short time so they can find agreement on the issue next year. Neither side has seemed interested in compromise.

Senators for the first time are poised to question military leaders over Trump's use of the National Guard in American cities, an extraordinary move that has prompted legal challenges as well as questions about states' rights and the use of the military on U.S. soil.

The hearing Thursday before the Senate Armed Services Committee is expected to feature tough questioning for Pentagon leaders over the legality of the deployments, which in some places were done over the objections of mayors and governors.

The hearing will bring the highest level of scrutiny to Trump's use of the National Guard outside of a courtroom since the deployments began and comes a day after the president faced another legal setback over his muscular use of troops in larger federal operations.

Oil companies offered $300 million for drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday in the first of 30 sales planned for the region under Republican efforts to ramp up U.S. fossil fuel production.

The sale came after Trump's administration recently announced plans to allow new drilling off Florida and California for the first time in decades. That's drawn pushback, including from Republicans worried about impacts to tourism.

Wednesday's sale was mandated by the sweeping tax-and-spending bill approved by Republicans over the summer. Under that legislation, companies will pay a 12.5% royalty on oil produced from the leases. That's the lowest royalty level for deep-water drilling since 2007.

Thirty companies submitted bids on parcels covering 1,600 square miles (4,142 square kilometers). Total high bids were down from $382 million offered in the most recent lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico under former President Joe Biden in December 2023.

When Trump promised new tariffs while running for president, Gene Stehly worried that trade disputes would jeopardize his international sales of corn, soybeans and wheat.

A little more than a year later, Stehly said his fears have become a reality, and Trump's latest promise of federal assistance is insufficient to cover farmers' losses.

Trump announced Monday that his administration would distribute $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers, who have suffered from persistently low commodity prices, rising costs and declining sales after China cut off all agricultural purchases from America during the trade war.

While rural areas remain conservative bastions, farmers' patience with Washington is wearing thin. Several of them described the government bailout, an echo of similar policies during Trump's first term, as a welcome stopgap but one that won't solve the agricultural industry's problems.

“It's a bridge. It's not the ultimate solution we're looking for,” said Charlie Radman, a fourth-generation farmer. “What we really want to have is a little more certainty and not have to rely on these ad hoc payments.”

Sweeping taxes on imports have cost the average American household nearly $1,200 since Donald Trump returned to the White House this year, according to calculations by Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee.

Using Treasury Department numbers on revenue from tariffs and Goldman Sachs estimates of who ends up paying for them, the Democrats' report Thursday found that American consumers' share of the bill came to nearly $159 billion — or $1,198 per household — from February through November.

In his second term, Trump has reversed decades of U.S. policy that favored free trade. He's imposed double-digit tariffs on almost every country on earth. According to Yale University's Budget Lab, the average U.S. tariff has shot up from 2.4% at the beginning of the year to 16.8%, the highest since 1935.

The president argues that the import taxes will protect U.S. industries from unfair foreign competition, bring factories to the United States and raise money for the Treasury.

Hudson Institute national security analyst Rebeccah Heinrichs breaks down the U.S. seizure of a sanctioned Iranian oil tanker off Venezuela, President Donald Trump's vow to target narco-terror networks and Iran's evasion of U.S. sanctions. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro on Thursday and reassured him of Moscow's support as the Venezuelan leader faces escalating external pressure, according to a statement from the Kremlin.

In the call, reported by Reuters, Putin expressed support for Maduro's government ""in the face of growing external pressure,"" as the United States under President Donald Trump continues to push for Maduro's removal from office. Washington has increased military activity in the Caribbean as part of its pressure campaign.

The Kremlin said the two leaders discussed their shared interest in advancing a strategic partnership agreement and moving forward on joint projects in the economic and energy sectors. Moscow has long viewed Venezuela as a key partner in Latin America, particularly as both governments face isolation and international sanctions.

The call came one day after the United States seized a massive, U.S.-sanctioned Venezuelan oil tanker off the country's coast, escalating already tense relations between Caracas and Washington.

According to Fox News Digital's report, the Venezuelan government condemned the seizure as a violation of its sovereignty and accused Washington of hostile action against its economic interests. The Trump administration has intensified enforcement targeting Venezuela's oil sector, which remains the backbone of Maduro's government despite years of decline.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed that federal agencies, including the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Coast Guard, carried out the tanker operation and released unclassified video footage of the seizure. The move followed a federal warrant tied to sanctions violations.

President Trump publicly acknowledged the operation, describing the vessel as the largest tanker ever seized by the United States. Reuters reported that the action caused oil prices to rise and added new strain to U.S.–Venezuela relations.

Russia and Venezuela have maintained a close relationship for more than two decades, a partnership that deepened during the presidency of Hugo Chávez and continued under Nicolás Maduro. According to Reuters, cooperation between the two countries has focused on defense, energy production and financial assistance.

Over the past several years, Moscow has supplied military equipment to Caracas, supported Venezuela's state oil company through joint ventures, and extended loans and credit lines that have helped keep parts of the country's oil sector functioning. Venezuela has taken billions of dollars in Russian loans and financing arrangements tied to Venezuela's crude exports.

Despite international sanctions targeting both governments, Russia has consistently treated Venezuela as a strategic partner. The U.S. Congressional Research Service reports describe the relationship as durable and largely unaffected by short-term political shifts or external pressure. Moscow has continued to offer diplomatic backing and economic cooperation even as Venezuela's domestic crisis worsened and U.S. pressure campaigns intensified.

Fox Sports analyst Robert Griffin III gave his take on the Cleveland Browns' questionable two-point conversion play, where Shedeur Sanders was sidelined with the game on the line in Week 14.

When Shedeur Sanders found fellow rookie Harold Fannin Jr. for the touchdown in Cleveland on Sunday to make it a 31-29 ball game, Browns fans were ecstatic, knowing a successful two-point conversation meant a tie game. 

Sanders, who started the last three games for the Browns in his rookie season, showcased his late-game savvy and kept his team in the contest up until the final play. 

But confusion, and bewilderment for some, was the reaction when Sanders wasn't seen under center on the two-point try. It was rookie running back Quinshon Judkins, who was in the wildcat formation as he does on occasion this season.

The play ended up going unsuccessful, and the Browns fell to the Tennessee Titans with lots of what-if responses from experts and fans alike. 

Robert Griffin III, the FOX Sports analyst and former NFL quarterback who spent the 2016 season in Cleveland, has been vocal about how the Browns have treated Sanders since taking him in the fifth round. After seeing head coach Kevin Stefanski's decision to go with Judkins in the wildcat over Sanders, he believed it was pure ""coaching failure"" on his part. 

""You have to be in touch with what's going on in the game, and the young man that gave you the best chance to win the game should've been on the field in the most crucial point of the game. He wasn't and that's a coaching failure on their part,"" Griffin told Fox News Digital after helping USAA gift two military veterans with new vehicles before the 126th Army-Navy game this weekend. 

SHEDEUR SANDERS ADDRESSES UNDERGARMENT RUMORS AFTER VIRAL MOMENT IN BROWNS' LOSS: ‘IT DID LOOK LIKE THAT'

The Browns were in a massive hole with about six minutes remaining in the contest, staring at a 31-17 deficit after a blocked punt set up a Titans field goal.

Sanders, though, never lost faith and was able to get into the end zone for his first rushing touchdown on the ensuing drive to make it a 31-23 ball game. Then, after a three-and-out by the Titans, he went seven plays in 1:40 to eventually find Fannin for the score with 1:03 remaining in the game.

At that point, Sanders had totaled his fourth touchdown of the game and his third passing score. He was 23-for-42 for 364 yards with an interception as well.

Griffin said the two-point conversion play Stefanski and offensive coordinator Tommy Rees had dialed up might have been the wildcat on the call sheet, but he thought they needed to look deeper into how they got to that point.

""I think, from a coaching standpoint, you look at it and say, ‘What are our best two-point plays? What have we practiced all week?' Most coaches go into a game with two to three two-point plays, and they were just at the point where that was the two-point play that was next on the call sheet,"" he explained. ""In that moment, I think you have to say to yourself this young man has four touchdowns, he's led us all the way back into this game and kept us in this game. We should not be taking him off the field. That, to me, was where the mistake was.

""Every coach will tell you, ‘You go down your sheet, you call the play, and you live with it.' But you have to be able to take the analytics out and say, ‘All right, this is the best thing we can do in this moment.'""

Stefanski has been criticized for his handling of Sanders since joining a crowded Browns quarterbacks room when he arrived in Cleveland. Throughout the season, as the Browns have struggled for consistency at the position with Joe Flacco traded and Dillon Gabriel not finding consistent results, the call for Sanders grew louder by the week.

Sanders won his first career start in Las Vegas, a 24-10 victory over the Raiders, and Stefanski gave him praise for getting better by the week. He also said what Griffin suggested this past weekend, as Sanders will remain the team's starter the rest of the way.

But Stefanski's decision on Sunday with the two-point conversion only added fuel to those who believe Sanders is being set up to fail with the Browns.

Griffin noted no coach should make gameday decisions based on outside noise, but after balling out, he's confident that Sanders should've been in for that crucial play.

Sanders has four more games left in his rookie season, starting with the Chicago Bears on the road in Week 15.

HELPING THOSE WHO SERVE US

Griffin was back in Baltimore, where he spent the remaining years of his NFL playing career, to show honor through action in the tradition of the annual Army-Navy Game by gifting two recycled rides with USAA, the official Salute to Service partner of the NFL.

Cryptologic Technician Petty Officer First Class Jamil Lewis, who is currently serving in the Navy, and veteran Patrick Huber, a specialist of the 116th Infantry Regiment, Army National Guard, were both surprised by Griffin with the brand-new vehicle at Inner Harbor in front of the USS Constellation.

Griffin, who comes from a military family himself with his mother and father serving in the Army, has long enjoyed his partnership with USAA and couldn't have been happier to help out with this.

(Edwin Remsberg)

""I've been so honored to partner with USAA. We've been partnered together for the last 13 years, and I'm a guy who likes to do genuine, authentic partnerships. Military brat, mom and dad both served in the Army. So, I'm a ‘Go Army, beat Navy' guy — 31 years combined between them. To see the impact we've been able to make over the last 13 years, doing things to make our military members know they're not forgotten, it does something for me,"" he explained. ""If it's doing something for me, it's doing something for these families we get to impact, to make their lives a little bit easier. It's not a free car. I say that because, yeah, they didn't have to pay money for it, but there was sacrifice for us and our freedoms to be able to get this type of treatment. We want them to know that, ‘Hey, man, we appreciate you.'""

Griffin said that Huber, a lifelong Dallas Cowboys fan, made sure to take a crack at him during their time together about the Washington Commanders, who the Baylor product was drafted by.

And Griffin also loved seeing Lewis' nine-year-old son, one of his five children, ""going ballistic"" when he realized what was happening.

""They got a free car to the point where, 30 minutes after the event, he's still sitting in the passenger's side seat,"" Griffin said about Lewis' son.

Conservatives haven't taken health policy seriously for decades.

Health insurance premiums on the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces are set to soar after Congress failed Thursday to pass a last-minute plan to avert the rate hikes.

As many as four million people could be forced to go uninsured, because they can no longer afford their health plan. I spoke with some of them earlier this fall. These are working parents, entrepreneurs, and retirees — all now facing impossible choices because of the loss of their government aid.

They are fed up with their livelihoods being exploited for politics, and it's this population — those with health insurance subsidized by the federal government — who, in particular, think Republicans have dropped the ball.

A recent survey found that 76 percent of people who get their insurance through the ACA and want the subsidies extended would blame President Donald Trump or Republicans in Congress if they are not. The broader public, the vast majority of whom would also like to see the aid extended, agrees; 48 percent of voters blame the GOP, while 32 percent pin it on the Democrats, per a new Morning Consult poll.

On Thursday, the Senate failed to pass two partisan measures that were designed to avert premium spikes. One proposal from the Democrats would have extended the financial subsidies for three more years; it failed 51-48, with all Democrats and four Republican senators supporting it. The rest of the Republicans objected, and 60 votes were needed for the bill to advance. The other plan, put forward by Republicans, would've put money into a health savings account and pushed people to purchase catastrophic coverage with a higher deductible. It also fell short, at 51-48, with unified Democratic opposition.

The only reason these votes happened at all is that the two parties agreed to end the government shutdown earlier this fall on the condition that the Senate would hold a vote by mid-December on a then-unspecified plan to restore the subsidies.

Democrats had been pressing Republicans to address the assistance ahead of the shutdown and during the shutdown. Republicans, however, refused to negotiate at the time and failed to come up with a unified plan to fix the issue — until only a few days before the planned vote.

Now, patients will have to pay their new, much higher premiums when coverage begins on January 1. And unless Democrats are willing to shut down the government again on January 30, when the current funding bill runs out, there likely won't be another chance to fix the problem any time soon.

Americans are right to blame the Republicans for this entirely avoidable health care catastrophe. The upcoming rate hikes are the result of the party's failures to take health policy seriously for decades.

The Republican Party has been uninterested in health care reform for a long time.

When President Obama finally passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, he did so without the GOP's support — even though his plan incorporated policies, such as the individual mandate, that were originally proposed by conservative policy thinkers.

Ever since, the party has been focused singularly on dismantling it, rather than crafting a viable alternative to take its place. Their repeated pledges to repeal and replace the health care law ended in a disjointed and embarrassing failure in 2017. And, more recently, Trump himself could offer only “concepts of a plan” for health care during his second campaign for the presidency in 2024.

Since then, the White House surprisingly floated a plan to address the issue in late November, seemingly without vetting it with congressional Republicans, who quickly shut it down. Trump has otherwise been disengaged on the urgent issue of keeping health coverage affordable for millions of voters while simultaneously arguing that Americans' concerns over affordability in general are a “hoax” (and building a $300 million White House ballroom).

On this specific question of the enhanced ACA subsidies, Republicans kicked the can down the road as much as they could — until they ran out of road.

They could have extended the assistance as part of the big, beautiful bill that passed this summer and done so in a way that would be more palatable to conservatives. But, according to Semafor, pressure from deficit hawks led the GOP to table the issue during the debate over that legislation. (Never mind that the overall bill, as passed, added more than $3 trillion to the deficit, even as it slashed Medicaid spending by $1 trillion, another move that could also lead to millions of Americans losing their health benefits.)

As even Republican strategists will acknowledge, GOP senators were only going through the motions of appearing to do something about the expiring subsidies. Their HSA plan was doomed to fail, and the party didn't even unify around it until two days before the planned vote. This was not a serious effort to avert a huge premium increase for millions of their own constituents.

House Speaker Mike Johnson promised to advance several health care bills in the coming months, but congressional insiders are rightly skeptical.

The next great conservative health care plan has been just around the corner for more than a decade — “just in time,” in the words of Modern Healthcare deputy editor Jeff Young. It's a joke that started in 2013. It's still going today.

And, as today's vote confirms, the Republicans appear no closer to coalescing around a real plan that would lower health care costs for the American people.

OpenAI on Thursday announced its most advanced artificial intelligence model, GPT-5.2, and said it's the best offering yet for everyday professional use.  

The model is better than predecessors at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, perceiving images, writing code and understanding long context, OpenAI said. It will be available starting Thursday within OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot and its application programming interface (API).

The announcement comes weeks after OpenAI launched its GPT-5.1 model. Rivals Anthropic and Google also launched new models last month, prompting OpenAI to declare a ""code red"" effort to improve ChatGPT and sideline other projects. 

It's all part of a high-stakes battle among leading tech companies to create the most widely used model as consumers and businesses increasingly add AI into their daily lives and workflow. OpenAI is counting on its GPT family of models to define the future as the company seeks to justify its $500 billion valuation and over $1.4 trillion in planned spending.

""We announced this code red to really signal to the company that we want to martial resources in one particular area, and that's a way to really define priorities and define things that can be deprioritized,"" Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI, told reporters in a briefing on Thursday. ""We have had an increase in resources focused on ChatGPT in general, I would say that helps with the release of this model, but that's not the reason it's coming out this week in particular.""

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told CNBC on Thursday that Google's release of its Gemini 3 model had less of an impact on the company's metrics than it originally feared. He said he expects OpenAI will exit its code red by January. 

""I believe that when a competitive threat happens, you want to focus on it, deal with it quickly,"" Altman said. 

OpenAI said GPT-5.2 will be available in Instant, Thinking and Pro versions. Instant is faster at writing and information seeking, Thinking is better at structured work like coding and planning and Pro will deliver the most accurate answers for difficult questions, OpenAI said. 

The company said that the model tops industry benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Pro, which evaluates agentic coding performance, and GPQA Diamond, a graduate-level scientific reasoning benchmark. On GDPval, an evaluation OpenAI released earlier this year, GPT-5.2 beat or tied top industry professionals on 70.9% of well-specified tasks, the company said.

""This has been in the works for many, many months,"" Simo said. ""While we are proud that we are able to have a cadence of releasing models fast, this particular integration has been in the works for a while.""

Anthropic's latest model, Opus 4.5, scores higher than GPT-5.2 on SWE-Bench Verified, a test set that evaluates an AI system's software coding abilities. OpenAI told reporters that the benchmark is less ""contamination resistant, challenging, diverse and industrially relevant"" than SWE-Bench Pro.

OpenAI was founded as a research lab exactly 10 years ago, but it's become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities in the world following the launch of ChatGPT in 2022. More than 800 million people now use its chatbot every week.

After the U.S. military seized a large crude oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast, President Donald Trump suggested the ship's contents could remain in U.S. possession.

""Well, we keep it, I guess,"" Trump told reporters Wednesday during a business roundtable at the White House, hours after the Guyana-flagged Skipper was seized. 

But similar seizures in the past have led to the sale of confiscated assets. The question now is where the oil from the Venezuelan ship may end up and how the proceeds will be distributed.

Matt Smith, head U.S. analyst at energy consulting firm Kpler, told CNBC that Skipper was covertly loaded with 1.1 million barrels of oil in mid-November and appeared to be headed for Cuba. Though the tanker flew Guyana flags, the country's Maritime Administration Department said in a statement on Wednesday that the ship was not registered in Guyana. 

""In past instances, mainly involving Iran, the oil is sold and the US government kept the proceeds. There's a civil asset forfeiture process,"" said Bob McNally, founder and president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House energy advisor to President George W. Bush.

""We expect that to be followed in this case,"" McNally said.

Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, a petroleum analysis firm, told CNBC that the U.S. has seized Iranian oil sold into the U.S. Gulf Coast on multiple occasions in recent years.

""There is a process, ultimately the USA has to indemnify anyone taking part in the transaction, which includes the oil buyer, any tankers required for the lightering operation or any of the service providers involved in the transaction,"" Lipow said. Lightering is the process of transferring cargo, oil or hazardous materials from one ship to another.

 ""They have done it in the past, will do so again,"" Lipow said.

Spokespeople for the U.S. Coast Guard and the Pentagon deferred to the White House when asked about the process of disposing of the tanker and oil. The Department of Justice and Homeland Security Department did not immediately return requests for comment. 

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a briefing on Thursday that the vessel is ""undergoing a forfeiter process.""

""The vessel will go to a US port and the United States does intend to seize the oil. However, there is a legal process for the seizure of that oil and that legal process will be followed,"" Leavitt said.

Past seizures have resulted in windfalls for the U.S.

In 2024, the U.S. seized and sold Iranian oil, generating $47 million in proceeds, some of which could be directed toward the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, according to a statement by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia earlier this year.

The U.S. Marshals Service also operates an asset forfeiture program that includes managing and selling assets seized by the DOJ. But the Marshals Service is not involved in the Venezuelan seizure, according to an agency spokesperson.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a post on X on Wednesday, said that the ship had been sanctioned for multiple years because of its ""involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.""

""Our investigation alongside the Department of Homeland Security to prevent the transport of sanctioned oil continues,"" Bondi wrote.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the seizure during testimony at a House hearing on Thursday.

""It was a successful operation directed by the president to ensure that we're pushing back on a regime that is systematically covering and flooding our country with deadly drugs and killing our next generation of Americans,"" Noem told the House Homeland Security Committee.

She touted the Coast Guard's efforts to target drug smugglers and ""those individuals that are funding it with a shadow fleet of sanctioned oil that should never be sold to benefit their profits and their pockets to kill Americans.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Tom Lee's BitMine Adds $112M in Ethereum, Calls Bottom at $2,500","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tom-lee-bitmine-adds-112m-132425778.html","Thu, 11 Dec 2025 13:24:25 GMT","

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum-focused treasury company BitMine received 33,504 ETH worth $112 million from institutional trading desk FalconX, according to on-chain intelligence firm EmberCN.

The purchase extends the firm's aggressive accumulation strategy as chairman Tom Lee declared Ethereum has likely bottomed and projected the asset could reach $7,000 by early 2026.

The transaction pushes BitMine's total holdings to approximately 3.86 million ETH, representing 3.2% of Ethereum's circulating supply, according to StrategicETHReserve data.

Lee, who also serves as Fundstrat Global Advisors' chief investment officer, told CNBC last month that the bottom is in despite ETH testing the critical $2,870 support level for the first time since July.

Lee believes Ethereum is entering the same explosive growth cycle that propelled Bitcoin from $1,000 to over $100,000 since his firm's initial 2017 recommendation.

Speaking on Farokh Radio, he noted Bitcoin endured multiple 75% drawdowns during that period before ultimately delivering 100x returns to patient holders.

“We believe ETH is embarking on that same supercycle,” Lee stated, arguing current weakness reflects market doubt rather than fundamental deterioration.

The comparison carries particular weight given his track record of calling major market bottoms, including upgrading the S&P 500 at 720 in February 2009, one month before the generational low at 666.

His conviction stems from Wall Street's accelerating blockchain adoption, particularly BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's commitment to tokenizing traditional assets on Ethereum.

Lee emphasized that financial institutions require “a neutral and 100% uptime blockchain, and that's Ethereum” to bring stocks, bonds, and real estate onto distributed ledgers.

He noted that tokenization addresses a market “in the quadrillions,” rather than merely replacing gold's $20 trillion addressable market, as Bitcoin does.

The latest purchase follows BitMine's acquisition of nearly $70 million in ETH over three days in early December, even as the firm sits on unrealized losses with an average cost basis of $3,008 per token.

Management claims it's roughly 62% toward its long-term target of controlling 5% of total Ether supply, an ambitious goal that would require accumulating approximately 2.5 million additional ETH at current levels.

This contrasts sharply with broader market behavior. Bitwise data shows that digital asset treasury companies purchased just 370,000 ETH in November, an 81% decline from August's peak of 1.97 million ETH.

While competitors retreated amid volatility, BitMine accelerated buying, with Lee noting that his team purchased ETH at more than double the rate compared to two weeks prior.

Lee dismissed concerns about the four-year Bitcoin cycle theory, suggesting it may no longer apply.

“If Bitcoin closes above $126,000 by January 31st, then there's no four-year cycle,” he told Farokh Radio, adding that traditional market indicators like the ISM manufacturing index and copper prices have already broken their historical four-year patterns.

This challenges widespread beliefs among original crypto investors who expect 2026 to bring weakness.

The company recently appointed Chi Tsang as chief executive, replacing Jonathan Bates as part of a leadership transition aimed at positioning BitMine “to become a leading financial institution.”

Three new independent board members also joined alongside the management change.

Ethereum's current price action around $3,100 carries technical significance beyond simple support levels.

The asset retested $2,870 support, the same level that preceded a 72% rally to all-time highs near $4,900 in August.

Lee referenced this pattern when declaring that the bottom is likely in place, though he acknowledged the asset has “unfortunately” been in a sustained downtrend.

Market indicators reflect extreme pessimism that historically precedes reversals.

Currently, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits near 29, indicating that there is still some “fear” in the market, which often marks accumulation zones.

Speaking with Cryptonews, Ignacio Aguirre, chief marketing officer at Bitget, projects ETH could climb toward $3,800 as “institutional flows resume and macro conditions stabilize” following yesterday's Federal Reserve rate cut.

Bitcoin traded around $90,000 at press time while Ethereum held above $3,200, with both assets pulling back roughly 2% in early Asian trading hours today.

Straight Arrow News


				Large cryptocurrency mines consumed 14.7 million megawatt hours of electricity in 2024, according to public records obtained by SAN.			


				The crypto mines consumed as much electricity as residents of San Antonio, the Dallas suburb Garland and the El Paso area combined.			


				Proponents say Bitcoin mine “flexibility” helps the grid, but some experts believe the industry's growth is a factor in higher consumer costs.			

A Straight Arrow News investigation found that in 2024, large cryptocurrency operations in Texas consumed more electricity mining virtual currencies such as Bitcoin than residential utility customers in the cities of San Antonio and El Paso combined. The footprint of crypto mines is expected to keep growing in the coming years.

As of mid-November, 22 cryptocurrency mining facilities had registered with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas. In 2024, those facilities combined to consume more than 14.7 million megawatt hours of electricity, according to public records obtained by SAN. That corresponds to about 3% of all electricity produced on the state's power grid in 2024.

The cryptocurrency mines consumed enough electricity to power more than a million Texas homes for a year. Insiders from the Bitcoin industry told SAN it is misleading to compare their electricity consumption to Texas cities because cryptocurrency mines turn off when electricity prices are high. But not all electricity market analysts outside the cryptomining industry are convinced; some said Bitcoin is a factor in rising consumer prices.   

Texas has become a major hub of the Bitcoin mining industry, and the state government has even purchased $5 million of Bitcoin. The energy-intensive process uses computers to guess a random string of numbers, which verifies a set of virtual currency transactions, known as a block. It's a lucrative business: For each block of transactions a mining company correctly verifies, it earns a reward of 3.125 Bitcoin. However, as the industry has grown, so too have concerns among residents and state lawmakers over rising demand on the power grid.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration tracks annual retail electricity sales by utility companies across the country. 

In 2024, San Antonio's city-owned utility CPS Energy sold over 11.1 million megawatt hours of electricity to 865,914 homes, according to the EIA data. El Paso Electric, which serves the city of El Paso and parts of southeast New Mexico, sold about 2.7 million megawatt hours of electricity to 312,576 residential customers.

SAN's analysis found that the amount of electricity consumed by cryptocurrency mines is equal to residential utility customers in the city of San Antonio, the El Paso area and another mid-sized Texas city, such as Garland, where residents consumed over 908,000 megawatt hours of electricity in 2024.

On average, each of the 22 cryptocurrency mines consumed over 668,000 megawatt hours of electricity last year.

While megawatt hours measure how much electricity is consumed over time, megawatts show how much power a facility can consume in an instant. The cryptomining industry has increased how much power it can draw from the grid at once. In the next two years, it's expected to rise another 20%. 

In June 2024, a senior vice president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas told lawmakers that cryptocurrency mining could draw an estimated 2,600 megawatts of power from the grid. As of November 2025, the electric demand of cryptocurrency mines is 4,288 megawatts and is expected to surpass 5,300 megawatts by 2027. 

In 2024, cryptocurrency mines in Texas consumed more than 14.7 million megawatt hours of electricity, enough to power over a million homes for a year.

The Texas legislature passed Senate Bill 1929 in 2023, requiring virtual currency mining operations with a capacity of 75 megawatts or more to file registration forms with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUC). Following its passage, a SAN reporter was the first among several media organizations to request copies of the filings via the Texas Public Information Act. 

The PUC denied the request, arguing that public disclosure of the size and location of cryptocurrency mines could be used by terrorists to attack critical infrastructure. But the Texas Attorney General's office largely sided with the journalists, triggering a lawsuit between the PUC and the attorney general. Litigation is ongoing.

SAN filed another public records request seeking totals from all registered facilities, foregoing information on specific cryptocurrency mines or companies. That request yielded the electricity consumption data reported in this investigation.

The total capacity of cryptocurrency mines and their annual electricity consumption is likely somewhat higher than the available data, which only tracks facilities that can draw at least 75 megawatts from the grid. 

While the PUC data includes 22 mines above 75 megawatts that have registered with the agency, a report from the Texas Observer found 60 cryptocurrency mines spread across 33 Texas counties.

As part of this investigation, SAN contacted several of the largest known cryptocurrency companies in the state, including Riot Platforms and MARA, formerly Marathon Digital Holdings. None responded to multiple requests for comment. 

Daniel Batten, a Bitcoin investor and advisory board member for MARA, told SAN that without context, the comparison of Bitcoin mining consumption to various Texas cities is “highly misleading.” 

“Bitcoin mining is by economic necessity a non-rival consumer of energy,” Batten said.

Cryptocurrency mining is “flexible” and can turn its energy consumption up or down depending on economic factors, given the price of electricity and the price of Bitcoin.

Through this flexible operation, Batten said cryptocurrency mines “not only help stabilize the grid, they also provide additional revenue for renewable energy operators, which has been shown to accelerate the green energy transition.”

Spencer Marr, co-founder and president at Sangha Renewables, a company launching a 20-megawatt Bitcoin mine that will consume excess solar power behind-the-meter at a facility near Odessa, said “Bitcoin mining operations tend to concentrate where there is an oversupply of power.”

Some studies have shown that cryptocurrency mining can incentivize renewable energy development, while others have demonstrated the potential for large flexible loads to help stabilize the grid. In Texas, Bitcoin mines can rake in millions by enrolling in ERCOT programs to cut their energy use when demand spikes.

Critics, however, view those programs, which pay cryptocurrency companies a premium to participate, as exploitative rather than beneficial. Very little real-world data exists to demonstrate the extent of voluntary cuts to power consumption outside of organized ERCOT demand response programs.

“As the Nobel-winning conservative economist Milton Friedman said, ‘There is no such thing as a free lunch.' That applies to cryptocurrency miners on the ERCOT grid,” said Ed Hirs, an energy economist and lecturer at the University of Houston. “Any cryptocurrency miners on ERCOT using electricity are market demand over and above that of regular Texans.” 

Hirs told SAN that without Bitcoin on the grid, overall electricity demand would be lower, as would reliance on some of the power plants that currently operate day in and day out. 

“Any cryptocurrency miners on ERCOT using electricity are market demand over and above that of regular Texans,” he said. 

Daniel Cohan, a professor at Rice University who has researched energy policy, said the electricity consumption data shows crypto mines are “likely propping up wholesale prices and natural gas use on mild days.” 

Cohan said more precise data would be needed to estimate the exact price impact for consumers. 

While some Bitcoin companies like Sangha Renewables are co-located with solar power, others like MARA's facility in Hood County are co-located with natural gas power plants.

In response to SAN's findings, Mandy DeRoche, a deputy managing attorney for the Clean Energy Program at the nonprofit Earthjustice said, “Bitcoin mining companies are continuing to exploit the system for their profit.”

Rising electricity use by cryptocurrency mining operations in Texas is impacting the state's power grid and raising questions about consequences for consumers and infrastructure planning.

Large-scale Bitcoin mining in Texas is using more electricity than entire cities, influencing overall grid demand and prompting debate over the associated economic and infrastructure costs.

Industry representatives argue flexible mining operations can help stabilize the energy grid, while critics and analysts highlight potential pressures on market prices and grid reliability, impacting utility costs for consumers.

Recent regulatory efforts in Texas to track and disclose cryptocurrency mining operations reflect concerns over transparency, security, and the need for informed energy policy as the sector grows.

What's going on here?

Tech stocks took a big hit after Oracle's downbeat results, sparking a selloff in semiconductors and dragging the broader sector lower. At the same time, energy and crypto joined the downturn – but consumer, health care, and retail shares quietly booked gains in the shadows.

What does this mean?

Technology and communication stocks were this week's weakest performers, with the Invesco QQQ Trust falling 0.6% after Oracle's disappointing quarterly update put a damper on sentiment across big tech. Semiconductor ETFs – State Street SPDR S&P Semiconductor and iShares Semiconductor – suffered even steeper declines, signaling persistent uncertainty. Energy stocks also tumbled as oil and natural gas prices slumped, pulling down popular ETFs tied to those markets. Yet, defensive sectors like consumer staples, health care, biotech, and retail quietly gained ground, showing some resilience. Meanwhile, financials bucked the trend, with leverage-focused funds jumping and State Street's Financial Select Sector SPDR posting gains – a sign that some investors are rotating back into riskier areas within the sector.

Why should I care?

For markets: Sector rotation shifts the spotlight.

Investors are shifting gears, pulling capital from former tech favorites and semiconductors in favor of more defensive picks like consumer staples and health care. That move hints at a possible rotation as market uncertainty lingers, while retail's steady performance points to areas of hidden strength. All told, sector leadership appears up for grabs as the market searches for its footing.

The bigger picture: Navigating risk in choppy waters.

Energy and crypto losses – with bitcoin down 2.4% and ether ETFs dropping up to 5% – signal a retreat from high-risk assets, even as financials and industrials attract fresh attention. Rising gold and silver ETF prices, climbing 1.2% and 3.6% respectively, suggest investors are eyeing safer harbors. Overall, these moves paint a picture of a market carefully shuffling its bets as uncertainty hangs over the broader economy.

Satsuma Technology (SATS), a U.K.-based bitcoin-focused technology company sold 579 BTC out of its holdings of 1,199 BTC, generating approximately 40 million pounds ($53.2 million) in net proceeds, according to an announcement on Thursday. 

Following the sale, the company holds 620 BTC and around 90 million pounds in cash. 

The transaction is intended to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet the 78 million pound-repayment obligation on its convertible loan notes due on Dec. 31 should certain holders choose not to convert their notes into equity during the planned uplisting.

Satsuma continues to progress toward admission to the Equity Shares Category of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Official List and trading on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) Main Market. Completion of the uplisting remains dependent on FCA approval of its prospectus, so timing and certainty are not yet guaranteed ahead of Dec. 30.

Shares moved slightly higher to 1.05 pence after the announcement, while down nearly 30% over the past month. 

Satsuma now ranks as the 61st largest publicly traded bitcoin holder following the sale.

Measles Outbreaks Accelerate as U.S. Inches Closer to a Disease Tipping Point

More than 1,900 people, mostly children, have been sickened by measles in the U.S. in 2025. The outbreaks are moving the country toward losing its measles-free status by early next year

South Carolina is the epicenter of what state officials call an “accelerating” measles outbreak. Hundreds of people are in quarantine, and the outbreak has sickened at least 111 individuals, most of whom—105—were not vaccinated against the disease. The rash of cases is merely the latest in a string of measles outbreaks across the U.S. this year. Each of these outbreaks has brought the country ever closer to losing its measles-free status after more than 25 years.

As of December 10, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 1,912 measles cases, most of which were linked to 47 outbreaks of the disease, this year. For comparison, 2024 saw just 16 outbreaks and 285 cases. At least two children have died of measles in the current outbreaks.

A growing decline in vaccination rates in communities across the country is driving these grim trends. Measles vaccines are generally given as part of the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot, two doses of which are 97 percent effective against the disease. The U.S. effectively eliminated measles in 2000 because enough people got the vaccine to suffocate the virus's spread through the population.

As part of that effort, the MMR vaccine is required for children to attend public school throughout the country, but many states offer parents the choice to exempt their child for religious or personal reasons. In a media briefing yesterday, South Carolina's state epidemiologist Linda Bell said that vaccination levels there were simply “lower than hoped for.”

The state has seen vaccination rates of its schools' students decline from almost 96 percent in 2020 to 93.5 percent in 2025—for context, robust herd immunity from measles requires about 95 percent of the population to be vaccinated, according to the World Health Organization.

Both Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and President Donald Trump have criticized the shot, suggesting it should be broken up into separate jabs and linking it, without evidence, to autism. Numerous studies have debunked this link.

Editor's Note (12/11/25): This article was edited after posting to correct the number of people who have been sickened in the current measles outbreak in South Carolina, the description of cases this year that have been linked to 47 outbreaks and the date of the media briefing with Linda Bell.

Teen AI Chatbot Use Surges, Raising Mental Health Concerns

A new survey offers the clearest national snapshot yet of how U.S. teens are using artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence chatbots are no longer a novelty for U.S. teenagers. They're a habit.

A new Pew Research Center survey of 1,458 teens between the ages of 13 and 17 found that 64 percent have used an AI chatbot, with more than one in four using such tools daily. Of those daily users, more than half talked to chatbots with a frequency ranging from several times a day to nearly constantly.

The results offer a national snapshot of what is a fast-moving landscape, as chatbots become increasingly embedded in teens' lives while policymakers argue over how to best regulate them.

ChatGPT was the most popular bot among teens by a wide margin: 59 percent of survey respondents said they used OpenAI's flagship AI-powered tool, placing it far above Google's Gemini (used by 23 percent of respondents) and Meta AI (used by 20 percent). Black and Hispanic teens were slightly more likely than their white peers to use chatbots every day. Interestingly, these patterns reflect how adults tend to use AI, too, although teens seem more likely to turn to it overall.

The report comes amid rising concern over AI's effect on teens' mental health. And several AI companies, including ChatGPT maker OpenAI, face legal action tied to teens' use of their chatbots. The same features that make chatbots appealing—the always-on availability, the seemingly empathetic conversation, the projection of confidence—can lead teens to turn to them for support or mental health guidance instead of a human. Given the scale of daily usage that Pew found, the real question isn't whether adolescents will use AI but what kind of design features, safeguards and age limits they might encounter when they do.

Lawmakers are also confronting that reality. In recent days, U.S. president Donald Trump has teased a “ONE RULE” executive order aimed at curbing a state-by-state patchwork of AI laws. Meanwhile senators in D.C. are floating legislation to ban the use of AI companions among minors. Abroad, Australia has begun enforcing a ban on under-age-16 social media accounts—a sign of how governments are trying to redraw age lines as youth-facing technology keeps changing.

Still, Pew's numbers show that many teens have made up their minds about AI while the rules are still being argued into existence.

It wasn't supposed to be there.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

These days, we would call them proprietary blends. But in the late 1500s and early 1600s, individual alchemists called the medicines they cooked up in their labs ‘secrets'. And  thanks to a study published in Heritage Science, we now know a little bit more about the secrets of one alchemist in particular. 

It turns out that Tycho Brahe, mostly known for his study of astronomy, had his own basement laboratory for mixing medicines—including some particular elements.

Brahe's famed observatory, located in his castle-like Uraniborg observatory on the island of Ven, in what is now Sweden, was dismantled following his death in 1601. But recently, a team of researchers from the University of Southern Denmark and National Museum of Denmark analyzed five shards rescued from what would have been the site's old garden between 1988 and 1990. It's believed those shards came from the basement alchemical laboratory.

The authors examined cross sections of the shards for 31 trace elements using mass spectrometry by converting sample molecules into charged ions. While there was plenty of the expected elements on the shards (four of which were glass and one of which was ceramic)—including nickel, copper, zin, tin, antimony, gold, mercury, and lead—there was one find that surprised the experts: tungsten. 

“Tungsten is very mysterious,” Kaare Lund Rasmussen, archaeometry expert at the University of Southern Denmark, said in a statement. “Tungsten had not even been described at that time, so what should we infer from its presence on a shard from Tycho Brahe's alchemy workshop?”

That's a question that doesn't have a clear answer. Rasmussen said that while tungsten does occur naturally in certain minerals, and could have made its way into Brahe's laboratory that way, there's another plausible theory: Brahe had a secret substance to help create his medicines for Europe's elite. 

Not classified as an element until the 1780s, tungsten likely first popped up in German chemistry as ‘Wolfram,' and Brahe's medicine were known to have German influence. “Maybe Tycho Brahe had heard about this and thus knew of tungsten's existence,” Rasmussen speculated. “But this is not something we know or can say based on the analyses I have done. It is merely a possible theoretical explanation for why we find tungsten in the samples.” 

“Most intriguing are the elements found in higher concentrations than expected,” Rasmussen said, “indicating enrichment and providing insight into the substances used in Tycho Brahe's alchemical laboratory.” 

The business of creating medicines was a secret one. Brahe, like others of the day, didn't share the makeup of prescriptions. Brahe was known for his plague medicine—a highly complicated remedy to create that could have had up to 60 ingredients, including everything from snake flesh and opium to copper, oils, and herbs. Could the resulting medicine have also included tungsten as part of the finished product?

“It may seem strange that Tycho Brahe was involved in both astronomy and alchemy, but when one understands his worldview, it makes sense,” said Poul Grinder-Hansen, senior researcher and museum curator at the National Museum of Denmark, in a statement. “He believed that there were obvious connections between the heavenly bodies, early substances, and the body's organs.” 

Gold and mercury were often used by alchemists (including Brahe) in medicines, and it was common for alchemists to link the Earth's elements to properties in space and the human body. And there's a whole list of those connections. Silver tied to the Moon and the brain, while gold was a link to the Sun and the heart. Jupiter and the liver were connected through tin, Venus and copper by the kidneys, Saturn and the spleen by lead, Mars and the gallbladder by iron, and Mercury and the lungs by (of course) mercury. In this thinking, gold was a common ingredient for medicines of the day, including ones Brahe took. 

Where tungsten fits into the mix, however, isn't clear. So far, it remains a secret.

OpenAI has introduced GPT-5.2, its smartest artificial intelligence model yet, with performance gains across writing, coding, and reasoning benchmarks. The launch comes just days after CEO Sam Altman internally declared a “code red,” a company-wide push to improve ChatGPT amid intense competition from rivals.

“We announced this code red to really signal to the company that we want to marshall resources in one particular area, and that's a way to really define priorities,” said OpenAI's CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, in a briefing with reporters on Thursday. “We have had an increase in resources focused on ChatGPT in general.”

Simo denied that OpenAI had moved up GPT-5.2's launch in light of its code red, claiming the company has been working on this model's release for months. However, she said the additional resources around ChatGPT have been “helpful.”

While OpenAI's models and products were considered best in class when ChatGPT launched in 2022, that's no longer a settled matter. The startup now faces an array of worthy challengers, perhaps none more threatening than Google, whose recently launched Gemini 3 model was received well by the tech industry. Google's Gemini app has grown at an impressive rate over the last year, now with more than 650 million monthly active users, compared to OpenAI's 800 million weekly active users. That pressure has forced OpenAI to rein in some of its most ambitious projects, including its work on introducing ads to ChatGPT, and to refocus on improving its core technology and products.

Much like the company's recent model launches, GPT-5.2 is shipping as series of models: Instant, which responds faster and is better for information-finding; Thinking, which excels at coding, math, and planning; and Pro, the most powerful tier of OpenAI's models that delivers higher accuracy on difficult questions.

OpenAI calls GPT-5.2 its best model yet for everyday professional use. GPT-5.2 Thinking notched the highest scores to date on GDPval, an OpenAI benchmark that compares performance between AI models and human professionals across 44 real-world occupations. The company says the model beat human professionals in over 70 percent of tasks, and completed them 11x faster.

OpenAI's post-training lead Max Schwarzer says that GPT-5.2 should also offer a substantial improvement around hallucinations in ChatGPT. The company says GPT-5.2 Thinking hallucinated 38 percent less than GPT-5.1 on benchmarks measuring answers to factual questions.

The company is bringing GPT-5.2 to both ChatGPT users and developers on OpenAI's API product. OpenAI says the new series of models “brings clear gains across everyday and advanced use cases.”

While GPT-5.2's performance looks impressive on paper, benchmark scores only tell part of the story for any model launch. When OpenAI released GPT-5 earlier this year, users revolted over the model's colder responses, a trait that's difficult to measure through benchmarks alone. The company ended up releasing an update to GPT-5 days after the launch to make the model “warmer.”

A key tension around OpenAI's model launches is making ChatGPT more enjoyable to chat with in order to drive up usage, without making the model overly sycophantic—the tendency for an AI model to be excessively agreeable. Over the last year, OpenAI has navigated a wide array of mental health challenges associated with ChatGPT usage. In October, the company released a report that found more than a million people talk to ChatGPT about suicide every week. That same month, a research leader behind the company's mental health work internally announced her plans to leave OpenAI.

But in light of competitive pressures from Google and Meta, OpenAI has significant incentives to grow ChatGPT's userbase. In October, OpenAI's head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, sent a memo to the company declaring it was facing “the greatest competitive pressure we've ever seen,” according to The New York Times. To combat those pressures, Turley reportedly set a goal to increase daily active users by 5 percent before 2026.

With GPT-5.2, OpenAI says it has continued to strengthen ChatGPT's responses to sensitive prompts indicating signs of self harm, mental health distress, or emotional reliance on a model. The company also says it's in the early stages of rolling out its previously announced age-prediction model in certain countries. This system will allow the company to automatically apply content protections for users whom it estimates are under 18.

Simo says the company now plans to roll out its “adult mode” in the first quarter of 2026, which Altman previously indicated would allow users over 18 to have “erotic” conversations with ChatGPT.

Seattle-based mental health startup Joon Care has been acquired by Handspring Health, a New York-based health tech company. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“The acquisition is a major step toward building the most clinically rigorous and digitally engaging platform for youth and family mental healthcare in the country,” said Sahil Choudhry, co-founder and CEO of New York-based Handspring, in a LinkedIn post.

Joon launched in 2019 to provide online care for teens and young adults, pairing digital tools with virtual therapy sessions. The company serves patients 13- to 26-years-old who need help with anxiety, depression, disordered eating, sexual and gender identity, academic problems and other challenges. The course of therapy typically runs 16 weeks. The company's program emphasizes its use of evidence-based care strategies and patient assessments to track progress.

Joon spun out of Seattle's Pioneer Square Labs (PSL) and raised an initial $3.5 million round in 2020. Two years ago, it announced an additional $6 million investment, which would provide two to three years of operations, CEO Emily Pesce said at the time.

Handspring said in a press release that it would be integrating the companies' “expert teams,” but did not say if all of Joon's employees would be retained. The company has roughly 50 employees, based on information on LinkedIn. 

GeekWire reached out to Pesce and will update the story if we hear back. 

Handspring launched in 2021 and has raised $18.2 million, according to PitchBook. It also provides virtual therapy and online support, serving a slightly larger demographic with patients from 8- to 29-years-old.

Both companies operate multi-state platforms. Joon is licensed to provide care in Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania. Its treatment is covered by 16 insurance companies, according to its website, and includes national giants Aetna and UnitedHealthcare. 

Joon also launched a partnership in 2023 with the City of Seattle to provide free care to clients who are referred to the startup through the city's human services programs. The collaboration appears to be ongoing, and Handspring said it would continue serving families under Joon's existing contracts with government agencies, as well as treatment covered by insurance companies.

Pesce was a finalist for Startup CEO of the Year at the 2023 GeekWire Awards.

Google on Thursday introduced a new AI experiment for the web browser: the Gemini-powered product, “Disco,” which helps to turn your open tabs into custom applications. With Disco, you can create what Google is calling “GenTabs,” a tool that proactively suggests interactive web apps that can help you complete tasks related to what you're browsing, and allows you to build your own apps via written prompts.

For instance, if you're studying a particular subject, GenTabs might suggest building a web app to visualize the information, which could help you better understand the core principles. 

Or, in a less academic scenario, you could use GenTabs to help you create a meal plan from a series of online recipes or help you plan a trip when you're researching travel.

These are things that you can already do today with some AI-powered chatbots, but GenTabs builds these custom experiences on the fly using Gemini 3, using the information in your browser and in your Gemini chat history. After the app is built, you can also continue to refine it using natural language commands.

The resulting generative elements in the GenTabs experience will link back to the original sources, Google notes. 

Like others in the AI market, Google has been experimenting with bringing AI deeper into the web browsing experience. Instead of building its own standalone AI browser, like Perplexity's Comet or ChatGPT Atlas, Google integrated its AI assistant Gemini into the Chrome browser, where it can optionally be used to ask questions about the web page you're on.

With GenTabs, the focus is not only on what you're currently viewing, but your overall browsing task spanning multiple tabs — whether that's research, learning, or something else. 

However, the feature is only initially going to be available to a small number of testers through Google Labs, who will offer feedback about the experience. The company says that interesting ideas that are developed through Disco may one day find their way into other, larger Google products. 

It also suggests that GenTabs will be one of many Disco features to come over time, noting that GenTabs is the “first feature” being tested. 

To access Disco, users will need to join a waitlist to download the app, starting on macOS.

OpenAI launched its latest frontier model, GPT-5.2, on Thursday amid increasing competition from Google, pitching it as its most advanced model yet and one designed for developers and everyday professional use. 

OpenAI's GPT-5.2 is coming to ChatGPT paid users and developers via the API in three flavors: Instant, a speed-optimized model for routine queries like information-seeking, writing, and translation; Thinking, which excels at complex structured work like coding, analyzing long documents, math, and planning; and Pro, the top-end model aimed at delivering maximum accuracy and reliability for difficult problems. 

“We designed 5.2 to unlock even more economic value for people,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI's chief product officer, said Thursday during a briefing with journalists. “It's better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long context, using tools and then linking complex, multi-step projects.”

GPT-5.2 lands in the middle of an arms race with Google's Gemini 3, which is topping LMArena's leaderboard across most benchmarks (apart from coding – which Anthropic's Claude Opus-4.5 still has on lock).

Early this month, The Information reported that CEO Sam Altman released an internal “code red” memo to staff amid ChatGPT traffic decline and concerns that it is losing consumer market share to Google. The code red called for a shift in priorities, including stalling on commitments like introducing ads and instead focusing on creating a better ChatGPT experience. 

GPT-5.2 is OpenAI's push to reclaim leadership, even as some employees reportedly asked for the model release to be pushed back so the company could have more time to improve it. And despite indications that OpenAI would focus its attention on consumer use cases by adding more personalization and customization to ChatGPT, the launch of GPT-5.2 looks to beef up its enterprise opportunities. 

The company is specifically targeting developers and the tooling ecosystem, aiming to become the default foundation for building AI-powered applications. Earlier this week, OpenAI released new data showing enterprise usage of its AI tools has surged dramatically over the past year. 

This comes as Gemini 3 has become tightly integrated into Google's product and cloud ecosystem for multimodal and agentic workflows. Google this week launched managed MCP servers that make its Google and Cloud services like Maps and BigQuery easier for agents to plug into. (MCPs are the connectors between AI systems and data and tools.)

OpenAI says GPT-5.2 sets new benchmark scores in coding, math, science, vision, long-context reasoning, and tool-use, which the company claims could lead to “more reliable agentic workflows, production-grade code, and complex systems that operate across large contexts and real-world data.”

Those capabilities put it in direct competition with Gemini 3's Deep Think mode, which has been touted as a major reasoning advancement targeting math, logic, and science. On OpenAI's own benchmark chart, GPT-5.2 Thinking edges out Gemini 3 and Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 in nearly every listed reasoning test, from real-world software engineering tasks (SWE-Bench Pro) and doctoral-level science knowledge (GPQA Diamond) to abstract reasoning and pattern discovery (ARC-AGI suites). 

Research lead Adain Clark said that stronger math scores aren't just about solving equations. Mathematical reasoning, he explained, is a proxy for whether a model can follow multi-step logic, keep numbers consistent over time, and avoid subtle errors that could compound over time. 

“These are all properties that really matter across a wide range of different workloads,” Clark said. “Things like financial modeling, forecasting, doing an analysis of data.”

During the briefing, OpenAI product lead Max Schwarzer said GPT-5.2 “makes substantial improvements to code generation and debugging” and can walk through complex math and logic step-by-step. Coding startups like Windsurf and CharlieCode, he added, report “state-of-the-art agent coding performance” and measurable gains on complex multi-step workflows. 

Beyond coding, Schwarzer said that GPT-5.2 Thinking responses contain 38% fewer errors than its predecessor, making the model more dependable for day-to-day decision-making, research, and writing. 

GPT-5.2 appears to be less a reinvention and more of a consolidation of OpenAI's last two upgrades. GPT-5, which dropped in August, was a reset that laid the groundwork for a unified system with a router to toggle the model between a fast default model and a deeper “Thinking” mode. November's GPT-5.1 focused on making that system warmer, more conversational, and better suited to agentic and coding tasks. The latest model, GPT-5.2, seems to turn up the dial on all of those advancements, making it a more reliable foundation for production use. 

For OpenAI, the stakes have never been higher. The company has made commitments to the tune of $1.4 trillion for AI infrastructure buildouts over the next few years to support its growth – commitments it made when it still had the first-mover advantage among AI companies. But now that Google, which lagged behind at the start, is pushing ahead, that bet might be what's driving Altman's ‘code red.' 

OpenAI's renewed focus on reasoning models is also a risky flex. The systems behind its Thinking and Deep Research modes are more expensive to run than standard chatbots because they chew through more compute. By doubling down on that kind of model with GPT-5.2, OpenAI may be setting up a vicious cycle: spend more on compute to win the leaderboard, then spend even more to keep those high-cost models running at scale.

OpenAI is already reportedly spending more on compute than it had previously let on. As TechCrunch reported recently, most of OpenAI's inference spend – the money it spends on compute to run a trained AI model – is being paid in cash rather than through cloud credits, suggesting the company's compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.

For all its focus on reasoning, one thing that's absent from today's launch is a new image generator. Altman reportedly said in his code red memo that image generation would be a key priority moving forward, particularly after Google's Nano Banana (the nickname for Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model) had a viral moment following its August release.

Last month, Google launched Nano Banana Pro (AKA Gemini 3 Pro Image), an upgraded version with even better text rendering, world knowledge, and an eerie, real-life, unedited vibe to its photos. It also integrates better across Google's products, as demonstrated over the past week as it pops up in tools and workflows like Google Labs Mixboard for automated presentation generation.

OpenAI reportedly plans to release another new model in January with better images, improved speed, and better personality, though the company didn't confirm these plans Thursday.

OpenAI also said Thursday it's rolling out new safety measures around mental health use and age verification for teens, but didn't spend much of the launch pitching those changes.

Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google on Wednesday, alleging that the tech giant has infringed on its copyrights, Variety reports.

Disney is accusing the tech giant of copyright infringement on a “massive scale,” claiming it has used AI models and services to commercially distribute unauthorized images and videos, according to the letter seen by Variety.

“Google operates as a virtual vending machine, capable of reproducing, rendering, and distributing copies of Disney's valuable library of copyrighted characters and other works on a mass scale,” the letter reads. “And compounding Google's blatant infringement, many of the infringing images generated by Google's AI Services are branded with Google's Gemini logo, falsely implying that Google's exploitation of Disney's intellectual property is authorized and endorsed by Disney.”

The letter alleges that Google's AI systems infringe characters from “Frozen,” “The Lion King,” “Moana,” “The Little Mermaid,” “Deadpool,” and more.” Google did not respond to TechCrunch's request for comment.

The move comes the same day that Disney signed a $1 billion, three-year deal with OpenAI that will bring its iconic characters to the company's Sora AI video generator.

I used to mutter about him being that race in Star Trek TNG that kidnaps people to make their ships “go”.But then one day I had an epiphany. I realized his boss knows exactly what he is. He's a useful idiot with a knack of getting something for nothing out of people. That's his skill. Not dinner conversation, but cost control. That and the Gervais Principle explain a lot of our head scratching about bad managers. They just know how to nerdsnipe or neg us into doing free work.Every time I take a computer to the Genius Bar I impersonate that beautiful moron. I've paid for one expensive repair that I feel nobody should have to pay for, but also not paid for two repairs that I knew damned well were out of warranty. All told I've paid pretty much what a fair universe should have charged me for lifetime maintenance on my hardware.The thing is if they know you're in IT they will engage in a coherent argument with you that explains why they are entitled to deny your claim. If you just say, “it won't connect to the internet” then they do the mental math on what an argument will cost with this grandpa whose kids bought him too much laptop for his own good and decide a waver is just less work.

All told I've paid pretty much what a fair universe should have charged me for lifetime maintenance on my hardware.The thing is if they know you're in IT they will engage in a coherent argument with you that explains why they are entitled to deny your claim. If you just say, “it won't connect to the internet” then they do the mental math on what an argument will cost with this grandpa whose kids bought him too much laptop for his own good and decide a waver is just less work.

Yes, but I think you're overlooking a hugely important factor in all this...You boss is just some average manager that very often could even be below average.Your boss is under their own pressure to perform and most of them will similarly struggle because they're not that good.Most workers at any roles are just average by definition. And the higher up you go, the more timing and luck plays a role, and the less good meritocracy is at filtering people. As luck becomes a bigger factor up the management chain, leaders tend even more towards being average at their job.Even founders, they often have never done this before, leading a fast growing company is all new to them and they learn as they go.What makes a good founder is the guts to be one, and than having the luck of timing and right idea. Plus being able to sell a narrative.What I mean by that is, they'll want to optimize profits, that's literally the charter of any company, and as an employee you should also be focused on that as your goal.But optimizing for profit often aligns with engineering well being, a robust, productive team, an environment conductive to innovation and quality with high velocity, etc. Those are good both for the employed engineers and profit.Often if you can't get that, it's not so much because of maximizing profit, but that your boss just isn't good.Think about it, it's super easy to, as a manager, do nothing but tell people to work harder, do better, and ask why this isn't done, why this isn't good, etc. This is what being bad at leading a profit maximizing company looks like.It's much harder to motivate people to work their hardest, to properly prioritize and make the hard trade off to focus the resources on the best ROI, to actually unblock blockers, to mentor and put processes that actually help quality go up and velocity go up. Etc.

I agree with this 100%. I may add a tidbit here simply because I'm thinking about it. There is a real agency problem in leadership.I've been a staff engineer[0] for just over half a decade now. I've noticed, particularly in the last few years, there's been more dustups over executive[1] authority of the role. Traditionally, what I've experienced is having latitude to observe, identify, and approach engineering problems that affect multiple teams or systems, for example. I've contributed a great deal to engineering strategy, particularly as it relates to whatever problem domain I am embedded in. Its about helping teams meet their immediate sprint goals, not working on strategy or making sure upcoming work for teams is unblocked by doing platform work etc.The only thing I can surmise about this shift is that engineering managers (and really managers going up the chain) don't want to feel challenged by a ""non manager"". They didn't like that we didn't have a usual reporting structure that other ICs do (we all rolled up the same senior director or VP rather than an EM) and previously had similar stature that of a director.[0]: for a general sense of what this entails, see this excellent website: https://staffeng.com[1]: As in having the power to put plans and/or actions into effect

This is what the AI boom is really about, removing more power from labor. Its why all the AI hype largely markets itself in this way ""how AI can replace or minimize X role"" as opposed to ""This is how you can use AI to empower your workforce in the majority of discourse I've seen around it.

reply

Arguably, AI is largely marketed that way because that's what corporate buyers care about, the same way every productivity improving invention has been marketed to corporate buyers even if a major actual effect is increasing the value of each labor hour and driving wages up. (Which is largely isomorphic to reducing the number X role needed in the production of Y units of a good or service.)Its also sold as a labor productivity increase to independent creators. And the two things are, after all, different sides of the same coin.

I'm happy to re-evaluate my stance in the light of better evidence, but the AI adoption has corresponded to alot of CEOs announcing layoffs with a simultaneous doubling down on AI tools to replace those now displaced workers.



This isn't the norm in most STEM industries anymore.Most of us started off as IC-level engineers before either beung given progressively more responsibility and/or being sponsored by our employees to participate in a PTMBA like Wharton, Booth, Fuqua, or Haas.Networking and hustling did ofc play a role, but lacking domain experience would limit how high you could climb.

The culture of the ""exit"" is the problem; the notion of routine payment with stock options, etc. etc.Back when I was working in a dot com (well a dot co dot uk) I noticed this; if you ask for a hard salary in lieu of stock options you are treated as if you have a communicable disease. Something I am glad I did, actually, because I saw other people leave with vested options that the company refused to either honour or buy back.Everything about the subsequent 21st Century IT culture is short-term-ist, naïve, and sick, and it is still taboo to talk about some of the problems.

In a lot of cases, ""caring too much"" is itself seen as a problem because the boss explicitly just wants you to implement the thing that benefits him. He doesn't really want to hear that its not going to work well and there are better alternatives.If you really don't care you might voice a quiet objection and then just implement the garbage your boss asked for. If you do care ""too much,"" then you might just be a thorn in your boss' side. Remember, he ultimately doesn't care if the product works. He cares if he can claim success. You're not helping him claim success, so you're a problem.

This works in theory, but the problem is that some jobs are complex and require thinking. These jobs will attract people who do not like to be a slaves. They want to enjoy their work, do something good and feel good while doing it. The slave like job mentality you mention has severe limitations on what it can achieve.

Depends.I worked and even had a business with and/or worked for three people that I've known for a long time. And had loud substantial disagreements with - before going into business. Worked like a charm every single time. The personal side I mean, business was neutral once, a complete failure but I only wanted the paycheck anyway once, and a resounding success in a traditional business where I handle only IT right now.In the first venture I found out I hated selling and business. Sure, I can do it, but I really really don't want to. I am a minimalist, and I might have become a poor monk in a monastery a thousand years ago. I don't want to sell anyone anything. So in the next two businesses I left all the business stuff to others, and it is sooo much better.And now that I'm in a non-IT traditional business I'm a servant 100%. And it is nice. My main focus is non IT stuff, and I use computers to achieve that. Finding differences in thousands of EDI messages for invoices, order confirmations and deliveries, for example. HOW - who cares? I am not developing a product. If it's a one-off I may just run some command line tools. Or, shocking!, I actually use Excel. Or I ask ChatGPT for a little helper Python script to run over the raw data files.Doing servant work without business responsibilities is really nice :) My boss may have the bigger house and car, so what?

Without the stress it's no problem! One of my direct colleagues is way past retirement age...

I worked and even had a business with and/or worked for three people that I've known for a long time. And had loud substantial disagreements with - before going into business. Worked like a charm every single time. The personal side I mean, business was neutral once, a complete failure but I only wanted the paycheck anyway once, and a resounding success in a traditional business where I handle only IT right now.In the first venture I found out I hated selling and business. Sure, I can do it, but I really really don't want to. I am a minimalist, and I might have become a poor monk in a monastery a thousand years ago. I don't want to sell anyone anything. So in the next two businesses I left all the business stuff to others, and it is sooo much better.And now that I'm in a non-IT traditional business I'm a servant 100%. And it is nice. My main focus is non IT stuff, and I use computers to achieve that. Finding differences in thousands of EDI messages for invoices, order confirmations and deliveries, for example. HOW - who cares? I am not developing a product. If it's a one-off I may just run some command line tools. Or, shocking!, I actually use Excel. Or I ask ChatGPT for a little helper Python script to run over the raw data files.Doing servant work without business responsibilities is really nice :) My boss may have the bigger house and car, so what?

So just by doing a little pre-interview prep, I found out that this person (if it was a real person and not a persona of some kind) had a resume with one career timeline and two LI profiles with two separate and different career timelines.Fed this to my bosses who proceeded to have an extremely awkward and brief interview with the person (or the person posing as the person) about ""so, in 2022, were you at $FIRST_COMPANY, $SECOND_COMPANY, or $THIRD_COMPANY?""  I mean, you have to pass a background check to work at my company even if offered; why do people do this?

It's the employee engagement survey where you want people to say that the company cares about you, and first line managers get in trouble from the results but executive leadership does not. It's the cognitive dissonance that you expect us to just deal with.It's the lack of communication when people are fired. There's no good way to fire people, but there sure are bad ways and you've found them.It's the times that I've told my boss about issues I'm dealing with and those issues show up in my end of year review instead of working on them together.

Being a leader means a constant confrontation with choosing political or organizational consequences to a decision. If all you're doing is operating politically, your reward will always be burned out, tired, and frustrated workers who, for once, want you to do what's in the best interests of your own organization rather than your personal political advantage. At least until a better political player than you outmaneuvers your ass, because you gave them room for growth in an organization that rewarded such behaviors.Workers just want to do good work, make good things, get paid good money, and go home. If your decision-making as a boss regularly imperils or impairs those things, you suck as a boss.

This resonates with me. I've seen way too much of this ""performative"" care. It's pretty grating when they start sounding like therapists: ""tell me how you're feeling, this must be pretty upsetting, huh?"". Or, ""do you need any help?"" and I'd be honest and say something like - ""yeah, sure, someone could assist with x, y, z"", -""oh, unfortunately, we don't have anyone available"". They know there is nobody there to help yet they feel like they've ticked their check-mark of showing ""care"".This is one of those ""you're fly is open"". People can see and smell the fakeness a mile a way. There are certainly worse qualities and maybe some people enjoy this ""therapeutic"" approach but it's certainly not a universally better thing and shouldn't become the default. If the care is just not there I'd rather it be just plain and simple without the extra fake fluff.

More precisely ""la société du soin"" comes to my mind. It's a bit different as in french the term as a very large semantic network. Sure care is the closest general translation.Anyway, we really are making much more progresses on technological side than on relevant careful social organisation, human inter-help, environmental and moral sides.Technology is easier to track continuously with proxy metrics which regularly move up some scale. In many other areas, tracking can be more an hindrance, an inhibitor or even a cause of total extinction.

For the care issue, I don't know how I would scale it.For my direct reports, I care, because I have yet to have take the MBA course where they remove my empathy. Its easy to know how they feel because I have the context.However, should I be good enough, or lucky enough to climb up the greasy pole and have reports with reports, I don't know how I would be able to scale the attention required to provide valid pastoral care to those reportees.Large forums only really allow the extrovert, confident, brave or stupid to over supply their opinions. So its not like a group monthly meeting will allow those grumbles to be surfaced before a crisis.

Very much this.  If you don't actually care about us, don't expect us to care about you or your company or the work.  You're going to be left with automatons rather than creative, energetic people (even if the bodies haven't changed).And the fact is that automatons don't make the line go up nearly as well as people who care.  So the really ironic thing is, if all you care about is money, then you better care about the team.  And not just care with lip service, but really care.My current job has problems, but I'll give them this:  When I wound up in the ER the weekend before a business trip, nobody was worrying about the effect on the trip.

You're just at a different place in the curve of rationalizing other humans' behaviors and motivations and how they affect you. Your response is not invalid, but it makes me sad, because you think it's the best response for you. Why wouldn't you instead hold on to your empathy and make it your super power?

reply

At least one reason would be because the empathetic person is usually the one bearing most of the cost of this ""super power"" while at best only sharing in the reward. Quite often entirely thankless work.

reply

I'm very interested in your response. I have accepted that I have blind spots and I want to remove them.

reply

It can also help you understand where coworkers or peers are coming from, and work with them better.The problem comes when it's a one way road where the empathetic person is doing all the work.

I was removed because the team lead thought I'm going over his head... while I coordinated every move with him. But the moment I disagreed with him -- once, and for the first time -- I was removed. Zero discussion.I'm quite empathetic. My original message above comes from bitterness because neither extreme is good. I was in the positive extreme for a while. Too sympathetic, always finding excuses for people who only saw me as a tool to advance their own careers and removed me the minute they thought that was no longer true.

All over the place, from the popular culture to the propaganda system, there is constant pressure to make people feel that they are helpless, that the only role they can have is to ratify decisions and to consume.The whole educational and professional training system is a very elaborate filter, which just weeds out people who are too independent, and who think for themselves, and who don't know how to be submissive, and so on — because they're dysfunctional to the institutions.If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all.― Noam Chomsky

I truly believe that capitalism is the best possible system of financial discourse for the most people.  I also believe that anti-trust and regulatory bodies have a responsibility to ensure competition at a very core level.  I don't think govt should be picking winners and losers and in fact, I feel we should expressly format any govt contracts such that there are multiple suppliers.  This should go towards all essential infrastructure, bar none.I also feel that govt should act in terms of a somewhat protectionist front in favor of its own peoples.  I think it comes down to real negotiation to keep it that way, but that trying to be fair is only a recipe for long term failure.Given the inflation of the past couple years, the push to stagnate wages for white-collar work is a bit repugnant at best.  The push to stagnate blue collar work is worse still.  This can and will only lead to more unionization.  One can only hope for a combination of local-focus and worker-lead efforts to stabilize (rebalance) the economy.  I say this not in support of socialist efforts, but to keep them at bay, lest we succumb to communism in the longer term, which at a global level will stagnate society as a whole.

""Outlet"" quality, but still at premium pricing

It's interesting to see that it's not only the best RAM that's become pricier these days. As pointed out by hardware enthusiast momomo_us, even memory kits sold through outlet channels still carry a notable retailer markup. For example, the Crucial Pro DDR5-5600 C46 64GB (2x32GB), which costs $507.99 in the U.S., is available in Japan for $602.74, taxes included.

Products available in the outlet channel usually come at a discounted price because they often include items with slightly damaged packaging, returned products, or things that are a bit outdated. However, that's not and will never be the case for memory. In today's market, where consumer memory is scarce, retailers are doing their best to make the most of every memory kit. Sometimes it means selling outlet memory kits at the same exorbitant prices as new ones, since there's little room for consumer sympathy in a tight market.

Take a look at the Crucial Pro DDR5-5600 C46 64GB (CP2K32G56C46U5) memory kit that's available at Japanese retailer Sofmap. Even though it's labeled as an outlet item, this memory kit costs $602.74, or $547.58 before taxes. That's about 8% more than what you'd pay in the U.S. market. If you feel U.S. consumers face high prices, let's consider how paying an extra 8% for an outlet memory kit might feel.

#おすすめ#アウトレット Crucial　DDR5メモリ CP2K32G56C46U5 [DDR5-5600 32GB×2] が在庫限り特価89,980円(税込)🔽詳しくはこちら🔽https://t.co/XW4RWJ2kQd pic.twitter.com/HsRdomHpoyDecember 11, 2025

In Sofmap's defense, the memory kit is new and works perfectly; only the packaging might have some scuffs, scratches, or be slightly torn. Since Micron has pulled out of the consumer market, Crucial products now have some collector appeal, which makes retailers even less inclined to change prices.

Before the memory shortage, Crucial's 64GB memory kit used to sell for about $134.99, but the price has shot up by 3.7 times in just a few months. Keep in mind that's in the retail market. Over on eBay, memory scalpers are asking as much as $1,067.45—more than twice the retail price. It's quite a rollercoaster in the market right now.

When it comes to DDR5-5600 with timings like C46-45-45, this 64GB memory kit isn't the fastest out there. Still, DDR5-5600 is easy to run on any modern processor, whether you're using an Intel or AMD processor. Plus, it supports Intel XMP 3.0 and AMD EXPO, making setup quick and simple. But is the Crucial Pro DDR5-5600 C46 64GB worth paying $507.99? That's a personal choice only you can make. With the holiday season just around the corner, we're likely to see some good RAM deals, even if they might be few and far between.

Not many 192GB memory kits are available in the consumer market, making the Biwin Black Opal OC Lab Gold Edition DW100 DDR5-6000 a standout choice that rivals the best RAM options.

Interestingly, not long ago, 128GB of memory on a mainstream motherboard was quite impressive, but DDR5 technology has really pushed the limits of memory capacity. Thanks to the introduction of non-standard capacities, such as 24GB and 48GB memory modules, it's now possible to build a system with up to 192GB of memory with the latter, or even 256GB with the new 64GB modules. That's why Biwin has introduced a special Black Opal OC Lab Gold Edition DW100 DDR5-6000 memory kit, ideal for users such as prosumers and professionals with high-capacity memory requirements.

The Black Opal OC Lab Gold Edition DW100 memory modules feature an elegant black 2mm aluminum alloy heat spreader with an electrophoretic coating. This coating offers a more uniform application and provides some degree of corrosion resistance. As a special 'Gold Edition,' the reviewed model boasts golden highlights that give it a distinctive, premium appearance. The memory modules look equally good in consumer, gaming, and workstation systems.

To meet enthusiast expectations, Biwin has equipped the Black Opal OC Lab Gold Edition DW100 memory with a standard RGB diffuser. The programmable RGB lighting features eight independent zones, which can be managed via your motherboard's software. Compatibility extends to all major motherboard manufacturers, including Asus, MSI, ASRock, and Gigabyte. At 1.98 inches (50.24 mm) tall, the Black Opal DW100 memory modules are taller than standard modules; therefore, consideration should be given when using a CPU air cooler.

Biwin employs a 10-layer PCB for the Black Opal OC Lab Gold Edition DW100 memory modules. Additionally, the company has incorporated silicon pads with a thermal conductivity of 2.5 W/m · K, positioned between the black PCB and the aluminum heat spreader to facilitate heat dissipation. The integrated circuits (ICs) are sourced from SK hynix, specifically the H5CGD8MGBDX021 (M-die) variants with a capacity of 3GB. There are a total of 16 M-die ICs, with eight located on each side of the PCB, arranged in a dual-rank configuration. Furthermore, the power management integrated circuit (PMIC) is the 0P=BE EY4, a widely utilized component manufactured by Richtek.

The stock configuration for the Black Opal OC Lab Gold Edition DW100 memory modules is DDR5-5600, featuring timings of 46-45-45-90. These modules are equipped with Intel XMP 3.0 and AMD EXPO profiles for DDR5-6000. Upon activation, the memory will operate at the specified data rate with timings of 28-36-36-102 and a DRAM voltage of 1.4V. See our PC Memory 101 feature and the How to Shop for RAM story for more on timing and frequency considerations.

The Black Opal OC Lab Gold Edition DW100 showed impressive performance on the Intel test system. The memory kit operates at DDR5-6000, a solid data rate for mainstream setups, and features tight timings that help it stand out from the competition.

Biwin's memory kit performed wonderfully on the AMD platform. DDR5-6000 makes it easy to run modern Ryzen processors at a 1:1:1 ratio for the Infinity Fabric Clock (FCLK), the unified memory controller clock (UCLK), and the memory clock (MEMCLK). This setup delivers optimal performance without any compromise.

Usually, expectations are modest for high-capacity memory kits. However, the Black Opal OC Lab Gold Edition DW100 DDR5-6000 C28 pleasantly exceeded expectations by running at DDR5-6200 with the same timings as DDR5-6000. The only needed change was increasing the DRAM voltage to 1.45V.

The default timings for DDR5-6000 were pretty good to start with, and even after boosting the DRAM voltage to 1.45V, we didn't notice a significant difference. Most of the memory timings stayed the same, except for tRAS, which we adjusted from 102 to 96 clock cycles.

The Black Opal OC Lab Gold Edition DW100 DDR5-6000 C28 memory kit offers impressive capacity and performance that are sure to impress. While Biwin has optimized this memory kit for AMD systems, it also works wonderfully with Intel setups and includes both XMP 3.0 and EXPO profiles for easy configuration. Keep in mind, like all overclocked memory kits, neither Intel nor AMD officially supports DDR5-6000 with four-DIMM configurations, so your experience may vary. But if you have the right processor and motherboard, Biwin's memory kit will make any mainstream workstation very happy.

Biwin has set the MSRP at $849 for the Black Opal OC Lab Gold Edition DW100 DDR5-6000 C28. While it's currently unavailable for purchase in the U.S., Biwin is actively working to make it available there soon. Interestingly, despite the global memory shortage and increasingly soaring prices, the memory kit has remained stable at €899 at Amazon Germany. Let's hope that Biwin sorts out the logistics quickly, as the Black Opal OC Lab Gold Edition DW100 DDR5-6000 C28 is a solid choice, marred only by its limited availability.

In patients with unresectable melanoma, a flipped-dose regimen of 3 mg/kg of nivolumab plus 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab was associated with higher response rates, longer survival, and fewer severe immune-related adverse events vs standard dosing.

These findings “raise concerns regarding possible overtreatment with the higher dose of ipilimumab in the traditional NIVO1+IPI3 regimen in advanced melanoma and provide evidence supporting the use of NIVO3+IPI1 as a preferred regimen that may offer both improved efficacy and tolerability,” the authors wrote.

In a press release, Hildur Helgadottir, MD, PhD, of Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, said, “Our results suggest that this lower dosage may enable more patients to continue the treatment for a longer time, which is likely to contribute to the improved results and longer survival.” Continued evaluation of the flipped-dose regimen is needed, the researchers noted, including a comparison against the recently approved combination of nivolumab and relatlimab.

The study, led by Karl Björkström, MD, PhD, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, was published online in JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

The retrospective design prevents establishment of causality. The treatment groups showed significant differences in baseline characteristics, particularly disease stage distribution and timing of inclusion. Findings on patients in a single country may not be generalizable.

The study received support through grants from the Swedish Cancer Society, Region Stockholm, and the Cancer Research Funds of Radiumhemmet. Some authors reported receiving speaker honoraria or research grants and having other ties with various sources. Full disclosures are noted in the original article.

 December 11, 2025  

A dedicated pediatric First Seizure Clinic (FSC) provided specialist evaluation in less than a week and enabled an epilepsy diagnosis at the initial visit for more than 1 in 5 children.

The findings come from an 8-year retrospective review of more than 1600 children referred to the FSC at Dayton Children's Hospital (DCH) in Dayton, Ohio. The clinic integrates rapid EEG, targeted imaging, and multidisciplinary counseling at or before the initial appointment to streamline diagnosis and follow-up.

The review underscores how well the FSC model can streamline early evaluation and management, said study author Yash Agarwal, an undergraduate at Washington University in St. Louis who contributed to the project. He told Medscape Medical News that the findings demonstrate the clinic's ability to shorten the path to specialist care and emphasized that similar models could be replicated in other communities where the need exists.

The findings were presented on December 6 at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) 79th Annual Meeting 2025.

Before the clinic was established, wait times for a specialist evaluation often stretched beyond 53 days, Agarwal said. “This is not optimal for any family,” he noted, particularly when delayed diagnosis stalls treatment initiation.

The longer seizures go unaddressed, the greater the adverse impact on cognitive function, seizure outcomes, and overall health. “For children, even a 1-month delay in diagnosis and treatment can cause long-term developmental problems,” Gogi Kumar, MD, the study's senior author and attending physician at DCH, said in a press release.

“Timely treatment can reduce the risk of injury and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and help children live healthier lives,” Kumar added.

The FSC at DCH functions as a centralized, “one-stop” access point designed to shorten the wait for a specialist evaluation while providing rapid access to MRI and ambulatory EEG. Although prior research has shown that adult FSCs are linked to lower subsequent hospital utilization, this is the first study to examine how a pediatric FSC affects access to care and early diagnosis following a first-time seizure.

The retrospective observational study included 1622 patients (median age, 7 years) seen at the DCH clinic from 2017 to 2025. Of these, 47.2% identified as female and 76.6% as White or Caucasian. About 46.9% had private insurance, and 51.8% had public insurance.

The children were referred to the clinic by community physicians, outside emergency departments (EDs), and the hospital's ED. Reasons for referral included new-onset convulsive seizures, suspicion of focal seizures, seizure-like activity, or a recommendation by a provider for a seizure evaluation.

The clinic achieved a median lead time of 6 days from referral to specialist evaluation, with waits ranging from same-day visits to just over a month. Procedures were ordered for nearly two thirds of patients, most often long-term EEG monitoring and brain MRI. Initial visit diagnoses commonly included seizure-like events (21.6%), convulsions (15.8%), and, in about 1 in 5 children, epilepsy (20.9%).

“Being able to offer a diagnosis at the first visit for about 20% of patients is a huge deal,” Agarwal said. “Even if they don't get a diagnosis on the first day because they may need another EEG or more imaging, we're setting up a pathway for them, and that's important.”

A timely diagnosis allows treatment to begin sooner, he added. “Outcomes are always better the earlier you see the patient and the earlier you start therapy.” Agarwal emphasized that the data suggest the model is advancing care in a meaningful way and improving the trajectory for children with new-onset seizures.

Agarwal said the team now plans to examine patient outcomes to better understand the clinic's longer-term impact.

Commenting for Medscape Medical News, Kelly G. Knupp, MD, professor of pediatrics and neurology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado, said the study is particularly important given the ongoing shortage of pediatric neurologists — a problem that “is probably going to get worse before it gets better.” This shortage means it “takes longer and longer” for families to secure an appointment with a specialist, she added.

Knupp said that having a dedicated program where children with possible seizures can be evaluated promptly is an important advance. She said she would also like to understand how families perceive the clinic because clinicians often view the experience through a medical lens, while parents may be overwhelmed by the volume of information delivered in a short period. 

She emphasized that receiving an epilepsy diagnosis can be life-altering for families and questioned whether parents are able to absorb everything presented during the visit or whether the process feels as though there's too much information to absorb in a short period.

Over the past 26 years, drug labels were updated to include pediatric information, but more than half of the medicines studied still came only as adult pills. Labels often lacked guidance on how to modify use for children when only adult forms of the medicines were available, and alternatives were often missing after child‑friendly versions were discontinued.

“These observations beg the question of whether manufacturers leveraging federal incentives to bring pediatric drugs to market should be held to a reasonable expectation of accessibility irrespective of the effective patent life remaining at the time of pediatric approval,” the authors of this study wrote. “Manufacturers, clinicians, and regulators should collaborate to explore solutions that may lead to improved medication options for pediatric patients.”

This study was led by Susan M. Abdel-Rahman, PharmD, of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. It was published online on December 8, 2025, in Pediatrics.

Multiple changes in laws and markets may have occurred over 26 years. Public data limited insight into why child‑friendly forms were not available or how fast products were discontinued after labeling. The findings may not apply to drugs for rare diseases.

This study did not receive any specific funding. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest malignancies, with survival rates remaining dismally low despite major advances in oncology. One of the key reasons lies in the disease's unique fibrotic microenvironment-a dense, collagen-rich tissue that acts as a physical and biochemical barrier, preventing drugs from reaching tumor cells effectively.

Now, a research team from Okayama University and Tohoku University has uncovered a promising new way to breach this barrier. Led by Assistant Professor Hiroyoshi Y. Tanaka from the Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, the group demonstrated that blocking collagen signaling through the discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) significantly improves the delivery of macromolecular drugs in pancreatic cancer. Their study, published online on October 31, 2025, in the journal Small, highlights a new therapeutic approach to enhance drug effectiveness by dismantling fibrotic resistance mechanisms.

The research was spearheaded by Ms. Mayu Ohira and Ms. Moe Kitamura, co-first authors from Okayama University, and carried out in close collaboration with Professor Atsushi Masamune of Tohoku University and Professor Mitsunobu R. Kano of Okayama University. Together, the team investigated how collagen-long considered merely a structural barrier-also acts as a signaling molecule that directly influences fibrosis and drug penetration.

""Our findings reveal that collagen signaling, not just its physical density, plays a crucial role in hindering drug delivery,"" explained Dr. Tanaka, a co-author from Okayama University, Japan. ""By inhibiting DDR1, we can interrupt this signaling cascade, loosen the fibrotic barrier, and enable better access for therapeutic agents.""

The team leveraged an advanced three-dimensional cell culture model that replicates the human pancreatic cancer fibrotic barrier. Through this model, they demonstrated that DDR1 inhibition suppresses collagen signaling and enhances the diffusion of macromolecular drugs, such as antibodies and nanomedicines.

The study also uncovered an unexpected twist: MEK inhibitors, a class of drugs previously tested in pancreatic cancer, were found to increase collagen I expression, intensifying the fibrotic barrier and reducing treatment efficacy. Remarkably, this fibrosis-promoting effect was reversed when DDR1 signaling was blocked.

This newly identified phenomenon, termed 'therapy-induced exacerbation of the fibrotic barrier,' may explain why some MEK inhibitor-based therapies have failed in clinical trials.

We found that while MEK inhibitors can attack cancer cells, they also unintentionally strengthen the fibrotic barrier, making drug penetration even more difficult. Recognizing and countering this effect could fundamentally change how combination therapies are designed for pancreatic cancer.""

Dr. Hiroyoshi Y. Tanaka, Assistant Professor, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University

The researchers emphasized the broader significance of their discovery, noting that a better mechanistic understanding of collagen signaling in fibrosis could lead to new therapeutic strategies across oncology. The team hopes that future studies will validate DDR1 inhibition in clinical settings and pave the way for translational applications in human patients. Looking forward, the team plans to establish combination treatments that simultaneously target tumor cells and their fibrotic surroundings.

Beyond pancreatic cancer, the implications of this study extend to other fibrotic diseases where collagen accumulation limits drug access. By redefining collagen's role as both a structural and signaling component, the researchers believe their work could inform the development of more effective treatments for fibrotic conditions.

As pancreatic cancer continues to pose one of the most formidable challenges in modern oncology, this collaborative study offers new hope, illuminating how rethinking fibrosis might finally help life-saving drugs reach their targets.

World Cup

 Ian Kington / AFP / Getty Images

The U.S. men's national team's road to the 2026 World Cup is officially complete.

After previously announcing friendlies against European powers Belgium, Portugal and Germany in the two windows that will precede next summer's competition, U.S. Soccer revealed Thursday that Mauricio Pochettino's side will be facing African giant Senegal to fill the last open date on the calendar. The U.S. will welcome the Lions of Teranga to Charlotte's Bank of America Stadium on May 31, with the match slated for a 3 p.m. ET start time. The two nations have never met on the senior international stage before.

“We are so happy to have such a great team in Senegal as our fourth opponent in the matches leading up into the tournament,” Pochettino said in a statement. “In the year leading up to the World Cup, we will have played at least one team from five different confederations which is incredibly valuable for our preparations. We are looking forward to an amazing crowd in Charlotte.”

The Senegal match should be the first for the U.S.'s final World Cup squad, with Pochettino previously indicating that he has no plans to use the last friendlies before the World Cup as a final tryout. Based on his previous comments, which are subject to change, he expects to name his final team before the camp that includes the Senegal friendly and send-off match in Chicago vs. Germany before going straight into the World Cup.

“I think it's difficult when you bring more than 26 [players], and then you need to tell [a player], on the last day, ‘You are out,” Pochettino said in November. “I prefer … to bring the 26 that you believe are going to be in the squad, and if something happens, you call someone (else).”

The U.S. has been preparing exclusively against teams that qualified for the World Cup ever since the conclusion of the Concacaf Gold Cup, and adding Senegal to the mix is a continuation of that. September friendlies against Japan and South Korea were followed by October dates with Ecuador and Australia. The Americans capped the year by beating South America's Paraguay and Uruguay. Even before the Gold Cup last June, the U.S. faced Switzerland and Turkey, with the latter not having qualified for the World Cup yet but taking part in the European qualifying playoff whose winner will enter the U.S.'s group.

If Turkey is to get through, then the U.S. will have played all three of its group opponents (Paraguay, Australia being the others) in the year leading into the World Cup.

Senegal, which reached the 2022 World Cup round of 16 and is paced by former Liverpool star Sadio Mané, went unbeaten in Africa's World Cup qualifying competition (seven wins, three draws). At the World Cup, Senegal is in a difficult Group I, which features France, Norway and a qualifier to-be-determined from the March intercontinental playoffs. The team will first be competing in the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations, headlining a group with DR Congo, Benin and Botswana later this month. Senegal won the competition in 2021 and was runner-up in 2019.

It is possible that the two sides could meet in the round of 32 at the World Cup. If the U.S. wins its group, it will be paired with a third-place finisher from one of five groups, and Group I is among that mix. Conversely, if Senegal wins its group, it'll be matched with a third-place finisher from one of five groups, and the U.S.'s Group D is included in that.

Croatian goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic has been told he will never play for Spanish side Girona again

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Girona coach Michel has publicly criticised Croatia goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic, stating the player will not feature for the club again after allegedly refusing to play due to personal ambitions. 

Michel revealed on Thursday that the reserve goalkeeper declined to participate in a recent fixture, prioritising his World Cup prospects with Croatia, who are due to face England in their first match, and a potential move to another team.

""Livakovic is a spectacular person, but he has a timeline with objectives different from Girona's,"" Michel stated. 

""He needs to play for the World Cup, not for Girona. He told me this himself; he is a sincere person. He told me he didn't want to be here, that he wanted to play for another team because if he played with Girona, he wouldn't be able to play for another team.""

The 30-year-old Livakovic, currently on loan from Fenerbahce, reportedly informed Michel he wished to remain eligible for a transfer to a different club. 

Football regulations stipulate that players can only represent two teams in a single season, and Livakovic has already played for Fenerbahce.

This refusal forced regular starter Paulo Gazzaniga to play a Copa del Rey match earlier this month despite suffering from the flu and a high fever. Michel expressed his frustration, highlighting the immediate impact on the squad.

""Right now, I only have one goalkeeper available,"" Michel explained. 

""Gazzaniga's commitment is beyond any doubt. Until the winter transfer window, I know we have a problem. And I am not defending my position but defending the goalkeeper who has been here for three years, which is Gazzaniga.""

Michel justified making the matter public by asserting that ""the fans needed to know."" 

The situation comes as Girona, currently 18th in the league standings and within the relegation zone, faces a challenging period. 

Gazzaniga himself has endured an inconsistent season, marked by several errors, including two that led to Elche goals in a recent match.

A Star-Studded Moroccan Squad With One Big Question


Hosts Morocco have officially revealed their squad list for AFCON 2025, assembling one of the most talented and well-balanced teams in the tournament. Coach Walid Regragui called up elite names such as Brahim Díaz, Noussair Mazraoui, Azzedine Ounahi, Nayef Aguerd, and Eliesse Ben Seghir, reinforcing the idea that the Lions of the Atlas aspire to lift the trophy on home soil.





However, despite the depth of quality, all the anticipation revolved around a single figure: Achraf Hakimi, the most influential Moroccan footballer of his generation.

The final list also left notable absences, including Hakim Ziyech and Sofiane Boufal, both left out of the squad. Even so, the atmosphere surrounding the announcement made clear that the true suspense came from Hakimi's medical situation and whether he would be able to compete.


The Injury That Threatened His Presence in the Tournament


Hakimi's participation became uncertain after suffering a severe right ankle sprain from a tough tackle by Luis Díaz during PSG's Champions League match against Bayern Munich.

Forced off the field on his 27th birthday, he underwent medical tests that confirmed he would require two weeks of total immobilization followed by at least four weeks of rehabilitation—a timeline that jeopardized his availability for Morocco's AFCON group stage.

Inside PSG, the concern was clear: while they hoped he might recover in time for the knockout rounds, his chances of starting the tournament were far from guaranteed.

The injury also came at a moment when PSG had multiple players sidelined, but Hakimi's case was the most delicate due to what he represents for his country and the level of physical demand expected at AFCON.






His Award as African Player of the Year Highlights His Importance


Even while injured, Hakimi reached a milestone in his career by winning the 2025 CAF African Player of the Year award. It was the culmination of an extraordinary season at PSG, where he played 55 matches, scored 11 goals, delivered 14 assists, and helped secure a historic treble: Ligue 1, Coupe de France, and Champions League.


His leadership was just as crucial in guiding Morocco to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, solidifying his status as one of Africa's greatest modern football icons.
But at the awards ceremony in Rabat, he appeared wearing a protective boot on his injured foot—a symbolic reminder that his availability for AFCON was still in doubt.

But at the awards ceremony in Rabat, he appeared wearing a protective boot on his injured foot—a symbolic reminder that his availability for AFCON was still in doubt.

The honor recognized his brilliance. The injury exposed his vulnerability at the worst time.


So… Is Achraf Hakimi Included in Morocco's AFCON Squad?


After weeks of speculation, medical updates, and hopeful projections, Morocco settled the debate: yes, Achraf Hakimi has been officially called up for AFCON 2025.

The PSG full-back appears on the final squad list and will join the team for the home tournament, offering a massive emotional boost to fans and teammates alike. However, his physical condition remains the key variable. The federation and coaching staff are expected to manage his workload with extreme caution, especially in the early stages.

Hakimi is on the list—but his impact will depend entirely on how well he recovers in the coming days. Morocco will handle him carefully, knowing that having him fully fit could be the difference between a deep run and falling short at home.

MLS commissioner Don Garber has publicly encouraged Mohamed Salah to consider a move to the United States amid escalating uncertainty over the Liverpool star's future. With his relationship with manager Arne Slot fractured and interest growing across the Atlantic, Garber urged the Egyptian to speak directly with Lionel Messi and Thomas Muller to learn how transformative MLS life can be.

Salah's future has been thrown into fresh doubt after a turbulent season at Liverpool, where a public breakdown in relations with Slot has sent shockwaves through Anfield. With Saudi Pro League interest strong and MLS teams unexpectedly entering the picture, the uncertainty has given rise to global debate about his next step.

MLS commissioner Garber has now added fuel to the discussion by directly inviting Salah to consider the American league as a serious option. His public remarks came as rumours linked the Egyptian icon with a potential move to ambitious clubs such as San Diego FC or Chicago Fire, both of whom may have the financial structure and an open marquee-player slot to attempt such a deal. Whether Salah is indeed open to the idea remains unclear, but the commissioner's comments have thrust MLS into the conversation.

Speaking about Salah's uncertain future, Garber made his stance clear, telling reporters: “Obviously, if [Salah] ever decides to come to Major League Soccer, we'd welcome him with open arms. I'd say he should reach out to Leo [Messi] and reach out to Thomas Muller and see how happy they've been and how successful they've been and how much they've really embraced being in Major League Soccer.”

He also warned that MLS would not interfere with Liverpool's active contract: “I've seen some rumors about Mo Salah. We very much believe in the sanctity of a contract; that's an American business dynamic. Mo's under contract to Liverpool, people we know. It's a great team.”

Salah's link to MLS is emerging at a time when the Egyptian star is enduring the most challenging season of his Liverpool career. His fallout with Slot, punctuated by being benched for three straight league games and excluded from the squad against Inter Milan, has reshaped the narrative around his future. With his contract running until 2027, his next step hinges on whether he and Liverpool consider reconciliation possible or whether a major transfer becomes inevitable.

The Saudi Pro League retains strong interest and has historically offered enormous financial packages to lure the forward. MLS, meanwhile, represents a different kind of appeal: lifestyle, market expansion, and the chance to follow the Messi blueprint, which has elevated the league's visibility worldwide. 

Yet the obstacles are considerable as MLS clubs must navigate salary-cap regulations, Designated Player slots, and competitive balance rules, all of which complicate deals of this scale. Even Inter Miami, who famously engineered the Messi signing, are believed to be prioritising other positions, making a 2026-style roster reconstruction more feasible than a 2025 splash for Salah. Still, given Salah's global influence, MLS will not simply dismiss the idea.

For MLS, the next step is simply to monitor the situation while maintaining an open line of invitation should Salah push for a move away from Liverpool. Garber's comments are intended to position the league as a viable destination without breaching contractual respect, leaving the decision firmly in the player's hands. If Salah does explore the option, conversations with Messi, Müller and other European imports may prove influential.

Liverpool, meanwhile, must resolve the deepening rift between Salah and Slot as the club enters a crucial phase of the season. Whether he stays or departs could depend on performances, dressing-room dynamics, and Liverpool's stance ahead of the January window. Should relations continue to deteriorate, Salah could face a pivotal choice between staying in Europe, accepting a Saudi mega-offer or starting a new chapter in MLS.

“I'm really excited to show you guys the behind the scenes of my life, on the court, off the court, unedited, unfiltered,” Shelton said in an intro video posted on his channel.


Shelton, No. 9 in the PIF ATP Rankings, won his biggest career title in August at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Toronto. He finished the season with a 40-24 match record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Season showdown in Abu Dhabi

Carlos Sainz reflects on finishing outside the points in the final race of the season.

Carlos Sainz hopes Williams' point-less finish in the Abu Dhabi season finale serves as a ""wake-up call"" for the team, with the the Spaniard believing it is the best catalyst to take into the off season.

Williams had a successful 2025 season overall, with a fifth-place finish in the Teams' Championship to celebrate, while Sainz also claimed two podium finishes – plus a further top-three finish in the Austin Sprint.

With the team having switched focus to their 2026 car relatively early, some of those late results were achieved despite having minimal upgrades to the FW47. Sainz finished third in Baku and in Qatar for his two podiums in his debut season for the Grove-based team, but his year ended with a P13 in Abu Dhabi.

“We were starting 12th and we were the 12th fastest car and with nothing exciting happening in the race we were always going to finish there - with [Lewis] Hamilton making it through the pack to [drop us to] P13,” Sainz explained.

“Everyone else, we just did everything we could to finish in the points but there was simply not enough pace this weekend, which I hope it serves as a good wake-up call to the team, that after a podium you come back in Abu Dhabi thinking you are going to be strong and we were quite weak this weekend.

“I'm actually happy this happened, so we go into the winter without falling asleep.”

After losing his 2025 Ferrari seat to Hamilton, Sainz had options on the F1 grid to choose from with Williams boss James Vowles successfully persuading him to pick the Grove-based squad as they plot their way back towards the front of the grid.

With their P5 finish this season showing that they are heading in the right direction, Sainz reflected on his first Williams campaign, acknowledging there were plenty of tough times early on.

“For sure, it has been a very challenging first half to the season,"" he said.

""But I hope all that frustration that I got from that first half, as I said, even if we were quick, even if the adaptation was good, if all that frustration meant that then two podiums were meant to come and one podium in the Sprint, I definitely welcome that frustration and that lack of points in the first half.

“I think in the second half [of the season] I proved to everyone why we made this switch, and what we are trying to achieve here and why I think we are a force to be reckoned with for the future.

“If you had told me last year we would have scored those podiums and be P5 in the Constructors' like we are, I would have taken it. And overall, we have to take it as a very positive first year with Williams.”

The 25-year-old actor has found himself in the spotlight after his breakout role in the HBO Max-Crave series has caught fire: “As an actor, you just always hope that things pop off.”


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	“My head hasn't exploded yet, so we're doing good,” Connor Storrie jokes. 


	No one could blame the 25-year-old if that were the case. His buzzy series Heated Rivalry went from the special project he made in the bubble of a tight-knit Canadian set to the show of the moment, becoming the internet's favorite before it even found a U.S. home or was released.




	In Heated Rivalry, Storrie plays Ilya Rozanov, a Russian-born hockey player who meets his professional rival, Shane Hollander, portrayed by Hudson Williams, at the age of 17. By the age of 18, the pair, now professional hockey players, begin sleeping together on and off for years throughout their career, growing from teens to men. The show is hot and exciting, while still being vulnerable and smart.

	The actor, perfectly cast even though he himself didn't see it at first, not only had to learn hockey but an entirely new language, as his character spends a considerable amount of time each episode speaking Russian. Hearing Storrie, a West Texas native, speak in his normal accent is jarring, in a genuinely impressive way. “I've always loved languages. I've always loved accents,” the actor tells The Hollywood Reporter. “I used to write monologues, and I would just put it into Google Translate and memorize it in different languages.”


	Below, Storrie chats all about his breakout role in Heated Rivalry, how he learned Russian so quickly, the pressures of adapting a beloved character and what's next.


How are you doing with this instant love from the internet?


	I feel really honored and blessed. We all know the internet can be really ruthless, especially Twitter. For every negative comment, I feel like there's a billion good ones, so I feel like the pros far outweigh the cons. Also, I think being from this day and age, I'm very aware of the presence of social media. I'm aware of how connected you are to the people who are watching it, so that's prepared me to really engage with people. I feel good. My head hasn't exploded yet, so we're doing good.

	











In the past, people didn't have that instant access to every creative person to share such quick feedback. Are you thinking about that in a way that's stressful, or something that just is?


	No, I think if you think on it too much, it can stress you out a little bit. We're in a really cool circumstance where the people who are interacting with this are just so enthusiastic and positive. I think that's because Jacob [Tierney, show creator] created something really cool and because Rachel Reid [author, Heated Rivalry] spoke to a community and a group that really loves her work. It's both of those things. Before the show even came to be, the fandom was already so positive and warm and enthusiastic. If you're doing anything great or anything that's bold, you have to have the idea that some people aren't going to like it, and that's OK, and that's good. Some of the best movies in the world have haters on them. There's some movies and stuff that I don't like that are world-renowned, and it doesn't mean that it's not awesome. It just means it doesn't speak to every single person, every single thing, given this speaks to a lot of people.


In taking on this project, how much did you know about it? What were you thinking when it came your way?


	When I got the breakdown, it was like 6'3, native Russian speaker, hockey player. Usually [the requirements are] a little less specific than that. With that being so specific, I didn't think this was going to be me. The breakdown also said that it was a book. I remember looking up the book, looking up the fan art and reading about it online. All of the fan art was this ginormous guy with brown eyes and scruff. As an actor, especially at the phase I was at before Heated Rivalry, you audition for things all the time that are such a shot in the dark and are such a long shot, but you want to act and work, so you give it a shot. I thought this was special and cool from the jump, but definitely did not think it was going to be me. Personally, the thing that excited me most about it too, off the jump, was the Russian element of it.

	











Why was that exciting?


	I've always loved languages, I've always loved accents. When I was little, I used to — this is probably back in 2007, I think when Google Translate came out, 2008, so it was not correct at all. I used to write monologues, and I would put it into Google Translate and memorize it in different languages.


Wow.


	Looking back on it, the pronunciation was horrible. The grammar was so wrong. I probably half memorized it. I would do it in French, I would do it in Chinese. The culture shifting, the language and the accent, that was really, really, really cool to me.


Everything makes a lot more sense. How long did you have to prepare that?


	The timeline's kind of spotty because I'm pretty sure I didn't get the actual call that it was 100 percent a go until, I want to say, a week before we left, which isn't super-duper abnormal. But it's kind of crazy to have to learn how to skate, play hockey, speak Russian and do the accent and you don't even know until a week before. Once I got the yes, I started almost instantly. They hooked me up with my awesome dialect coach, Kate Yablunovski, who was based in Montreal. We started doing three, four-hour Zoom sessions every single day. A week before I left, I started learning Russian, and then I was with her for the first month and a half of the shoot, [and] I had Russian sprinkled throughout. Again, every single day — five, six, seven days a week, we would talk on the phone and go over the Russian.

	











Then the hockey of it all, that's another element. How into sports were you before this?


	Growing up, I was a tumbler. I'm from West Texas, so the tumbling, gymnastics [and] competitive cheerleading thing is pretty big out there. I did that growing up, so I was always into individual sports. I'm not the best team player. If I'm going to fail, I want to fail because of me.


Yeah, not because of someone else.


	Totally. I skated a little bit growing up. I remember recreationally skating with my cousins and stuff. One time, there was this Russian lady who actually came up to me. Again, this is in West Texas, middle of nowhere [in the] desert. This Russian lady came up to my mom and was like, “You have to let me train him.” I remember the next day I came back and there was no one in the skating rink, and she skated backwards and made me do these little — they call them C-cuts in hockey. Yeah, never saw her again, but my mom said she really wanted to make me her little prodigy. I'm good at anything that has to do with control. With hockey, I can do the skating, but once they drop that puck and they give me the stick, I'm out.


It seems like you were able to film most of this show in a bubble, which I assume was nice. There were built-in fans, but I imagine this rollout has been more than anyone imagined. What did you think going in versus what it ended up being?


	There's two parts of that for me. On one hand, when I signed up for this, it was a Canadian television show that was getting put up on Crave, which is a strictly Canadian streamer. I was still super excited about that because to me, that meant we were going to do a limited series in a more independent way. Sometimes, that's where a lot of magic can happen. Maybe it'll have some sort of international distribution at some point, but at the end of the day, I was excited to work. I was excited to work on something that was so specific and cool. I'm not a hockey player. I got to get out of my country for a few months. I got to speak a different language. I was in it. If it never got seen, and if it never got finished, I would still have been ecstatic just to have that experience.

	











Then the international distribution came along? 


	Getting that next level of distribution, it's the dream. Everyone that I've talked to in the industry and on the distribution or the sales side [has said] this doesn't happen. As an actor, you just always hope that things pop off. We do this, we make stuff so that it can be seen, it can be shared and so that it can affect people and it can become part of the cultural ethos. It looks like it's doing that, so it's so cool. I'm also kind of nihilistic in the way where I just — I don't think it's a bad thing, I actually think it's a good thing — always expect the worst. I hope for the best. Shoot for the stars and expect the worst.


In the span of a week, essentially, you go from just doing your job as an actor to having a lot of people on the internet talking about or weighing in on you. How are you dealing with it?


	I don't know how to say this without sounding like an asshole, but I think as an actor, I've always wanted to work at a really high scale. I think every actor does. If you want to be an actor, on some level, I think there's something about wanting what you do to be seen and be exposed and reach people. I've wanted to be an actor since… My mom always says that since I could speak, I've always been like, “That's me on the TV.” I don't know, I've always seen that for myself. For it to finally manifest, and to be reaching people in that way… This is what I wanted, so can't really be too shocked when it happens.

	











	As for people addressing me specifically online, rather than just the work that I do, I just see it as part of the territory. Once again, luckily people are really, really nice to me and say a lot of really nice things. I think it comes with the territory of wanting to work on the level that I'm really excited to work on, and I hope that continues to grow, and I get to do more stuff and work with other cool people that inspire me. It's part of the job, baby.


In bringing Ilya to life, I'm wondering how you saw him when reading the script or the book for the first time. There's been a lot of conversation online about who the character is. How did you see him? How did you track that emotionally?


	I saw a lot of love for Ilya online before I dove into the book. Once I booked a part, I instantly read the book. I didn't read the second one just because I didn't want to play [him] with the end in mind. But it's funny, I think that at first I remember thinking that people loved him because of the bad boy sort of archetype. Me as a person, I don't always find that charming, endearing, funny, because I see it as a shell. I was like, oh, here we go. [I'm] going to play the bad boy. Everyone loves this bad boy because he's cheeky and he's cocky and people like that. Then I realized really quickly that everyone likes him for the same reason that I'm learning to like him, which is that it's a front, that it's a shell. There's more underneath it. He's playing at being a grouch sometimes. He's playing at being a flirt sometimes, but underneath it, without revealing anything for the plot for the people who haven't read the books, he goes through a lot. He goes through some shit, and that's why people like him. We feel for people that go through stuff. I mean, it's so easy to engage with someone who tries to wink his way through all of that. That's so charming and so likable.

	











It is.


	It just means that he feels everything since you don't see it. He feels it a hundred times bigger than most. That's why people love it. That's why people love him. That's why I love him, and why he's so cool.


Jacob has spoken about the fact that he wanted to take this material seriously. In general, romance is typically adapted in a bit more frivolous way. I appreciate that the show takes the material seriously and treats it in a real way. Did you feel more pressure in that sense?


	Pressure is an interesting thing in that — to be completely honest — I don't really feel a lot of pressure as an actor, and it doesn't mean that I'm always confident. I doubt certain choices or putting on an accent as hyperbolic as Ilya's is not always a comfortable, easy decision.


I can imagine.


	But I'm very much of the mindset that with art — and today's world pushes this all the time — you do something, you give it 100 percent, and eventually it'll move on, and we'll watch it, appreciate it and then we'll move on to the next thing, which I don't think is a bad thing at all. For me, I'm always just like, just give it 150 percent, and if people don't like it, accept it and move on. I just felt like I was in really good hands. Because you're right, a story like this, I think a lot of other directors and writers would've tried to adapt something like this and could've fallen into a few pitfalls, kind of what you said, tried to feed into a really watered-down idea of the female gaze, and Jacob didn't do that. It's interesting. It's fast, it's witty, it's sexy, it's stylized, it's awkward at the right moments. Reading that, instantly a lot of my fears went away because I think the only time that you can really hesitate is if the foundation isn't strong.

	











What do you, as an actor, hope comes next after this experience? You're still very much in the middle of it, but looking ahead, what are you thinking about?


	I'm still very much in the beginning stages of my career. I think it's cool to be transparent about that because when you talk to actors a lot, or when you read or watch interviews, it feels so distant from you. To be completely honest — and I think this is cool to talk about because I never hear a lot of actors talking about this — but when I auditioned for Heated Rivalry, I was working at a restaurant. I was working at a restaurant 40 hours a week, getting off at 1 a.m. I did that on and off ever since I was in high school.


	I just feel really lucky and so blessed right now to be doing the thing that I've always wanted to do. Really, honest to God, all I want going forward is to keep having opportunities to work and be on set and enjoy the people and the experiences along the way. It sounds so cheesy, and I was not of that mindset up until eight months ago, but it really is just about being inspired and being with cool people. I just feel so blessed to be doing the thing that I've always wanted to do with my life. How long that lasts, what that looks like, who I get to work with, the ups and the downs, I don't know, but all I can do is be thankful for right now and hope that those fruits continue to grow.

Check out pics of the global pop star. 

“I'm wearing my Rosie T-shirt,” Bruno Mars says with his signature suave smile as Rosé laughs in disbelief. She, too, is wearing artist merchandise — only hers is a Bruno Mars T-shirt. “We weren't planning this,” attests Bruno, to which Rosé adds with a playful sigh, “This is our life.”

Even over Zoom today from across the world, with Rosé in Seoul and Mars in Los Angeles, there's a comfortable candor between the two collaborators and close friends — a relationship that Rosé, 28, likens to siblings, with Mars, 40, acting as a music industry mentor and older-brother figure to her. They first met at an Atlantic-arranged meeting at Mars' L.A. studio in the summer of 2024, as the Blackpink superstar was preparing her solo debut album, and Mars remembers how she was immediately “hustling information” from him. As Rosé recalls, “I was trying to get the most out of the meeting because I thought it'd be our last — first and last meeting, forever. Like, ‘This is my moment, I need to get all the tips, all the help I can.'

“There was a lot that I was determined to learn about,” she says of embarking on her solo career, for which she signed with The Black Label for management in June 2024 and Atlantic Records for label services that September — and, in September 2025, with WME for worldwide representation for future releases and solo global touring. “I just remember feeling like a very curious soul as to what I would want to do on my own,” Rosé explains, “so it was a good opportunity for me to meet new people in this industry.”

The superstar has signed with the agency for worldwide representation for her solo music career.

	Lyndsey Havens



Rosé is doubling down on her solo career: the global pop star has signed with WME for worldwide representation in all areas of her music career.


	The deal, signed in September, comes on the heels of a historic year for the Blackpink member. Following the 2024 release of her debut solo album Rosie, lead single “APT.” with Bruno Mars has become a global smash. The hit made history with the forthcoming 2026 Grammys — where it is nominated for record and song of the year, along with best pop/duo group performance — when the song's nominations made Rosé the first lead K-pop artist to earn a nod in any of the Grammys' main six categories.


	Even more recently, “APT.” finished as the No. 1 song on both the 2025 Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. year-end charts — earning her the cover of Billboard‘s No. 1s issue.


	Rosé's deal with WME signals much more to come, as she prepares new projects and global releases and also expands into solo global touring. 


	“Rosé is a creative force with a voice that transcends borders and languages,” WME's global head of contemporary music and touring Lucy Dickins said in a statement. “We are honored to welcome her to WME and excited to support her as she continues to shatter records, break new ground as a solo artist and reach even greater heights in her music career. She is unstoppable.” 


	Ahead of releasing Rosie, Rosé signed with The Black Label for management in June 2024 and Atlantic Records for label services that September. As she said in her Billboard cover story about beginning her solo career, “There was a lot that I was determined to learn about… I just remember feeling like a very curious soul as to what I would want to do on my own.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Say Nothing star Lola Petticrew has been tapped as the co-lead opposite Toby Wallace in Netflix's Assassin's Creed live-action series, based on Ubisoft's best-selling video game franchise.


Assassin's Creed is a high-octane thriller centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions — one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters — said to be different from the games — across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny.

	Details about Petticrew's series regular role are being kept under wraps. The series is expected to start production in 2026 in Italy, which, as Deadline has reported, serves as a setting of the series, with the exact time period unclear.

	Roberto Patino and David Wiener serve as showrunners on Assassin's Creed, which stems from a deal Netflix signed with Ubisoft in 2020. They executive produce with Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, Genevieve Jones for Ubisoft Film & Television, and Matt O'Toole.


	With more than 230 million units sold, the Assassin's Creed franchise is one of the best-selling series in video game history.


	For their starring role in FX's limited series Say Nothing, Petticrew was just nominated for an Independent Spirit Award in the Best Lead Performance In a New Scripted Series category and previously won the Irish Film & Television Award for Best Lead Actress and received a Best Actress BAFTA Television Award nomination.

	











	Petticrew recently played the lead in Channel 4's series adaptation of Louise Kennedy's novel Trespasses, starring opposite Gillian Anderson, and is wrapping production on Liz Meriwether's upcoming Hulu series Furious (aka Black Widow). Petticrew, whose break came playing the title role opposite Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the 2023 indie Tuesday, is repped by CAA, Range Media Partners, UK's B-Side Management and Sloane Offer Weber & Dern.

EXCLUSIVE: The 2026 Sundance documentary lineup will feature a royal flourish.


	Deadline has learned the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – Prince Harry and Meghan – will executive produce Cookie Queens, “a coming-of-age story about the joys, pressures, and pain points woven into one of America's most cherished rituals: Girl Scout Cookie season.”


	The couple's Archewell Productions is partnering with Beautiful Stories and AJNA Films on the documentary, which premieres in the festival's Family Matinee section. Alysa Nahmias (Art & Krimes By Krimes, Unfinished Spaces) directs the film, producing alongside Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw (The Truffle Hunters, Gaucho Gaucho), and Jennifer Sims.

	“Captivating, candid, and full of heart, the film follows four girls ages five to twelve and their families as they navigate the annual whirlwind of selling, striving, and succeeding,” notes a description of Cookie Queens. “For these Girl Scouts, selling cookies isn't just about Thin Mints and sisterhood – it's a crash course in entrepreneurship. Behind the smiles and cookie boxes lie real pressure: long hours, ambitious sales goals, and the weight of high expectations. Nahmias crafts a bold, vibrant, observational portrait that honors the girls' perspectives and illuminates the emotional and intellectual stakes of their experiences.”

	Long before she became a member of the British royal family, Meghan donned the Girl Scouts vest, participating in that annual rite of selling boxes of cookies to fundraise for the group.

	











	“As a former Girl Scout myself, with my mom as my troop leader, I have a personal affinity for this film and am proud that all our conversations and collaboration have led to Archewell Productions partnering with this award-winning team to executive produce this incredibly captivating documentary,” Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, shared. In a statement, she said, “When we first viewed the early footage of this documentary, it was immediately something we wanted to be involved in. The creative point of view, the edgy yet humanizing tone and tenor of the directing, and the glimpse behind-the-scenes into such a nostalgic and also modern tradition of Girl Scout Cookie season are absolutely irresistible.”


	No word yet on whether Meghan and Harry plan to attend Sundance. The festival hasn't announced the exact premiere date yet for Cookie Queens.


	“I'm proud and excited to be premiering Cookie Queens at the Sundance Film Festival – which has been a north star along my creative path – and to share that Prince Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and the Archewell Productions team are partners in this project as we introduce the stories of these remarkable girls with the world,” director-producer Alysa Nahmias said in a statement. “From our very first conversation, their enthusiasm was unmistakable – Meghan has a deep personal connection to our film's community as a Girl Scouts alumna, and the Archewell Productions team understands how this coming-of-age tale goes beyond the cookies to resonate not only with the world's 50+ million Girl Scouts, but audiences everywhere. I'm grateful to have such thoughtful partners in bringing this delicious adventure to the screen.”


Cookie Queens is a Beautiful Stories & AJNA Films Production in association with Archewell Productions, Artemis Rising Foundation and Good Gravy Films. Along with Prince Harry and Meghan, the film is executive produced by Chanel Pysnik and co-produced by Qadriyyah Shamsid-Deen for Archewell Productions. Executive producers also include Regina K. Scully, Hallee Adelman, Ann Lewnes, Stephen G. Hall, Ruth Ann Harnisch, Geralyn Dreyfous, Tegan Acton, Emma Pompetti, James Costa, Trevor Burgess, Sheri Sobrato, Jamie Wolf, Nathalie Seaver, Andrea van Beuren, and Jennifer Pelling.


	The film is edited by Kim Roberts and Jeanne Applegate; Antonio Cisneros served as DP on the project. Amanda Jones composed the score; music supervisors are Bruce Gilbert and Lauren Mikus.

It's beginning to look a lot like “Selfie szn.”

Kim Kardashian can be seen soaking up the sun in a tiny leopard print string bikini in her latest Instagram photo dump shared on Tuesday.

In the picture, the “Kardashians” star, 45, wore her signature black hair slicked back and sported a pair of oversized sunglasses while giving a kissy face to the camera.

She rounded out her carousel with photos of her spending quality time with her family, which included a sweet snap featuring her and Kanye West's four children — daughters North, 12, and Chicago, 7, and sons Saint, 10, and Psalm, 6 — as they smiled during an outing with their grandmother, Kris Jenner.

In another two pictures, Kardashian gave a rare glimpse at her grandmother, “MJ” Campbell. 

She closed the post with a photo from her sleepover with her sister Khloé Kardashian and Britney Spears.

“Selfie szn,” the Skims founder captioned the post. 

It seems the reality TV star has been spending some much needed relaxation time by the pool after she candidly shared how stressed she was while studying for the California State Bar exam. 

After revealing that she failed her 2025 attempt at the test in November, Kardashian shared a set of bikini photos which appeared to have been taken at her sister Kendall Jenner's lavish 30th birthday celebration.

The business mogul wore a gray bejeweled bikini set as she posed for a selfie. For her hair, she styled her long black locks in loose waves and accessorized with a silver scarf.

She also paired the look with another pair of oversized black shades. 

Kendall's birthday was on Nov. 3 and the model celebrated with a star-studded, private beach bash that included mom Kris and sisters Kim, Khloé, and Kylie Jenner.

Hilary Swank has apologized after snapping at a mom for seemingly taking her picture at the airport without her permission.

Jada Bafus, who was taking her two terminally ill sons, Mason, 7, and Jack, 4, on a trip to Disneyland, said she happened to spot the Oscar winner at Los Angeles' LAX airport during the Make-A-Wish trip.

“At baggage claim, I was walking next to Hilary Swank,” Bafus said, according to the Daily Mail.  “And I did a double take on her because it's Hilary Swank and I am a fan of her movies and stuff.” 

Bafus said she took out her phone “because I got distracted and trying to find my Make-A-Wish kids and my husband.”

“I just looked, like you know, I was trying to call my husband. I wasn't taking a picture.”On social media, Bafus detailed that Swank said to her, “You got what you needed? Get what you came for? Enjoy that picture.”

Bafus claimed that Swank “stormed off a little bit” following the encounter.

“It just hurt my feelings because I was starting my son's Make-A-Wish trip, which she wouldn't have known, but just one of those situations where it was one of my first encounters with a celebrity so I thought it was a little comical,” Bafus said. 

“We just don't know what others are going through and I was just a stressed mom trying to navigate LAX.“

Bafus' sons are battling Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a rare genetic disorder defined by extreme muscle weakness caused by progressive muscle degeneration. The condition is terminal and typically leads to loss of mobility by age 12 and a shortened lifespan.

Bafus later noted that Swank reached out with an apology.

She told the outlet that Swank reached out via Instagram to apologize, and explain she was worried about her twin toddlers, Aya and Ohm, being photographed.

Bafus asked that the apology, which she shared with the outlet, not be reproduced.  She expressed shock that Swank reached out. 

“I did not expect Hilary Swank to directly talk to me,” she said. “It was just like a ‘Woah, I was taken aback.'”

Bafus' husband, Bryan, said the encounter was “unexpected at the start of our trip” and wondered why a two-time Oscar winner would be concerned about cameras.

“To snap back at anybody when you're in that profession is kind of like ,,, I don't know — it is what it is,” he said, per the outlet, adding that the couple is “not upset” at Swank.

A rep for the “Boys Don't Cry” actress did not immediately return Page Six's request for comment. 

Swank announced that she welcomed her twins with husband Philip Schneider in April 2023, and has never shared photos of their faces via social media. 

“I thought that it would be like this dream, but it's dreamier than I ever imagined,” she told Today of becoming a mom, in a February 2024 interview.

“It blows open my whole world in the most beautiful way.”

Nothing says summer fun like a successfully paper-trained pup. The trailer for Supergirl, the first theatrical expansion of James Gunn's new DC Cinematic Universe, is a booze-and-piss soaked introduction to the woman of tomorrow, Kara Zor-El (Milly Alcock). Picking up where her Superman cameo left off, Supergirl zooms around the galaxy, enjoying the loosened inhibitions effects of being far from Earth's yellow sun.

More surprisingly, Supergirl more closely recalls James Gunn's sci-fi exploits on Guardians Of The Galaxy than last year's Man of Steel reboot. Directed by Craig Gillespie, who applies his reputation for stories about flawed females, like Tonya Harding and Cruella De Vil, to the superhero world, Supergirl's trailer teases the off-world browns of the MCU more than the bright, colorful Metropolis of Gunn's film. Nevertheless, 2025's favorite CGI cutie, Krypto, links us to the previous film's misfit sensibility while Alcock drinks her way into the role.



As to why Gunn is following Superman with Supergirl rather than a straight-ahead sequel, he says it came down to the script.

“When Ana Nogueira wrote the Woman Of Tomorrow script, it was fantastic,” Gunn said at Supergirl‘s virtual press conference on Sunday. “At DC Studios, we care most about the writing, and so we just instantly greenlit the movie. Now, it was something that I was very interested in making from before we even took over DC Studios. I called [DC Studios co-chair Peter Safran]. I said, ‘Have you seen this book by Tom King, Woman Of Tomorrow?' Told him how great it was, what an interesting take it was on Supergirl. And I said, ‘You know who would be great? If you've seen that little blonde girl in House Of The Dragon, I think she would be great because it's a rock and roll Supergirl.'”

Supergirl opens June 26, 2026.

“Love letters to cinema” are often so poisonously sweet they might as well be written in antifreeze. So when a deadly bitter streak administers Narcan to the film-addicted work of Chinese writer-director Bi Gan, it's invigorating—a blast of human frailty revitalizing his intoxicated ode to the movies. Bi believes in art, it's people he's not so sure about. The relationship between the two suffuses the sensation-split Resurrection, his anthology-like epic that spans the history of moviemaking and the corresponding moments in Chinese history. Through five enrapturing and escalating chapters loosely based around the five senses, Resurrection strips its audience down and builds them back up again, revealing how we change the art we make, and how it changes us in turn.

Since Kaili Blues, Bi has been using crime stories as backdrops for his more abstract interests in time, images, and the unconscious. His follow-up film, Long Day's Journey Into Night, falls backwards into a gangster's 3D, hour-long, single-shot dream. Resurrection once again crawls under the skin of crooks and screw-ups, searching for the sublime subjective truths of our nerve endings through a shotgun spread of dreams. In the frame narrative, a mutated Deliriant (Jackson Yee, who goes on to virtuosically play the leads in each of the chapters) is one of the sole remaining humans who still has the capacity to dream; everyone else has given up this ability in order to achieve immortality. But what kind of living is that? 

A narrator (Shu Qi) takes us through this Deliriant's various imaginations, beginning with evocative silent pictures and evolving into flashily modern single-take wonders. It starts with the Deliriant in his most monstrous, garish form—a pitiable Lon Chaney creation built to stalk the German Expressionist shadows of an opium den—and culminates with his slickest—a lovestruck hoodlum slinking around a jaw-dropping oner on the cusp of a new millennium.

Between are a washed-out, Dark City-like oddball noir obsessed with diegetic sound, which tears its way into Resurrection like color flooding Dorothy's arrival in Oz; a toothache-stricken ex-monk, left alone by looters in his old monastery, living through a frigid ghost story; and a lush con-artist drama, hinging upon lies you can smell. Each chapter leaps genres and decades, styles and aspect ratios, color palettes and paces. The narratives all give way to their tangible focus—ironic, considering this isn't shot in Smell-O-Vision and William Castle is long dead. But you swear you can still smell the sweat lingering on poolside skin, taste the never-dwindling cigarette between a spirit's lips, or feel the heat between two lovers. Divided yet compounding as the totality of Resurrection unfolds, our sharpened senses catch onto the details of Bi's work, our awareness heightened around how many ways we can engage with the film in front of us, and movies in general.

It's an ambitious undertaking, and one so single-mindedly obsessed with its medium that, like those “love letters,” it's inherently in danger of industry schmaltz or arthouse inscrutability. And Bi is still high on the possibilities of film; he asks Yee to effectively play the living body of cinema, the essential dreamer, the audience member. Casually magnificent camerawork illustrates each subdream's purpose with ornate clarity, Dong Jingsong's lighting and focus shifting instantly like a nightmare taking a turn off a cliff—yet seeming totally normal at the time. Minimal handholding sets this up, and the fable framework only adds another layer to chew on. And yet, Resurrection also tells one of the year's best fart jokes. Bi finds plenty to laugh at, mourn, and admire in his card sharps, disgraced holy men, grotesques, and gangland losers. These characters yearn, burning like nitrate (sometimes literally). That it all serves a headier purpose is just another thrill, another sense titillated by the picture show.

It all comes to a head with that dockside delinquent meet-cute, New Year's Eve, 1999. Drenched in rain and the red light of its shady city district, Apollo (Yee) and Tai Zhaomei (Li Gengxi) traipse through their own hyper-ambitious version of Before Sunrise, naturally adding in some karaoke and bloodshed for good measure. As this showboating take unfurls, incorporating time-lapse footage before jolting back into normal speed, we get our biggest secondhand buzz from Bi. Resurrection separates out the ways we can love the movies, dividing its audience out into cinematic canopic jars, then reassembles us into a glorious whole for a finale that revels in our totality. And yet, there's nothing cloying about this. The work, the tearing down and building back up, is about appreciation. It's not easy, and, in a world of Deliriants, it's too rare. Bi knows that, but he's also got faith that there are still a few dreamers out there willing to do things the hard way.

“Dancing with the Stars” Season 33 alum Jenn Tran, who competed alongside professional dancer Sasha Farber, shared a glimpse into what she has been up to these days, and she looks incredible! 

Tran posted several photos on Instagram showing her at events, eating tasty food, attending conferences, and getting glammed up by a makeup team. The first photo is the most eye-catching though and it shows Tran wearing a stunning black sheer dress. She also posted several other pictures of this dress, so fans can see it from all angles. It fits her perfectly, and although it is a daring choice, it looks so good!

In the caption, she wrote, “Not pictured: me studying for finals all week and in class for 8 hours a day.” 

The comment section has come alive and fans have been eager to share their thoughts. “YOU LOOK AMAZINGGGG,” a comment reads. “Jenn tran has never owned a bad dress in her life,” another person shared. Other reactions include, “Love your dress that you wore at the Nylon party!!!,” “You're an INSPO,” and “STUNNING.”

Tran is celebrated for her sense of style and her wardrobe is impressive! She is not only fashionable but daring, and at times, she has opted for dresses and tops that look like they could easily slip down, like many of the dresses she wore on “The Bachelor” season starring Joey Graziadei, and later her own “The Bachelorette” season. Interestingly, Tran and Graziadei were on DWTS at the same time, and while she placed seventh, he went on to win the Mirrorball Trophy in Season 33.

She discussed her outfits in an interview with Parade in August 2024, and revealed how she avoided wardrobe malfunctions by using “so many different boobage [aids]” and noting that for each dress, “you accommodate accordingly.” 

When starring on “The Bachelorette,” Tran had wowed with her gorgeous dresses, and she is definitely a fan of dressing up. “I wear scrubs to work but I'm someone who loves to dress up;” she told Parade. “My closet is full of dresses that I probably have never worn. I think they look really pretty and then I don't have an event to wear them to. So I am like a dress collector.”

She continued, “It's really nice because my friends come over and they always have a dress for whatever occasion that they need. They don't have to go shopping. They shop in my closet.”

Dear Santa, All I want for Christmas is the hot babysitter from “Halloween Ends” to date the hot roommate from “Happy Death Day.” Then, please make him dismember a room full of Nazis. Thanks!

With Cineverse's new “Silent Night, Deadly Night” remake, writer/director Mike P. Nelson delivers some of the best catharsis money can buy at the tail-end of this truly terrifying year. The filmmaker further cements himself as an underrated satirist for indie horror, following up his divisive “Wrong Turn” reboot from 2021 with another politically savvy entry. The result is still imperfect, but smarter, too. Starring Rohan Campbell and Ruby Modine, its main characters are easier to root for than the “Wrong Turn” hikers, and the story is generally better executed as a standalone film. It's also timely amid national news in the United States and deserves the free buzz it'll get for braving some of its edgier themes.

Of course, controversy is baked into the “Silent Night, Deadly Night” brand. Back when the original came out in 1984, the psychology-driven slasher from first-time feature director Charles Sellier started a public uproar so significant it caused physical protests outside theaters. Tri-Star Pictures took heat for casting Santa Claus as a spree killer suffering from PTSD, and across the country, parents complained that the movie's widespread marketing campaign was giving kids nightmares. Critic Gene Siskel went so far as to label the film's box office “blood money,” although ticket sales didn't amount to much. The release caused a strong enough backlash that the studio pulled it from theaters after just six days. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






This Christmas, Nelson's surprising and fresh remake baits controversy in a couple new ways. The core concept is no doubt still maddening to plenty of Christians who would like Santa left alone. But there's also a wild Nazi massacre, and a script that plays it so fast and loose with mental health jargon the two leads sometimes sound like they're speaking for a drunk therapist. Even more daring, the latest “Silent Night, Deadly Night” attempts a drastic tonal shift that won't work for some series purists. 

If you want a flat modernization of the original story, you've got the 2012 remake for that. But if you want an ambitious and cutting reassessment of the franchise as a whole, Nelson has the goods. With a unique supernatural spin, the darkly romantic update on a schlocky cult classic — it's the second hard-reboot and seventh installment — might even feel like betrayal of the source material to those who don't appreciate its creativity. But this strange IP's own chaotic history supports Nelson's all-in enthusiasm for conveying [checks notes] the confused inner life of a dangerous drifter with hallucinatory PTSD.

Its cinematic representation is a kind of “Venom” or “Dexter”-esque vehicle for vigilantism that matches the oddball reputation of the four sequels. Schlepping from town to town to support his gruesome secret tradition, Billy flashes forward from a terrifying memory from the car-jacking that killed his parents when was 8 years old. The attacker was dressed like Santa Claus, and — even wearing a bloody white plastic beard of his own now — Billy can't shake a vicious internal monologue he refers to as “Charlie.”

 










Voiced by Mark Acheson, and filtered through demonic and deep bass, the commanding offscreen presence is something only Billy can hear. But figuring out who — or what — it means to the anti-hero kick-starts both the core comedy and mystery. By also doubling down on his film's bold visuals, including some hilariously blunt title cards (think “KILL NAZIS” illustrated in bright red for some reason), the new movie evokes the same resilient spirit that eventually brought the censored original back to theaters in May 1985. Nelson harnesses that take-it-or-leave-it energy and sticks to his guns with a dramatic dynamic and a visual scheme that's unlike anything these movies have attempted before.

That might seem even more heavy-handed in an original story but applied to the complete “Silent Night, Deadly Night” collection, it's both fitting an endearing. The canon can already be described as a bewildering artistic menagerie, including a perplexing assessment of misandrism, body horror by Brian Yuzna, killer toys from the '90s, and more. Referential flecks from those films emerge throughout Billy's arrival in the small town setting for the remake, The people of Hackett are perfectly nice, but we soon learn anything can seem “naughty” to a hyper-violent Santa with a murder-trophy advent calendar.

 










Billy meets love interest Pam (Modine) working at Ida's Trinkett Tree, a local store and clever twist on Ira's Toy Store — where the first Billy was employed in the 1984 movie. It's not long before a customer flirts with the hot-tempered Pam and sets Billy off on his psychosis-lined trail of holly-jolly homicide. Hammer. Ax. Archery set. Deer antlers. Kill scenes ripped from the overtly pervy inaugural outing come back to life. This time, there's no nudity, but Nelson's festive and fucked-up fantasies aren't defanged. With Campbell and Modine selling a genuinely enjoyable connection and grounded-enough fear, this sick celebration gets real stakes and even the breeziest jokes take on a stronger satirical bite. 

Even as Billy and Charlie's sometimes awkward back-and-forth drags down the film's pace and the tension falls slack, Nelson pushes his twinkly world of terror to turn on a dime. That steady stream of plot developments leads to an overly long ending that takes the mechanics of the universe in an interesting direction — but causes the action to overstay its welcome by at least 20 minutes. Still, the latest “Silent Night, Deadly Night” is an audacious 2025 season capper for Cineverse and a solid achievement for Nelson, one that promises the director will give us more genre worth unwrapping down the line. 

 










From Cineverse, “Silent Night, Deadly Night” will be released in theaters on Friday, December 12.

Kate Winslet's “Goodbye June” — a terminally cozy Netflix Original that she directed from a script written by her 21-year-old son Joe Anders as part of his coursework at Britain's National Film and Television School — isn't the least bit shy about the extreme privilege that went into its production, and all things being equal, that's probably for the best. Saccharine and schematic as the movie turned out to be in the end, it might have felt more dishonest if she hadn't crammed her filmmaking debut full of her famous actor friends, or cashed in her kid's accrued nepotism (his dad is Sam Mendes!) on a doughy piece of yuletide sop about the unexpected forces that can pull a family closer together.

More to the point, whatever sweet and errant truths are buried within this glossy tale of a cancer-ridden Christmas can be found in — and stem from — its recognition of the privilege at its core. Not the privilege that “Goodbye June” is built upon, but rather the privilege that it reveals as the film's strained family drama thaws into the stuff of an even broader holiday weepie. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






It's the privilege of being able to receive death as a gift in disguise. The privilege of being able to say goodbye to someone who's capable of saying it back to you. The privilege of being able to experience loss for the best of what it can leave us in return: Togetherness, grace, and the warmth of our fondest memories. I didn't believe a lot about this movie, but I can't help but appreciate that it doesn't take its most valuable asset for granted. 

There are only 16 shopping days until Christmas, but poor June (Helen Mirren) probably isn't going to make it for the festivities this year. She's been sick with cancer for long enough that her scattered family has come to think of it as the status quo, but the whole brood is forced to constrict back to Cheltenham after June's son Connor (a moppy, hyper-sensitive Johnny Flynn) finds her lying on the floor one morning. Connor refuses to admit even to himself is that his mom is about to be admitted to the local hospital for the last time, but — the stunted manchild of a movie family whose every member was assigned a different archetype at birth — he makes it his business to rally the troops, who will all have to make hasty adjustments to their holiday plans.

First up is Julia (played by Winslet herself), a put-together human pantsuit whose professional veneer and upwardly mobile ambition mask her struggle to be warm and present for her three kids, one of whom has special needs. She's a natural foil for prickly middle child Molly (Andrea Riseborough), whose entire character — best as I could tell — is that she married tall (Stephen Merchant) and is very serious about only eating organic. That might still be enough, however, to give her the edge over June's oldest daughter Helen (Toni Collette), a flighty new age breathing instructor who lives abroad and was recently impregnated by a random Greek stranger who knocks people up for fun and money. 

 










All summoned home with their clashing baggage in tow, these people are absolute models of complexity when compared to their doddering father Bernie, whose denial over June's condition is so complete that he barely seems to know where he is half the time. Like most of the roles in this movie, Bernie would be an insufferable caricature if not for the skill and humanity of the actor playing him; contrived as it is to see him disassociate for comic effect (“Simon Cowell?” he responds to a doctor named Simon Khal) and mutter on about his “jerkin” before coming to terms with the imminent reality of June's death (a sudden awakening worthy of Oliver Sacks), a giant like Timothy Spall can't help but invest a rich history of love and loss into Bernie's pre-grief process.

Nevertheless, the inescapable greatness of Winslet's cast has the perverse effect of emphasizing her film's mediocrity, as “Goodbye June” quickly sags into the gap between the work these actors are capable of and the work they've been enlisted to do here. Flynn's role is mostly played by his pajamas, Collette seldom gets the chance to shine any brighter than her character's healing crystals, and the friction between Winslet and Riseborough — while much rawer than the rest of the movie — sands down its recognizable sibling resentments without giving us the chance to fully appreciate how rough they were at the start. 

 










Mirren, at least, is heartrendingly believable as a sick woman on her way to repose, despite the fact that her hospital room is blasted with enough beatific white light to make it look like she's halfway to heaven already. That's par for the course in a facility where all of the nurses are angels (Fisayo Akinade's diabolically endearing Nurse Angel in particular), and nobody else seems to be sick. The unforgiving close-ups that Winslet trains on Mirren's face push for the naked honesty that Anders' script would rather wrap in tinsel, and the movie around her is never more effective than when it weaponizes its comfiness to explore the various ways that people allow themselves to feel pain. And, by extension, the way that feeling pain allows them to be present. 

If the emotions in “Goodbye June” are as transparently manufactured as the fake snow that falls outside of the hospital windows, they're all bundled up in a warm blanket of truth — the truth of how loss has a gravity that can bring a family closer together if they let it. Equal parts noxious and comforting in the tradition of wounded holiday movies like “This Is Where I Leave You” and “The Family Stone,” Winslet's directorial debut may grovel for your sympathies, but at least it knows that bitterness, loss, and regret are what really makes the Christmas season so magical, and that we should all be so lucky to share them with each other in person. 

 










Netflix will release “Goodbye June” in limited theaters on Friday, December 12. It will be available to stream on Netflix starting Christmas Eve.

Dark. Gritty. Broody. Superheroes have been through it in recent years, and plenty of blockbuster films have made it a habit to reflect that same emotional ethos. And while the returns have been mixed, from the dramatic highs of Christopher Nolan's “Dark Knight” franchise to the decidedly downbeat lows of Zack Snyder's own Batman stories, it seems that audiences are eager to get a little more lightness in their comic book tales.

But! Could someone perhaps tap into both the darkness of being an all-powerful being in a wacky world and the relative fun of, well, that exact same thing? Consider Craig Gillespie‘s “Supergirl,” which is attempting to bridge both of those elements. Yes, being a superhero can be strange, but surely it's also fun? Milly Alcock stars in the titular role, as Kara Zor-El (aka Supergirl), who fans first got a glimpse of at the end of James Gunn's “Superman” earlier this year, where her existence as an unreliable party girl was teased in the film‘s post-credits.

While her cousin Clark (aka Kal-El) loves to see the good in people, Kara is more prone to seeing the truth. No wonder their approach to the world is so very different, with Clark's Superman leaning hard into saving the world, while Kara seems intent on tuning it out. 

 










At a weekend event held in New York City, Gunn, Gillespie, and Alcock debuted the film's first trailer to an eager crowd, a first-look that provided both a bigger sense of Kara's world (yes, she's still partying pretty hard, but that looks less fun than it sounds, the whole thing screams “coping mechanism!”) and a better look at Alcock's flinty, funny performance as the reluctant superhero. This one, Gunn told the crowd is “different,” a standalone story about a truly messy female superhero that will stand on its own merits. The Blondie jams? Those are good, too.

Gillespie directs the film from a screenplay by Ana Nogueira. Alcock stars alongside Matthias Schoenaerts, Eve Ridley, David Krumholtz, Emily Beecham, and Jason Momoa.

Warner Bros. will release the film in theaters and IMAX across North America on June 26, 2026. Check out the film's first teaser trailer below.

	All the way back in 2023, when Joe Biden was president and brat girl summer was but a lime-green twinkle in our eye, I became the first person I knew to get laid off because of AI. As an Aquarius rising, I have long been burdened with being ahead of my time.


	I worked at a small animation startup, backed by the usual VC suspects, where we partnered with celebrities and influencers to create animated characters that lived online. There was a sassy baby doll, a dog who could cook, a Monster High-inspired tween.


	Because you can do almost anything for money in America, my job was to run and grow the social accounts of these characters. Once we got enough followers, we'd go out to toy companies and publishing houses and say, “Look at this popular thing we made. Do you want to turn it into a stuffed animal or a children's book?” Sometimes they said yes. Turns out there's a ton of cash in kids stuff.


	I thought it was a decent model that was showing early signs of success, but in the background, the AI winds were gathering. Not long after we invited an AI notetaker to our meetings, the storm made impact — they fired half of the staff in one day. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“We're pivoting,” they told us. “We're becoming an AI studio.”


	That was two years ago. I still don't have a full-time job.


	This is not for lack of trying, which anyone who's even glanced at the job numbers can tell you. Almost a million people laid off this year. Hiring at its slowest rate since 2009. The long-term unemployment rate — the portion of the unemployed who have been searching for more than 27 weeks — has hit 26 percent.

	











	I know some people keep a spreadsheet of all the jobs they've applied to, but I lost count somewhere after 70. Besides, the only jobs that matter are the ones you hear back from, and I can count those on one hand.


	There was the creative agency that strung me along for seven interviews and a presentation (assigned on Christmas Eve), only to end three months after our first conversation. There was the national magazine looking for an overnight news editor who could immediately tell I'd forgotten everything I'd learned in a newsroom since last working in one more than a decade ago.

	And a couple of weeks ago, there was the AI woman.


	She was calling about some amorphous content strategist job I found on LinkedIn during one of my EasyApply sessions, where you upload a resume, go down the list, and click “apply.” It's not totally brainless — sometimes they still ask you a few questions, like if you're a veteran or if you need a work visa. And other times they ask you trick questions to make sure you read the job description. I always close out of those in an incandescent rage. Call me old fashioned, but I'm not answering any fucking riddles until after the first paycheck.


	When the AI woman called, I knew she was a robot as soon as I picked up. She was stilted and faraway. I figured it was a prescreening. The job was through a consulting company that places candidates at evil tech corporations. I'm sure they get lots of applicants.


	She asked my name and gave me some vague information about the role. And then she kept talking, launching into a series of questions. Suddenly I was in an interview.


	I asked her to pause when I realized what was happening. I wasn't ready. I hadn't brushed my teeth yet. What was this role again? Why don't I keep a spreadsheet?

	Fishing through my inbox for the application, I reminded myself she's just a robot. I talk to a robot, Alexa, every day, when she sets a timer for my eggs. I'm very mean to her, and I hate when she tries to be cute. I can't wait to fistfight her when she gains consciousness.


	The interview took 30 minutes. We got into the meat of my previous roles and my philosophies on building audiences. She had no feedback, of course. You realize how much work a soft “yeah” does during a conversation when you don't hear a single one.


	Ultimately, I thought I did fine and immediately told all my friends about the latest cruel hurdle on my quest to find a job. I told TikTok, too, asking them if it was a scam. No, one commenter confirmed. Their job was programming one of these robots.

	











	“The screening questions are designed to score you as a candidate … based on the requirements in the job description,” they wrote. “If you pass a certain threshold, you're passed to a recruiter.”


	The next day, the robot called back. I figured I must have done well. But instead, she asked my name again. And then told me about the role. Then she began the interview.


	I stopped her, explaining we just did this a day ago. Her answer was … robotic. “There seems to be a mistake. I'll let the team know. Goodbye.”


	The day after, roiling in the cosmic joke of it all, I called the consulting company in the hopes of speaking to a person. Their LinkedIn said something about being a business with a human touch. Obviously, no one picked up.


	“I think your computer got confused,” I pleaded into the void of their voicemail box. “I wanted to make sure you got the answers you needed.” I still haven't heard back.


	“It's so creepy,” one of my friends said.


	“I know,” I told her. “But at least I got a call.”


	TWO YEARS IS A LONG TIME to do anything, much less endure a quiet unemployment. The idle mind wanders into all sorts of dark hallways.


	There's brighter hallways, too. The ones that make you wonder if it's time to try something new.


	I've tried a lot of things, and thought about trying a lot of things. I've researched phlebotomy certification, HVAC school, how much electricians make in Chicago. I started a short-form YouTube horror channel and Googled “how to sell feet pix.”


	I've dabbled in watercolor and made jewelry. I've consulted an Etsy witch and become quasi-dependent on a YouTube psychic named Linda G. 


	I've volunteered for the elderly and delivered groceries to their apartments, chatting at their thresholds about Jesus and the electric bills. I've gotten really into house music, dusting off the mixer I got for my boyfriend three birthdays ago. I did a sick transition of the Verve into Azealia Banks.


	I've gone online — all day, everyday — doing irreparable damage to my dopamine reserves. I've opened my email thousands of times an hour. I've mainlined Reddit, Instagram, and Twitter in an endless loop, because I like my news fast, furious, and filled with misinformation.


	Recently, I did get a part-time seasonal position at a makeup store. For 10 hours a week, I do the cash register and offer store credit cards to people who shouldn't get store credit cards. If we sign up enough credit cards by the end of the month, we get to wear jeans for a day. If I sign up more than the other employees, I get a 30-minute lunch break. 

	











	I've resorted to TikTok. Not only watching them, but making them. I get a lot of rage out by yelling about the administration. I've acquired 27,000 followers doing this and consider becoming an influencer on a weekly basis. “I should really go for it,” I tell myself. “Sell vitamins that don't work and make a content calendar.”


	I tried that for a little while but gave up.


	Above all, that's the thing I've tried the most during these two years: giving up. It's sort of a new thing for me, but I've had a lot of practice now.


	I've given up over and over and over. On my youth, on the 2010s, on being a size four again. On the media industry and the career that once lit me up. We unstarred MTV, my former employer, from our favorite channels on the TV guide, and it felt personal.


	I was a writer and editor there, and I couldn't believe I got paid for it. I went on to keep getting paid for it at other places, too. When I got recruited into tech, it was because the CEO, a college kid at the time, really liked my writing.


	Writing has been a part of every job I've ever had, but no one seems to want it anymore. One of the darker hallways suggests maybe no one ever did. Maybe it was always luck.


	On top of all that, now the robots are here. And they're not even cool. We're not meeting them in the chrome-colored utopia we dreamed of. They're not cute, helpful sidekicks bleep-blooping toward us down the hallway, fixing our tie on our way out the door. Instead, they're harbingers of a soulless dystopia architected by the jaundiced men who bought the presidency. They're death doulas for the middle class.

	Sure, they're helping us crank out cover letters that go unanswered and diagnosing our ailments without a doctor's bill, but they're also warping our already tenuous grip on reality. In some cases, fatally. With each additional billion investors pump into their promise, where does it leave the rest of us? What do we get for writing the words and taking the pictures that built their libraries, the foundation of their fortunes? So far, our only payment seems to be more videos of fake bunnies jumping on fake trampolines. More trash to add to our heaping pile of digital slop. 


	And so it's becoming harder and harder to tell what that smell is — the end of your career, the country, the way things were, or all three. All you know is something's rotting.

Right now in New York, two exhibitions reveal artists' fascination with the unexplained.

Modern science and technology have done little to tamp down the public's long-held fascination with UFOs, unexplained phenomena, and the possibility of life beyond Earth. If anything, this millennia-old obsession has only accelerated in recent years, as the Pentagon has declassified files on strange objects seen from Navy cockpits and Silicon Valley giants have spent billions of dollars chasing their own interplanetary ambitions.

The mysteries of the galaxy still vastly outweigh the knowns, and two shows in New York this winter tap into this perennial puzzle. “Voice of Space: UFOs and Paranormal Phenomena” at the Drawing Center (on view through February 1, 2026) gathers some three dozen works by artists ranging from René Magritte to Isa Genzken. “Paintings Made for Aliens Above” at P.P.O.W (on view through December 20, 2025), a solo exhibition of new paintings by Romanian artist Hortensia Mi Kafchin, probes the promises and failures of technofuturism.

Together, these exhibitions show how the allure of unidentified phenomena and the technology that might propel them are bound up with our own shifting belief systems—as well as how the cosmic can open a space to explore queerness, speculative worlds, and flashes of utopia glimpsed through dystopia.

Unidentified objects in the sky have riveted artists since antiquity, with irregular planetary movements, meteor showers, and comets often treated as divine omens. On April 14, 1561, for example, people in Nuremberg famously reported seeing an aerial clash of mysterious globes, rods, and crosses. A blood-red aurora over Britain on March 6, 1716, was read as a celestial war between supernatural soldiers. Newtonian physics has since explained some of these phenomena—for instance, Halley's Comet is now a known quantity with a predictable return date rather than a bizarre nocturnal anomaly heralding the fall of empires—but the skies have remained charged with artistic inspiration nonetheless.

One classic example is René Magritte's Voice of Space (1931), on loan from the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice. Last exhibited in New York in 1965, the painting is the conceptual lodestar of the Drawing Center's show of the same name. Described by the curator Olivia Shao as “the Mona Lisa of UFO paintings,” the canvas features three oversized silver orbs floating over a bucolic landscape, their smooth metallic forms eerily foretelling the countless visualizations of alien spacecraft that followed.

Although Magritte never described the work as being about aliens—he said the forms were inspired by the crotal bells common on horse-drawn vehicles of the period—other artists in the show embrace far more direct encounters with cosmic visitors. One such example is the 20th-century artist Paulina Peavy, whose multimedia works combine enigmatic figures and abstraction in the style of Italian futurism. Peavy's works are often dually credited to her and Lacamo, a personal UFO that Peavy claimed to have met after attending a séance in 1932. Peavy, who died in 1998, even made bejeweled “trance masks” to better channel her extraterrestrial collaborator, while her multidimensional cosmology became a way to imagine a post-gender utopia far from the conservative reality of mid-century America.

More contemporary works eschew the channeling of possibilities for the visualization of present-day thinking. Also on view at the Drawing Center are two collages by Char Jeré, whose works interrogate the presumed worldview behind technology and consumerism. In an email, Jeré describes a potential unidentified encounter at a reservoir in upstate New York in 2001 as a partial inspiration.

The resulting collages feature everyday objects ranging from sandpaper and balloons to emergency medication and more. Jeré (who uses they/them pronouns) describes the works as “maps and incantations” ultimately intended to decolonize the present. “The works Gil Scott Heron points out in his anthem ‘Whitey on the Moon,' we suffer in order for technological spectacle and scientific triumph to exist,” they say. “These collages resist the ‘wait your turn' detritus that so often gets thrown at Black people, queer people, [and] people who have been marginalized.”

Elsewhere in the Drawing Center's show, UFOs stand in for faith and expanded consciousness rather than literal flying saucers. “It's also about transhistorical human experience, belief systems, cybernetics, and AI,” Shao says of the exhibition. “It's an attempt to map where we are in the world.”

This convergence crystallizes in three pieces by Adam Putnam from his ongoing Visualization series (2021–), which now spans more than 650 small works on paper drawn from dreams and meditation. Describing the project as “an ever-expanding deck of tarot cards,” he considers its construction and expansion a way of “cultivating a connection to the unconscious or the super conscious mind.”

The backstory behind the addition of his works to the show reveals an almost supernatural intervention. “I let Olivia shuffle through a stack and pick whatever spoke to her,” he recalled. “One of the Visualizations [#59, 2021–22] she chose was quite remarkable because it came from a dream I had about UFOs… There is no indication of this outwardly, as it is a fairly abstract work, but something in it must have resonated with [her].”

This conception of the unconscious as an outer-dimensional force slots into a longer lineage. Putnam's visualizations sit alongside drawings by Sigmar Polke, who in the late 1960s spoke of receiving “commands” from “higher beings.” Included in the show is his 1968 ballpoint drawing of a wavelength, Command of 28.8.68, with its title marking the date of “transmission.” For Polke, those higher beings could be seen as psychedelic, divine, or even extraterrestrial—an elastic category that let him tap into the era's UFO fever to skewer West Germany's consumer culture. His wavering signal supposedly arriving from the cosmos is, in the end, actually a conduit through which he could address terrestrial desires.

Four blocks south of the Drawing Center, a series of paintings by Kafchin at P.P.O.W. similarly examines how preoccupations with aliens sometimes represent distinctly earthly tensions. “The title ‘Paintings Made for Aliens Above' itself is a political and social commentary about the hierarchy of our world and cultural context,” she says.

Kafchin's paintings raid multiple eras of art history, with her reference points ranging from Salvator Rosa and Francisco Goya to Leonora Carrington and Max Ernst. The works feature a rotating cast of characters that includes, in her words, “Aliens (representing the unknown, the Celestial Strangers), A.I. learning from our madness… and the long impossible distances between the stars that separate different civilizations.”

This eclectic ensemble is informed by her personal history. “Born in 1986, I opened my eyes at a time when technology was synonymous with the future,” she recalls, noting that her father told her stories from Jules Verne, Issac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and other sci-fi giants.

Kafchin's works register the gap between that techno-utopian promise and the entangled realities of the present, to which her trans identity remains central. “We are people who think outside the box; it's in our nature to vibe with magic, fantasy, tech, divination, and so on,” she says. “I need to be validated by a bigger power than anything we have on Earth, like, for example, the Intergalactic Federation or some more advanced neighbors.”

The paintings intentionally blur conspiracy and fact, aspiration, and invention. Kafchin cites “hyperstition,” the philosopher Nick Land's theory that a fiction shared widely enough can bring a new reality into being.  “There is a borderline between hyperstition and conspiracy, like an unknown force that is training or harvesting our perception of reality or collective consciousness,” she notes. “It's funny how UFOs and the image of aliens are in concordance with our times.”

In this register, UFOs become less about contact and more about cosmology—a way to reframe what it means to be human at all. As Jeré puts it, “If war, AI, and money can change the world, then art should also take on that same responsibility, or at least the challenge of refusing the world as it is.”

Mary Carole McDonnell spent years creating true-crime television series investigating plots of murder, corruption and espionage as the head of a California production agency.

On Tuesday, the 73-year-old became entangled a criminal drama of her own after she was added to the FBI's most wanted list for allegedly posing as an heiress to defraud millions of dollars from big banks, cast members and even her own family.

Federal investigators believe Ms McDonnell fled to the UK after coming under scrutiny in 2017 for not paying wages, before fleeing to Dubai, where she is believed to remain at large.

Bobby Chacon, a former FBI agent who worked with the producer, said that her years of producing true-crime television may have trained her for life on the run.

“Maybe she learned how not to get caught by watching so many people get caught on her programmes,” he said.

Her once seemingly-successful production company, Bellum Entertainment Group, was behind dozens of true-crime shows, including It Takes a Killer and I Married a Murderer.

Known for her gaudy jewellery, Ms McDonnell would host extravagant parties for staff at her house north east of Los Angeles, equipped with a ballroom and resort-style swimming pool, a former associate said.

Rumours about her wealth are said to have circulated among crew members, particularly that she came from a “big-money family”.

“She gave the appearance that she was a very independently wealthy woman,” Joshua Koffmann, one of her former employees, told KTLA 5, adding that she “was always impeccably dressed”.

“She seemed to be very good at thriving in chaos,” Mr Chacon also recalled.

“A good producer working on a low budget is going to do that,” he said. “But if you're a good con man, you also have to do that as the walls are closing in on you.”

Suspicions about Ms McDonnell were first raised in 2017, after Deadline reported that the California Labour Commission was looking into Bellum for failing to pay wages to dozens of former workers.

Mr Chacon said he was making “very good money” for a year, but then pay cheques began to take weeks to arrive, forcing members of the crew to breaking point.

He eventually parted ways with the company in mid-2017 and says he is still owed $36,000 (£26,000).

Around the same time, Ms McDonnell secured a $14.7m (£11m) loan from California-based banks by claiming to be a member of the McDonnell aviation dynasty with an $80m (£60m) secret trust fund she would be able to access.

“Beginning in approximately July 2017 and continuing to May of 2018, McDonnell is alleged to have knowingly, and with intent to defraud, devised and participated in a scheme to obtain money, funds, assets, and property owned by Banc of California,” the FBI said.

The Michigan-native used similar tactics to steal an estimated $15m (£11.2m) from other financial institutions, federal investigators said.

In December 2018, a federal arrest warrant was issued for her after a grand jury indicted her on charges of fraud and identity theft.

Even family members were exposed to her alleged crimes. Peter McDonnell, her nephew, worked at Bellum Entertainment and is reportedly owed thousands of dollars by his aunt.

“We all thought something strange was going on, and then one day, she was just gone,” Mr Chacon said.

Ms McDonnell is thought to have travelled to London first before making her way to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates before applying to extend her visa in 2019. UAE immigration authorities were approached for comment.

After she disappeared, an online community of disgruntled former employees who claimed to be owed money by Ms McDonnell began to form, sharing rumours about her whereabouts, much like the true crime investigators from her TV shows.

After 27 years in the FBI, Mr Chacon said he was not surprised by the extent of the producer's alleged crimes but said there was no reason to suspect her when they first met.

“At the foundation, it was a legitimate business,” he said. “But over time, she was building this house of cards that ultimately collapsed, and she was not going to be around when that happened.”

You can run Sim locally using Docker, with no execution limits or other restrictions.We started building Sim almost a year ago after repeatedly troubleshooting why our agents failed in production. Code-first frameworks felt hard to debug because of implicit control flow, and workflow platforms added more overhead than they removed. We wanted granular control and easy observability without piecing everything together ourselves.We launched Sim [1][2] as a drag-and-drop canvas around 6 months ago. Since then, we've added:- 138 blocks: Slack, GitHub, Linear, Notion, Supabase, SSH, TTS, SFTP, MongoDB, S3, Pinecone, ...- Tool calling with granular control: forced, auto- Agent memory: conversation memory with sliding window support (by last n messages or tokens)- Trace spans: detailed logging and observability for nested workflows and tool calling- Native RAG: upload documents, we chunk, embed with pgvector, and expose vector search to agents- Workflow deployment versioning with rollbacks- MCP support, Human-in-the-loop block- Copilot to build workflows using natural language (just shipped a new version that also acts as a superagent and can call into any of your connected services directly, not just build workflows)Under the hood, the workflow is a DAG with concurrent execution by default. Nodes run as soon as their dependencies (upstream blocks) are satisfied. Loops (for, forEach, while, do-while) and parallel fan-out/join are also first-class primitives.Agent blocks are pass-through to the provider. You pick your model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, vLLM), and and we pass through prompts, tools, and response format directly to the provider API. We normalize response shapes for block interoperability, but we're not adding layers that obscure what's happening.We're currently working on our own MCP server and the ability to deploy workflows as MCP servers. Would love to hear your thoughts and where we should take it next :)[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43823096[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44052766

Incretin-based medications — GLP‑1 receptor agonists and DPP‑4 inhibitors — were not associated with an increased risk for acute pancreatitis among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to SGLT2 inhibitors; however, their use was associated with a small increase in risk for biliary disease.

""Our finding of an increased risk of biliary disease with incretin-based therapies, which is consistent with previous evidence, highlights a need for cautionary clinical benefit–risk evaluation when prescribing GLP-1RAs [GLP-1 receptor agonists] or DPP-4is [DPP-4 inhibitors] in patients with T2D at risk of biliary disease,"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Yichen E. Fang, Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. It was published online in Diabetes Care.

Despite adjusting for more than 90 potential confounders and confounder proxies, residual confounding from unmeasured or incompletely measured factors such as BMI, diet, alcohol consumption, or socioeconomic factors remained unavoidable. Potential misclassification of outcomes may have occurred due to the use of administrative claims data. The exclusion of patients with a history of pancreatitis or biliary events limited the generalizability of the findings. 

This study received funding through a grant from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. One author received research grants from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and FDA. Some authors disclosed receiving personal fees, grants, and royalties and having other ties with various pharmaceutical companies.

Among adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D), an increase in the severity of diabetes-related complications was associated with a decrease in health-related quality of life, with the inverse association holding across most dimensions except for anxiety and depression, freedom to drink, and freedom to eat.

""This [study] highlights the impact of complications on different aspects of the lives of pwT1D [people living with T1D] and reinforces the importance of preventing complications to maintain quality of life,"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Sara Barraud, MD, CRESTIC, Service d'Endocrinologie Diabete Nutrition, URCA, CHU de Reims, Reims, France. It was published online on December 02, 2025, in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.

The findings came from a French cohort with its own demographics and health system, which may have limited generalisability. The study relied on self-reported data, which could have introduced response bias. It used the DCSI, a tool not widely used in T1D-only studies. The cross-sectional design precluded establishing a cause and effect relationship between complications and quality of life.

The study was supported by multiple sources including the Foundation Francophone pour la Recherche sur le Diabète, the Société Francophone du Diabète, and the Luxembourg Institute of Health. Some authors reported receiving grants or contracts, consulting fees, payments or honoraria for lectures and participation on speakers' bureau, and support for attending meetings and/or travel as well as declared having other ties with various pharmaceutical companies.
