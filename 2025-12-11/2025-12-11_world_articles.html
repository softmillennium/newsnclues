Confusion over diplomatic standoff deepens after conflicting reports about the soldiers' whereabouts

Eleven Nigerian military personnel are reportedly still in Burkina Faso days after their plane made an “unauthorised” landing in the south-west city of Bobo Dioulasso, despite earlier suggestions they had been freed, deepening confusion about the diplomatic standoff.

Burkinabé authorities told the BBC on Tuesday that the troops had been released and given permission to return to Nigeria, but officials in Abuja have said the matter is yet to be resolved.

The Nigerian daily the Punch quoted Kimiebi Ebienfa, a foreign ministry spokesperson, as saying late on Wednesday that that Nigerian embassy in Ouagadougou was “engaging with the host authorities to secure their release”.

The saga began on Monday when a Nigerian military cargo plane, a C-130, travelling from Lagos to Portugal was forced to land in Burkina Faso. Authorities in the country, which is part of the three-member Alliance of Sahel States (AES), called the landing an “unfriendly act carried out in defiance of international law” in a statement that evening.

The Nigerian air force said technical concerns had forced the plane to divert to the nearest airport “in line with standard safety procedures and international aviation protocols”. The Burkinabé authorities had treated the crew courteously and plans were under way to continue the mission, it said.

Conspiracy theories began circulating on social media and offline given that the landing came within 24 hours of Nigerian troops helping to thwart a coup attempt in Benin, which borders Nigeria and Burkina Faso.

The AES trio of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger officially left the larger Ecowas regional bloc in January, forming a military alliance as it withdrew from many of its traditional local and international allegiances.</p>

If you value progressive media, please make a year-end donation today. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the U.S. “executed a seizure warrant” for the tanker, which was “used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.” “For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,” Bondi said in a post on X. From a strictly legal standpoint, the U.S. has no jurisdiction to impede Venezuela from selling its oil to non-U.S. parties as long as the transaction happens outside of U.S. territory,” said Francisco Rodríguez, senior fellow for the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “What the U.S. is doing is using the law of the sea concerning stateless vessels, which allows it to approach, board, and inspect vessels without a national registration, as an entryway to justify enforcing U.S. sanctions outside of U.S. territory,” Rodríguez added, saying that a prolonged campaign like this could deepen Venezuela's economic woes. In a speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) pleaded with Congress to exercise its war powers to stop the Trump administration from further escalation with Venezuela. “Trump is bringing us to the brink of war — a regime change war — and we are running out of time to stop it,” Van Hollen said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you value progressive media, please make a year-end donation today. On Wednesday, through a legally dubious executive order, President Donald Trump launched the “Trump Card,” a means by which wealthy immigrants or their corporate backers can expedite their visa process and gain entry into the United States. “A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. Despite Trump's post, recipients of Trump Cards do not receive a “direct path to citizenship,” but rather secure “a lawful permanent resident status as an EB-1 or EB-2 visa holder.” They can theoretically begin the process of becoming a naturalized citizen after obtaining those statuses. Two types of Trump “Gold” Cards are listed on an official government website: an individual card and one for corporations to use for their employees. With an additional $1 million contribution and a fully vetted background check, recipients can expedite their visa process. The site also mentions that a Trump “Platinum” Card is coming soon. That card, which will cost $5 million for individuals, will grant the recipient residency, plus 270 days in the U.S. “without being subject to U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income.” “Once an applicant is approved, a Trump Gold Card will be available for use throughout all 50 states and territories,” the website brags, adding that it will become “evidence that the individual will substantially benefit the United States.” His initial proposal aimed at providing immigrants a faster pathway toward citizenship, not work visas, and would have cost individuals $5 million, not $1 million. For the program to produce $2 billion, at least 2,000 individuals, or 1,000 workers sponsored by corporations (or a combination of those two numbers) would be required. Some legal experts expect challenges to the Trump Card — notably, Trump's executive order may not be based on any applicable law or power the president has been granted. Other critics suggested there could be ways around the process for people with some level of wealth. “The Trump admin says anyone who pays $1 million will be deemed to have ‘exceptional business ability' and become eligible for an employment-based immigrant visa. But there's nothing stopping someone from just getting a loan or using parents' money,” wrote Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council. The Trump Cards are yet another attempt by the president to make it harder for immigrants who are poorer or seeking better opportunities to come to the U.S. Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act, for example, requires asylum seekers, for the first time ever, to pay fees for their applications, placing an additional burden on people who may be fleeing political persecution in their home countries. Trump's new visa program also appears to be based on racism and a desire to attract immigrants from countries with whiter populations. Notably, in 2018, Trump was reported as describing immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, and African nations as coming from “shithole countries” during a meeting at the White House. And I say: Why is it we only take people from shithole countries, right?” Trump told an audience at a rally he held in Pennsylvania this week. From Denmark –- do you mind sending us a few people?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned Thursday that members of the alliance could be “Russia's next target,” calling for a rapid rise in defense spending to prevent a war similar to those seen by past generations. “We need to be ready because conflicts … are no longer fought at arm's length. “Russia has brought war back to Europe, and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents and great-grandparents endured.” However, he added, if NATO “delivers on our commitments, this is a tragedy we can prevent.” Rutte cautioned that “Russia could be ready to use military force against NATO within five years.” In June, NATO members agreed to increase their defense spending targets to 5% of their gross domestic product by 2035, more than double the current 2% target and in line with the type of increase US President Donald Trump has demanded for years. He made the comments after the Trump administration on Friday released its National Security Strategy, which adopted an unprecedentedly confrontational posture toward Europe. “It's crucial we keep the transatlantic bond as it is today,” he said, pointing out that “you cannot defend the US without a safe Atlantic, and you need NATO to keep the Atlantic safe.” Trump has expressed impatience to reach a deal in recent weeks, while the Europeans have appeared more cautious, seeking both guarantees over security and further discussions on any territorial concessions. “There have to be security guarantees (for Ukraine) in place of such a quality and level that Putin knows if he tries again the reaction will be devastating,” Rutte said. “We all know there will be a delicate, difficult discussion about territory, which in the end only the Ukrainians can decide about,” he added. Meanwhile, Russia called on the United Kingdom to “admit” what a British soldier who died in Ukraine was doing there, implying without evidence that British forces were performing more than their publicly disclosed duties in the country. Britain's Ministry of Defence said Wednesday that the soldier died “following a tragic accident whilst observing Ukrainian forces test a new defensive capability, away from the front lines.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It comes as Washington exerts pressure on the authoritarian government of President Nicolás Maduro. • Tanker seized: Machado spoke a day after the US seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, ramping up a campaign that has included moving troops into the Caribbean, strikes on suspected drug boats and threats against its leader. She called US President Donald Trump's actions “decisive” in weakening Maduro's regime. Live coverage on this story is over for today. Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call with his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolás Maduro today, in which he expressed solidarity with the Venezuelan people and reaffirmed his support for Maduro's policies, according to a Kremlin readout. “I wouldn't say it went well or badly. María Corina Machado has held two news conferences in Oslo, Norway, telling journalists that it was her “duty” to receive the prize and take it back to Venezuela. “We're going to show the world that we do not only deserve this Nobel Prize, but that this generation will outlast what is going on,” she added. “I cannot give details, because these are people that could be harmed,” Machado said of those who aided her travel. “Certainly, the regime would have done everything to prevent me from coming. Asked for her reaction to the US seizure of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela yesterday, Machado said she supports global actions to cut off sources of revenue flowing to Venezuela's oppressive government. “They use those resources to repress and persecute our people,” she said. Machado added that she believes US President Donald Trump's actions have been “decisive” in weakening the regime of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. These tensions increased as Chávez tightened his grip on power amid deepening authoritarianism and strong relations with communist Cuba, a sworn enemy of the US, and have deepened under Chávez' chosen successor Nicolás Maduro. Since taking over as Venezuelan president in 2013 following Chavez' death from cancer, Maduro has overseen a further slide into dictatorship, manipulating election results and violently repressing protests as he has fought tooth and nail to stay in power, as well as deepening relationships with Washington's geopolitical rivals of China, Russia and Iran. During his first term in office, President Donald Trump used economic sanctions and support for Venezuela's political opposition to exert pressure on Maduro, who nonetheless has remained in power. His administration has also designated Venezuelan criminal groups Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles as foreign terrorist organizations in an apparent move to justify military action against the Venezuelan government. At the same time, Trump envoy Richard Grenell has maintained contact with Venezuelan officials and met with Maduro several times earlier this year, and the US president himself spoke with his Venezuelan counterpart by phone in November. Despite maintaining diplomatic contact, the US has continued to build its military presence in the Caribbean, conducting military strikes against alleged drug trafficking vessels and threatening to attack cartel infrastructure in Venezuelan territory, and Wednesday's seizure of an oil tanker carrying Venezuelan crude is the latest escalation in Trump's campaign to finally remove Maduro from power. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has developed a knack for succeeding against the odds, with few predicting his rise to the presidency nor his continued ability to remain in power. He then became a union leader before entering the National Assembly when his political mentor Hugo Chávez was elected president in 1999. Maduro rose through the ranks of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), serving as foreign minister and vice president during Chávez' time in office. He was one of a raft of potential candidates to take over the presidency as Chávez' health declined following a cancer diagnosis, but Chávez moved to tamp down internal disputes and picked him as his successor in December 2012. Since taking over the top job in 2013, Maduro has faced mockery of his eccentric public pronouncements and criticism of his electoral system, as well as a succession of protests, sanctions, arrest warrants, possible rebellions and international isolation. Nonetheless, he has been able to head off crises despite mounting international criticism of his government and the fact that millions of Venezuelans have fled the country amid deepening poverty and political repression. Excessive force, arbitrary detentions of protesters and opposition leaders, sexual violence, torture and extrajudicial executions are all part of Maduro's toolkit for managing dissent, according to UN reports. Now, however, Maduro appears to be facing his toughest moment yet, with President Donald Trump ratcheting up the pressure on his government and opposition leader María Corina Machado, who was named this year's winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, attempting to drum up international support for a change in government. Venezuela has said it “strongly denounces” the US seizure of an oil tanker off its Caribbean coast, describing the move as an “act of international piracy.” A statement from the Venezuelan government said the move, along with previous comments from US President Donald Trump, made it clear that Washington's policy toward Caracas is part of a “deliberate plan to plunder our energy resources.” Venezuela said it would appeal the seizure to “all existing international bodies.” María Corina Machado said she doesn't yet have plans to visit other European capitals or the United States, but the Venezuelan opposition leader said has received “quite a few invitations” during her time so far in Norway. “To be absolutely honest, I'm taking one day at a time,” Machado told reporters at a news conference in Oslo, where she arrived late last night. “Now that I'm here, I certainly want to spend a few hours with my colleagues, friends and my children,” she said, adding that she also has some doctors' appointments and meetings to attend after being in hiding for the last 15 months. María Corina Machado said she believes US President Donald Trump's actions have been “decisive” in weakening the regime of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. “I believe every country has the right to defend themselves, and in our case, I believe that President Trump's actions have been decisive to reach the point where we are right now, in which the regime is weaker than ever,” Machado said. She added that the costs for Maduro staying in power needed to be raised, and the costs of leaving power lowered: “That's where we're moving towards right now.” “I don't know the intentions of other foreign countries. Asked for her reaction to the Trump administration's seizure of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado reiterated that she supports global actions to cut off sources of revenue flowing to Venezuela's oppressive government. “So yes, these criminal groups have to be stopped, and cutting the sources of illegal activities is a very necessary step to take,” she said in English, without referencing the United States directly. “We know that our regime is supporting itself thanks to other authoritarian regimes. “That's why we are certainly asking the world to act.” More background: Yesterday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the seized oil tanker had been sanctioned by the US for multiple years “due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,” including Venezuela and Iran. “I cannot give details, because these are people that could be harmed,” Machado said of those who aided her travel. “Certainly, the regime would have done everything to prevent me from coming. She then took a private jet from Curaçao to Norway, which made a pit stop in the United States, according to the WSJ. CNN has not independently confirmed the details of Machado's travel. “And I know that you will also be back in Venezuela very soon, we're going to show the world that we do not only deserve this Nobel Prize, but that this generation will outlast what is going on,” she added. Machado said that she has met many Venezuelans on the streets in Oslo on Thursday, including people who told her “they are preparing their bags to come back home to build a nation that will be so proud.” María Corina Machado is holding a second news conference in Oslo, organized by the Nobel committee. It is expected that she will speak in both English and Spanish. The Trump administration's seizure of an oil tanker off Venezuela is one of the most dramatic twists yet in a military pressure campaign against leader Nicolás Maduro. While the tanker might not have been directly related to the showdown between Trump and Maduro, its interception will be seen in the context of a US naval buildup in the Caribbean, part of an apparent attempt to force Maduro out of power or to convince his subordinates to oust him. Millions of Venezuelans would welcome Maduro's departure after grim years under an authoritarian regime that has impoverished the country, imposed repression and forced millions of people to flee poverty and persecution. So, the Washington controversy over Trump's intentions in Venezuela is less about whether Maduro's exit after ignoring his loss in a democratic election would be beneficial and more about whether the US president is acting legally. Critics fear Trump is preparing to embroil America in another pronged foreign policy misadventure as he again seeks to flex unchecked executive power. The administration insists at it is justified in using legal military force against what it brands as narco-terrorists that threaten American national security. “These are basically the Coast Guard's version of special operations forces,” Leighton told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. “They take that over first basically to control the ship,” said Leighton. It was ultimately destined for Asia after being brokered through Cuban sellers, a senior US official said. On November 18, the Skipper was seen on satellite imagery docked around seven miles from the coastal Venezuelan city of Barcelona, according to a satellite image provided by Planet Labs. Analysts say oil tankers sometimes “spoof” their AIS location in an attempt to hide questionable or illegal activities. The tanker was flying a Guyana flag, despite not being registered in Guyana, the country's Maritime Administration Department said in a statement posted to Facebook. In early July, it appeared to loiter less than 15 miles off Iran's coast for several days. Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed that her country would soon be “bright, democratic and free,” in her first news conference since arriving in Norway after narrowly missing the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony. Machado, who has been in hiding for a year following the disputed election of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, also committed to returning to her country, whether or not Maduro is still in power. “Peace, ultimately, is an act of love,” she said, adding that courage to fight for freedom increases when the things you love are in danger. “I am very hopeful Venezuela will be free, and we will turn the country into a beacon of hope and opportunity, of democracy.” Asked by CNN if the Venezuelan government knows where she has been in hiding, Machado responded: “I don't think they have known where I have been, and certainly they would have done everything to stop me from coming here.” “I want to take advantage of your question to thank all those men and women that risked their lives so that I could be here today,” she said. “I think it's worthwhile being here with you, telling the world what's happening in Venezuela.” Her remarks come as the United States is escalating pressure on Maduro's regime, seizing an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela on Wednesday. Listen to what Maduro said about the Nobel Peace Prize: It's not clear exactly how she made the journey to collect the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway, which Nobel organizers previously said “involved extreme danger.” But if it's still in power, certainly, I will be with my people,” Machado told CNN's Pau Mosquera at the press conference in Oslo. “And they [the Maduro government] will not know where I am. María Corina Machado said she doesn't think the Venezuelan government knows where she has been in hiding, telling CNN's Pau Mosquera in Oslo that “certainly they would have done everything to stop me from coming here.” “I want to take advantage of your question to thank all those men and women that risked their lives so that I could be here today,” she said. “One day I will be able to tell you, because certainly I don't want to put them in risk right now.” “It was quite an experience, but I think it's worthwhile being here with you, telling the world what's happening in Venezuela,” Machado said of her journey to the Norwegian capital. The opposition leader has been in hiding after the Venezuelan government moved to crush dissent following last year's disputed election, resurfacing only once in January at a protest against President Nicolás Maduro being sworn in for another term. And when we win – because we will – this will be an extraordinary example for those countries that today do not have freedom,” she added. Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado was asked by CNN if the Venezuelan government knew about her whereabouts as she went from hiding in the country to visiting Oslo after winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Asked if she would support US military intervention in Venezuela, María Corina Machado said only that she is asking the international community to help stop the violence, repression and sources of funding that sustain the regime of President Nicolás Maduro. We have terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas operating freely in accordance with the regime. In her response, Machado did not name the United States or directly express support for the Trump administration's recent actions in Venezuela. Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel laureate María Corina Machado said on Thursday that Venezulea will soon be a “a bright, democratic and free country.” “I long for that day, and we will host all of you in a bright, democratic and free country – and it's going to be soon.,” Machado said in a press conference in Oslo, speaking alongside Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre. “You cannot have democracy without freedom,” she said. “I believe there's no other generation in the history of Venezuela that that loves more, freedom and family and….the possibility of actually being in your homeland, of moving freely in your homeland, because we have lost that.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senior Democratic lawmakers and at least one Republican have condemned Wednesday's seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker off the nation's coast, with one saying Donald Trump is “sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela”. Trump has accused Venezuela of facilitating drug trafficking, and increased the US military presence in the Caribbean to a level not seen in decades. “This shows that their whole cover story – that this is about interdicting drugs – is a big lie,” Van Hollen said. Rand Paul, a Republican senator of Kentucky, told NewsNation that “seizing someone's oil tanker is an initiation of war” and questioned whether “it's the job of the American government to go looking for monsters around the world, looking for adversaries and beginning wars”. Chris Coons, a Democratic senator, said he was also alarmed at the administration's actions, telling the station: “I have no idea why the president is seizing an oil tanker and I'm fairly gravely concerned that he's sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela.” Mark Warner, also a Democratic senator, highlighted what he characterized as inconsistent priorities, posting on social media: “So they can seize an oil tanker, but not a drug boat?” Chuck Schumer, when asked by CNN whether he opposed Trump's goal of regime change in Venezuela, refused to answer, saying Trump's erratic messaging made it impossible to know his true intentions. “Obviously, if Maduro would just flee on his own, everyone would like that,” he said, but added the lack of clarity made it impossible to endorse specific policies. When Ted Cruz, a Republican senator of Texas, was asked for his reaction on the oil tanker seizure, he deflected and said Trump was saving American lives by targeting drug smugglers. Last week he and Paul, along with fellow senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Schumer, filed a war powers resolution aimed at blocking the administration from military engagement with Venezuela without congressional approval. But US drug enforcement officials noted in a May report that fentanyl primarily enters the US through Chinese producers and Mexican criminal organizations, while cocaine mainly comes from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leaked document reveals how US can ‘Make Europe Great Again' The official NSS, released on Dec 4, warned that Europe faced “civilisational erasure” if it did not cut migration and would be “unrecognisable in 20 years or less” if present trends continued. Mr Trump has made no secret of his affection for Giorgia Meloni, Italy's conservative prime minister. He described his Italian counterpart as a “fantastic woman” who had “taken Europe by storm” when she visited Mar-a-Lago ahead of his inauguration. He further extended his praise to the Brothers of Italy leader during her Oval Office visit in April and praised her as “beautiful” during the Middle East peace summit in Egypt in October. The US president has also had a close relationship with Viktor Orban, Hungary's prime minister, having welcomed him to the White House last month. Mr Trump has endorsed Mr Orban before the Hungarian elections next year, describing him as “fantastic” and handing Hungary an exemption on sanctions for buying Russian oil and gas. This appears to build on the official document's focus on trying to “cultivate resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations”, eyeing potential allies in the “growing influence of patriotic European parties”. Mr Trump this week condemned European leaders as “weak” for failing to end the war in Ukraine, and accused them of presiding over a “decaying” continent, diminished by illegal migration and political correctness. “Seeking a peace agreement without including Europe in the talks is unrealistic, given the war is in Europe,” he said. “Guarantees are also being sought for security today and in the future. Europe must be part of this, and unfortunately, not everyone understands this, but I think there is a great opportunity for European leaders to unite and seek a solution together.” He said some comments from Mr Trump suggest “trying to break apart what I think needs to be an alliance today and in the future”. Anna Kelly, a White House spokesman, said reports of the longer NSS were “fake news”. President Trump is transparent and put his signature on one NSS that clearly instructs the US government to execute on his defined principles and priorities,” she told The Telegraph. “Any other so-called ‘versions' are leaked by people distant from the president who... have no idea what they are talking about.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office said it has classified two explosions that killed one person and injured four others in Kyiv on Dec. 11 as a terrorist attack, the office said in a statement. The blasts occurred in Kyiv's Darnytskyi district, killing a National Guard soldier. The Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office said a homemade explosive device detonated at the site but did not clarify whether it triggered both blasts. Investigators from the Security Service of Ukraine, in collaboration with prosecutors from the Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office, have launched a pretrial investigation. The Kyiv City Prosecutor's Office did not comment on whether Russian special services were involved. Ukraine has returned a group of children from Russian-occupied parts of Kherson Oblast, local Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Dec. 11. Prokudin did not specify the total number of children. Among those rescued was a 12-year-old boy and his family, who lived in constant fear due to regular searches, interrogations, and threats from Russian forces, the governor added. "Our children have endured threats, pressure, and attempts at 're-education,' but today they are safe on free Ukrainian soil," Prokudin said. "They are receiving the necessary psychological, medical, and social support." A Russian attack on Dec. 6 destroyed a commuter train depot and 27 train cars in the city of Fastiv, Kyiv Oblast, Deputy Community and Territorial Development Deputy Minister Oleksii Balesta said on Dec. 11. "It was a targeted strike on civilian infrastructure. Three modernized electric trains were also destroyed — a total of 27 train cars," Balesta said. "These were electric trains that provided service in Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy oblasts. It was the first such large-scale attack on railway infrastructure in Kyiv Oblast, according to Balesta. Trump's initial 28-point peace plan called for establishing a "neutral, demilitarized buffer zone" following the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the Donbas region, including Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Ukraine launched a mass drone attack against the Russian capital overnight on Dec. 9-10, according to Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin. Russian air defense units shot down at least 31 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) bound for Moscow, Sobyanin said. Emergency crews are working to clear debris at the crash sites. Moscow's Vnukovo, Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo, and Zhukovsky airports introduced temporary flight restrictions during the attack, according to Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsiya). Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) struck Russia's Vladimir Filanovsky field in the Caspian Sea for the first time with long-range drones, halting oil and gas production from more than 20 wells, a source in the SBU said on Dec. 11. "At least four hits were recorded on the offshore platform. As a result of the attack, oil and gas production from more than 20 wells it serves stopped," the SBU source said. At least 4 people have been killed and 21 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Dec. 11. Russia launched 151 drones and three Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 83 drones and two ballistic missiles. Sixty-nine drones and one missile made it through, striking 34 locations. In Sumy Oblast, a Russian glide bomb struck a local shop in the Velyka Pysarivka community, killing two women and injuring two others, the local military administration reported. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks killed one person and injured 10 others over the past day, the local military administration reported. Russian forces struck Kherson's Korabelnyi district at about 9 a.m. on Dec. 11, injuring a 49-year-old man. In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian forces targeted four settlements, killing a 69-year-old man in the village of Zamulivka, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. Russian strikes also injured three people in the city of Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian forces targeted the Nikopol district, injuring a 68-year-old woman and a 53-year-old man, Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko reported. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a 63-year-old man and a 71-year-old woman suffered injuries because of Russian strikes against the Polohy district, according to the local military administration. Russian forces also targeted energy infrastructure in Odesa and Poltava oblasts overnight, though local officials have not disclosed the extent of the damage. Russia has lost around 1,185,080 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Dec. 11. According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,404 tanks, 23,699 armored fighting vehicles, 69,507 vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,992 artillery systems, 1,564 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,253 air defense systems, 431 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 89,148 drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Commission and Kyiv have agreed on a 10-point action plan to tackle corruption and strengthen democratic institutions in Ukraine as part of its path to membership, EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos announced on Dec. 11. The current focus is on implementing and screening measures under the first, second, and sixth clusters, which relate to the rule of law and democracy, the internal market, and external relations, respectively, according to officials. Priorities listed in the 10-point agreement, concluded on Dec. 10, "all focus on strengthening the rule of law, fighting corruption, and building strong, accountable democratic institutions in Ukraine," Kos said at a press conference during an informal EU meeting in Lviv. The news follows Ukraine's largest corruption scandal in recent years, in which NABU charged seven people, including President Volodymyr Zelensky's former business partner Timur Mindich, with a money-laundering scheme involving the state-owned energy company Energoatom. Speaking beside Kos, Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Taras Kachka acknowledged that "Ukraine is going through painful structural reforms and the most recent situation also could eventually cast a shadow on the adherence of Ukraine to anti-corruption reforms." This is why Kyiv focuses its efforts on "reforms like amendments to the criminal procedure code or involvement of international experts in the reforms of institutions in the criminal justice," he said. "It is a disappointment for many of us that we have not been able to formally open Cluster One," Danish EU Affairs Minister Marie Bjerre said at the press conference. However, the shift of focus on technical talks means that "the enlargement process with Ukraine is not at a standstill," she said, noting that "the Cyprus Presidency will be able to continue this approach." In late September, the European Commission announced that Ukraine had completed a bilateral screening process, a major milestone toward accession. "Reforms are at the center of this process, and nobody can veto Ukraine from doing these reforms," Kos commented in Lviv. While Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has consistently obstructed aid to Ukraine and its path toward EU membership, he faces his greatest domestic political challenge yet in the upcoming parliamentary elections next spring, with Peter Magyar's opposition Tisza Party leading in most polls. Martin Fornusek is a reporter for the Kyiv Independent, specializing in international and regional politics, history, and disinformation. Based in Lviv, Martin often reports on international politics, with a focus on analyzing developments related to Ukraine and Russia. "I believe that the Ukrainian people will answer this question," he added. The European Commission and Kyiv have agreed on a 10-point action plan to tackle corruption and strengthen democratic institutions in Ukraine as part of its path to membership, EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos announced. Washington's representative said the U.S. voted against the resolution not because it opposed nuclear safety measures, but because it objected to references to the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. At least 31 drones have been shot down over the Russian capital, according to Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin. All four airports in the region have suspended operations. The National Bank of Ukraine voted to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 15.5%, amid steep uncertainty over the country's financing next year. Novgorod Governor Alexander Dronov said 19 drones were shot down over the region — located between Moscow and St. Petersburg — amid what Russia described as a major Ukrainian drone attack. The $900 billion spending package upholds many of U.S. President Donald Trump's national security policies but places limits on his ability to reduce American troops in Europe and withhold support to Ukraine. Trump did not discuss specific conditions of the peace deal but said Zelensky needs to be "realistic" and asked when Ukraine would hold presidential elections.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mary Carole McDonnell posed as heiress to steal millions before fleeing US, says FBI Mary Carole McDonnell spent years creating true-crime television series investigating plots of murder, corruption and espionage as the head of a California production agency. On Tuesday, the 73-year-old became entangled a criminal drama of her own after she was added to the FBI's most wanted list for allegedly posing as an heiress to defraud millions of dollars from big banks, cast members and even her own family. Bobby Chacon, a former FBI agent who worked with the producer, said that her years of producing true-crime television may have trained her for life on the run. Her once seemingly-successful production company, Bellum Entertainment Group, was behind dozens of true-crime shows, including It Takes a Killer and I Married a Murderer. Known for her gaudy jewellery, Ms McDonnell would host extravagant parties for staff at her house north east of Los Angeles, equipped with a ballroom and resort-style swimming pool, a former associate said. Rumours about her wealth are said to have circulated among crew members, particularly that she came from a “big-money family”. “She seemed to be very good at thriving in chaos,” Mr Chacon also recalled. Suspicions about Ms McDonnell were first raised in 2017, after Deadline reported that the California Labour Commission was looking into Bellum for failing to pay wages to dozens of former workers. Around the same time, Ms McDonnell secured a $14.7m (£11m) loan from California-based banks by claiming to be a member of the McDonnell aviation dynasty with an $80m (£60m) secret trust fund she would be able to access. The Michigan-native used similar tactics to steal an estimated $15m (£11.2m) from other financial institutions, federal investigators said. In December 2018, a federal arrest warrant was issued for her after a grand jury indicted her on charges of fraud and identity theft. Peter McDonnell, her nephew, worked at Bellum Entertainment and is reportedly owed thousands of dollars by his aunt. After she disappeared, an online community of disgruntled former employees who claimed to be owed money by Ms McDonnell began to form, sharing rumours about her whereabouts, much like the true crime investigators from her TV shows. “At the foundation, it was a legitimate business,” he said. “But over time, she was building this house of cards that ultimately collapsed, and she was not going to be around when that happened.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Canadian dollar is on a two-day winning streak, up again today and up more than half a cent US since early Wednesday. Greenback weakness is key here, as it usually is – with the Fed cutting rates and leaving the door open to further easing a key development. But today's surprise Canadian trade surplus for September – a signal the domestic economy is weathering the trade storm reasonably well – is helping too. Mr. Rosenberg also thinks Canadians – specifically those participating in the ‘elbows up' movement - can take some of the credit here for supporting their own currency. “There is this perception among the Canadian public that we have been tarred and feathered, and so while Mark Carney dropped his elbows on his reciprocal moves, domestic residents have taken matters into their own hands. When you look at this “staycation” theme holistically, as in all the multiplier effects that include retailers, restaurants, and hotels, this domestic travel thrust touches 4.5 million workers (20% of employment) and C$100 billion of GDP (a near-5% chunk — as big as the resource patch). And this is bullish for the loonie because what it means is that more dollars are being spent at home instead of being converted into greenbacks for the trips Canadians used to make to Palm Beach, Vegas, Scottsdale, and Manhattan — to such an extent that the travel account as part of the overall balance of payments, historically in a large deficit position, has now swung to a record of over C$10 billion at an annual rate,” Mr. Rosenberg told clients. The S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent and pulled further from its all-time high, which was set in October. Drops for AI-related stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite down 1.2 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was doing much better with a gain of 465 points, or 1 per cent, as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern time. Oracle tumbled 14.4 per cent and had briefly been on track for its worst day since 2001, when the dot-com bubble was still deflating. It reported 14% growth in revenue for the latest quarter, which came up just short of analysts' expectations, even though its profit topped forecasts. Doubts remain about whether all the spending that Oracle is doing on AI technology will produce the payoff of increased profits and productivity that proponents are promising. Analysts said they were surprised by how much Oracle may spend on AI investments this fiscal year, and questions continue about how the company will pay for it. Such doubts are weighing on the AI industry broadly, even as many billions of dollars continue to flow in. Those questions had helped drag the broad U.S. stock market through some sharp and scary swings last month. BofA Securities upgraded Visa Inc. (V-N) to a “buy” recommendation from “neutral” on Thursday, sending its shares higher. “Following recent underperformance, we believe Visa shares offer very attractive return potential, and we are upgrading to Buy from Neutral,” analyst Mihir Bhatia said. Canada's main stock index rose on Thursday, as gains in mining shares outweighed a tech selloff sparked by renewed fears about lofty valuations. Meanwhile, energy is really selling off,” said Robert Gill, portfolio manager at Fairbank Investment Management. “It's this time of year that portfolio managers begin to ... reposition their portfolios so that could lead to some sector rotation or the closing of underperforming positions.” Consumer discretionary stocks rose 0.6 per cent; shares of Dollarama gained 2.3 per cent after the discount store raised its annual sales forecast, betting on resilient demand for cheaper household supplies and groceries amid still high inflation. Technology stocks led the selloff, dropping 2 per cent after Oracle's quarterly results and forecast disappointed investors and revived concerns about an AI bubble. Empire shares (EMP-A-T) are getting clobbered this morning after quarterly results that disappointed. TD Cowen analyst Michael Van Aelst notes that Empire's EPS came in a penny below consensus, but suggests that actually masks weaker performance. “Retail EBITDA, excluding other income, was +1% y/y vs +4% expected — this falls short of Loblaw (+7%) and Metro (+7% excl DC freezer issues),” he detailed in a first look note this morning. “One solid number was Food same-store sales growth, which came in at +2.5% (roughly in line with our forecast and consensus), above L's +2.0% and MRU's +1.6% (or +1.9% excluding the impact from the DC freezer issue). Telus (T-T) investors just can't catch a break. The stock is sinking today to its lowest levels since 2013 after a downgrade from BMO. Even when that's factored in, the stock price is still lower. The Vancouver-based telecom said earlier this month that it is pausing dividend hikes until its share price “reflects growth prospects.” Its dividend yield had spiked above 9 per cent as the share price tanked, and it's still hovering there today. He notes Telus continues to trade at a premium valuation to its incumbent peers, adding “We believe the core telecom business is growing in line with peers and the outlook for TELUS Digital (now wholly-owned) is unclear.” Meanwhile, he notes that payout ratios remain elevated compared to peers and dividend growth has been paused. It isn't all gloom for telecom investors today though. For more details, call up today's Upgrades and Downgrades report. Morgan Stanley energy analyst Devin McDermott published his outlook for 2026 on Thursday, emphasizing weakness for crude in the first half of the year. He sees a better risk-reward scenario in U.S. natural gas. For natural gas the analyst believes supply growth, while strong enough to limit commodity price upside, is not enough to meet future demand. He expects U.S. natural gas futures to increase by 20 per cent. The excitement surrounding domestic natural gas is dependent on new LNG facilities opening in Kitimat B.C. Mr. McDermott, however, predicts a global LNG surplus next year that will depress gains. Of the Canadian companies Mr. McDermott covers, he rates only one as overweight/attractive – Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE-T). North American stock indexes opened lower on Thursday as fresh worries over Oracle's hefty AI spending plans overshadow optimism over a less hawkish tone from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Toronto's S&P/TSX composite index was down 0.26 per cent at 31,410.44 points, a day after it notched a fresh record high on Wednesday, led by financial and technology shares, as policy decisions from the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve met expectations. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 97.04 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 48,157.04, the S&P 500 lost 29.36 points, or 0.42 per cent, to 6,857.45 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 171.04 points, or 0.71 per cent, to 23,485.26. Oracle slumped almost 16 per cent in early trading after its quarterly forecast fell short of analysts' estimates and the company said annual spending would climb US$15-billion compared with its earlier expectation. “Oracle has been the poster child for volatility and that will continue. The spending itself is stand-alone issue and part of the CapEx is a bit opaque,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. Bond portfolios are doing well this morning amid a second straight day of yield declines (bond prices and yields move inversely) – the U.S. 10-year is down about 6 basis points to 4.11 per cent. Mike Dolan points out that no matter what you think is in store in 2026, it probably won't be a year of the bond. He notes we've seen a general rising of borrowing rates across the globe in recent days as investors increasingly believe that the easing cycle is nigh. We're talking global here, but this trend is on full display in Canada, too. But as it appears right now, allocating more to bonds next year comes with its own risks. The strategy team at Scotiabank, led by Hugo Ste-Marie, have provided four quantitatively-derived trades for 2026. They expect small-cap stocks to outperform large caps on both sides of the border. In Canada, smaller metal miners are already driving small-cap returns higher relative to large caps. Mr. Ste-Marie believes U.S. growth at a reasonable price (GARP) stocks will outperform more expensive, AI-exposed companies. Non-tech will be supported by an improving U.S. economy that helps cyclical stocks generate double digit profit growth. The team's belief in high-quality domestic stocks was dashed by junior miners of copper, gold and uranium. Their list of highest quality stocks begins with Dollarama (DOL-T), Metro (MRU-T), Hydro One (H-T), Loblaw Companies (L-T) and George Weston (WN-T). Oil prices eased on Thursday as investors shifted focus back to Russia-Ukraine peace talks and monitored potential fallout from a U.S. seizure of a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday that a visit to Moscow this month by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff had resolved misunderstandings between the two countries. He added that Moscow had handed over Russia's proposals on collective security guarantees to Washington. “We anticipate a supportive environment to continue into 2026 via a combination of positive secular trends that impact existing footprints as well as driving an acceleration in new regulated or long[1]term contracted growth projects. Key themes “All of the above” energy strategies should create broad-based infrastructure opportunities. In particular, we believe that companies with established infrastructure footprints and/or regulated monopolies stand to benefit the most by leveraging their asset bases to drive improved profitability as well as capture high-return growth opportunities. Doubling up is the most common response to deteriorating housing affordability but also can be seen as shadow demand ready to be utilized in an environment of improved affordability. The practical implication here is that with the current improvement in affordability due to falling prices/rent, some of this potential demand might be released due to undoubling and might establish a price floor faster than currently anticipated” Montreal-based Dollarama (DOL-T) raised its annual sales forecast on Thursday, betting on resilient demand for affordable household supplies and groceries amid still high inflation. Canadian consumers are increasingly seeking discounted alternatives for goods ranging from pantry staples to cleaning supplies as they look to save money, driving strong demand and traffic for dollar-store chains. Dollarama posted net sales of $1.91-billion for the third quarter ended November 2, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.87-billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of $1.10 per share. Suncor Energy (SU-T) on Thursday forecast higher oil and gas production in 2026 as the Canadian energy producer boosts output from its oil sands assets. The Calgary-based company expects upstream production between 840,000 and 870,000 barrels per day next year, compared with its 2025 production estimates of 810,000 to 840,000 barrels per day. CEO Rich Kruger said the company in December increased share buybacks by 10 per cent to $275-million per month, pointing toward a projected $3.3-billion of repurchases in 2026. A view of Oracle headquarters on September 11, 2023 in Redwood Shores, California.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Oracle (ORCL-N) shares slumped nearly 11 per cent in premarket trading on Thursday after downbeat forecasts and higher capex fanned worries that its massive AI investments are taking longer than expected to pay off. Executives warned that capital expenditures for fiscal 2026 are now expected to be US$15-billion higher than the US$35-billion the company estimated in September during its first-quarter earnings call. Oracle's shares have risen nearly 34 per cent this year, as mega cloud-computing deals with OpenAI and others and its plans to build large-scale AI cloud data centers helped boost sentiment. However, investors have turned cautious, closely examining major cloud companies' earnings reports for signs of an AI bubble fueled by heavy spending, high valuations, limited real-world productivity gains, and complex circular investments. National Bank Financial analysts Shane Nagle and Rabi Nizami see supply shortfalls supporting the near-term price outlook for copper heading into 2026, while they warn “some cracks” in the demand outlook persist. “We forecast a larger deficit for 2026 as supply continues to fall short of demand growth. The biggest swing factor remains Cobre-Panamá - which continues to progress towards a resolution (we model contributions by H2/27). Stocks mentioned include: Advantage Energy Ltd.; Aurora Cannabis Inc.; BCE Inc.; Canopy Growth Corp.; Capital Power Corp.; Capstone Copper Corp.; Evertz Technologies Ltd.; Foran Mining Corp.; Ivanhoe Electric Inc.; Osisko Metals Inc.; Peyto Exploration & Development Corp.; Solaris Resoures Inc.; Taseko Mines Ltd; Telus Corp.; Vermilion Energy Inc. U.S. stock index futures tumbled on Thursday after Oracle's (ORCL-N) forecasts raised fresh concerns about hefty AI spending and outweighed optimism following a less hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve. Oracle slumped 12 per cent in premarket trading after its quarterly forecasts missed analysts' estimates and the company said annual spending would rise by US$15-billion compared with its earlier expectations. Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE volatility index, climbed 0.71 points and was last at 16.47. Global markets were mixed as renewed worries over tech valuations after Oracle's weak forecast offset investor relief from the U.S. Federal Reserve's less-hawkish-than-anticipated comments after cutting interest rates. TSX futures followed sentiment lower after a fresh record close yesterday. In Canada, investors are getting results from Dollarama Inc., Empire Co. Ltd. and Lululemon Athletica Inc. On Wall Street, markets are watching earnings from Costco Wholesale Corp. and Broadcom Inc. “The initial positive tone from a Fed cut ... is being overshadowed by Oracle,” said ANZ's Head of Asia Research Khoon Goh. World shares are mixed on Thursday after the U.S. stock market again approached its record high following the Federal Reserve's cut in its main interest rate. However, some Asian technology companies saw sharp declines after Oracle (ORCL-N), a bellwether in the artificial intelligence sector, reported weaker than expected earnings. The company's spending spree in AI has some worried about its cash flow. “Frankly, the report was not dramatically bad, but it came to confirm concerns around heavy AI spending, financed by debt, with an unknown timeline for revenue generation,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya of Swissquote said in a commentary. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in Washington on Wednesday.Jacquelyn Martin/The Associated Press Stocks ended higher on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point as expected and investors bet on further easing down the road, even as the central bank signalled that it will put further cuts on pause for now. Canada's main index closed at a fresh record high, tracking the advance on Wall Street. And policy makers raised estimates for 2026 GDP growth to 2.3 per cent from 1.8 per cent and maintained expectations for a 4.4-per-cent unemployment rate at the end of next year. In his press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell declined to provide guidance on whether there will be another rate cut in the near future. However, investors garnered some hope for easing from his comments that the labour market has significant downside risks and that the central bank doesn't want its policy to push down on job creation.
