                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Affordable Care Act health insurance website healthcare.gov are seen on a computer screen in New York, Aug. 19, 2025. The Senate on Thursday rejected two partisan health bills on expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, essentially guaranteeing that millions of Americans will see a steep rise in costs when the subsidies run dry on Jan. 1. Less than an hour after the legislation failed, White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt said President Donald Trump is “prepared to take action on health care.” But she added, “We're not going to stand by and watch sanctioned vessels sail the seas with black market oil, the proceeds of which will fuel narcoterrorism of rogue and illegitimate regimes around the world.” The White House has maintained that the tanker seized was carrying oil set to be sold in violation of international sanctions. Leavitt said the president was trying to defend his tariffs when he said at a rally Tuesday that Americans should buy fewer dolls and pencils for their children. Trump was saying his tariffs are bringing back factory jobs and products made domestically might cost more, Leavitt said. The White House has previously maintained that foreign countries would pay the taxes and that there would be little to no inflation domestically. But she added that it's “still up in the air whether real peace can be achieved.” Trump took office in January suggesting he could solve Russia's war in Ukraine quickly but has spent months complaining bitterly about a lack of progress. Leavitt said the president is “extremely frustrated with both sides of this war.” Leavitt said the Justice Department had received a warrant to take the tanker because it's a sanctioned vessel used to carry “black market” oil. Also blaming Democrats for the Obama-era health care bill, which she noted was passed “without a single Republican vote,” Leavitt argued that Democrats had “ballooned” the program “with these expensive COVID subsidies that completely distorted the health insurance market.” Senators rejected a Democratic bill to extend the subsidies for three years and a Republican alternative that would have created new health savings accounts Thursday. Ahead of the votes, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans that if they did not vote to extend the tax credits, “there won't be another chance to act,” before premiums rise for many people. Republicans have argued that Affordable Care Act plans are too expensive and need to be overhauled. The FEMA Review Council was scheduled to meet Thursday afternoon. Delia Ramirez, a Democrat from Illinois, accused Noem's department of waging an “unaccountable, unlawful, unconstitutional” war against communities across the country. Ramirez disputed those characterizations and said Noem lied with “impunity.” The Senate has rejected a Republican bill to replace expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies with new health savings accounts. The Trump administration in April canceled $3.6 billion in grants under the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, created under the first Trump administration to help communities harden infrastructure to mitigate damage from climate disasters. Noem said FEMA is “deploying resources two times faster on average, than in history,” though a policy that she personally approve DHS expenditures of $100,000 or more has been widely criticized for slowing deployment of FEMA services and dollars. As she walked out, Julie Johnson, a Democrat from Texas who was slated to question the secretary next, joked: “I'm just going to take the position that she was scared of my questions.” Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, used the closing moments of the hearing to press the officials on whether National Guard troops will be deployed from other states beyond their current authority to protect federal facilities and officials, such as to conduct law enforcement activity. Federal judges have blocked or limited troop deployments in Oregon, Illinois and California as the Trump administration has attempted to use troops to assist in its mass deportation goals. Mark Ditlevson, a Trump administration official who oversees homeland defense, only said that any orders would be evaluated to make sure they are “100% legal.” Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed solidarity with Maduro and told him “direct communication channels” between the countries “remain permanently open,” a Venezuelan government statement said. Talking a day after the U.S. military seized an oil tanker off the Venezuela's coast, Putin told Maduro that “Russia will continue to support Venezuela in its struggle to assert its sovereignty, international law, and peace throughout Latin America, making its diplomatic capabilities available to strengthen cooperation in these essential areas,” the Venezuelan government said. The Kremlin said both leaders also discussed developing friendly bilateral ties and their commitment to joint projects in trade, economic, energy, financial, cultural, humanitarian, and other areas. The Senate is voting on Republican legislation that would create new health savings accounts as health care subsidies for millions of Americans are set to expire Jan. 1. Republicans say the savings accounts would replace the subsidies by giving money directly to consumers, instead of to insurance companies. Democrats say the GOP plan would lead to higher costs for consumers. Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned that premiums will skyrocket unless Congress passes an extension of the subsidies. “If Republicans don't climb aboard, there won't be another chance to act,” Schumer said ahead of the votes. Noem linked the seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast to the Trump administration's efforts to push back on “a regime that is systematically ... flooding our country with deadly drugs.” She said Trump administration officials had seized “enough lethal doses of cocaine to kill 177 million Americans.” Trump has broadly justified a regional military buildup and a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean as necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. House Democratic identified members of the audience they said had family members who had been improperly treated by the immigration system. Magaziner said the Purple Heart recipient had been deported earlier this year. Trump's zero-tolerance immigration policy split more than 5,000 children from their families at the Mexico border during his first term, when images of babies and toddlers taken from the arms of mothers sparked global condemnation. Seven years later, families are being separated but in a much different way. With illegal border crossings at their lowest levels in seven decades, a push for mass deportations is dividing families of mixed legal status inside the U.S. Federal officials and their local law enforcement partners are detaining tens of thousands of asylum-seekers and migrants. ▶ Read more about how immigrant families are being separated now. Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said Thursday that “decisive” actions by the United States, including the seizure of an oil tanker, have left the repressive government of President Nicolás Maduro at its weakest point, and she vowed to return to the country to keep fighting for democracy. Machado's statements to reporters came hours after she appeared in public for the first time in 11 months, following her arrival in Norway's capital, Oslo, where her daughter received the Nobel Peace Prize award on her behalf on Wednesday. Machado sidestepped questions on whether a U.S. military intervention is necessary to remove Maduro from power ▶ Read more about what the Nobel winner said in Oslo He asked for details on where the group is headquartered, and how many people are involved. Trump announced he had made that designation earlier this year, in a crackdown on leftists after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee zeroed in Thursday on Trump's statements that an “invasion within” or an “enemy within” justifies his guard deployments. Gen. Gregory Guillot, who leads the military's Northern Command, said “I do not have any indications of an enemy within.” An attorney for the Pentagon declined to offer a clear answer when asked if a president could lawfully order the military to shoot protesters. During a hearing Thursday on National Guard deployments in U.S. cities, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, noted that former Defense Secretary Mark Esper alleged that Trump inquired about shooting protesters during the George Floyd demonstrations. Hirono asked Charles L. Young III, principal deputy general counsel at the defense department, whether a presidential order to shoot protesters would be lawful. “We have a president who doesn't think the rule of law applies to him,” Hirono said in response. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must release Abrego Garcia from custody immediately. “Since Abrego Garcia's return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,” the judge wrote. The Salvadoran national has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge in 2019 ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose Trump's immigration crackdown. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, raised concerns that National Guard troops deployed to U.S. cities don't receive training on how to handle situations where someone is having a mental health episode, saying that many police officers frequently encounter such situations and receive extensive training on how to handle them. Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the commander of U.S. troops in North America, said that National Guard troops are trained to de-escalate tense interactions with people, but don't receive any specific training on mental health episodes. Operation Allies Welcome was created by the Biden administration to save Afghan supporters from Taliban retribution after the U.S. military pullout from Afghanistan following 20 years of American intervention and billions of dollars of aid.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who was also shot during the confrontation, has been charged with murder. Guillot said that he consults with military attorneys, raises any questions with the defense secretary and commanding military officers, and executes the order once he's confident in its lawfulness. This has become a pressing question under the Trump administration amid National Guard deployments to U.S. cities and a campaign to strike boats allegedly carrying drugs near Venezuela. The president has targeted Democratic lawmakers who released a video urging military and intelligence officers to refuse illegal orders. A protester interrupts as, from left, Joseph Kent, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Michael Glasheen, operations director of the National Security Branch of the FBI, appear before the House Committee on Homeland Security on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. Chairman Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., gaveled the panel back to order as Noem resumed her opening remarks. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, told the secretary she has diverted vast resources to carry out Trump's “extreme” immigration agenda, and failed to provide basic responses to oversight questions from Congress. “I call on you to resign,” the Mississippi congressman said. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appears before the House Committee on Homeland Security on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi said in an opening statement that FBI Director Kash Patel should also be appearing at the hearing alongside Noem, saying he “can't help but notice” Patel's absence. Patel appeared to be out of the country on official FBI business. Late Wednesday on X, Patel posted that he was in Brussels for a “great” meeting with Matt Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO. Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the commander of U.S. troops in North America, told senators that National Guard troops are instructed not to perform many law enforcement activities like making arrests or searching for evidence of a crime. “Stop terrorizing our communities,” one person shouted as the secretary entered. One protester was singing the song from Star Wars that had been used to follow law enforcement officers as the agency conducts mass immigration raids and patrols city streets. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to face fierce questioning from Democrats Thursday as the public face of the Republican administration's hard-line approach to immigration. Noem is testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,” which in years past have focused on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. Thursday's appearance is likely to focus heavily on immigration. This hearing is the highest level of scrutiny to Trump's use of the National Guard outside of a courtroom since the deployments began and comes a day after the president faced another legal setback over his muscular use of troops in larger federal operations. The hearing comes two weeks after two West Virginia National Guard members deployed to Washington were shot just blocks from the White House in what the city's mayor described as a targeted attack. Sarah Beckstrom died a day after the Nov. 26 shooting, and her funeral took place Tuesday. “Most Americans don't want this,” she said at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, adding that most of the Guard members don't want these assignments, either. “Our heroes did not sign up for this,” said Duckworth, a combat veteran who served in the Illinois National Guard. “In recent years, violent crime, rioting, drug trafficking and heinous gang activity have steadily escalated,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican. FILE - Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., leaves after a meeting with U.S. Navy Adm. Frank M. Bradley on Capitol Hill, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025, in Washington. He added that the troop deployments are “not only appropriate, but essential.” That's the lowest level for continuing claims since mid-April. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Overall layoffs have been muted despite recent high-profile job cuts. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state. It had fallen more than 23% from July to August. Many companies imported foreign goods early in 2025 to get ahead of Trump's tariffs. Even in the face of one-on-one pressure from the White House and violent threats against state lawmakers, many Indiana Republicans have been reluctant to back a new congressional map that would split the city of Indianapolis into four districts. Trump is threatening to back primary challengers for any GOP state senator who votes against the Republican remap. “If Republicans will not do what is necessary to save our Country, they will eventually lose everything to the Democrats,” Trump wrote on social media. Trump's approval ratings on immigration have declined since March, but border security remains a relatively strong issue for him. Trump's relative strength on border security is partially driven by Democrats and independents, who are less likely to approve of his immigration approach. Other polls have shown these groups tend to prioritize increasing border security more than deporting immigrants, even those who are living in the country illegally. Shaniqwa Copeland, a 30-year-old independent and home health aide in St. Augustine, Florida, said she approves of Trump's overall handling of the presidency, but believes his immigration actions have gone too far. “Now they're just picking up anybody,” Copeland told the AP.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, looks back at the media in Downing Street, London, Monday, Dec. 8, 2025. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine would give its latest peace proposals to U.S. negotiators ahead of his urgent talks Thursday with a coalition of about 30 countries supporting Kyiv's effort to end the war with Russia on acceptable terms. The White House did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday on whether that happened. Negotiations are at “a critical moment,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. Washington's goal of a swift compromise to stop the fighting that followed Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 is reducing Kyiv's room for maneuvering. Zelenskyy is walking a tightrope between defending Ukrainian interests and showing Trump he is willing to compromise, even as Moscow shows no public sign of budging from its demands. Zelenskyy's allies are backing his effort, seeking a fair settlement that will deters future Russian attacks and defend Europe. ▶ Read more about the latest negotiations to end Russia's war in Ukraine Despite a bipartisan desire to continue the credits, Republicans and Democrats have never engaged in meaningful or high-level negotiations. “It's too complicated and too difficult to get done in the limited time that we have left,” said Sen.

The sale came after Trump's administration recently announced plans to allow new drilling off Florida and California for the first time in decades. That's drawn pushback, including from Republicans worried about impacts to tourism. Under that legislation, companies will pay a 12.5% royalty on oil produced from the leases. That's the lowest royalty level for deep-water drilling since 2007. This screenshot taken from video shows Charlie Radman, a corn and soybean farmer, standing on the land his family has owned since 1899, near Randolph, Minn., Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2025. When Trump promised new tariffs while running for president, Gene Stehly worried that trade disputes would jeopardize his international sales of corn, soybeans and wheat. Trump announced Monday that his administration would distribute $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers, who have suffered from persistently low commodity prices, rising costs and declining sales after China cut off all agricultural purchases from America during the trade war. While rural areas remain conservative bastions, farmers' patience with Washington is wearing thin. Several of them described the government bailout, an echo of similar policies during Trump's first term, as a welcome stopgap but one that won't solve the agricultural industry's problems. It's not the ultimate solution we're looking for,” said Charlie Radman, a fourth-generation farmer. “What we really want to have is a little more certainty and not have to rely on these ad hoc payments.” Sweeping taxes on imports have cost the average American household nearly $1,200 since Donald Trump returned to the White House this year, according to calculations by Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee. Using Treasury Department numbers on revenue from tariffs and Goldman Sachs estimates of who ends up paying for them, the Democrats' report Thursday found that American consumers' share of the bill came to nearly $159 billion — or $1,198 per household — from February through November. In his second term, Trump has reversed decades of U.S. policy that favored free trade.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was not immediately clear what recommendations were included in the report. Late last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth requested advice from the Navy Secretary, who oversees the military branch Kelly served in for more than two decades, on how to proceed to potentially punish Kelly for participating in the video, which Hegseth has claimed amounted to serious violations of the military's code of justice. “I am referring this, and any other related matters, for your review, consideration and disposition as you see fit,” Hegseth wrote in a memo to the Navy secretary, dated November 25. In the video that triggered the Trump administration's calls for consequences, six Democratic lawmakers said that “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home,” and repeatedly urged the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.” The Trump administration has argued that by emphasizing service members' legal duty to disobey unlawful orders, Kelly and the other Democratic lawmakers were inciting troops to disobey lawful orders. Kelly's involvement in the video is under “review” by the Pentagon, rather than subject to a formal investigation, meaning military police are not involved, a source familiar with Hegseth's thinking previously told CNN. Behind closed doors, Hegseth has been weighing his options to punish Kelly for participating in the video, ones that range from reducing the retired US Navy captain's rank and pension to prosecuting him under military law, CNN has reported. In his various public messages, Hegseth has suggested Kelly's comments violated several statutes of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which lays out legal requirements for those in the military. In Kelly, Hegseth sees a critic worth making an example of, and he could technically use the military justice system to do so, the source familiar with Hegseth's thinking said. Unlike the other five Democrats who appeared in the video, Kelly is a military retiree — meaning he served long enough to receive a pension, and thus, is still beholden to the UCMJ, including its restrictions on free speech, legal experts told CNN. Kelly could be recalled to active service and court-martialed because of that status, but doing so over his role in the video would be extraordinary, legal experts said. That's because not only has the UCMJ mainly been used in recent years to prosecute former service members who commit crimes overseas outside of US civil jurisdiction, but also because Kelly is a US senator.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks during the House Committee on Homeland Security on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. Senators clashed Thursday over President Donald Trump's use of the National Guard in American cities, with Republicans defending the deployments as necessary to fight lawlessness and Democrats calling it an extraordinary abuse of military power that violates states' rights. Meanwhile, in a separate hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was accused by House Democrats of habitually lying about the Trump administration's immigration enforcement. Delia Ramirez, a Democrat from Illinois, accused Noem's department of waging an “unaccountable, unlawful, unconstitutional” war against communities across the country.

Magaziner said the Purple Heart recipient had been deported earlier this year. Trump's zero-tolerance immigration policy split more than 5,000 children from their families at the Mexico border during his first term, when images of babies and toddlers taken from the arms of mothers sparked global condemnation. Seven years later, families are being separated but in a much different way. With illegal border crossings at their lowest levels in seven decades, a push for mass deportations is dividing families of mixed legal status inside the U.S. Federal officials and their local law enforcement partners are detaining tens of thousands of asylum-seekers and migrants. ▶ Read more about how immigrant families are being separated now. Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said Thursday that “decisive” actions by the United States, including the seizure of an oil tanker, have left the repressive government of President Nicolás Maduro at its weakest point, and she vowed to return to the country to keep fighting for democracy. Machado's statements to reporters came hours after she appeared in public for the first time in 11 months, following her arrival in Norway's capital, Oslo, where her daughter received the Nobel Peace Prize award on her behalf on Wednesday. Machado sidestepped questions on whether a U.S. military intervention is necessary to remove Maduro from power ▶ Read more about what the Nobel winner said in Oslo He asked for details on where the group is headquartered, and how many people are involved. Trump announced he had made that designation earlier this year, in a crackdown on leftists after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee zeroed in Thursday on Trump's statements that an “invasion within” or an “enemy within” justifies his guard deployments. Gen. Gregory Guillot, who leads the military's Northern Command, said “I do not have any indications of an enemy within.” An attorney for the Pentagon declined to offer a clear answer when asked if a president could lawfully order the military to shoot protesters. During a hearing Thursday on National Guard deployments in U.S. cities, Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, noted that former Defense Secretary Mark Esper alleged that Trump inquired about shooting protesters during the George Floyd demonstrations. Hirono asked Charles L. Young III, principal deputy general counsel at the defense department, whether a presidential order to shoot protesters would be lawful. “We have a president who doesn't think the rule of law applies to him,” Hirono said in response. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must release Abrego Garcia from custody immediately. “Since Abrego Garcia's return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,” the judge wrote. The Salvadoran national has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge in 2019 ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose Trump's immigration crackdown. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, raised concerns that National Guard troops deployed to U.S. cities don't receive training on how to handle situations where someone is having a mental health episode, saying that many police officers frequently encounter such situations and receive extensive training on how to handle them. Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the commander of U.S. troops in North America, said that National Guard troops are trained to de-escalate tense interactions with people, but don't receive any specific training on mental health episodes. Operation Allies Welcome was created by the Biden administration to safe Afghan supporters from Taliban retribution after the U.S. military pullout from Afghanistan following 20 years of American intervention and billions of dollars of aid.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who was also shot during the confrontation, has been charged with murder. Guillot said that he consults with military attorneys, raises any questions with the defense secretary and commanding military officers, and executes the order once he's confident in its lawfulness. This has become a pressing question under the Trump administration amid National Guard deployments to U.S. cities and a campaign to strike boats allegedly carrying drugs near Venezuela. The president has targeted Democratic lawmakers who released a video urging military and intelligence officers to refuse illegal orders. A protester interrupts as, from left, Joseph Kent, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Michael Glasheen, operations director of the National Security Branch of the FBI, appear before the House Committee on Homeland Security on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. Chairman Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., gaveled the panel back to order as Noem resumed her opening remarks. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, told the secretary she has diverted vast resources to carry out Trump's “extreme” immigration agenda, and failed to provide basic responses to oversight questions from Congress. “I call on you to resign,” the Mississippi congressman said. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi said in an opening statement that FBI Director Kash Patel should also be appearing at the hearing alongside Noem, saying he “can't help but notice” Patel's absence. Patel appeared to be out of the country on official FBI business. Late Wednesday on X, Patel posted that he was in Brussels for a “great” meeting with Matt Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO. Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the commander of U.S. troops in North America, told senators that National Guard troops are instructed not to perform many law enforcement activities like making arrests or searching for evidence of a crime. “Stop terrorizing our communities,” one person shouted as the secretary entered. One protester was singing the song from Star Wars that had been used to follow law enforcement officers as the agency conducts mass immigration raids and patrols city streets. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to face fierce questioning from Democrats Thursday as the public face of the Republican administration's hard-line approach to immigration. Noem is testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,” which in years past have focused on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. Thursday's appearance is likely to focus heavily on immigration. This hearing is the highest level of scrutiny to Trump's use of the National Guard outside of a courtroom since the deployments began and comes a day after the president faced another legal setback over his muscular use of troops in larger federal operations. The hearing comes two weeks after two West Virginia National Guard members deployed to Washington were shot just blocks from the White House in what the city's mayor described as a targeted attack. Sarah Beckstrom died a day after the Nov. 26 shooting, and her funeral took place Tuesday. “Most Americans don't want this,” she said at a the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, adding that most of the guard members don't want these assignments, either. “Our heroes did not sign up for this,” said Duckworth, a combat veteran who served in the Illinois National Guard. “In recent years, violent crime, rioting, drug trafficking and heinous gang activity have steadily escalated,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican. FILE - Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., leaves after a meeting with U.S. Navy Adm. Frank M. Bradley on Capitol Hill, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025, in Washington. He added that the troop deployments are “not only appropriate, but essential.” That's the lowest level for continuing claims since mid-April. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Overall layoffs have been muted despite recent high-profile job cuts. Hiring is also sluggish, which makes finding a job for those out of work challenging. For now, the U.S. job market appears stuck in a “low-hire, low-fire” state. It had fallen more than 23% from July to August. Many companies imported foreign goods early in 2025 to get ahead of Trump's tariffs. Even in the face of one-on-one pressure from the White House and violent threats against state lawmakers, many Indiana Republicans have been reluctant to back a new congressional map that would split the city of Indianapolis into four districts. Trump is threatening to back primary challengers for any GOP state senator who votes against the Republican remap. “If Republicans will not do what is necessary to save our Country, they will eventually lose everything to the Democrats,” Trump wrote on social media. Trump's approval ratings on immigration have declined since March, but border security remains a relatively strong issue for him. Trump's relative strength on border security is partially driven by Democrats and independents, who are less likely to approve of his immigration approach. Other polls have shown these groups tend to prioritize increasing border security more than deporting immigrants, even those who are living in the country illegally. Shaniqwa Copeland, a 30-year-old independent and home health aide in St. Augustine, Florida, said she approves of Trump's overall handling of the presidency, but believes his immigration actions have gone too far. “Now they're just picking up anybody,” Copeland told the AP. Prediction markets pegged AI as a leading contender, along with Trump, Pope Leo XIV, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, looks back at the media in Downing Street, London, Monday, Dec. 8, 2025. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine would give its latest peace proposals to U.S. negotiators ahead of his urgent talks Thursday with a coalition of about 30 countries supporting Kyiv's effort to end the war with Russia on acceptable terms. The White House did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday on whether that happened. Negotiations are at “a critical moment,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. Washington's goal of a swift compromise to stop the fighting that followed Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 is reducing Kyiv's room for maneuvering. Zelenskyy is walking a tightrope between defending Ukrainian interests and showing Trump he is willing to compromise, even as Moscow shows no public sign of budging from its demands. Zelenskyy's allies are backing his effort, seeking a fair settlement that will deters future Russian attacks and defend Europe. ▶ Read more about the latest negotiations to end Russia's war in Ukraine Despite a bipartisan desire to continue the credits, Republicans and Democrats have never engaged in meaningful or high-level negotiations. “It's too complicated and too difficult to get done in the limited time that we have left,” said Sen.

The sale came after Trump's administration recently announced plans to allow new drilling off Florida and California for the first time in decades. That's drawn pushback, including from Republicans worried about impacts to tourism. Under that legislation, companies will pay a 12.5% royalty on oil produced from the leases. That's the lowest royalty level for deep-water drilling since 2007. This screenshot taken from video shows Charlie Radman, a corn and soybean farmer, standing on the land his family has owned since 1899, near Randolph, Minn., Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2025. When Trump promised new tariffs while running for president, Gene Stehly worried that trade disputes would jeopardize his international sales of corn, soybeans and wheat. Trump announced Monday that his administration would distribute $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers, who have suffered from persistently low commodity prices, rising costs and declining sales after China cut off all agricultural purchases from America during the trade war. While rural areas remain conservative bastions, farmers' patience with Washington is wearing thin. Several of them described the government bailout, an echo of similar policies during Trump's first term, as a welcome stopgap but one that won't solve the agricultural industry's problems. It's not the ultimate solution we're looking for,” said Charlie Radman, a fourth-generation farmer. “What we really want to have is a little more certainty and not have to rely on these ad hoc payments.” Sweeping taxes on imports have cost the average American household nearly $1,200 since Donald Trump returned to the White House this year, according to calculations by Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee. Using Treasury Department numbers on revenue from tariffs and Goldman Sachs estimates of who ends up paying for them, the Democrats' report Thursday found that American consumers' share of the bill came to nearly $159 billion — or $1,198 per household — from February through November. In his second term, Trump has reversed decades of U.S. policy that favored free trade. Trump's approval on the economy and immigration have fallen substantially since March, according to a new AP-NORC poll, the latest indication that two signature issues that got him elected barely a year ago could be turning into liabilities as his party begins to gear up for the 2026 midterms. Trump has also struggled to recover from public blowback on other issues, such as his management of the federal government, and has not seen an approval bump even after congressional Democrats effectively capitulated to end a record-long government shutdown last month. There's been a similar decline on immigration, from 49% approval in March to 38% now. AP Morning Wire curates the most important stories and sends them straight to your inbox.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After demolishing the White House's East Wing, President Donald Trump is now eying four federal buildings for the same treatment and is circumventing a key government agency with his plans, according to a historic preservationist raising the alarm. “It is based on hearsay, not personal knowledge, and it is wrong,” principal deputy assistant attorney general Adam Gustafson and deputy chief Marissa Piropato wrote. GSA, they said, “is currently evaluating those assets not for demolition but for disposal—meaning conveyance out of federal ownership,” adding that GSA is following the necessary regulations. The White House did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Since returning to the White House this year, Trump has leaned into his background as a real estate developer and has taken major steps to apply his vision to Washington: paving over the White House Rose Garden and decorating it to mirror his Mar-a-Lago patio; adorning the Oval Office, Cabinet Room and West Colonnade with gilded features; and launching construction of a $300 million ballroom that he says is privately funded. But his new plans, Wright said in her declaration, present an “untenable situation” for GSA leadership attempting to navigate the president's hands-on involvement. '” said Wright, who added that she first learned of the effort Friday and that it only recently came to the attention of key GSA officials, who usually have to work within strict legal guidelines and historic preservation and environmental policy. As he attempts to put his mark on the nation's capital — from Kennedy Center renovations to plans for a new triumphal arch and stadium — Trump is taking aim at buildings with historical significance, preservationists warn. The Weaver building follows former President John F. Kennedy's “Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture” and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Earlier this year, the president signed an executive order mandating that all federal buildings “embrace classical architecture,” specifically targeting modernist and brutalist buildings. Historian Michael Austin has warned that Liberty Loan, an example of “tempo” federal buildings that popped up in the 20th century, is an “irreplaceable piece of Washington history.” The GSA Regional Office Building is another New Deal-era building. Wright's declaration comes amid a broader court battle over Trump's efforts to paint the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, a sprawling and ornate federal building next door to the White House. In an interview last month, Trump told Fox News he was exploring painting the distinctive building a bright white, adding, “Gray is for funerals.” A group of preservationists sued Trump to halt any changes to the building unless a standard review process is followed, warning the structure could be “irreversibly damaged.” Meanwhile, Trump's renovation and construction projects continue at the White House. Last week, he hired a new architect for the ballroom amid disputes with the project's original architect over its size and scope.</p>

Hudson Institute national security analyst Rebeccah Heinrichs breaks down the U.S. seizure of a sanctioned Iranian oil tanker off Venezuela, President Donald Trump's vow to target narco-terror networks and Iran's evasion of U.S. sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro on Thursday and reassured him of Moscow's support as the Venezuelan leader faces escalating external pressure, according to a statement from the Kremlin. In the call, reported by Reuters, Putin expressed support for Maduro's government "in the face of growing external pressure," as the United States under President Donald Trump continues to push for Maduro's removal from office. Washington has increased military activity in the Caribbean as part of its pressure campaign. The Kremlin said the two leaders discussed their shared interest in advancing a strategic partnership agreement and moving forward on joint projects in the economic and energy sectors. Moscow has long viewed Venezuela as a key partner in Latin America, particularly as both governments face isolation and international sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro. According to Fox News Digital's report, the Venezuelan government condemned the seizure as a violation of its sovereignty and accused Washington of hostile action against its economic interests. The Trump administration has intensified enforcement targeting Venezuela's oil sector, which remains the backbone of Maduro's government despite years of decline. Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro brandishes a sword during an event at the military academy in Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2025. The move followed a federal warrant tied to sanctions violations. Russia and Venezuela have maintained a close relationship for more than two decades, a partnership that deepened during the presidency of Hugo Chávez and continued under Nicolás Maduro. According to Reuters, cooperation between the two countries has focused on defense, energy production and financial assistance. Over the past several years, Moscow has supplied military equipment to Caracas, supported Venezuela's state oil company through joint ventures, and extended loans and credit lines that have helped keep parts of the country's oil sector functioning. Soldiers with their faces painted march during a military parade to celebrate the 205th anniversary of Venezuela's independence in Caracas, Venezuela July 5, 2016. Despite international sanctions targeting both governments, Russia has consistently treated Venezuela as a strategic partner. The U.S. Congressional Research Service reports describe the relationship as durable and largely unaffected by short-term political shifts or external pressure. Moscow has continued to offer diplomatic backing and economic cooperation even as Venezuela's domestic crisis worsened and U.S. pressure campaigns intensified.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defiantly defended the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies on Thursday during a House committee hearing, portraying migrants as a major threat faced by the nation that justifies a crackdown that has seen widespread arrests, deportations and a dizzying pace of restrictions on foreigners. Noem, who heads the agency central to President Donald Trump's approach to immigration, received backup from Republicans on the panel but fierce questioning from Democrats who called for her resignation. The secretary, whose testimony was interrupted by protesters calling for an end to deportations, vowed she “would not back down.” Noem, who was testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss “Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,” emphasized in her remarks how big a role she believed immigration played in those threats to the country. She said that was why Trump's administration was being “so aggressive” in “finding those people who shouldn't be in this country to begin with.” Trump returned to power in January with what he says is a mandate to reshape immigration in the U.S., claiming the country is under an invasion. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, told Noem that she has diverted vast resources to carry out Trump's “extreme” immigration agenda and failed to provide basic responses to oversight questions from Congress. “I call on you to resign,” the Mississippi congressman said. Noem did not address Thompson's call during her opening statement but suggested that she and the department she leads weren't going anywhere. Since then, immigration enforcement operations, especially in Los Angeles and Chicago, have become increasingly contentious, with federal agents and activists frequently clashing over her department's tactics. Her testimony was interrupted by protesters shouting “Stop ICE raids” and “End deportations.” The hearing offered lawmakers a rare opportunity to hear directly from Noem, but many members of the panel used the bulk of their allotted time to either praise or lambast her handling of immigration enforcement rather than ask questions designed to elicit expansive and illuminating responses. The program, Operation Allies Welcome, was created by then-President Joe Biden's Democratic administration after the 2021 decision to leave Afghanistan following 20 years of American intervention and billions of dollars in aid. Noem's department is under particular scrutiny because Congress in July passed legislation giving it roughly $165 billion to carry out its mass deportations agenda and secure the border. The secretary's appearance also comes as a federal judge is investigating whether she should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador. Noem will also likely have to answer to criticism from Democrats who accuse immigration enforcement agents of erroneously detaining and arresting American citizens in their rush to deport as many people in the country illegally as possible. When the hearing was announced in September, the Republican committee chair said that besides Noem and Kent, FBI Director Kash Patel would also be attending. But instead the FBI is being represented by Glasheen. Thompson said during his opening statement that he felt the FBI director should also be appearing at the hearing alongside Noem, saying he “can't help but notice” Patel's absence. Patel appeared to be out of the country on official FBI business. Late Wednesday on X, Patel posted that he was in Brussels for a “great” meeting with Matt Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO.</p>

After being taken into custody Wednesday night, it appears Sherrone Moore will remain in jail for the foreseeable future. The former Michigan head coach "remains under active investigation by law enforcement," and potential charges are not expected to be announced until at least Friday, officials told Fox News Digital. "Mr. Moore remains in custody at the Washtenaw County Jail. As this remains an active investigation, we are unable to comment further at this time, but our office will provide an update once a decision on charges is made," the Washtenaw County Prosecutor's Office said. Michigan Wolverines head coach Sherrone Moore stands on the sideline prior to a game against the Oklahoma Sooners at Gaylord Family-Oklahoma Memorial Stadium. Pittsfield police said later Thursday that Moore would be arraigned on Friday. Moore was fired Wednesday, and the University of Michigan quickly announced it found credible evidence of an "inappropriate relationship" with a staffer. Shortly after, he was booked into the Michigan jail. "The conduct constitutes a clear violation of University policy, and U-M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior," athletic director Warde Manuel said. (Adam Cairns/Columbus Dispatch / USA TODAY Network via Imagn Images) Following news of the police investigation, the University of Michigan athletic department told Fox News Digital it "cannot comment on personnel matters" and had "nothing to share beyond the initial statement." Pittsfield police said they responded to a home as part of an assault investigation. Police said a suspect was taken into custody and that the incident does not appear to be random.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge in Maryland ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia freed from immigration detention on Thursday while his legal challenge against his deportation moves forward, handing a major victory to the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement must let Abrego Garcia go immediately. “Since Abrego Garcia's return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority,” the judge wrote. The Department of Homeland Security was highly critical of the release order and vowed to oppose it, calling it “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed by President Barack Obama, a Democrat. “This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department's assistant secretary. Messages seeking comment were left with Abrego Garcia's attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he originally immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge in 2019 ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. under a court order. His lawsuit in federal court claims Trump's Republican administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish Abrego Garcia over the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation to El Salvador. In her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The reference was made to the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia to and submitted affirmations that Costa Rica had rescinded its offer to accept him — later determined to be untrue. “But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote. Xinis also dismissed the federal government's arguments that the court did not have jurisdiction to rule on a final order of removal, noting that order had not been filed. “Thus, Abrego Garcia's request for immediate release cannot touch upon the execution of a removal order if no such order exists,” she wrote. His defense attorney in the Tennessee case, Sean Hecker, declined to comment. A judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing to be held on the motion after previously finding some evidence that the prosecution against Abrego Garcia “may be vindictive.” The judge said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern.” The judge specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case.

A federal judge in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Thursday ordered the release of Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia from federal immigration custody in Pennsylvania — a long-awaited update in an extraordinary case that has dominated international headlines and federal court dockets for nearly 10 months. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered Abrego Garcia released from the ICE Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pa., on the grounds that the Trump administration had not obtained the final notice of removal order that is needed to deport him to a third country, including a list of African nations they had previously identified for his removal. "Since Abrego Garcia's return from wrongful detention in El Salvador, he has been re-detained, again without lawful authority," Xinis said in her order on Thursday. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, right, and his brother Cesar Abrego Garcia, center, arrive at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore, Monday, Aug. 25, 2025. Xinis in November had used a lengthy evidentiary hearing to press lawyers for the Trump administration on whether it had the final order needed to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. to a third country, including the African nations identified by government officials. Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign suggested then that the immigration judge who ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia could not be removed back to his home country of El Salvador had "meant," or implied a final order of removal — a notion Xinis dismissed in her ruling. "No such order of removal exists for Abrego Garcia," she said. The Justice Department is almost certain to appeal her order to a higher court, as Ensign indicated they would do in previous hearings. Xinis had said last month that without final notice of removal, Abrego Garcia would be "at a minimum" entitled to certain relief. She cited Supreme Court precedent under Zadvydas v. Davis, which bars the government from indefinitely detaining migrants after removal issues have been ordered. A side-by-side image of President Donald Trump and protesters holding signs in support of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadorian migrant who was deported to El Salvador in March, in what Trump officials acknowledged was an "administrative error." Abrego Garcia's status since March has been at the center of a legal and political maelstrom, when he was deported to his home country of El Salvador, in violation of a 2019 court order and in what Trump officials acknowledge was an "administrative error." Xinis ordered then that Abrego Garcia be "immediately" returned to the U.S. Critics argue the months-long legal fight that ensued has allowed the Trump administration to test its mettle on immigration enforcement, as well as its ability to slow-walk or evade compliance with federal courts. Senior DHS and Justice Department officials, for their part, have disputed that accusation. They have also been sharply critical of Xinis and other federal judges presiding over deportation cages, whom they have repeatedly accused of overstepping their authority as a district judge. "This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts," DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Thursday in response to the order. Upon his return to the U.S. in June, Abrego Garcia was immediately taken into federal custody in Nashville and detained on human smuggling charges, stemming from a 2022 traffic stop. A federal judge in Tennessee has been hearing from the government and Abrego Garcia's lawyers on his motion to dismiss that case on the grounds of vindictive and selective prosecution. A hearing on the motion to dismiss has been scheduled in Nashville for early next month. A member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus holds a picture of Kilmar Abrego Garcia during a news conference to discuss Abrego Garcia's arrest and deportation d at Cannon House Office Building on Apr. Xinis had also pressed Trump officials on why they could not deport Abrego Garcia to the third county of Costa Rica, whose government had granted the necessary assurances that they would not detain him or refoul him back to his home country of El Salvador. Trump officials previously told her in court that Costa Rica was "off the table," though they did not provide evidence. Subsequent court filings appear to show that Costa Rica had not reneged on its agreement to accept Abrego Garcia into their country, casting renewed doubt on that claim. The order from Xinis comes after lawyers for the Trump administration repeatedly asked Xinis to dissolve an emergency order she handed down in August, which required Abrego Garcia to remain in U.S. immigration custody, and within 200 miles of her court. The Trump administration previously tried and failed to remove Abrego Garcia to the African countries of Liberia, Eswatini, Uganda and briefly, Ghana. Xinis noted in late November that the government cannot take any of those steps without the final notice of removal order. "You've raised all these arguments, and they all depend on me having a withholding of removal order," Xinis said then.

The University of Michigan fired Sherrone Moore after the school found "credible evidence" of an inappropriate relationship with a staffer – hours later, he was booked into a jail. It is quite a rapid fall from grace for Moore, who less than two years ago was on top of the college football world as a national champion. Moore found himself in controversy during the investigation into Michigan's potential sign-stealing, but this controversy trumps them all. (Adam Cairns/Columbus Dispatch / USA TODAY Network via Imagn Images) After spending his first two years at a community college near his hometown, he transferred to Oklahoma and played there for two years.

Steinman/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Just one year after graduating from Oklahoma, Moore joined the coaching staff at Louisville as a graduate assistant. He was promoted to a full-time assistant in 2012, becoming the team's tight ends coach. Moore left to hold the same position at Central Michigan in 2014 before also becoming the team's assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator in 2017. Central Michigan assistant head coach/recruiting coordinator/tight ends coach Sherrone Moore during a game between the Boston College Eagles and the Central Michigan Chippewas on Sept. 30, 2017, at Alumni Stadium in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. Moore was the tight ends coach through 2020 and was promoted in early 2021 to the team's co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach. Moore's first taste as a head coach came in 2023, when he became the acting head coach while Harbaugh served two separate three-game suspensions stemming from the sign-stealing scandal. Michigan completed a perfect season, winning the national championship over Washington. After Harbaugh left for the Los Angeles Chargers, Moore was promoted to head coach. His first season was a disappointment, as Michigan went 8-5, but one of those wins was a huge upset as three-touchdown underdogs in Columbus against Ohio State. Moore was shockingly fired on Wednesday, and the University of Michigan quickly announced it found credible evidence of an inappropriate relationship with a staffer. Shortly after, he was booked into the Washtenaw County Jail in Michigan. Pittsfield police said they responded to a home as part of an assault investigation. Police said a suspect was taken into custody and that the incident does not appear to be random. At the time of publication, Moore had yet to be charged. Earlier this season, Poggi took over for Moore during his suspension. Fox News' Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The OpenAI logo is seen displayed on a cell phone in front of an image on a computer screen generated by ChatGPT's Dall-E text-to-image model, Friday, Dec. 8, 2023, in Boston. Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, testifies before a Senate committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on May 8, 2025. Disney is investing $1 billion in OpenAI and will bring characters such as Mickey Mouse, Cinderella and Luke Skywalker to the AI company's Sora video generation tool, in a licensing deal that the two companies announced on Thursday. At the same time, Disney went after Google, demanding the tech company stop exploiting its copyrighted characters to train its AI systems. Under the three-year licensing deal, fans will be able to use Sora to generate and share videos based on more than 200 Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars characters. AI video generators like Sora have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of such videos on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about “AI slop” crowding out human-created work alongside concerns about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright. “This agreement shows how AI companies and creative leaders can work together responsibly to promote innovation that benefits society, respect the importance of creativity, and help works reach vast new audiences,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. Disney CEO Robert Iger said the deal will “extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.” Disney will also become a “major customer” of OpenAI and use its technology to build new products, tools, and services. It will also roll out ChatGPT for employees. “Well, we have been aggressive at protecting our IP, and we have gone after other companies that have not honored our IP, not respected our IP, not valued it. And this is another example of us doing just that,” Iger said in an interview on CNBC's “Squawk on the Street. “We have been in conversation with Google, basically expressing our concerns about this. Disney accused Google of “infringing Disney's copyrights on a massive scale,” according to a copy of the letter dated Dec. 10 seen by The Associated Press. Google has also been “intentionally amplifying” the problem by making the infringing content available across its many channels including YouTube, Disney said. Disney said Google hasn't taken any measures to mitigate the problem even though it has been raising the concerns for months. “Google's mass infringement of Disney's copyrighted works must stop,” the letter said. Google did not respond immediately to a request for comment.</p>

Fox Sports analyst Robert Griffin III gave his take on the Cleveland Browns' questionable two-point conversion play, where Shedeur Sanders was sidelined with the game on the line in Week 14. When Shedeur Sanders found fellow rookie Harold Fannin Jr. for the touchdown in Cleveland on Sunday to make it a 31-29 ball game, Browns fans were ecstatic, knowing a successful two-point conversation meant a tie game. But confusion, and bewilderment for some, was the reaction when Sanders wasn't seen under center on the two-point try. It was rookie running back Quinshon Judkins, who was in the wildcat formation as he does on occasion this season. After seeing head coach Kevin Stefanski's decision to go with Judkins in the wildcat over Sanders, he believed it was pure "coaching failure" on his part. He wasn't and that's a coaching failure on their part," Griffin told Fox News Digital after helping USAA gift two military veterans with new vehicles before the 126th Army-Navy game this weekend. Sanders, though, never lost faith and was able to get into the end zone for his first rushing touchdown on the ensuing drive to make it a 31-23 ball game. He was 23-for-42 for 364 yards with an interception as well. Griffin said the two-point conversion play Stefanski and offensive coordinator Tommy Rees had dialed up might have been the wildcat on the call sheet, but he thought they needed to look deeper into how they got to that point. "I think, from a coaching standpoint, you look at it and say, ‘What are our best two-point plays? Most coaches go into a game with two to three two-point plays, and they were just at the point where that was the two-point play that was next on the call sheet," he explained. "In that moment, I think you have to say to yourself this young man has four touchdowns, he's led us all the way back into this game and kept us in this game. We should not be taking him off the field. But you have to be able to take the analytics out and say, ‘All right, this is the best thing we can do in this moment.'" Cleveland Browns' Shedeur Sanders (12) and Teven Jenkins (74) celebrate a touchdown in the first half of an NFL football game against the Tennessee Titans in Cleveland, Sunday, Dec. 7, 2025. Stefanski has been criticized for his handling of Sanders since joining a crowded Browns quarterbacks room when he arrived in Cleveland. Sanders won his first career start in Las Vegas, a 24-10 victory over the Raiders, and Stefanski gave him praise for getting better by the week. But Stefanski's decision on Sunday with the two-point conversion only added fuel to those who believe Sanders is being set up to fail with the Browns. Griffin noted no coach should make gameday decisions based on outside noise, but after balling out, he's confident that Sanders should've been in for that crucial play. Sanders has four more games left in his rookie season, starting with the Chicago Bears on the road in Week 15. Cryptologic Technician Petty Officer First Class Jamil Lewis, who is currently serving in the Navy, and veteran Patrick Huber, a specialist of the 116th Infantry Regiment, Army National Guard, were both surprised by Griffin with the brand-new vehicle at Inner Harbor in front of the USS Constellation. Griffin, who comes from a military family himself with his mother and father serving in the Army, has long enjoyed his partnership with USAA and couldn't have been happier to help out with this. From left to right, Mark Steiding of Kenwood Auto Body, NFL legend Robert Griffin III, Spc. Patrick Huber (veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard), USAA Senior Vice President Rob Braggs and Dale Moss of NABC Recycled Rides pose at USAA's Army-Navy Game NABC Recycled Rides Car Gifting in Baltimore, Maryland, on Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2025. "I've been so honored to partner with USAA. We've been partnered together for the last 13 years, and I'm a guy who likes to do genuine, authentic partnerships. Military brat, mom and dad both served in the Army. So, I'm a ‘Go Army, beat Navy' guy — 31 years combined between them. To see the impact we've been able to make over the last 13 years, doing things to make our military members know they're not forgotten, it does something for me," he explained. "If it's doing something for me, it's doing something for these families we get to impact, to make their lives a little bit easier. I say that because, yeah, they didn't have to pay money for it, but there was sacrifice for us and our freedoms to be able to get this type of treatment. Griffin said that Huber, a lifelong Dallas Cowboys fan, made sure to take a crack at him during their time together about the Washington Commanders, who the Baylor product was drafted by. And Griffin also loved seeing Lewis' nine-year-old son, one of his five children, "going ballistic" when he realized what was happening.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When an ancient ship was unearthed in Scandinavia over 100 years ago, archaeologists started to uncover bits and pieces of its history. On board the plank-built vessel was a hoard of weapons — swords, spears, shields and more — revealing a tale of warriors who attempted to attack the Danish island of Als and were ultimately defeated. The island's defenders sank the ship in a bog, where it remained until its discovery and excavation over two millennia later. But there were still lingering questions, such as where the invaders came from and when. The findings, which were published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, provide radiocarbon dating data as well as an analysis of building material, suggesting the boat traveled farther than previously thought. Archaeologists find earliest known fire made by humans “Our work has provided an important new clue for the mystery of where the raiders in the boat came from,” said lead author Mikael Fauvelle, an associate professor and researcher in the department of archaeology and ancient history at Lund University in Sweden. “During the Bronze Age, Scandinavians needed to travel by sea to trade for copper and tin, which were needed to make bronze and were not mined in the Nordic region at the time,” Fauvelle said in an email. “Studying the boat gives us critical information not only about early Iron Age seafaring, but also information about seafaring in the preceding Bronze Age.” According to Fauvelle, the fingerprint was a rare find that could provide a direct link to someone who had used the ancient boat. Before its sinking, the Hjortspring boat was nearly 20 meters (about 66 feet) long and could hold up to 24 men. The boat, which is currently on display at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, is made up of a bottom plank sewn together with two side planks, and a curved extension at each end. It wasn't until 2024, when the authors of the new study analyzed previously unexamined caulking — a sealant material that makes a boat watertight — and cordage (rope and twine) found with the boat, that the first new major clue in over a century was uncovered. An ancient stone staircase seemed to lead nowhere. It was previously assumed that the caulking was made from local materials such as linseed oil or tallow (cow fat), but the researchers found that the material instead to consist of a mixture of animal fat and pine pitch, or dried sap from pine trees. During this period, Denmark had few pine forests, suggesting that the boat may have been built in a different region, such as the coastal areas along the Baltic Sea that did have pine forests. “It also shows that ancient Scandinavia was a very interconnected region. Much like today, political conflicts and alliances transcended regional boundaries and people must have had both contacts with each other over considerable distances.” Ole Kastholm, a specialist in ancient Scandinavian seafaring and a senior researcher at the Roskilde Museum in Denmark,  found the unexpected use of pine pitch for caulking to be exciting. “The study also shows how important it is that we in our museum-collections take care of old artefacts,” he added. “When the Hjortspring Boat was excavated in 1921, one could not have known that 100 years later there would be a number of highly specialized methods that would be able to extract knowledge from even the most insignificant pieces from the excavation. Hopefully one day we are able to pin down the exact geographical origin of this unique vessel.” A few other fingerprints have been found in tar, “but they all come from different time periods and very different contexts. To find one on such a unique boat is extremely special,” he added. Mystery foot fossil may shake up human family tree “The Hjortspring boat and the Hjortspring find (with its many weapons) gives evidence as to conflict and strategy during the Early Iron Age of Northern Europe,” Kaul said in an email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japan's deadliest surge in bear attacks is gripping the nation. Just as sunlight interrupts the darkness over his small Hokkaido city, the 76-year-old pulls on his rain boots and dons a bright orange jacket. Along the drive, neighbors call out, asking about recent sightings. Ikegami is somewhat of a local hero in this rural community. Over his 40-year career, he's culled dozens of bears and sees his work as a crucial line of defense between the town and the increasingly unpredictable wilderness. “Without me,” he said, “who else would save this town?” The metal cages he's set up are scattered across Sunagawa city, each baited with slabs of deer meat and positioned where bears have been spotted this year. The day we accompany him, his traps are empty. But he warns that the bears are never far, increasingly pushing into human territory and frightening those who live here. This is a murder case,” the hunter told CNN. This year, at least 13 people have been killed and more than 200 wounded injured in bear encounters. Videos of bears rummaging through supermarket aisles, roaming school grounds and plucking persimmons from suburban backyards have gone viral on Japanese social media. Some schools have also closed temporarily, while residents in parts of northern Japan avoid going out after dark. Japan's defense minister has deployed the Self-Defense Forces to hard-hit regions, and lawmakers are scrambling to find long-term solutions. The US and UK embassies have also issued advisories to travelers in rural areas. But for hunters, the crisis feels both frightening – and predictable. “There are just too many bears now, it's an emergency situation,” Ikegami said. With more than a third of Japan's population now over 65, rural towns are shrinking. Few young residents remain, and even fewer are willing to take up hunting, Ikegami said, a dangerous job with low pay and little appeal compared to urban life in places like Tokyo. “If the government had taken this seriously earlier, it wouldn't have gotten this bad,” Atsushi Kanno, a 37-year-old bear hunter, told CNN. “It's nonsense that they're responding now, only after things have escalated.” There are several factors driving the surge in encounters. The stocky cousins of the grizzly can stand nearly seven feet tall and are found only in Hokkaido. Poor harvests of nuts and fruit are pushing bears to seek food elsewhere. I believe bears are taking a step closer to human settlements,” Hiroo Tamatani, a bear conservationist, told CNN. But as those areas empty out, bears are moving in, taking advantage of the new real estate. Culling is currently Japan's primary response for bears that attack people or encroach on residential areas. But the Self-Defense Forces remain legally prohibited from using weapons unless national defense is at stake, leaving hunters like Ikegami on the frontlines. He trains young hunters, but few have the skill or confidence to take down animals that can weigh several hundred pounds. At the same time, he regularly receives angry phone calls urging him not to kill bears. No person would say a bear's life is more important than their own,” Ikegami added. Harada also knows first-hand how powerful these bears can be. He was nearly killed by a bear more than 20 years ago while hunting deer. “I fired two shots, but the bear didn't stop. It got on top of me, pulled by gun out of my hands and bit by head,” he told CNN. “My eye and ear were hanging off,” he said. But he recalls reaching for his walkie-talkie and calling his friends, who were on the hunt with him, to get help. Many in Japan now fear hiking or traveling to prefectures with recent attacks, and a growing number prefer visiting “no-bear prefectures,” areas with no known bear populations. “Rather than killing them all, we should identify the ones that cause problems and deal with those respectively,” Tamatani said. He works at a nonprofit called Picchio, which uses dogs to deter bears, and tags bears to track their movements. Tamatani also advocates planting bear food trees away from residential zones, so they have access to natural resources further from towns. While repeat offenders may still be culled, he argues that these measures reduce unnecessary deaths. Japan continues searching for solutions that protect human life while allowing wildlife to survive. Sometimes we harmed each other, but we still must respect and acknowledge one another,” Tougen Yoshihara, a Buddhist monk who was attacked by a bear in May, told CNN. Yoshihara survived only because his dog, Chico, barked and chased the bear away, he said. He escaped with minor injuries, but the experience has haunted him—he now carries a carving knife when walking in the woods. But until a lasting solution emerges, more lives, human and animal alike, will likely pay the price.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Pentagon did not conduct a routine investigation into the impact of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's disclosure of sensitive military information in a group chat on Signal earlier this year and whether it damaged national security – in part because Hegseth never authorized it, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. A classification review and damage assessment would typically be initiated following any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive defense information, in part, to examine whether sources and methods or ongoing US military and intelligence operations have been compromised in a way that would require mitigation. After the Signal messages came to light, Hegseth, instead turned his attention inward and focused on formally investigating suspected leakers on his own staff, even threatening to polygraph defense officials he believed were disclosing potentially embarrassing details about him, multiple current and former officials said. Those threats had a “chilling effect” among DoD officials who became increasingly wary of doing anything that could be perceived by Hegseth as an attempt to undercut him, according to those officials. The news that the Pentagon did not carry out a damage assessment or conduct an internal classification review comes days after an internal watchdog report was released that concluded Hegseth risked endangering American troops by sharing highly sensitive attack plans targeting Houthi rebels in Yemen. Hegseth has mischaracterized the report's findings, claiming “total exoneration” and “no classified information” even though the watchdog declined to weigh in on his classification authority or whether a compromise occurred – acknowledging its investigation was limited in scope, in part, because the secretary refused to cooperate. “A damage assessment is forward-looking and focused on risk rather than personal culpability. Even without the official's cooperation, analysts can evaluate what material was shared, who had access to it, and any potential operational or counterintelligence implications. In that sense, a damage assessment would not have been constrained by the same limitations that hampered the IG investigation,” according to Brianna Rosen, a former White House official specializing in national security and tech policy. But that is not consistent with how other current and former officials explained the process. Inspectors general would not typically be responsible for determining whether a compromise of classified material occurred, according to Irvin McCullough, director of national security at the Government Accountability Project, who noted that is usually done by the department's security officers through a damage assessment. “I'd 100 percent expect a damage assessment,” McCullough told CNN. “If they did not do a damage assessment, I'd imagine it's because the Original Classification Authority/originator determined there was no compromise,” he said. In this case, the IG report suggests that decision would have likely been made by Hegseth. For Hegseth's use of Signal, a damage assessment would have examined how the information was transmitted, why it was classified at that level and assessed the risk from intelligence to what damage it could cause, the US official added. US intelligence agencies and the FBI similarly did not examine the broader national security implications of Hegseth using a commercial messaging app – on his personal phone – to send closely-guarded operational details about an imminent strike in Yemen despite concerns being raised that information could have jeopardized the safety of US troops and mission objectives, the sources said. No such assessment took place after revelations that Hegseth used Signal, via his personal phone, to send detailed attack plans to other Trump officials and a reporter, despite US officials raising immediate concerns about the information's sensitivity and his use of unsecure, non-government devices to share it, the sources said. “Based on our review, we concluded that some information the Secretary sent from his personal cell phone on Signal on March 15, 2025, matched the operational information USCENTCOM sent and classified as SECRET//NOFORN,” the unclassified IG report states. Former prosecutors who specialized in national security cases also told CNN that under previous administrations, investigators would have likely scrutinized whether Hegseth had used Signal for other sensitive discussions beyond the chat on Yemen strike plans. A third former senior defense official noted, however, that the decision to conduct a damage assessment is not automatic and not uniform across cases – meaning there is not a single uniform template that must be followed in every circumstance. When any of those elements are present, agencies generally err on the side of initiating an assessment because it guides mitigation responses and helps prevent future breaches,” Rosen told CNN. US intelligence agencies considered it the Defense Department's responsibility to initiate a damage assessment because the Pentagon was in charge of the operation in question and details shared by Hegseth seemed to come from classified military channels. The IG report acknowledged Hegseth, as defense secretary, has broad authority to declassify information but also notes investigators were unable to find any documentation showing he properly did so in this case. To properly declassify the material, Hegseth would have had to issue a formal written order notifying several top Pentagon officials of his decision at the time he claims to have made it, including the DoD general counsel, undersecretary for intelligence and CENTCOM. Unlike the IG, Pentagon officials conducting a damage assessment, if one had been done, would have been able to examine whether Hegseth followed that process without relying solely on his cooperation, multiple current and former officials said. In some cases, like the investigation into former national security adviser John Bolton's handling of classified information following the publication of his book about his time working for Trump in 2020, damage assessments have uncovered evidence that led to a criminal prosecution. Those details included the operation's timing, targets, methods and objectives – similar to what Hegseth shared in at least two group chats, including one with his wife, brother and personal lawyer. The Air Force colonel now faces up to 10 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to one count of unauthorized communication of national defense information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson blasted Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) during an interview on CNN's The Source with Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday night. Wilson said Mace acted like an “entitled, spoiled brat” during an incident at the Charleston International Airport on Oct. 30, in which she reportedly berated law enforcement officials and Transportation Security Administration staff. “There are half a dozen people who gave reports, I mean statements, that she used, I mean they're all saying the same thing,” Wilson said in response to a question asked by Collins about Mace's denial. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson responds to Rep. Nancy Mace accusing him of a political hit job over the airport police investigation. At the end of the day, she's saying things that are delusional, and this basically reminds me of a spoiled brat, an entitled, spoiled brat.” According to the police report from that day, police officers eventually connected with Mace at a TSA entrance, where they found her “very irate.” “It appeared she was either dictating a message into her phone or talking to someone about the situation.” Earlier this week, while also appearing on CNN, Mace criticized the report of her exchange with airport officers, calling it a political “hit job” and partly “falsified.” And conveniently, there is no audio that goes with it.” I have never done that in my life,” Mace added. She was asked on CNN if Wilson and the Charleston Airport Police Department collaborated. “Six minutes after they released the falsified reports, he had a news release and a press thing on social media,” the congresswoman said. He announced his candidacy for governor of South Carolina in June 2025. In August 2025, Mace also announced her candidacy for governor of South Carolina.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Circuit Judge Emil Bove for attending President Donald Trump's speech in Pennsylvania on Tuesday. Bove told MS NOW's Vaughn Hillyard that he attended the speech as a private citizen: “Just here as a citizen coming to watch the president speak.” Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, filed a judicial misconduct complaint against Bove on Wednesday over his attendance at the Trump event. Fix the Court was originally founded as a project of New Venture Fund, which is managed by the left-wing dark money group Arabella Advisers. “It should have been obvious to Judge Bove, either at the start of the rally or fairly close to it, that this was a highly charged, highly political event that no federal judge should have been within shouting distance of,” Roth wrote in the complaint. In your world, you'd rather give rights to illegal criminals over Americans,” Cheung said. Attending a Trump event — and not leaving when it became clear that the speech was, in fact, a partisan rally — violates this canon,” Roth wrote. “Canon 5 states that a judge ‘should refrain from political activity.' A spokeswoman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Clare Slattery, told Bloomberg Law that Trump's speech “was an official White House event highlighting kitchen table issues that impact all Americans.” Grassley and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) have raised code of conduct concerns about federal judges who they say have anonymously made “inflammatory comments” about the Supreme Court. Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Dick Durbin (D-IL) told the Courthouse News Service that he hoped Bove would show “better judgment.”</p>
