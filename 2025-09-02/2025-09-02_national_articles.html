                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that U.S. Space Command will be located in Alabama, reversing a Biden-era decision to keep it at its temporary headquarters in Colorado. The long-expected decision from Trump caps a four-year tug of war between two states and opposing administrations about where to locate U.S. Space Command, an intense fight because the headquarters would be a significant boon to the local economy. Alabama and Colorado have long battled to claim Space Command, with elected officials from both states asserting their state is the better location. “The U.S. Space Command headquarters will move to the beautiful locale of a place called Huntsville, Alabama, forever to be known from this point forward as Rocket City,” said Trump, flanked by Republican members of Alabama's congressional delegation, from the Oval Office on Tuesday. “We had a lot of competition for this and Alabama's getting it.” Trump said Huntsville won the race for the Space Command headquarters, in part, because “they fought harder for it than anybody else.” GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who is running for governor of Alabama, said Huntsville is the “perfect place” for the headquarters and suggested it be named after Trump. And Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt, who stood next to Trump during the announcement, thanked Trump for “restoring Space Command to its rightful home.” “The Biden administration chose to make this political,” she said. “What we want to do is put the safety and security of Americans first. We want to make sure our American war fighter is put first.” In this photo released by the U.S. Air Force, Capt. Ryan Vickers stands for a photo to display his new service tapes after taking his oath of office to transfer from the U.S. Air Force to the U.S. Space Force at Al-Udeid Air Base, Qatar, Sept. 1, 2020. U.S. Space Command said in a statement on X after the announcement that it “stands ready to carry out the direction of the President following today's announcement of Huntsville, Alabama as the command's permanent headquarters location.” Its functions include conducting operations like enabling satellite-based navigation and troop communication and providing warning of missile launches. Huntsville, Alabama, nicknamed Rocket City, has long been home to the Army's Redstone Arsenal and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle said about 1,400 Space Command jobs will transition to Redstone Arsenal over the next five years. Huntsville is ready with our experienced workforce, resilient infrastructure and deep commitment to national defense.” The city was picked after site visits to six states that compared factors such as infrastructure capacity, community support and costs to the Defense Department. President Donald Trump steps off Air Force One after arriving at Huntsville International airport, Sept. 22, 2017, in Huntsville, Ala. President Donald Trump's administration says U.S. Space Command will be based in Alabama, reversing a Biden-era decision to keep it in Colorado. Then-President Joe Biden in 2023 announced Space Command would be permanently located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which had been serving as its temporary headquarters. The announcement infuriated both Democratic and Republican officials in Colorado, which has a booming aerospace industry. Jared Polis, a Democrat, called the relocation of Space Command to Alabama “deeply disappointing” and demanded an explanation as to how the decision was made. “The problem with Colorado is that they have a very corrupt voting system,” Trump said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States “conducted a lethal strike” against an alleged “drug vessel” in the southern Caribbean, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday. “As @potus just announced moments ago, today the U.S. military conducted a lethal strike in the southern Carribean against a drug vessel which had departed from Venezuela and was being operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization,” Rubio said in a post on X after President Donald Trump referenced the incident in Oval Office remarks. The move represents a significant escalation by the Trump administration against drug cartels, a number of which the administration has designated as foreign terrorist organizations. It could have serious implications for the region where the US has amassed military assets, drawing the ire of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. CNN has asked the Venezuelan government for comment. Rubio himself is on his way to Mexico and Ecuador on Tuesday. Trump on Tuesday said the US military “just over the last few minutes, literally shot out a boat, a drug carrying boat.” “It just happened moments ago, and our great general, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff … he gave us a little bit of a briefing, and you'll see, and there's more where that came from,” Trump said. “We have a lot of drugs pouring into our country, coming in for a long time, and we just these came out of Venezuela, and coming out, very heavily from Venezuela,” he said.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X that the vessel was being operated by a “designated narco-terrorist organization.” JB Pritzker, a Democrat, to call him and say “send in the troops.” President Donald Trump speaks during an event about the relocation of U.S. Space Command headquarters from Colorado to Alabama in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, Sept. 2, 2025, in Washington, as Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., and Vice President JD Vance listen. I didn't see that” and then talked about his activities over recent day. Trump said despite a lack of public appearances up until Tuesday that he did “numerous” interviews and had some “pretty poignant” posts on his social media site. The president said he went to visit “some people” at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia as well. In announcing that Space Command would be headquartered in Alabama, Trump said the “big problem” he has with Colorado is its use of mail-in voting. Trump has long claimed without clear evidence that mail-in voting increases fraud and he's seeking to ban it as a practice by states in U.S. elections. “So that played a big factor,” Trump said of relocating Space Force's command center. The president said that mail-in voting leads to “automatically crooked elections.” Trump has officially announced that Space Force's headquarters will be moving to Alabama. “The U.S. Space Command HQ will move to the beautiful locale of a place called Huntsville, Alabama, forever to be known from this point forward as Rocket City,” Trump said. Trump said one of his issues with Colorado was that it allowed all-mail in voting -- which he suggested encouraged fraud. The president said in an interview taped Tuesday morning with conservative commentator Scott Jennings that he will be “going in as an emergency” to the high court and would “probably” be seeking it Wednesday. “It will be a disaster if that is lost for our country,” Trump said of his tariffs. When Trump makes his announcement about Space Command's new headquarters, it will be the first time he's spoken publicly for a week. His participation in a Cabinet meeting last Tuesday stretched for three hours, including a monologue, conversations with top officials and questions from reporters. After Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst made her retirement official on Tuesday, one House Republican widely speculated to launch a statewide bid teased an “announcement soon” on the race. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who represents an eastern Iowa district, praised Ernst's time in military and government service as a “powerful example of the American dream.” “As we look forward, President Trump needs a fighter in the Senate who will always have his back to continue to cut spending, deport illegal aliens, and put working families first,” Hinson said in a post on the social media site X. Dr. Paul Offit told the Associated Press Tuesday that he learned his appointment to a Food and Drug Administration vaccine panel would not be renewed. Offit, a vaccine inventor and pediatric specialist, has been a prominent critic of Kennedy, repeatedly calling for his resignation over recent changes to vaccine access and information. The FDA's vaccine advisory panel meets regularly to make recommendations for seasonal shots and to review the safety and effectiveness of new vaccines. But Offit said he was told that Kennedy's department decided not to renew his appointment. Secretary of State Marco Rubio attended an awards ceremony in his native Miami where Polish officials recognized one of Cuba's best known dissidents. Rubio appeared alongside his Polish counterpart, Radoslaw Sikorski, and spoke briefly to praise Berta Soler's refusal to leave Cuba while also thanking Poland for its actions to throw off communist rule and support other countries on the same path. Soler did not attend the event and recorded a video from Cuba. It's a loss for Climate United Fund and other nonprofits who wanted the federal court system to ensure it quickly received its funding. Rep. Jamie Raskin expressed hope Tuesday that a joint House resolution he introduced last month to reverse the Trump Administration's takeover of law enforcement in the District of Columbia will pick up steam as Congress returns. “I'm asking my staff to check this Tuesday morning exactly how many people we have on it, I think it's around 70 or 75” members of Congress who joined during the recess. “As people come back, I'm hoping to get huge numbers of members and of course the big question as always will be whether Republicans will join us in this.” Almost all are Venezuelan, and they've reversed course since Trump's immigration crackdown began, according to a report published by the governments of Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica, with support of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. This “reverse flow” migration is largely made up of migrants who fled Venezuela's long-running economic, social and political crises only to encounter U.S. immigration policy no longer open to asylum-seekers. Migration through the treacherous Darien Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama peaked in 2023 when more than half a million migrants crossed. That flow slowed somewhat in 2024, but dried up almost completely early this year. ▶ Read more about what's happening with Venezuelans who were trying to reach the U.S. Judge Breyer noted in his ruling the Trump administration's possible plans to call National Guard troops into other U.S. cities. Newsom posted on X, in an all-caps reflection of the president's own social media style, “DONALD TRUMP LOSES AGAIN. Trump deployed roughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines in Southern California over the objections of Democratic Gov. Breyer accused the Trump administration of “willfully” violating the law, saying it used troops for functions barred by their training, refused to “meaningfully coordinate with state and local officials” and “coached” federal law enforcement agencies as it used armed soldiers and military vehicles to block traffic, engage in crowd control and otherwise act beyond its authority. It prohibits Chicago Police from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge. The federal surge into Chicago could start as early as Sept. 5 and last about 30 days, according to two U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not been made public. The Trump administration is piling new restrictions on Palestinian visa applicants, making it nearly impossible for anyone holding a Palestinian Authority passport to receive the travel documents needed to visit the U.S. for business, work, pleasure or educational purposes. Palestinian applicants who hold non-Palestinian Authority passports also may face difficulties, should they need a U.S. visa. Now, virtually all applications will either be denied or not accepted for processing. The administration is changing how U.S. visas are issued as it cracks down on illegal migration from around the world, but these steps against Palestinians appear more far-reaching that those directed at other nationalities, many of which include exemptions for official travel to the U.S. The U.S. Treasury has sanctioned the Iraqi-Kittitian businessman Waleed al-Samarra'i and firms associated with him, accusing him of smuggling Iranian oil disguised as Iraqi oil through a network of shipping companies and ships. “By targeting Iran's oil revenue stream, Treasury will further degrade the regime's ability to carry out attacks against the United States and its allies,” said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a news release. Survivors of abuse from Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell are meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, putting pressure on Congress to take action to force more disclosure of the evidence in the case. The committee has been conducting an inquiry into how the Justice Department handled Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. Several survivors are also expected to join a rally on Wednesday as well as a news conference with lawmakers who are pushing for legislation that would force the Trump administration to release the case files. The move will reverse a Biden-era decision to keep it at its temporary headquarters in Colorado, according to a person familiar with the announcement. Alabama and Colorado have long battled to claim Space Command because it has significant implications for the local economies. The organization, which has helped pay for PBS, NPR, 1,500 local radio and TV stations as well as programs like “Sesame Street” and “Finding Your Roots,” will be awarded the Governors Award. Trump signed a bill in July canceling about $1.1 billion already approved for public broadcasting, claiming the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense. Previous Governors Award recipients include Jerry Lewis, John Walsh, Bob Hope, Ted Turner, Tyler Perry, “Star Trek,” “American Idol” and Debbie Allen. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., listens as President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer says Democrats “are willing to work in a bipartisan way” to avoid a government shutdown when the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. Republicans will need votes from both parties to pass a short term funding measure while they finish the full package of spending bills, and Democrats will want some concessions to agree. Schumer received blowback from his party in March when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. Schumer's letter to colleagues Tuesday morning said he and Jeffries “are aligned,” and that “Senate Republicans must decide: Stand up for the legislative branch or enable Trump's slide toward authoritarianism.” “That's not just a price tick; it's the market's confession that faith in fiat is wobbling,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Fiat currency is money with value rooted in the trust and authority of the issuing government, rather than a fixed value or an asset like gold or silver. Investors have been shifting away from U.S. Treasuries for years but that shift has accelerated this year due to worries over U.S. government debt, trade tensions and geopolitical risks, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. The S&P 500 sank 1.3% early Tuesday, on track for its worst loss in a month. Trump's challenges to the U.S. Federal Reserve and other institutions have shaken faith in the U.S. dollar, prompting a shift into other investment options such as gold and silver, analysts say. Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco ruled that the Trump administration violated federal law by sending troops to accompany federal agents on immigration raids. California sued, saying the troops sent to Los Angeles over the summer were violating a law that prohibits military enforcement of domestic laws. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump's closest congressional allies, has pushed the president for months to support his sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose steep tariffs on countries fueling Russia's invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports. The legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it, and Republican leaders have so far said they won't move without him. Graham has stepped up his calls after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy last month in hopes of a peace deal. Since then, Russia has continued to step up attacks on Ukraine. “If we don't have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,” Graham said of his bill in an interview with The Associated Press last month. Senators are returning to Washington right where they left off in early August — fighting over Trump's nominees. Exasperated Republicans fled for the month after making little headway as Senate Democrats forced delays in confirmations, angering Trump as many of his administration's positions remain unfilled. Republican leaders called it quits after a rare Saturday session that ended with a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Chuck Schumer could “GO TO HELL!” FILE—A week before Congress returns from recess, armed National Guard soldiers from West Virginia patrol the Mall near the Capitol in Washington, as part of President Donald Trump's order to impose federal law enforcement in the nation's capital, Tuesday, Aug. 26, 2025. Congress is scheduled to return from their August break Tuesday, Sept. 2, 2025, after Labor Day. The most urgent task for Congress is to avoid a government shutdown on Sept. 30, when federal funding runs out. Just how Republicans and Democrats will be able to agree on this remains unclear. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer's vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party. Complicating the negotiations, Republicans rescinded about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump notified Congress that he will block $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid. “Trump is rooting for a shutdown,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on social media Friday. Trump's stepped-up immigration policies have resulted in a loss of 1.2 million immigrants from the nation's labor force from January through July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. New illegal border crossings have plunged as Trump makes good on his campaign promises. Most people detained by ICE for deportation have no criminal convictions. A man charged with trying to assassinate Trump last year in South Florida is set to represent himself during a pretrial conference on Tuesday, as final preparations are made for trial. Barring any delays, jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday in Fort Pierce federal court for the case against Ryan Routh. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon signed off on Routh's request to represent himself in July but said court-appointed attorneys need to remain as standby counsel. The trial will begin nearly a year after prosecutors say a U.S. Secret Service agent thwarted Routh's attempt to shoot Trump as he played golf. Routh, 59, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations. A woman from Peru and her children are detained and escorted to a bus by federal agents following an appearance at immigration court, Monday, June 23, 2025, in San Antonio. Trump's administration has started requiring parents looking to reunite with their children who crossed into the U.S. alone to show up for interviews where immigration officers may question them, according to a policy memo obtained by The Associated Press. Neha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a “built-in opportunity” to arrest parents while the children remain in custody — something she said has already happened.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Looming shutdown battle: Lawmakers return to Capitol Hill today, facing massive fights on government funding, the Jeffrey Epstein files and Trump's policing push. • Judge rules on military in LA: A federal judge ruled that the administration's deployment of troops to Los Angeles violated federal law. It comes as Chicago is bracing for a possible major immigration enforcement surge amid the administration's crackdown on crime. Asked in the Oval Office if he's spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said, “I have learned things that will be very interesting. Trump did not specify what the consequences, if any, would be if a bilateral meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky doesn't end up happening. President Donald Trump said his administration will appeal a decision that shot down many of his sweeping tariffs to the Supreme Court as soon as Wednesday. “We're going to be going to the Supreme Court – we think tomorrow,” Trump said as he spoke with reporters on Tuesday, asserting that a “wrong” decision from the conservative court would mean “devastation for our country.” A federal appeals court on Friday struck down many of Trump's tariffs, saying he unlawfully leaned on emergency powers to impose the import taxes. President Donald Trump said today that he will send National Guard troops into Chicago, but did not provide a timeline. Asked by a reporter at the White House today if he had made up his mind about sending the National Guard into Chicago, Trump responded: “Well we're going. President Donald Trump said he didn't know about conspiracy theories circulating on the internet over the weekend about him being dead. “No, I've been very active actually, over the weekend, I didn't hear that one that's pretty serious,” Trump said Tuesday — his first time publicly addressing reporters in a week. “I knew they were saying, like, ‘Is he okay? Trump said he'd been active over the long Labor Day weekend, during which he went to his Virginia golf course each day, and noted he also did an interview on Friday with the Daily Caller. He also touted his lengthy public appearances last week, including a Cabinet meeting that lasted more than three hours. “Last week, I did numerous news conferences, all successful. Biden wouldn't do them for months,” Trump said. President Donald Trump just announced that US Space Command Headquarters will move to Huntsville, Alabama. “I am thrilled to report that the US Space Command headquarters will move to the beautiful locale of a place called Huntsville, Alabama, forever to be known from this point forward as Rocket City,” he said today at the White House. He said this will create more than 30,000 jobs in the state. Some background: US Space Command, which is a joint command and separate from the US Space Force military branch, is currently housed in Colorado Springs. During Trump's first administration, officials decided to move it to Alabama, and a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2022 found the US Air Force's decision-making process had “significant shortfalls in its transparency and credibility.” Then in 2023, President Joe Biden elected to have it remain in Colorado, angering Alabama lawmakers. Today, Trump thanked Colorado for being the location for the headquarters, and then pointed to what was a “big factor” in this decision. President Donald Trump is making an announcement at the White House. The announcement is Trump's first public comments in a week. What to know: US Space Command is a joint command and separate from the US Space Force military branch. During Trump's first administration, officials decided to move it to Alabama, and a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2022 found the US Air Force's decision-making process had “significant shortfalls in its transparency and credibility.” Then in 2023, President Joe Biden elected to have it remain in Colorado, angering Alabama lawmakers. But prior to today, he had not addressed press at the White House since August 26, when he fielded questions from reporters during a marathon 3 hour and 17 minute public meeting of his cabinet. According to a CNN review of the president's daily guidance, those six days mark the longest stretch Trump hasn't spoken to reporters in public since taking office — though he did sit for an interview with the conservative-leaning Daily Caller during that time. Trump also appeared where reporters could see him during that time, taking trips to his golf course on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday of the holiday weekend, though he did not speak publicly. Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa officially announced that she will not run for reelection in 2026. “It has been an honor to dedicate my life to the service of our great state and country,” she said in a video posted on X. After a tremendous amount of prayer and reflection, I will not be seeking reelection in 2026,” she continued, acknowledging it was “no easy decision.” CNN reported last week that Ernst had decided not to seek reelection to a third term, according to people familiar with the decision — and that Ernst had been wrestling with the decision for months and began telling friends in recent days. The Iowa Republican insisted she's “not slowing down soon” and that she will “keep fighting” to the end of her term. Another longtime lawmaker: Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the dean of the New York congressional delegation, has also decided not to run for reelection next year, his office told CNN yesterday. Elections this November will serve as a measure of the mood of voters 10 months into President Donald Trump's second term as both parties prepare for next year's crucial midterm contests. The electoral tests of partisan enthusiasm come as both parties face challenges: Democrats find themselves balancing frustration with their own party leaders and disapproval of the president's actions while Republicans will try to turn out Trump voters, who are more motivated to show up when the president is on the ballot. Here's a list of the four races to watch this year: Illinois lawmakers are speaking out about federal immigration enforcement in the state and potential National Guard deployment in Chicago amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on crime. This post has been updated with comments from Raoul. House Speaker Mike Johnson is expected to meet with some of Jeffrey Epstein's victims today as Republicans grapple with how to handle growing pressure to act on the issue, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. This vote is largely to give House GOP leadership cover, as the committee does not need a floor vote to continue its investigation. Massie said he was unimpressed with the symbolic vote from leadership, calling it “meaningless.” Massie and Khanna will also hold a news conference tomorrow that will feature people who say they were victims of the late financier and sex offender's trafficking ring. The Trump administration is moving full steam ahead with its agenda as Congress returns from recess. If you're just joining us, these are the top headlines we're reporting so far this morning: President Donald Trump is expected to announce that US Space Command will move its headquarters from Colorado to Alabama during a 2 p.m. US Space Command, which is a joint command and separate from the US Space Force military branch, is currently housed in Colorado Springs. Some background: During Trump's first administration, officials decided to move it to Alabama, and a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2022 found the US Air Force's decision-making process had “significant shortfalls in its transparency and credibility.” Then in 2023, President Joe Biden elected to have it remain in Colorado, angering Alabama lawmakers. Former Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett also chose Huntsville as the preferred location for SPACECOM headquarters in 2021. I remain confident that Alabama is the right place for this mission to take root and thrive.” CNN's Kristin Fisher, Natasha Bertrand, Haley Britzky and Oren Liebermann contributed reporting. We've been hearing this morning from Illinois officials, who've told CNN that ICE has said it will begin operations in the state “later this week.” “We do know that ICE has informed our Illinois State Police department that they are going to begin operations sometime later this week,” Democratic Lt. Gov. “So, we got notice; there's been no direct communication with the governor. The timing of such a push had been confirmed to CNN by sources. For context: Chicago's mayor has pushed back against any ICE surge in his city as part of President Donald Trump's nationwide immigration push. Trump also has vowed to send National Guard troops to quell crime in Illinois' most populous city, as he has done in other cities run by Democrats, including Washington, DC, and Los Angeles. President Donald Trump announced yesterday that he will be awarding his former attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the highest civilian honor. “As President of the United States of America, I am pleased to announce that Rudy Giuliani, the greatest Mayor in the history of New York City, and an equally great American Patriot, will receive THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM, our Country's highest civilian honor. Over the weekend, Giuliani was involved in a car accident in New Hampshire, according to a statement his head of security, Michael Ragusa. Giuliani's vehicle was struck from behind at “high speed” on Saturday evening, Ragusa said in a statement on X. Giuliani was transported to a nearby trauma center “where he was diagnosed with a fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple lacerations and contusions, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg.” President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he will award former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor. A federal judge ruled that President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth violated federal law by using the US military to help carry out law enforcement activities in and around Los Angeles this summer. US District Judge Charles Breyer concluded that Trump's use of thousands of federalized California National Guard members and US Marines to provide protection to federal agents during an aggressive immigration crackdown in the Los Angeles area ran afoul of the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th Century law that generally prohibits the use of troops for domestic law enforcement purposes. “The evidence at trial established that Defendants systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles. President Donald Trump vowed  on social media this morning to make Chicago “safe again” and once again took aim at Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, claiming the governor is unaware of how badly he needs federal assistance. Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet. Chicago will be safe again, and soon,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. According to police data, at least 56 people were shot over Labor Day weekend, seven of them fatally. It comes as Trump has said he is considering extending his federal law enforcement surge and National Guard deployment in Washington, DC, to other major cities, including Chicago, as part of a crackdown on crime. His comments also come amid rising tensions between the Trump administration and Chicago officials, who are bracing for a possible federal immigration enforcement operation expected to begin as early as this week. In a letter to Senate Democrats as Congress returns from recess, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned of a potential government shutdown at the end of the month, blaming Republicans for rejecting a bipartisan approach and calling on the Senate GOP to stand up to President Donald Trump. However, as we near the funding deadline, Republicans are once again threatening to go-at-it-alone — heading our country towards a shutdown and making the health care crisis even worse,” said Schumer, pointing to the Trump administration's announcement that they will use a “pocket rescission” to claw back more foreign aid funds. “Senate Democrats have shown firsthand that we are willing to work in a bipartisan way to keep our government open by advancing bipartisan appropriations bills. However, the Trump administration is waging an all-out war against Congress' Article I authority and the constitutional balance of power,” Schumer added. “Senate Republicans must decide: stand up for the legislative branch or enable Trump's slide toward authoritarianism.” ET today — his first public comments in a week — will be related to the Department of Defense, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN. While he has posted repeatedly on Truth Social and golfed at his Virginia club over the holiday weekend, the president has largely remained behind closed doors in a rare absence. Officials in Chicago are bracing for a major federal immigration enforcement operation that could begin as soon as this week, with the city's mayor signing an order over the weekend aimed at resisting the Trump administration's planned crackdown. JB Pritzker said Sunday such a move would be an “invasion” and that he has had no communication with the Trump administration about reported plans to send National Guard troops to Chicago. “No one in the administration – the president or anybody under him – has called anyone in my administration, or me. So, it's clear that in secret they're planning this – well, it's an invasion with US troops, if they in fact do that,” Pritzker said Sunday.

FOX Business contributor Katrina Campins analyzes the impact of the Fulton County district attorney's personal relationship with Nathan Wade on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' A Georgia state court ordered Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to conduct a new search for records related to her criminal case against President Donald Trump after finding that her search methods were inadequate. The recent order from a Fulton County Superior Court judge stems from a months-long pursuit by the conservative watchdog Judicial Watch to obtain communications between Willis' office and the Jan. 6 select committee, as well as former special counsel Jack Smith's team. The order is the latest setback in the case for Willis after a judge ordered her office in January to pay about $22,000 in legal fees to Judicial Watch, finding that she failed to fully respond to the watchdog's initial open records requests. District Attorney Fani Willis at the Fulton County Courthouse in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 1, 2024. Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, told Fox News Digital his organization has been digging for Willis' communications because he believes the district attorney improperly coordinated with the federal government to charge Trump over the 2020 election. "The lawsuit is about any collusion and collaboration with Congress and the Justice Department, Jack Smith, and we haven't seen the documents, but they show that there has been because their very existence shows that they were talking to them," Fitton said. Asked about why Willis communicating with the Jan. 6 committee or Smith would be out of line, Fitton said the mere existence of the interactions showed Willis' work lacked independence and that her indictment against Trump and 18 others was a "political operation" rather than an "honest, good-faith process." "Look, if Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff are running this investigation, you can be darn sure it's not credible," Fitton said in reference to the former Democratic House speaker and member of the Democrat-led Jan. 6 committee, respectively. The judge said his order was a response to an affidavit by Willis that failed to address searches of key devices belonging to former Fulton County special prosecutor Nathan Wade and chief investigator Michael Hill, both of whom were integral to gathering evidence in the investigation into Trump's alleged subversion of the 2020 election in Georgia. The court raised questions about whether their records had been searched, saying communications may have been overlooked and that Willis must respond within 14 days with a more comprehensive report of her search methods. Former special prosecutor Nathan Wade arrives before Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis speaks after winning the Democratic primary on May 21, 2024, in Buckhead, Georgia. In March 2025, the court ordered Willis to produce 212 pages of records that were belatedly found after Willis' office had initially denied their existence. Willis has faced enormous outside scrutiny from lawyers for the defendants and the Georgia state legislature over her investigation and prosecution of Trump. Willis charged Trump and 18 co-defendants in August 2023 with racketeering and other violations over the 2020 election, but the case was whittled down significantly because of plea deals and dismissed charges. Ultimately, the Georgia Court of Appeals disqualified Willis from the case, finding her private romantic relationship with Wade presented a conflict of interest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The affection drained from our marriage long ago. Now he has dementia, and it's awful. Editor's Note: Is anything ailing, torturing, or nagging at you? Every Tuesday, James Parker tackles readers' questions. Tell him about your lifelong or in-the-moment problems at [email protected]. Don't want to miss a single column? Sign up to get “Dear James” in your inbox. I've been married to my husband for 35 years. I was in love with him during our courtship. He showed interest in me, appeared to enjoy doing things with me, and was affectionate, kind, and communicative. When I told him that I didn't feel loved, he didn't seem to care. He apparently believed that once the courtship and honeymoon were over, he could start behaving like an entitled jerk (my words, not his). I've made attempts to leave, none of which panned out. During my third attempt, about 10 years ago, it became clear to me that my husband was in cognitive decline. I had suspected it for some time, but his behavior as we went over logistics confirmed that he no longer understood what was happening. Now, here I am—the sole caretaker for a husband with full-blown dementia. When I walk into the room, he doesn't look up. We're living on our government pensions and can't afford caretakers. Our mutual social contacts have drifted away. I have made some new women friends, and I still go out for a coffee now and then, but I can't be gone for more than a few hours before my husband's anxiety maxes out. I'm not unkind enough to leave him now, but I am not kind enough to treat him with the love and concern he deserves in his confused state. That's not likely to happen until one of us dies. Is there a way I can curate my feelings and attitude, so I don't cringe when I read books about dementia care, and they keep using the term your loved one—which he has not been to me, nor I to him, for decades? Who renew the routine, repeat the steps, climb back onto the spiral, whether it feels like a joyous practice or a scene from Samuel Beckett's Endgame, or both. I find myself reaching for religious language when I think about what you're doing: You are consecrating yourself to the well-being of another—in some cases, or at some moments, a difficult, intractable, and unable-to-be-grateful other. You are making a liturgy out of the everyday. In your case, is it possible for you to separate the husband who made you so miserable from the man who now relies on your care? Maybe the symptoms of his cognitive decline are inextricable from what seemed to you to be his general self-absorption and thoughtlessness. And you have stepped up with strength and generosity, even if you can't manufacture feelings that aren't there. About those feelings, by the way, you should be experiencing no guilt whatsoever. These books about dementia care that you've been reading—every time you come across the words your loved one, try substituting your huge pain in the ass. Meanwhile, is there anything you can do to take care of yourself? Maybe you start playing Grand Theft Auto. And if you allow yourself a minute or two of unharried consideration, I guarantee that you'll come up with some angles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration will announce on Tuesday that U.S. Space Command will be located in Alabama, reversing a Biden-era decision to keep it at its temporary headquarters in Colorado, according to two people familiar with the announcement. A Pentagon website set up to livestream the remarks describes the event as a “U.S. “The president will be making an exciting announcement related to the Department of Defense,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. Space Command's functions include conducting operations like enabling satellite-based navigation and troop communication and providing warning of missile launches. In this photo released by the U.S. Air Force, Capt. Ryan Vickers stands for a photo to display his new service tapes after taking his oath of office to transfer from the U.S. Air Force to the U.S. Space Force at Al-Udeid Air Base, Qatar, Sept. 1, 2020. Alabama and Colorado have long battled to claim Space Command because it has significant implications for the local economy. The site also has been a political prize, with elected officials from both Alabama and Colorado asserting their state is the better location. Huntsville, Alabama, nicknamed Rocket City, has long been home to the Army's Redstone Arsenal and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. The Army's Space and Missile Defense Command is also located in Huntsville, which drew its nickname because of its role in building the first rockets for the U.S. space program. The city was picked after site visits to six states that compared factors such as infrastructure capacity, community support and costs to the Defense Department. President Donald Trump steps off Air Force One after arriving at Huntsville International airport, Sept. 22, 2017, in Huntsville, Ala. President Donald Trump's administration says U.S. Space Command will be based in Alabama, reversing a Biden-era decision to keep it in Colorado. The announcement was made Wednesday. Then-President Joe Biden in 2023 announced Space Command would be permanently located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which had been serving as its temporary headquarters. Biden's Democratic administration said that keeping the command in Colorado Springs would avoid a disruption in readiness. A review by the Defense Department inspector general was inconclusive and could not determine why Colorado was chosen over Alabama. Trump, a Republican who enjoys deep support in Alabama, had long been expected to move Space Command back to Alabama.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An appeals court has overturned a federal judge's ruling blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from terminating $20 billion in grants for several climate groups. A three-judge U.S. Court of Appeals panel on Tuesday issued a 2-1 ruling in favor of the Trump EPA's efforts to slash billions of dollars in grant money to green groups obligated during former President Joe Biden‘s administration. The District of Columbia Circuit Court judges were Gregory Katsas, Neomi Rao, and Cornelia Pillard, who dissented. They said the plaintiffs were not likely to succeed in their case because it belonged in the Court of Federal Claims, rather than the district court. Circuit Court placed a hold on U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan's ruling that allowed climate groups access to grant money held in Citibank. Climate United CEO Beth Bafford said in a statement: “While we are disappointed by the panel's decision, we stand firm on the merits of our case: EPA unlawfully froze and terminated funds that were legally obligated and disbursed.” “This is another hurdle in our fight to lower energy costs for those who need it most while creating jobs for hardworking Americans, but we will continue to press on for communities across the country that stand to benefit from clean, abundant, and affordable energy. This is not the end of our road,” she added. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has claimed the grant money was improperly distributed by being routed through Citibank. The fund was given $27 billion to help climate projects across the United States, specifically in low-income communities. Zeldin has called the funds “gold bars,” referring to a video last year in which a former EPA employee said the Biden administration was trying to disburse promised funds quickly before the next administration.</p>

President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that Space Command's headquarters would move from Colorado to Alabama — capping off a yearslong fight over where the command should be based. While Space Command has been operating out of Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Trump during his first term pushed for the command's headquarters to go to Huntsville, Alabama. "The U.S. Space Command headquarters will move to the beautiful locale of a place called Huntsville, Alabama, forever to be known from this point forward as Rocket City," Trump told reporters Tuesday. "This will result in more than 30,000 Alabama jobs," Trump said. … Most importantly, this decision will help America defend and dominate the high frontier, as they call it." Speculation that Trump would announce a move to Space Command increased after the agency initially posted a livestream link for Trump's 2 p.m. Eastern announcement Tuesday with a description that the event was related to Space Command's headquarters. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed to Fox News that Tuesday's announcement was related to the Defense Department. The announcement comes as both Colorado and Alabama have been vying to house Space Command, which Trump reestablished in 2019 as a new combatant command to oversee U.S. military space operations and is currently involved in Trump's Golden Dome initiative. "As you know that's going to be a big thing. Everybody wants to be a participant in it. We're going to be having a golden dome that the likes of which nobody's ever seen before…I hope it will also ensure that our technical technological capabilities, of which we're way ahead of anybody else, is nobody close, remain unmatched long into the future." The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital when asked about Space Command's headquarters. Roger Towberman, Space Force and Command Senior Enlisted Leader and CMSgt Roger Towberman, with Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett present President Donald Trump with the official flag of the United States Space Force in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on May 15, 2020. Proponents of keeping Space Command at Colorado's Peterson Space Force Base argue that it would be costly to move the headquarters, given the investment already put into Peterson to accommodate the command there. However, the Air Force concluded in 2021 that Army Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, would be the ideal location for U.S. Space Command. The town is also home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the Army's Space and Missile Defense Command. Meanwhile, a Department of Defense inspector general report released in April could not identify why Colorado was chosen over Alabama. Fox News' Jacqui Heinrich contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Trump announcement ahead: President Donald Trump will make an announcement this afternoon — his first public comments in a week — about the Department of Defense, according to the White House. A source said Trump will announce that Space Command is moving its headquarters. • Looming shutdown battle: Lawmakers return to Capitol Hill today, facing massive fights on government funding, the Jeffrey Epstein files and Trump's policing push. • Judge rules on military in LA: A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of troops to Los Angeles violated federal law. It comes as Chicago is bracing for a possible major immigration enforcement surge amid the administration's crackdown on crime. Elections this November will serve as a measure of the mood of voters 10 months into President Donald Trump's second term as both parties prepare for next year's crucial midterm contests. The electoral tests of partisan enthusiasm come as both parties face challenges: Democrats find themselves balancing frustration with their own party leaders and disapproval of the president's actions while Republicans will try to turn out Trump voters, who are more motivated to show up when the president is on the ballot. Here's a list of the four races to watch this year: Illinois lawmakers are speaking out about federal immigration enforcement in the state and potential National Guard deployment in Chicago amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on crime. House Speaker Mike Johnson is expected to meet with some of Jeffrey Epstein's victims today as Republicans grapple with how to handle growing pressure to act on the issue, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. This vote is largely to give House GOP leadership cover, as the committee does not need a floor vote to continue its investigation. Massie said he was unimpressed with the symbolic vote from leadership, calling it “meaningless.” Massie and Khanna will also hold a news conference tomorrow that will feature people who say they were victims of the late financier and sex offender's trafficking ring. The Trump administration is moving full steam ahead with its agenda as Congress returns from recess. If you're just joining us, these are the top headlines we're reporting so far this morning: President Donald Trump is expected to announce that US Space Command will move its headquarters from Colorado to Alabama during a 2 p.m. US Space Command, which is a joint command and separate from the US Space Force military branch, is currently housed in Colorado Springs. Some background: During Trump's first administration, officials decided to move it to Alabama, and a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2022 found the US Air Force's decision-making process had “significant shortfalls in its transparency and credibility.” Then in 2023, President Joe Biden elected to have it remain in Colorado, angering Alabama lawmakers. Former Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett also chose Huntsville as the preferred location for SPACECOM headquarters in 2021. I remain confident that Alabama is the right place for this mission to take root and thrive.” CNN's Kristin Fisher, Natasha Bertrand, Haley Britzky and Oren Liebermann contributed reporting. We've been hearing this morning from Illinois officials, who've told CNN that ICE has said it will begin operations in the state “later this week.” “We do know that ICE has informed our Illinois State Police department that they are going to begin operations sometime later this week,” Democratic Lt. Gov. “So, we got notice; there's been no direct communication with the governor. The timing of such a push had been confirmed to CNN by sources. For context: Chicago's mayor has pushed back against any ICE surge in his city as part of President Donald Trump's nationwide immigration push. Trump also has vowed to send National Guard troops to quell crime in Illinois' most populous city, as he has done in other cities run by Democrats, including Washington, DC, and Los Angeles. President Donald Trump announced yesterday that he will be awarding his former attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the highest civilian honor. Over the weekend, Giuliani was involved in a car accident in New Hampshire, according to a statement his head of security, Michael Ragusa. Giuliani's vehicle was struck from behind at “high speed” on Saturday evening, Ragusa said in a statement on X. Giuliani was transported to a nearby trauma center “where he was diagnosed with a fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple lacerations and contusions, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg.” President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he will award former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor. A federal judge ruled that President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth violated federal law by using the US military to help carry out law enforcement activities in and around Los Angeles this summer. US District Judge Charles Breyer concluded that Trump's use of thousands of federalized California National Guard members and US Marines to provide protection to federal agents during an aggressive immigration crackdown in the Los Angeles area ran afoul of the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th Century law that generally prohibits the use of troops for domestic law enforcement purposes. President Donald Trump vowed  on social media this morning to make Chicago “safe again” and once again took aim at Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, claiming the governor is unaware of how badly he needs federal assistance. Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet. Chicago will be safe again, and soon,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. According to police data, at least 56 people were shot over Labor Day weekend, seven of them fatally. It comes as Trump has said he is considering extending his federal law enforcement surge and National Guard deployment in Washington, DC, to other major cities, including Chicago, as part of a crackdown on crime. His comments also come amid rising tensions between the Trump administration and Chicago officials, who are bracing for a possible federal immigration enforcement operation expected to begin as early as this week. In a letter to Senate Democrats as Congress returns from recess, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned of a potential government shutdown at the end of the month, blaming Republicans for rejecting a bipartisan approach and calling on the Senate GOP to stand up to President Donald Trump. However, as we near the funding deadline, Republicans are once again threatening to go-at-it-alone — heading our country towards a shutdown and making the health care crisis even worse,” said Schumer, pointing to the Trump administration's announcement that they will use a “pocket rescission” to claw back more foreign aid funds. “Senate Democrats have shown firsthand that we are willing to work in a bipartisan way to keep our government open by advancing bipartisan appropriations bills. However, the Trump administration is waging an all-out war against Congress' Article I authority and the constitutional balance of power,” Schumer added. “Senate Republicans must decide: stand up for the legislative branch or enable Trump's slide toward authoritarianism.” ET today — his first public comments in a week — will be related to the Department of Defense, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN. While he has posted repeatedly on Truth Social and golfed at his Virginia club over the holiday weekend, the president has largely remained behind closed doors in a rare absence. Officials in Chicago are bracing for a major federal immigration enforcement operation that could begin as soon as this week, with the city's mayor signing an order over the weekend aimed at resisting the Trump administration's planned crackdown. JB Pritzker said Sunday such a move would be an “invasion” and that he has had no communication with the Trump administration about reported plans to send National Guard troops to Chicago. So, it's clear that in secret they're planning this – well, it's an invasion with US troops, if they in fact do that,” Pritzker said Sunday. Officials in Chicago are bracing for a major federal immigration enforcement operation that could begin as soon as this week, with the city's mayor signing an order over the weekend aimed at resisting the Trump administration's planned crackdown. President Donald Trump is preparing to effectively dare Democrats to shut down the government in a matter of weeks, taking a hard line against any major concessions ahead of negotiations over a must-pass funding bill. The White House plans to reject any Democratic demands that key health provisions in the GOP's domestic policy law be reversed as part of a budget package, aides said. It will also insist on retaining Trump's authority to claw back funding at will — seeking to cement an extraordinary expansion of executive power that has already roiled lawmakers in both parties. “We're not going to accept any limitations on the president's authorities or attempts to reverse President Trump's policies,” a senior White House official told CNN. The strategy is aimed at pressuring Democratic leaders, who are balancing efforts to avert a damaging shutdown with demands from their base to mount a stronger fight against Trump. Yet Democratic leaders are already telegraphing publicly and privately that they will not accept a status-quo funding deal without major concessions from Trump. They've signaled they want the White House to restore some of the billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid and rural hospital funding that was passed as part of the president's signature domestic policy law — in addition to accepting checks on his power to override Congress' spending decisions. As we've been reporting, President Donald Trump is due to make an announcement at the White House from 2 p.m. Trump made 26 public engagements last month — most recently, a three-plus-hour Cabinet meeting last Tuesday where the president fielded questions on topics from Taylor Swift's engagement to global conflicts. So it was certainly unusual when, for three weekdays at the end of August, Trump's public schedule went uncharacteristically dark. There were no events on his schedule last Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, and the president spent his Labor Day weekend in Washington also with no public appearances scheduled. But on Saturday, the president emerged, spotted by pool reporters in a white polo, black pants, and signature red “Make America Great Again” hat on the way to his Virginia golf club. He returned to his club on Sunday — posting an undated photo of himself seated in a golf cart during a matchup with former football coach-turned-Barstool Sports personality Jon Gruden — and again Monday. President Donald Trump is due to make an announcement today, from the Oval Office, at 2 p.m. Elsewhere, lawmakers will return to Capitol Hill following the August recess braced for a politically bruising fall, with massive fights upcoming on government funding, the Jeffrey Epstein files and Trump's policing push. After a summer of simmering tensions on Trump's nationwide deportations, National Guard deployment in Washington, DC, and a string of high-profile firings, Democrats are ready to fight back. Republicans and Democrats are already entering a high-stakes funding standoff ahead of a September 30 funding deadline, which marks Congress' first bout of bipartisan dealmaking in months.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We understand that over the past 250-odd years, you have come to rely on the services provided by the U.S. of A.: postal delivery, representative government, edible food, clean water, lifesaving vaccines, and no kings—ever, guaranteed. Some of these features arrived pretty late for some of you, and for that, we used to be sorry. We were so excited to reach 340 million free users. But now it's time to streamline our product so that it appeals more to paid subscribers, and that means some changes for everyone else. We are adding a lot of features no one asked for that will make your experience worse and also cost a lot of money! Nor is it, exactly, the freedom you've been used to! Yes, that is the National Guard in your city. We know that you didn't request it; it's just a new feature we're rolling out, possibly for 30 days, possibly for even longer! You were pretty vocal about what attracted you to America in the first place: personal liberty, economic opportunity, something called the American dream, and, of course, the perennial threat of gun violence. We offered you many opportunities to opt out.) But we knew what was really keeping you here: inertia, and the challenge of finding an alternative that sells decent breakfast burritos. We are banking on that going forward. We hope the difficulty of switching to another provider will keep you here while we slowly remove all the features that you came for and replace them with AI-generated slop. We are also changing a lot of our graphic design to extract any remaining soul from our product. (We saw how well that went for Cracker Barrel!) Instead of a Nice, Friendly Place Where You Can Work Hard and Have a Better Life, we're now That Place With More Than 60,000 People Currently in ICE Detention. Sydney Sweeney's jeans are running the Department of Homeland Security. Our new CEO does hate a large portion of our current user base, but he's not totally ignorant of the culture here. He is very excited to bring back some things that past users described as “great,” such as Depression, Recession, and White-Shark Attacks. It was also his brilliant idea to add the features of autocracy—State Control of Business, General Encouragement of Groveling, Masked Men Who Yank Your Neighbors Into an Unmarked Van to Whisk Them Off to a Gulag—to our core democratic product. You heard it right: The government you knew for Weather Data and Medical Research is going all in on Despot Whims. This costs money, so bedrock features such as Separation of Powers, No Troop Quartering, and Due Process are being phased out, even for premium subscribers. But you can have a career in ICE. We are retaining some features for premium users. The right to run your company without government interference? An explanation from the Supreme Court as to why it just ruled against you? You all know the classic process of enshittification, as coined by Cory Doctorow, from your experience with the tech products that touch every aspect of your life. First, you have a product that everyone enjoys, and then, when someone decides that that product needs to make a profit, everything about it gets gradually worse and worse until the whole thing is ruined. This is why, whenever you open America's homepage, an unwanted video starts to play. Instead of the medical recommendation you were looking for, there is a man with one weird trick, whom doctors hate! (He is the health and human services secretary!) All of the articles are now written by AI, except Article I, which has disappeared entirely. Tariffs, a share of Intel, and a weirdly conciliatory attitude toward Russian President Vladimir Putin are now the default for all users. Also, everything that used to be free now isn't: speech, assembly, and petition, to name just three. Eggs now cost $800—both because they are very expensive to produce and because we are trying to make the dollar worthless. We have gotten rid of the people responsible for making gradual improvements to America, and our new team wants to see exponential profits for shareholders. It's unclear who these shareholders are, exactly! We thought all of us were, but it might just be our CEO? The executive mansion definitely seems fancier than we remember, and he has a new private plane. You can still keep using America, and depending on your version, it may remain functional for some length of time. Please hand $5,000,000 in unmarked bills to our CEO.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Scientists are looking for the “dark matter” of the animal kingdom — and it's revealing how little we know about life on our planet. It's easy to assume, as many people do, that our planet is well explored. They estimate that for every species we've discovered, there are likely at least another nine or so that remain undiscovered or unidentified, meaning around 90 percent of life on Earth is unknown. The unknown is made up of small organisms, such as insects, mites, and crustaceans. And most of them have yet to be identified. This is especially remarkable given that the total number of described species across the entire animal kingdom is somewhere around 2 million. Biologists call animals like this dark taxa, a term that refers to groups of organisms in which the bulk of species are undescribed or undiscovered. Some taxonomists have also called them biology's dark matter. “Most people think that life on Earth is described, and we have a good idea of how ecosystems are functioning,” said Emily Hartop, a fly researcher and taxonomist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, who studies dark taxa. “The reality is that for most species on Earth, we don't know what they are, we don't know where they are, we don't know what they're doing. Scientists who study dark taxa argue that lifting the shadow on these organisms is essential to our own survival. If we don't know what constitutes our ecosystems, we risk killing off the key players that make them function — or failing to detect a potential threat, such as a disease-carrying insect that could set off the next global pandemic. “The little things run the planet,” said Rudolf Meier, a researcher at Berlin's Museum of Natural History and Humboldt University of Berlin who also studies dark taxa. But filling these gaps is an enormous task and, until recently, considered nearly impossible. The challenge comes down to process: How do you identify millions upon millions of species that are tiny, often look the same, and lack the traditional sort of charisma that funds expeditions? A little over a decade ago, when Hartop was living in Los Angeles, she and her colleagues set up bug traps in backyards across the city. They were mesh tents with openings, known as Malaise traps. Forty-three of those species were new to science and had never been described before. When scientists look for dark taxa, they seem to find new species everywhere. All but four or five were unknown to science. When researchers went looking for wasps in Costa Rica that parasitize other insects, they found 416 species. More than 400 of them hadn't been described yet. Why have these organisms been overlooked for so long? One reason is that they're typically small, often measuring less than 5 millimeters, Meier said. That makes them harder to notice — and less exciting by traditional standards. “Funders are much more likely to give you money for birds and butterflies, because that's something that a funder, who is not a biologist, finds much more relatable,” Meier told me. But a far bigger obstacle is that these groups of life are extremely diverse. Meanwhile, there could be 1 million species of scuttle flies globally, Hartop said. While trapping bugs in tents is easy, it's much harder to identify them and demonstrate that they're different from other species that have already been described. For hundreds of years, scientists have largely categorized animals by their appearance. Scientists use these distinctions in form to separate animals by species, typically defined as organisms that reproduce with each other but not with other animal groups. While distinguishing these animals by appearance is often possible, it typically requires an enormous amount of time and expertise; scientists literally have to look at them one by one through a microscope. Plus, looks can be deceiving: A bunch of, say, black-and-blue butterflies might appear identical but come from different genetic lineages that make them distinct species. In the 1970s, scientists figured out how to sequence part of an organism's DNA, producing a string of letters that corresponds to its genes. They later discovered that they could use just a small snippet of that sequence to tell one species apart from another. In 2003, a Canadian biologist named Paul Hebert dubbed those snippets “barcodes” because they serve as unique species IDs, akin to barcodes on cereal boxes in the grocery store. DNA sequencing is now so advanced that taxonomists — those who classify life — can barcode thousands of specimens at one time. It's this approach that's helping illuminate dark taxa: Researchers can collect scores of specimens from the field, sequence portions of their DNA, and then upload those bits of code to an existing database to see if they match known species. Even with modern DNA sequencing, identifying unknown life is, to be clear, still very hard. (The world of taxonomy is full of drama about the species-naming process and how much evidence scientists should be required to provide. There's also a debate about whether formally naming species actually matters if they already have unique DNA sequences that identify them.) Nonetheless, modern DNA sequencing has massively sped up the process for discovering and identifying life. It's pretty extraordinary: Even though we've known about the most visible species around us for hundreds of years, only now are we in the Golden Age of species discovery. “It's unbelievable,” said Hebert, a professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario who oversees the Center for Biodiversity Genomics, a DNA-barcoding research center. While there are no reliable estimates for the total number of species on Earth, it's likely in the tens of millions. And again, only around 2 million are formally described, Hebert said. Before modern sequencing became a reality, identifying all life on Earth would have taken hundreds, if not thousands, of years and likely would have cost trillions of dollars. Now, some scientists are confident that they can do it in a matter of decades or even years. In 2005, Hebert launched a project with his colleague Sujeevan Ratnasingham that is essentially trying to collect DNA data for every animal on Earth. So far, the project — known as Barcode of Life — has sequences for roughly 1.5 million species, Hebert said, though many of those are not formally described. To barcode the rest would require no more than $1 billion, he told me confidently. That money would help fund expeditions and DNA sequencing around the world. “We want barcode records for every species,” Hebert said. “If I can persuade the world to support this with about $1 billion, which is trivial, we can complete the inventory of animal life by 2040 — I am certain.” Just as we monitor the weather for looming disasters, complete inventories of animal life could allow scientists to monitor biodiversity — both the obvious and obscure stuff — to see how our ecosystems are changing and what that means for us. Are the insect larvae that make our soils fertile in decline? But there's also a more noble reason to discover life, he says. “This is the planet we live on,” Hebert said. You only get to do it once: discover life on our planet.” It probably has nothing to do with saving animals. Herds in North America will likely be hit the hardest. Inside the years-long quest to catch a sea star killer. These (literal) thirst traps are helping wild animals beat the heat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump‘s desire to force the sale of the Chinese-owned app TikTok has fallen victim to his own agenda, with a deal remaining out of reach as his administration prioritizes trade negotiations with Beijing. Since entering office, Trump has extended the deadline three times for TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest to American buyers or cease operating in the United States. Trump all but told reporters earlier this month at the White House that he'd keep extending the deadline until a deal for TikTok's sale could be agreed to by his administration and China. “I'm a fan of TikTok,” the president mused. Trump's words haven't gone unnoticed, and TikTok executives now believe that they've successfully avoided a ban in the U.S., according to James Lewis, senior adviser for economic security and technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “TikTok has become a hostage to the trade negotiations,” Lewis told the Washington Examiner in an interview, referencing Trump's prolonged tariff negotiations with Beijing. In April, the president's implementation of gargantuan new import taxes on Chinese goods scuttled a deal brokered by Vice President JD Vance, Trump's lead negotiator on the topic, that had received initial approval from Beijing. However, Lewis suggested that the current trade status quo gives TikTok itself a chance to breathe easily. They don't think they're facing any risk, and I know that because I bumped into a senior TikTok executive,” he explained. “He thought things are going really well, so TikTok thinks they've dodged a bullet.” The structure would see TikTok's U.S. operations folded into a new company majority-owned and wholly operated by U.S. investors. “The data privacy risks TikTok presented before President Trump took office haven't just magically disappeared,” one former aide stated forcefully. “My biggest concern has to do with the biometric and face recognition data that TikTok actively tricks users into handing over,” a second former Trump official added. Positive stories about the U.S. get a lower priority. “If the negotiations go well, TikTok is safe. If it doesn't work out, you know, [Trump] may do something to them, so you can see it makes a lot of sense to hold TikTok as a bargaining chip,” Lewis concluded. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick gave a sharper assessment, putting a little bit of daylight between himself and the president by telling CNBC during a recent interview that, should Beijing not agree to terms, “then TikTok is going to go dark.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>State and local police officers are signing up to assist President Donald Trump‘s mass deportation at a rapid pace, the Washington Examiner has learned, in a dramatic turnaround from the Biden administration. That is up from 135 when President Donald Trump took office in January. “DHS has secured 896 signed agreements with state and local partnerships under this program, and we will continue to build on that number despite baseless lawsuits like this.” Austin Kocher, an immigration trends analyst and professor at Syracuse University in New York, wrote in a recent report that the shift under Trump shows “massive growth.” When Trump took office in 2017, 35 agreements were in place, according to the America First Policy Institute, an organization created to support Trump's America First agenda. Trump ramped up the program in his first term to 150 agreements. States and cities can choose to turn over illegal immigrants in jail to ICE, assist ICE with arrests in the community, and team up on task forces. States such as Florida have been at the forefront of the state effort to get state police and local officers deputized to help ICE. Since the state deputized a portion of the Florida Highway Patrol to help out in March, state troopers have encountered roughly 3,600 illegal immigrants at traffic stops and turned them over to federal authorities, a state official told the Washington Examiner this week. The Trump administration obtained significant funding to reimburse state and local police for helping ICE. “Additionally, more than $500 million from President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill will go to increasing our 287(g) partnerships with state and local law enforcement,” a DHS spokesperson told the Washington Examiner. Some have criticized the use of local and state police for federal work. The American Immigration Council, an organization in Washington that advocates for immigrants regardless of legal status, stated in a recent report that two Justice Department investigations have found a “pattern and practice of constitutional violations” against Latinos. They are an expensive use of taxpayer money,” AIC wrote in the report. “ICE also provides insufficient supervision of local law enforcement agencies. But most egregiously, they have resulted in the widespread racial profiling of brown and Black communities.” The Trump administration has not given an estimate for how long it expects it will take the federal government to arrest and deport possibly millions of illegal immigrants.</p>
