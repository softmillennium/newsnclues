                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Pegula defeated Barbora Krejcikova in straight sets to reach her second straight US Open semifinal -- and last year's runner-up has only conceded 23 games in the tournament so far. Twelve months after breaking through the Grand Slam quarterfinal barrier at the US Open, Jessica Pegula has done it again. 4 seed and last year's runner-up reached the second major semifinal of her career with a 6-3, 6-3 defeat of Barbora Krejcikova in 1 hour and 26 minutes. Pegula, 31, becomes just the second player among those who began their career in the Open Era to reach her first two Grand Slam semifinals after turning 30. She follows Flavia Pennetta, who made the 2013 US Open semifinals aged 31 and then became the champion in New York two years later. Krejcikova had won the pair's last two meetings, at Dubai 2023 and the WTA Finals Riyadh 2024, but Pegula has been the victor both times they have met at Grand Slams -- back in 2023, she was a 7-5, 6-2 winner in the Australian Open fourth round. Pegula and Krejcikova had come through contrasting paths to the last eight. 62 due to her six-month injury layoff this year, had pulled off three-set comebacks in her last two matches against Emma Navarro and Taylor Townsend. In the latter, which ran 3 hours and 4 minutes, she saved eight match points -- the most of any player in a Grand Slam this year. Quick starts in both sets: The two players came out of the blocks in contrasting fashion, encapsulated by Krejcikova's first service game. It began by Pegula crunching two forehand winners, which were followed by Krejcikova airing a smash and then double faulting to get broken. Krejcikova fended off a point to go down 4-0 and another to go down 5-1, and was rewarded by getting back on serve at 4-3. Title chase is 🔛Last year's runner-up Pegula takes down Krejcikova in straights! Tired-looking errors and double faults meant that Krejcikova quickly fell behind 4-1 in the second set too. Once again, she found flashes of brilliance -- a chipped drop shot return that foiled Pegula completely -- to claw back one of the breaks and reduce the deficit to 4-3. Krejcikova finished with 24 unforced errors, including seven double faults, to only 14 winners. I've been having some very good, quick serves, and I really wanted to do that today, especially against someone like her who's very dangerous. Even at the end there, it got really tight -- she had a couple really good returns when I was serving at 4-1, and we all saw what she did against Taylor ... so yeah, I was happy that we're done." Jessica Pegula defeated Barbora Krejcikova in straight sets to reach her second straight US Open semifinal -- and last year's runner-up has only conceded 23 games in the tournament so far.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venus Williams, partnering with Leylah Fernandez in the US Open doubles draw, has invited Serena to sit in their box and coach. Venus Williams called her sister out and requested her presence in New York after reaching the quarterfinals of the US Open doubles draw, alongside partner Leylah Fernandez, on Monday. "She's given us advice, and we just need her in the box," the 45-year-old icon said in her on-court interview after the pair's impressive 6-3, 6-4 win over 12th-seeded Ekaterina Alexandrova and Zhang Shuai. "So my message is, 'Serena you need to show up.'" Asked later what kind of advice the 23-time Grand Slam singles champ had for her sister -- whom she won 14 major doubles titles with, don't forget -- Venus said Serena is a motivator, and she can hardly contain her nervousness watching them on TV. They're all at home, just really on our side." But if Serena is going to coach them, Venus prefers that she do so in Queens, not from a distance. "If she came, it would be a dream for both of us, and we'd have her on the court coaching," Venus said. It's been quite an interesting tournament for Williams, who lost in the revamped mixed doubles event before dropping her first-round match to now-quarterfinalist Karolina Muchova. But Williams decided to stick around in New York a bit longer, accepting a wild card into the doubles draw with Fernandez. They've torn the house down in Louis Armstrong Stadium since playing their first match last Thursday, winning three straight without dropping a set and becoming one of the more delightful stories of the tournament. But they're much more than just a nice story; they're a legitimate threat to win it all. We all know about Venus' doubles pedigree, and Fernandez -- a former US Open singles finalist in Flushing Meadows -- is also a former French Open doubles finalist. They'll face their stiffest test on Tuesday, again in Louis Armstrong Stadium (their happy place), against the top-ranked doubles players in the world, Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova. Hopefully Serena will be in the house to give them an extra boost. Venus Williams, partnering with Leylah Fernandez in the US Open doubles draw, has invited Serena to sit in their box and coach.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK -- Naomi Osaka has nothing but love for Coco Gauff, and she was effusive in her praise for the World No. 3 after defeating her in straight sets on Monday to advance to the quarterfinals of the US Open. "I think the way she conducts herself, it's really special. A post shared by US Open (@usopen) It's high praise from the four-time Grand Slam champion, who has been open about her mental health struggles over the course of her career. Gauff, too, has been honest and forthright about her feelings and struggles, relatable qualities that have helped her become one of the most popular athletes in the world. In her post-match press conference, the reigning French Open champion wasn't shy about her disappointment in exiting this tournament earlier than expected, but she's optimistic about her improved serve. She's also trying to focus on the positives, which isn't always easy when expectations are sky high. Then hearing their perspectives and everything, it definitely is a lot of positive things. So I think where my serve started from the start of the tournament to today was a big improvement." Osaka, back in the quarterfinals of a Slam for the first time since the 2021 Australian Open (which she won), appears locked in and is starting to emerge as a legitimate contender to win her third US Open. But the 27-year-old is trying to embrace and appreciate the moment, and not put too much pressure on herself. "What I want to take away from this tournament is just smiling and having fun," the World No. "I know in my first round I was too nervous to smile, and my match against [Daria] Kasatkina was just really not smiley at all. "Going into this match, I just wanted to be grateful. Osaka will certainly be having fun in her next match, against one of the most talented players on the Hologic WTA Tour in Karolina Muchova, who's reached back-to-back semifinals in Flushing. As we head into the quarterfinals, history is on Osaka's side: Every time she's made the final eight of a Grand Slam, she's won it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Karolina Muchova, Barbora Krejcikova and Marketa Vondrousova have made history for the Czech Republic at the US Open. But the only fourth-round match scheduled out on Grandstand delivered tension, quality and history as No. All three booked their places there via fourth-round barnburners. Muchova's win followed Barbora Krejcikova saving eight match points to end Taylor Townsend's run 1-6, 7-6(13), 6-3 and Marketa Vondrousova's 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 masterclass over Elena Rybakina on Sunday. Three Czechs have reached the last eight of a single major once previously -- at Wimbledon 2014, where champion Petra Kvitova defeated her compatriots Lucie Safarova in the semifinals and Barbora Strycova in the quarterfinals. Muchova's run is her third in a row to the US Open quarterfinals -- she was a semifinalist in both 2023 and 2024. Krejcikova and Vondrousova are back at this stage for a second time each, having been quarterfinalists in 2021 and 2023 respectively. "Three of us in the quarters, it's nice for our country," Muchova said afterwards. Obviously with Marketa, we are from the same club, so I know her a little better than Bara. But with both of them, nice relationship, we support each other." "I wouldn't really say it's a system," she told press. "For me personally, I was practicing most of the time in my hometown, always found myself a coach and built my team. I think for most of us, it was this way. "I wouldn't say it was the system for me, but it was nice that we had a lot of tournaments that we could compete against each other in the Czech Republic. So that would be probably the one thing that I will tell you is great in Czech Republic." The careers of all three have been marked by remarkable highs, when they're healthy enough for their talent to flow, punctuated by long periods on the sidelines and rankings that have yo-yoed from inside the Top 10 to outside the Top 100. At the age of 26, Vondrousova has only played a full season twice (2021, when she was the silver medallist at the Tokyo Olympic Games, and 2023, when she won Wimbledon). Muchova, 29, the 2022 Roland Garros finalist, has not played a full season since 2019, and this year was forced to temporarily play with a one-handed backhand due to a left wrist issue. Two-time major champion Krejcikova and Vondrousova have both been on the comeback trail yet again this year -- Krejcikova was sidelined for the first half of 2025 by a back injury, while Vondrousova underwent shoulder surgery last August. But quality tends to shine through regardless of ranking number -- and while the low-key trio may slip out of the spotlight during their absences from the game, they've shown this fortnight that they should never be overlooked. And there's still more history that could be made at Flushing Meadows. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka and Krejcikova faces No. 4 seed Jessica Pegula; on Wednesday, Muchova will play No. In the Open Era, two Czechs have reached the semifinals of a Grand Slam on three previous occasions: Roland Garros 1986 (Hana Mandlikova and Helena Sukova, representing the former Czechoslovakia), Wimbledon 2014 (Kvitova and Safarova) and the Australian Open 2019 (Kvitova and Karolina Pliskova). If Vondrousova, Krejcikova and Muchova all win their quarterfinals this week, it would be the first time in history that three Czechs have made the semifinals of a Grand Slam tournament. Karolina Muchova, Barbora Krejcikova and Marketa Vondrousova have made history for the Czech Republic at the US Open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Throughout the season, Carlos Alcaraz has made clear how much he enjoys golf. At the US Open, the Spaniard has even tied a bow on his victories by shadowing his golf swing. When Lehecka is back home and has a free afternoon, he will put on Golf Channel and check out the action. The Czech is a fan of Bryson DeChambeau and was “very happy” when Rory McIlroy won The Masters. His game might not measure up to the most experienced golfers among his fellow tennis players, though. For me, the biggest challenge still is to have the ball flying straight, so that's something I'm focusing on right now,” Lehecka said. It's relaxing and at the same time, some extra motivation and I like to watch it on TV.” One day Lehecka was scrolling Instagram when he saw a recent press conference answer Scheffler gave in which the American discussed what fulfills him most completely. Winning means a lot to him because of all he has put into becoming as good as he is at the sport. But ultimately, Scheffler is more fulfilled by supporting his family than lifting trophies. “It's such an interesting thing to hear. At the same time, Lehecka believes this does not only apply to when things are not going well. It is a consistent mindset he would like to maintain. “In the end, it's just something that we all do. But there are more important things than sport in the world. I think that's something we will all agree on, and I like that he said it out loud.” An important part of his life is his girlfriend, Lucie Neumannova, who played tennis growing up and is now a track athlete, who often pushes Lehecka to stay on top of his sleep and recovery. “She knows everything about the sport and at the same time, as she moved to track right after, it's such an inspiration to see the other approaches to different sports,” Lehecka said. So sometimes it's funny that she kind of pushes me towards doing things better than I'm doing.” According to his longtime coach, Michal Navratil, the Czech, at a career-high World No. 21, has improved not only physically since that run. “Jiri was always the guy who had solid technique, I would say. The power was always in him,” Navratil said. Alcaraz leads Lehecka 2-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, but the 23-year-old Czech will take confidence from his victory against the Spaniard earlier this year in Doha. “Jiri is dangerous and these matches that of course he already played with Carlos can help him for the match,” said Navratil, who added that the more Lehecka competes against the best players, he is not as fearful when playing them. “This is also the most important thing, because when you have a big respect, then of course, it's hard to manage it. But if you understand these guys are playable and you can do it, then it's easier, because, [as] I've been trying to explain him, everybody's beatable.” No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have created a scintillating Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry and the stars have been battling for No. But when asked what kids could learn from their rivalry, Sinner explained Monday evening that being opponents in big matches does not mean they need to be enemies. “I think that we have a good friendship also off the court. It's something great to see,” Sinner said. “We see that this is possible, it's not like you have to be enemies also off the court. After the handshake, everything is fine again.” You May Also Like: Sinner's Bublik beatdown ties his most one-sided Slam win Alcaraz loves playing golf, Sinner has his own hobbies. They just happen to be competing for some of the biggest prizes in the sport. “In the same time, we practise very hard. We have the team which supports us, [those people are] very honest with us,” Sinner said. “But I think many players are like this. Tennis is very important, and it depends also how much you are able to sacrifice for the sport because you have to. “But yeah, I think one thing is to be a good tennis player; the other one is to be a good person. Sinner and Alcaraz are both in the US Open quarter-finals and are two matches away from another tantalising clash. The Italian was ruthless Monday evening, defeating in-form Kazakhstani Alexander Bublik for the loss of just three games. “We don't have to forget that he had a five-set match and it finished very late against Tommy [Paul], a different player. Maybe I have a day where things don't work, and then I lose easy. 1 will prepare for the first all-Italian men's singles quarter-final at a major against Lorenzo Musetti. Pressure has always been there,” Sinner said with a smile. It's a bit different when you play the same, or from me being Italian playing against another Italian, they are always a bit different matches. “He has struggled a bit, you know, during the season, but now he finds himself in an amazing form and shape. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Didn't matter in the slightest on Monday.ByPeter BodoPublished Sep 02, 2025 copy_link NEW YORK—As exciting as it is to watch two wonderful, near-perfect players square off against each other on a grand occasion, there's also a lot to be said for matches featuring have-nots—struggling or flawed players hoping to right a listing ship, or a career that has hit some obstacle and ground to a halt.Labor Day at the US Open brought us an intriguing fourth-round clash to get the ball rolling on Arthur Ashe Stadium, featuring two players in the latter category: Andrey Rublev, the mercurial 27-year old Russian ranked No. 27-ranked Felix Auger-Aliassime.Rublev often gets into Grand Slam quarterfinals, only to stall there with startling regularity: his 0-10 record is an Open Era record. Auger-Aliassime, the Montreal native who exploded on the scene at age 21 in 2021, hit his peak ranking (No. But since then he's faded from relevance and is now trying to re-ignite his career.Consider FAA en fuego. He buried Rublev on Monday in a blizzard of forehands and blazing serves, winning in just two hours and 16 minutes, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4. Some of his first serves broke the 130 MPH barrier. He also made 15 more errors (33-18) than Rublev, but that was mostly a testament to the degree of command FAA imposed on the fracas..“It was a good win considering our head-to-head (Rublev led going in, 7-1) ,considering how good he is as a player,” Auger-Aliassime said. From that moment on I felt like I was putting a lot of pressure on him.” Labor Day at the US Open brought us an intriguing fourth-round clash to get the ball rolling on Arthur Ashe Stadium, featuring two players in the latter category: Andrey Rublev, the mercurial 27-year old Russian ranked No. 27-ranked Felix Auger-Aliassime.Rublev often gets into Grand Slam quarterfinals, only to stall there with startling regularity: his 0-10 record is an Open Era record.

From that moment on I felt like I was putting a lot of pressure on him.” The result was an eye-opener, considering that on paper Rublev was the heavy favorite thanks to that head-to-head advantage. But four of their most recent matches were bitter, protracted battles. And this latest one offered a choice, additional prize: the winner would get a quarterfinal berth in a decimated portion of the draw, with only No. Granted, he was enjoying an exceptional day. But even at the best of times, not many players can take the racquet out of Rublev's hands and so suppress his explosive shots. As Sam Querrey said on air, in response to an observation by his boothmate, “Rublev has never hit a slice in his life. He's going to hit hard from either side, every point. If your serve is off and you put the ball right in the pocket he's going to make you pay. ”The problem for Rublev was that he could not make FAA pay, because you must be able to get to the ball to take a good whack at it. This performance was a reminder of Auger-Aliassime's powers at the breakout stage of his career, as well as a demonstration of his mighty forehand.“Well, [the forehand] has always been my strength and my instinct growing up was to have the match be in my hands,” Auger-Aliassime said. I would miss plenty as a kid, and then I had to kind of know how to use it well, and to be precise and consistent. It was a revelation to watch FAA striking the ball.

This was an impressive bit of self-knowledge, because anyone watching the match could see that while FAA was clocking those forehands, he wasn't doing it with full cuts or going for broke, and he wasn't trying to clean lines.. The shot was artfully modulated, and deadly.“At the start I missed a few, I spread a few kind of far [wide], but then I believed that it was just a question of time that I'm going to start hitting my targets,” he said. “Once I did, it became very difficult for him.”Auger-Aliassime is a self-contained young man, not given to great expressions of feeling or reflecting on his past. He seems to have a strong sense of privacy. He pulled off a great upset in the previous round, eliminating No. But when reporters prodded him to extol the wonders of New York, and why it's so “special” to play here, he declined to play ball.“Well, New York and Australia, the hard courts, obviously for me I think they're better. I think that's one of the reasons. And then, I don't know, what else?

He won the first two sets of his second-round match with Alejandro Davidovich Fokina at the Australian Open, only to go down in five. At Roland Garros, he allowed another two-set lead slip away, this time to Matteo Arnaldi. And at Wimbledon, on a surface that could not be more suited to his monstrous serves and forehands, he bowed out in four sets in round two to No. But basic maturity may be the most overlooked essential in a young player's development. One minute, Auger-Aliassime was just this nice, polite kid from Quebec, and the next he was the Next Big Thing in tennis, walking the red carpet with the stars at New York's Met Gala (to his credit, though, he wore a simple tuxedo). Such transitions can be confusing, and distracting.“Throughout the years I still had good moments,” Auger-Aliassime said. But for sure there were months where I was thinking, ‘Okay, what's my approach tactically with my game?' Once I got the physical (injuries) things kind of sorted out, it was like, ‘Okay, now I'm healthy again. But basic maturity may be the most overlooked essential in a young player's development.

When he double faulted, his run of service holds came to an immediate end. With each passing game in the first set, Bublik lost a little more belief, and a little more of his will to try to seriously compete with Sinner. He threw a half-hearted drop shot into the net to go down 0-4. At set point, he served up another half-hearted dropper and watched as Sinner knocked it off for an easy winner.The next two sets went much like the first. In the third, he was broken in his first service game yet again, when Sinner sent a forehand pass by him. Sinner would hit two more running passes, each more perfectly measured than the last, to go up 4-0.“I broke him very early in every set, which gave me the confidence to serve a little better,” said Sinner, who faced just one break point and won 81 percent of his first-serve points.“So much energy here,” he said of Ashe, where he was making his night debut this year.

Normally something close to a serve-bot, he hit just two aces and committed 13 double faults. He won only 19 percent of points on his second serve, and hit 13 winners against 31 errors.Bublik, smiling at his own futility, managed to treat the packed house to a few reflex return winners down the stretch. The fans roared in hope, but their cheers only served to show how much more they wanted from this match, and how little they got. In the end, Bublik managed just three breadsticks, in a 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 defeat.When they shook hands, a still-smiling Bublik told Sinner, “I'm not bad.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venus Williams gave Louis Armstrong Stadium a jolt in the final game. The finish came a few points later, briefly interrupted by a rush of kids who spilled into the front row on match point, waving Sharpies and programs in Williams' direction. It ended with a 6-3, 6-4 win over No.12 seeds Ekaterina Alexandrova and Zhang Shuai, a 74-minute victory built on four breaks of serve and the steady pressure of a righty-lefty pairing that complemented each other all match -- sometimes both at the net, sometimes one setting up the other. Together, they handed Alexandrova her second defeat of the day after a singles loss to Iga Swiatek. For Williams, 45, this was her first major quarterfinal of any kind since 2017. “There's not a lot of strategy talk,” Fernandez said on court afterward. She paused, then turned toward her partner: “Seeing you on the court with that same big smile … it's so inspirational. Williams saved her last words for the crowd that had been with them all match. “Whenever we have a moment when it's not going perfect, you guys bring us up,” she told them. Venus Williams, 45, and Leylah Fernandez, 22, looked like a natural fit as they dismissed Ekaterina Alexandrova and Zhang Shuai 6-3, 6-4 to reach the quarterfinals of the US Open.</p>
