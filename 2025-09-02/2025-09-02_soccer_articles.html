                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Josh Sargent has started the new EFL Championship season with a bang, scoring a goal in every appearance for Norwich City through six games. Sargent has tallied double-digit goals for Norwich each of the previous three campaigns. Now, Sargent aims to continue that scoring tear with the U.S. Men's National Team. If he scores in this camp against Korea Republic (Sept. 6; Harrison, N.J.) or Japan (Sept. 9; Columbus, Ohio), it would be his first international goal since 2019. “Of course, I know it's been a while. While scoring in a National Team shirt is top of mind, it's not something he or the rest of the team is concerned with. Veteran defender Tim Ream — who watched Sargent come up through the same program as a fellow St. Louis native — said he has full confidence in the forward. “I don't think anybody really worries about it, to be completely honest with you,” Ream said. “I've known that the guy can score goals since he was 15-16 years old. You look at what he's doing at Norwich, and the types of goals that he scored and they're all different.” Previously with the U.S., Sargent has notched five goals in 28 appearances. USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino called in three strikers for the September friendlies. Sargent, Damion Downs — who played in the Concacaf Gold Cup Final run — and Folarin Balogun. This summer, Sargent didn't receive the call-up, but he took it as motivation to get another chance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The summer transfer window slammed shut across Europe on Monday. And while no United States men's national team members switched clubs on Deadline Day, plenty of Americans made moves throughout the summer. And if these players want to solidify their U.S. roster spots ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, these are places where they'll need to do it. Here's how those moves rank, starting with the most impactful: Johnny Cardoso joining Atlético Madrid highlights the transfers involving U.S. men's team players. Johnny's switch from Real Betis to La Liga rival Atléti ranks as the fourth-richest transfer ever for an American, and he's started all three league matches so far this season for Diego Simeone's side. Rest assured: Cardoso, who spent more than a month in camp with Pochettino during the Gold Cup though injury limited him to just 13 minutes, projects to contend with Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah for a starting spot at the World Cup despite his struggles with the national team to date. Tim Weah is back in France, this time with Marseille. Weah returned last month to France's Ligue 1, where the New York Red Bulls academy product turned pro with Paris Saint-Germain as a teenager and won the league title with Lille in 2021 before heading to Italy. Weah started slightly less than half of Juve's games last season. Following his $41 million July switch from PSV, where Tillman won two Dutch titles in two seasons, the silky playmaker shook off the calf injury that prevented him from featuring in last week's Bundesliga curtain-raiser by scoring on Saturday in his debut for the 2024 German champs. Tillman should remain a key figure for Leverkusen this season no matter who picks the lineups going forward. Former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag, who replaced Xabi Alonso after Alonso left for Real Madrid, was fired on Sunday after just three competitive matches at the helm. Matt Turner is banking on a return to MLS will keep him as the USMNT's potential starting keeper. Since arriving back at Gillette Stadium last month, the 30-year-old has already appeared in as many games (four) as he did with Palace over the entire 2024-25 season. Could George Campbell play his way onto the USMNT roster? Few had Campbell on their predicted roster for this year's almost exclusively MLS-based January camp, but the 24-year-old center-back impressed Pochettino and his staff. He has now gone 90 minutes in each of West Brom's last three games, during which the Baggies have gone undefeated with two wins. Given the USMNT's severe lack of depth in central defense behind current starters Chris Richards and Tim Ream, Campbell is a dark horse to sneak into the World Cup squad. Gio Reyna got his move, and now he needs to play. Heavily sought by Italian Serie A club Parma, the 22-year-old instead opted to stay in Germany, joining childhood friend and USMNT teammate Joe Scally at Gladbach. And Reyna, who has fewer than 1200 total minutes over his final two seasons with Dortmund, has yet to dress for his new team. He'll probably need to beat out one of three entrenched starters at some point this campaign to have any hope of making his second career World Cup roster in 2026. Paxten Aaronson is back in MLS where he'll hope his time with the Rapids will boost this stock. The younger brother of 2022 World Cup participant Brenden Aaronson raised eyebrows in late August, when he left Germany after two-plus years spent mostly on loan to Dutch Eredivisie outfits Utrecht and Vitesse and returned to MLS. After seeing Diego Luna and other MLSers emerge as national team regulars under Pochettino, Aaronson — who logged just 11 minutes during the Gold Cup — surely is hoping that leading Colorado on a deep playoff will help boost his stock ahead of 2026. Only two players (Max Arfsten and Chris Richards) have logged more minutes for the USMNT in 2025 than Agyemang, whose four goals lead the squad this year. Still, the 24-year-old Connecticut native took a risk when he left a starting job with The Crown for Derby, which finished 19th in England's second tier last season. The Rams have been even worse so far this term, having failed to win any of their first four matches. He'll have to hit the ground running upon his return: Two of his main challengers for a World Cup roster spot, Josh Sargent and Haji Wright, are already proven scorers in the Championship. Patrick Agyemang hasn't played yet for Derby County and wll need to hit the ground running once he does. Benjamin Cremaschi will head from Miami to Parma on a season-long loan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOBILE, Ala. (WALA) - As Americans, we understand that travel isn't a luxury – it's essential. Travel fuels the U.S. economy, connects communities, enriches lives and strengthens our position in the world. Travel is in our collective DNA – we get our kicks on Route 66, hop a flight to Miami Beach, and take planes, trains, and automobiles to get home for the holidays– supporting a US industry that added $2.9 trillion to the US economy last year. Next summer's FIFA World Cup 2026 will catapult US tourism to the world stage by filling stadiums with 3.7 million spectators, adding 185,000 jobs and growing GDP by $17 billion. As host cities prepare to welcome visitors by upgrading and renovating stadiums, improving connectivity, expanding airports and even evaluating short term rental policies, we're on the verge of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And FIFA is just the beginning. The 2025 Ryder Cup, America's 250th birthday, also in 2026, and the 2028 Olympics will bring revenue and jobs to economies and communities across the country unlike any period in American history. But, what needs to happen now BEFORE the world comes to visit so we don't forfeit jobs, billions of dollars for the economy and the opportunity to reach America's potential? Global travel experts note that with our national aging travel infrastructure in need of modernization and misguided and costly barriers for travelers, America is not the international travel destination it can be. The decisions our local and national policymakers make now will have a major impact on local economies and communities to America's standing on the world stage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team forward Josh Sargent confirmed Tuesday that there were multiple teams interested in signing him this summer, but in the end the transfer deadline passed with him staying at Norwich City. Sargent is wearing the captain's armband and is off to a scorching start to the season, with six goals in five games for the Canaries, including an EFL Championship-leading five in league play. “There were quite a few things going on,” Sargent said of the summer window. That included a bid from the Bundesliga's Wolfsburg. The Athletic previously reported that Sargent turned down the move back to Germany, where he started his pro career with Werder Bremen. “A lot of decisions had to be made, not just for myself, but for my family,” he said Tuesday. And I've had a good start to the season, so hopefully I can continue that form all throughout the season and keep scoring goals.” He found out via an email ahead of the tournament, with no other communication from the coaching staff. Sargent said he knew “they don't have to call me.” He took it as a challenge to get right ahead of this season — and to find his form to make sure he was on the team for next summer's World Cup. “I kind of just took it, as: rest up during the offseason, and hit the ground running with Norwich to make sure that I'm back into the next camp,” Sargent said. The stat feels a bit crazy considering his development at the club level, where he has netted 44 goals over the past three seasons at Norwich, and the fact that he's been a senior national team player for seven years. But Sargent's national team career has also been interrupted by injury — ankle and groin surgeries kept him out of the picture in 2023 and 2024. At a time in which several players in this national team have been criticized for not caring enough, the problem for Sargent has been the opposite. It has looked at times like he is overthinking the scoring rut, which only complicates things in front of the goal. For that reason, it was a surprise to see him left off the Gold Cup roster. Instead, he'll try to end the rut against South Korea and Japan. “Of course I know it's been a while. Sargent will fight for minutes in this camp with another top contender for the starting job at striker: Folarin Balogun, a late call-in for the U.S., scored for Monaco this weekend and was named to L'Equipe's team of the week. Damion Downs, Southampton's 21-year-old German-American striker, is also in camp. U.S. veteran center back Tim Ream, a fellow St. Louis native, said the team isn't concerned about Sargent's goal-scoring drought. “I've known that the guy can score goals since he was 15, 16 years old and following his path and his career so far,” Ream said. “It's not something that we're worried about. You look at what he's doing at Norwich and the types of goals that he scored, they're all different. Paul Tenorio  is a senior writer for The Athletic who covers soccer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After weeks of speculation and frustration surrounding his absence, Christian Pulisic has officially returned to the U.S. Men's National Team. The AC Milan star joins familiar faces like Diego Luna and Alex Zendejas as Mauricio Pochettino prepares his squad for two September friendlies against South Korea and Japan. Pulisic, nicknamed Captain America by U.S. fans, arrives in camp on the back of a strong performance with Milan. Over the weekend, he scored in a victory against Lecce, a timely reminder of the impact he can have when fit and confident. Pulisic skipped the 2025 Gold Cup, citing the need for rest, a decision that frustrated head coach Mauricio Pochettino and drew criticism from former U.S. stars, including Landon Donovan. Pochettino, however, made it clear that the situation is now behind them. We have a plan for every player, and for Christian the plan is to bring him back into this camp and see him perform.” On the first day of training camp, Pulisic was seen integrating quickly with his teammates, smiling and working at full intensity. The U.S. roster features a mix of established names and emerging talents, and Pochettino is determined to use these friendlies to evaluate options across the field. Gio Reyna accepts USMNT omission calmly as teammate reacts to Pochettino's roster exclusions Gio Reyna was left out of Mauricio Pochettino's latest USMNT roster, as the 22-year-old continues to search for rhythm after moving from Borussia Dortmund to Borussia Monchengladbach. Christian Pulisic returns to the national team after missing the Gold Cup, with Pochettino praising his form at AC Milan and describing him as “fresh and ready to contribute.” Christian Pulisic and Santiago Gimenez have returned to Milanello this summer only to find themselves in a vastly different environment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But with Fox Sports executives and talent all congregating in Columbus surrounding the season opener for Big Noon Kickoff and the debut of Dave Portnoy, it was in many ways the perfect venue. It's also because Fox Sports will attempt to replicate the on-campus environment for the newly expanded 48-team World Cup, which will take place next summer in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Fox's Jenny Taft moderated a panel featuring company president Eric Shanks, soccer analyst Alexi Lalas, and USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino at Ohio State University on Friday before the clash between the Buckeyes and the Longhorns. The public event, The Road to FIFA World Cup 26, was held on campus as part of a partnership between Fox Sports and Ohio State University through the school's Sports and Society Initiative. Awful Announcing was in attendance as Shanks outlined how he hopes the network can take the excitement and feel of being on campus for college football games and translate it to World Cup coverage this summer. “I don't think this country knows yet, or hasn't realized how big this is going to be. It is going to take this country by storm. There is so much that's going to happen, not just with the World Cup, but with the 250th anniversary of America. The fact that on July 4th we actually have World Cup games, I think one being played in Philadelphia on July 4th. It's going to feel very much like that big fanfest, college atmosphere. For us, it's going to kind of be like a three-ring circus. We're going to have two traveling studios around the country that will be at the best games each day with fans behind them to try to give people at home a sense of what it's like to be there, and then we'll have a big home base at Los Angeles as well,” he added. The 48 teams will play 104 games across 16 cities in 3 different countries from June 11 through July 19. “It's by far the biggest logistical undertaking that we've ever done at Fox. And we think it's going to pay off because I do think we're going to create memories of a lifetime for people who may not have ever seen a World Cup, or maybe this is the first one they've been alive, or the first one they can attend with their mom or their dad or their grandpa and create generational memories for a lifetime,” Shanks stated. Fox Sports has been the leading player in international soccer coverage ever since winning World Cup rights away from ESPN beginning in 2015. They have been the home of both men's and women's World Cup tournaments ever since. However, beginning in 2027, Netflix will air the next two women's World Cup tournaments, having surprisingly won the rights last December. The 2030 version will take place in Morocco, Spain, and Portugal and will undoubtedly be an attractive event for streamers and traditional networks alike, especially considering the dearth of sports rights currently on the open market. With that reality in mind, Fox has continued to build out its soccer portfolio. This summer, Fox aired the women's European Championship. But it may also be forgotten that the network also still airs a handful of matches from Major League Soccer. MLS doesn't quickly spring to mind as a Fox broadcast partner, given that the entirety of the league's rights are contained in a landmark streaming deal with Apple. And every panelist made clear that a successful, thriving MLS was a crucial aspect of the continued growth of soccer in America, including Pochettino. Last week, the USMNT manager faced criticism for selecting multiple MLS players for the upcoming international friendly matches. “The squad next week is going to have a roster from MLS. It's not only if you want to play in the national team, you need to go away and play in a different country. But I think the level is similar, and the thing is to respect everyone and give their chances.” “We've been partners with MLS for decades,” Shanks said. I do believe that a strong domestic league is a key component to how far we can eventually go and sustain our World Cup and international performance. A domestic league is essential, and to keep growing the domestic league in perception, I guess, with Spain, Germany, England, it requires even more investment from the team owners and the league to continue to get better and better players in their prime, and hopefully better and better domestic players in their prime so they don't think about going anywhere else.” “My dream for MLS, again telling them how to spend their money, is that one day I wake up and Commissioner Garber is on a stage at a podium surrounded by 30 representatives from all the 30 teams, and he announces a moonshot in that MLS is going to be the most popular and the best league in the world. It's not for lack of money and deep pockets; when you look at the ownership group, it's an amazing group of owners,” Lalas said. You're just as likely to see a Liverpool or Real Madrid jersey walking down any city street as you are one for Inter Miami or LAFC. And whether it's the EPL, La Liga, Bundesliga, Champions League, MLS, or so many leagues in between, just as many people are watching and engaging in soccer over the course of any weekend as any other major “American” sport. We don't know who that is yet, but we're going to be prepared to tell the story,” Shanks said. “If you were the broadcaster in 2010, 2014, it was like going to Vegas,” Shanks said. “You paid a rights fee, and if the US didn't do well, your investment was shot like you lost at the craps table. What has happened now is this has become such a soccer country that no matter how far the US goes, the interest in the World Cup is still going to be massive. There are fans who love the game, and if you saw the final in Qatar, that we did, amazing ratings, because everyone knew they were going to see something special with those two countries and those two stars.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With matches spread across 16 venues in three countries, finding the right streaming option has become more crucial than ever. For soccer fans in the US who are looking forward to the World Cup as much as we are, here's GOAL's guide to how you can tune into all the ties, know all the match schedules, different locations and how to do watch via your television at home or on your mobile device while on-the-go. In case you aren't fully aware, the 2026 FIFA World Cup will take place across three countries: the territories of Canada, Mexico and the United States, spanning 16 cities, between June 11 and July 19, 2026. Each nation boasts some incredible stadiums, making for an unforgettable broadcast experience. This won't be just any World Cup—we're witnessing history with the first-ever tri-country tournament spanning the United States, Canada, and Mexico. READ MORE: Who has qualified for the World Cup 2026? The World Cup will return to its usual annual slot of summertime, after the 2022 World Cup in Qatar took place in December. As a US soccer fan, there are multiple ways to watch the live soccer games through a variety of streaming providers. For anyone with a TV streaming subscription, there are plenty of ways to catch every World Cup match, with each offering different levels of overall television coverage and extras. Watching all the action with providers such as fubo will mean all your soccer needs will be consolidated to one single place and subscription. FOX Sports holds the English-language rights, while Telemundo covers Spanish-language broadcasts through 2026, ensuring all 104 matches are available across both networks. Each game streams on both the Telemundo app and via Peacock. For budget-conscious viewers, Peacock Premium at $7.99 per month offers the best value, streaming all matches with Spanish commentary. English-language viewers seeking affordability should consider Sling Blue at around $51 monthly for FOX Sports access. Premium services like YouTube TV and fubo provide comprehensive sports packages but cost significantly more, starting at just over $80 per month. The Telemundo app offers free access for existing cable or TV streaming subscribers (as noted above), making it ideal for Spanish-speaking fans with traditional TV packages. These official options ensure you'll never miss a match while supporting legitimate broadcasters who invest in World Cup coverage rights. As international sports fans, we understand the challenge of staying connected to our favorite events while traveling or for those living in other areas of the world. The 2026 World Cup spans five intense weeks from June 11 to July 19, with matches distributed across Eastern, Central, and Pacific time zones it means games can feature at various times during the TV schedule. We'll see the opening match at Mexico City's iconic Estadio Azteca, followed by group stage action through to June 27. Keeping up with all the match locations, time zone shifts, and which providers and channels have the broadcasting rights can be exhausting. So, after reading the above, you should have a clearer idea on which streaming TV provider you'll need, the channels you'll want access to, and an understanding of when and where the vital games are held. If you take these into consideration, you'll be well prepared for seeing all the soccer coverage and to have the best viewer experience next summer!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Matt Crocker landed in America, as U.S. Soccer's second-ever sporting director, he plunged into a few urgent tasks. He asked Twenty First Group, a sport data firm, some simple questions: Over the past 10 years, how many of the world's best soccer players have been American? On the men's side, Crocker asked a room of coaches in January, how many top-50 players do you think we've produced? Throughout his first year on the job, he listened and learned. His challenge, and the riddle that no U.S. Soccer executive has ever solved, is implementing it at thousands of amateur clubs, across an alphabet soup of youth soccer sanctioning organizations, that he does not — cannot — control. There, at the clubs, is where “95% of player development happens,” Crocker often says. In the past, he and others say, U.S. Soccer gurus would dictate to those coaches. The most transformative and disruptive plan to date, the Development Academy, relied on “standards” — and “technical advisors” who enforced them. Soccer used a stick,” Crocker says, before relaying one analogy he heard on his listening tour. A stakeholder told him: “The only time we heard from U.S. Soccer is when they wanted to send a lightning bolt down to blow up something.” Crocker, years later, has taken a different tack. Rather than dictate or tell, he wants to help and “influence.” He wants to inspire adoption of and alignment with his ideas. “It's educating,” says Trish Hughes, commissioner of the Girls Academy, one of several youth leagues that Crocker needs on board, “and trying to pull people in to be a part of the process.” But doing that, across this boundless landscape of independent clubs with their own incentives, who are often far more focused on fighting with one another for players than on producing future pros, is “not simple,” Crocker admits. “The 5% is such an easy bit to change and tweak,” he said in January of U.S. Soccer's operations. “This is — pfff,” he says with wide eyes. Crocker comes from a land where soccer is very different. Born in Wales, he made his name in England, first at Southampton, then at the English FA, the sport's national governing body. There, he helped craft and operationalize “England DNA,” a five-pillar approach to elite player development that is credited with shaping successful England national teams of the 2020s. But there, operationalizing a national plan is relatively straightforward. “No one is more than three hours away from St. George's Park,” Crocker says, referring to England's national football center. “You could go on a roadshow, and cover the whole country, [visiting] every county association, in two weeks.” When the FA wants to push a new developmental philosophy or initiative, it engages with those county associations, which govern grassroots soccer; with professional clubs, which operate youth academies; and with coach educators, who work for the FA and serve the entire country. A youth club, which relies on pay-to-play fees for funding, must attract and retain players; a pro club might scout and poach those players; a college coach might recruit them so his or her team can win; Crocker might want them to develop into national teamers. “What is needed to make youth soccer better can be very similar and very different to what pro soccer may need or want, or what the national team may need or want,” says Christian Lavers, president of the Elite Clubs National League (ECNL). “Sometimes it feels like 50 countries, it feels like UEFA,” Crocker says, referencing the European soccer confederation of 55 member nations. He knows that he and the U.S. Soccer Federation, a national governing body with a budget less than half that of the English FA, cannot work hands-on with coaches in the same way England can, nor with clubs that span an area roughly 75 times as vast. They cannot identify, nurture and elevate all the best 13-year-old players. They have discussed novel solutions, such as creating six or eight “regional youth national teams” to touch a broader selection of players, but remember: youth national teams are the 5%; “you guys are the 95%,” Crocker told the room of coaches in January. “Your ways are fundamentally gonna make the difference. We're just a little machine at the end that turns.” What Crocker and U.S. Soccer must do, essentially, is teach the sausage makers. That's why Crocker, in his second year on the job, set off on his own “roadshow.” He jetted coast to coast, south to north, evangelizing “the U.S. Way.” He presented at board meetings and symposiums. For elite teenage prospects, that means individual development plans shared among youth national team and club coaches. U.S. Soccer is piloting a digital platform that will house performance data, training programs, film and more, so that all those coaches who sculpt a given player can align. For 5-year-olds, of course, it means something very different. U.S. Soccer doesn't have specific prescriptions for them — yet. Crocker, though, wants the federation to help shape playing environments at “every age and stage,” as he often says, “as soon as a child can walk.” He envisions a dad who signs his daughter up for rec soccer, and stumbles into coaching the team, with no prior experience. He wants that dad to log onto U.S. Soccer's website and find instructive, illustrative answers to three key questions: “How do you make the environment fun and safe? There's natural pressure to win, says Hughes, the Girls Academy commissioner, and “there's always a scorecard in the girls youth soccer space,” where wins determine coach and club prestige. Crocker believes, “wholeheartedly,” that this mentality hinders technical development, and must shift. But there's a significant subset of coaches who believe that the U.S. soccer intelligentsia has actually shifted too far toward “winning doesn't matter.” Lavers, the ECNL president, is part of this subset and says: “We need to correct for that.” “You cannot completely decouple winning and development,” Lavers argues. He adds: “I also think we need to have respect for the youth coaches, [and] respect that they know how to balance winning vs. development as it changes across all of the age groups, and not talk to them as if they can't possibly understand that.” This is the proverbial tightrope that Crocker must walk. He does not want to impose his views, but, in the absence of mandates or standards, how can he incentivize coaches to adopt them? In January, he spoke about drafting a “bible” that anyone could choose to follow. Speaking now, via Zoom from a temporary office south of Atlanta, he delves into the more formalized field that will be crucial: coaching education. U.S. Soccer's network of courses, educators and licenses has historically been exclusive. But it's “the biggest lever that we can pull,” he says. In England, he explained, a young boy is “never more than 13 minutes away from a free elite program, with highly qualified coaches that have a playing philosophy and have an individual development plan for every single player.” In the U.S., there simply aren't enough coaches with any of that. He knows, of course, that this is an “absolutely unbelievable gigantic project,” one that would require many millions of dollars and could take decades to stand up. At many stops on the roadshow, Crocker's rhetoric has galvanized coaches and administrators. But it has been almost a year since he first outlined “the U.S. Way,” and many are still wondering: What, exactly, is it? Earnie Stewart, Crocker's predecessor, also had a presentation. Claudio Reyna, U.S. Soccer's youth technical director in the early 2010s, had a 123-page document. “Everybody,” Cullina says of Reyna's curriculum, “bought it hook, line and sinker … and then it just disappeared.” Some have wondered skeptically: Is “the U.S. Way” just a well-branded repeat? “But unless you can operationalize it, and unless you can get the buy-in necessary, it really isn't going to have any impact.” What he and others stress, though, is that U.S. Soccer has in fact changed. Crocker's sporting department and a new soccer growth department are “doing a tremendous amount of work, building relationships” across the landscape, Cullina says. Tangibly, thus far, they've begun to coordinate a “unified youth calendar” with leagues like MLS Next. And they are refining what Crocker calls “a really robust plan,” but he acknowledges: “Being able to turn that plan into something that resembles some type of reality, and get it working, and fund it, I think is an astronomical ask.” (Top photo: Sandy Huffaker for The Washington Post/Getty Images) Henry Bushnell  is a senior writer for The Athletic covering soccer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The most-followed professional sports league on Earth is increasingly an American one, but it's not the NFL, NBA or Major League Baseball. Despite their impressive strides in growing  global audiences and reach, homegrown U.S. sports aren't the world's biggest draw. The Premier League kicked off its 2025-2026 season  Aug. 15 with 11 of its 20 clubs under U.S. ownership (only four teams in the league are British-owned. Will thrice runners-up Arsenal (which shares owners with the Los Angeles Rams) be able to dethrone Liverpool (owned by the Red Sox's Fenway Sports Group)? And will San Francisco 49ers-owned Leeds United gain a permanent foothold in the league after being promoted from the lower division last season? Suddenly, Americans are far more connected to the rest of the world than previous generations were, thanks to sport, our age's leading pastime and most important form of media. Saudi Arabia, Beijing and other deep-pocketed, unsavory regimes are using the games we love to launder their reputations. When I first moved to the United States as a teenager in the 1980s, Americans didn't play much with others. Tom Brady never got to wear a Team USA jersey because, well, only other Americans play his kind of football. Moreover, although a Hollywood blockbuster might make three-quarters of its box office outside the U.S., and Taylor Swift scheduled two-thirds of her Eras Tour in nations other than America, our biggest sporting production — the Super Bowl — is still watched by far more people inside the U.S. than outside it. Yet things have changed dramatically over the past generation. It used to be common to hear sports pundits and American politicians (especially conservative ones) vilify soccer with the same xenophobic fervor reserved for such dastardly foreign schemes as the metric system and socialism. But now our “America First” President Trump is fast friends with FIFA's leader Gianni Infantino, and Trump's enthusiasm for the recent Club World Cup was such that he famously overstayed his welcome on stage during Chelsea's post-match celebrations last month at MetLife Stadium. We can thank the girls and women of America, and Title IX, for putting an end to America's sporting isolationism, along with immigrants, who were often the first to introduce the sport across American communities, and the marketing departments and aspirations of multinational corporations. Coca-Cola was FIFA's first global sponsor not because it was already a powerful American company, but because FIFA could help push the brand to every corner of the world. Electronic Arts could have simply created its Madden video game for NFL aficionados, but it was its FIFA game that made it a global player (and in turn helped popularize the sport among millions of American kids). Ours is now a nation where soccer practice is a staple of most kids' lives, the game's best player ever joined our top domestic league (which didn't exist until 1996), and we can watch every other league on the planet. Thanks to NBC's masterful coverage, England's Premier League is as avidly followed in this country as many of our domestic leagues. Now is not the time for Olympics doom and gloom. It wasn't that long ago that I could wear my Arsenal sweatshirt out and about without eliciting much of a response, but no more. A couple of seasons ago in Phoenix, I had taped a midday match to watch after work and was scrupulously avoiding any source of spoilers. I guess so, but an oddly satisfying spoiler too, for what it represented. You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.
