                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Dutch Grand Prix: All the angles of Verstappen's dramatic start at Zandvoort Hadjar kicked off his rookie F1 season in painful circumstances with a formation lap spin at the Australian Grand Prix, but since then the French youngster has starred with Racing Bulls. He reached new heights at Zandvoort via a stunning run to fourth in Qualifying, defending that position brilliantly before taking advantage of Norris' retirement to score a maiden podium. Piastri trailed McLaren team mate Norris during practice around the Dutch dunes but delivered when it matter to bag pole position in Qualifying. He expertly controlled proceedings in the race to earn a ninth career victory, tying manager manager Mark Webber's career total, while completing the first ‘Grand Slam' – pole, win, fastest lap and every lap led – for a McLaren driver since Mika Hakkinen at the 1998 Monaco Grand Prix. Heading into the weekend, Max Verstappen knew it would be a challenge to add to the Zandvoort wins he achieved in 2021, 2022 and 2023, given McLaren's level of performance this season. He was running a strong third to Piastri and Norris on an off-set strategy when the latter hit trouble and retired – giving the Dutchman a bonus P2 result. However, it was team mate Piastri who grabbed pole by 0.012s in another ultra-close Qualifying session, before Norris lost further ground at the start when Verstappen slipped ahead. The Briton fought back well to reclaim second and then put some pressure on Piastri, only for his hopes to go up in smoke. Having started his weekend inside the top five in practice, Albon was understandably frustrated with a Q2 elimination in Qualifying – the Williams driver's final run not going to plan. After keeping up his run of qualifying inside the top-six places at every round apart from Monaco so far this season, Russell experienced an eventful race day at Zandvoort. While he took “zero satisfaction” from his afternoon at the wheel, fourth still represented a solid return. However, a second clash with the other Silver Arrow of Kimi Antonelli, following an extra pit stop that he had questioned, ended his day. Across a tough season for Alpine, Pierre Gasly has managed to pull some impressive results out of the bag and give the team something to shout about. Fernando Alonso and Aston Martin caught the eye when they split the McLarens of Norris and Piastri during second practice, raising hopes of a podium push. It did not quite work out that way, with Alonso getting overhauled by quicker cars in Qualifying and team mate Stroll finding the wall. On race day, despite frustrations over the timing of his pit stops and losing time in traffic, Alonso managed to top up his points tally in eighth. Like Bearman, Esteban Ocon fell at the first Qualifying hurdle after a mistake on his final Q1 run, giving Haas plenty to do in the race. He joined his team mate in moving up the order, though, and made it a double points finish by fending off Alpine's Franco Colapinto late on and crossing the line in 10th position. Colapinto just missed out on a spot in the Power Rankings top 10 on what was a more encouraging weekend from the Argentinian, along with Liam Lawson, who was in points contention aboard the other Racing Bulls car until a clash with Carlos Sainz.</p>
