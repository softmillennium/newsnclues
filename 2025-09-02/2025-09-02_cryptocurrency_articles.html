                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This recognition aligns with Ripple's growing role in Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and international payments. <div style=”background-color: #ACD7E5!important; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1.5em; padding: 1em; color: #444;”>Central banks and financial institutions can utilize Ripple's technology when diving into digital assets, since it enables fast, low-cost cross-border transactions.</div> Naturally, this is great news for $XRP, the project's native token. In fact, this is a positive sign for the overall crypto market. Essentially, it's a private version of the XRP Ledger. It has already actively engaged with several central banks worldwide on their CBDC pilot programs and initiatives – Bhutan, Colombia, and Georgia. Countries like China, India, and Russia have also entered advanced pilot phases for CBDCs. Consequently, they draw attention to technologies that connect these systems worldwide, such as Ripple. Considering that Juniper Research predicts CBDC transactions will surpass $213B by 2030 – up from just $100M in 2023 – Ripple is well positioned for continued growth. These CBDC developments could be part of what's leading to a positive outlook for $XRP. The broader market also rewards crypto projects with strong communities and scalable infrastructure. One such example is Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE). Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) aims to become ‘the best Solana meme coin of 2025.' Following this cross-chain expansion, you can swap your $WEPE on Ethereum for $WEPE on Solana at a 1:1 ratio. To support this move, liquidity for the Solana launch is being taken directly from the project's treasury, rather than external sources. Also, ensuring fairness involves a buyback-and-burn mechanism that has been put in place to keep the supply balanced across chains. As a result, the total circulating $WEPE remains limited to 200B. Wall Street Pepe has launched several quests through QuestN, where you can complete simple tasks like joining social channels and sharing content to earn rewards such as whitelist spots and event NFTs. Since it also has more exchange listings coming up beyond Uniswap, MEXC, XT.COM, and Bilaxy, it's well-positioned to gain greater visibility and adoption – it might even be the next crypto to surge. Ripple being recognized as one of the ‘heavyweights' by JPMorgan highlights its expanding role in CBDC discussions and the increasing importance of interoperable settlement solutions. Although once considered speculative, CBDCs are now undergoing advanced testing worldwide. For $XRP, this is great news, as it could serve as a potential backbone for linking these virtual assets globally. For $XRP, this signifies ongoing importance as a bridge asset in global settlement. However, the influence extends beyond Ripple's native token; it indicates increasing confidence in blockchain infrastructure overall. In turn, it paves the way for other crypto projects to succeed. This includes Wall Street Pepe, which demonstrates how meme-driven communities can develop into multichain ecosystems and generate new opportunities for holders. On the official Wall Street Pepe website, you can buy $WEPE on Solana for just $0.001, using either $ETH, $USDT, $USDC, or fiat. Before making any investment, always do your own research and never spend more than you'd be sad to lose.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Layer Brett has already raised $2 million, with tokens selling for just $0.0053, and investors are starting to call it the next 100x meme token. Unlike many meme projects that lean only on hype, this one is built on Ethereum layer 2 technology, giving it both speed and real utility. The original Brett token lived on Base, fun but limited in what it could do. Layer Brett takes that same community-driven energy and puts it on Ethereum layer 2, unlocking lightning-fast transactions and gas fees cut down to pennies. Meanwhile, DOGE has carved out its space as the internet's favorite memecoin. A Dogecoin ETF could bring fresh liquidity and attention, yet it doesn't change the fact that DOGE lacks staking rewards or smart contract features. That's where Layer Brett shines; it blends meme culture with the power of modern defi. With so much stuff already going on in the $LBRETT project, there's always something that stands out. Here's what makes this memecoin such an appealing deal: For everyday users, the ability to stake right after buying is a major advantage. There's no denying the hype around a Dogecoin ETF. If approved, it could drive institutional money toward DOGE and strengthen its role as a digital asset. Bit Origin's move to set up a DOGE treasury and proposals like DogeOS verification or MyDoge's Ethereum bridge all show growing interest in building more around the token. But compared to Layer Brett, which already has low fees, staking, and transparent tokenomics built into its core, DOGE looks less flexible. A Dogecoin ETF could bring new highs, but Layer Brett offers something different. An early-entry price of $0.0053 for one $LBRETT meme token, staking rewards that dwarf anything in traditional meme coins, and a clear roadmap toward scalability. The presale has already raised $2 million, showing strong momentum. Disclaimer: The content above is presented for informational purposes as a paid advertisement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BitMine Immersion Technologies recently purchased 153,000 Ethereum, taking a $655 million step toward its goal of owning 5% of the asset's supply, according to a press release. The Las Vegas-based firm now owns roughly 1.86 million Ethereum worth $8.1 billion. The company, which initiated its Ethereum treasury strategy in late June, currently owns 1.5% of the 120.7 million Ethereum in existence, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Innovation in financial services boomed after the gold standard was abandoned, with the advent of money market funds and debit cards presenting notable examples, Lee said. As artificial intelligence systems become more sophisticated, AI could build on the blockchain, too, Lee posited. “But it's going to create a market for digital assets, and we think the winner there is Ethereum. BitMine owns some Bitcoin, in addition to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ethereum meanwhile dipped to $4,300, showing a 0.5% decline over the same period. ETH is down about 13% since hitting an all-time high price just under $5,000 late last month. Bitcoin has outperformed Ethereum for years, but during the pandemic-era crypto boom, both cryptocurrencies were widely popular. So far, that ratio has recovered from a multi-year low of 0.018 in April. The ratio stood at 0.038 on Monday, which is still below an 8-year average of 0.047, Lee said. Assuming Bitcoin's price reaches $250,000, Ethereum would be worth $12,000, if that 8-year average holds true. “Not only should Ethereum recover to the long-term average, it should probably get to the all-time high ratio, and arguably exceed it, as we start talking about Ethereum as the chain for both Wall Street to build its financial rails and the financial system, as well as AI,” Lee said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's Cost Basis Distribution shows strong buyer support versus Ether's weaker flows. Coinbase and Binance netflows hint at a liquidity regime shift favoring reaccumulation. Bitcoin's (BTC) spot market is flashing signs of a potential recovery rally. Data from Glassnode indicates BTC's Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) shows a sharp divergence with Ether (ETH). The CBD is an onchain metric that identifies price levels where significant supply has been accumulated or distributed. While ETH flows remain sparse, Bitcoin spot activity is denser, with transactions clustering tightly across recent levels. This density could indicate a strong buyer's conviction, and in the past, it has provided more durable support than futures-driven momentum. A CryptoQuant quicktake post points out that Coinbase recorded a consistent netflow spike between Aug. 25–31, immediately after its 30-day simple moving average (SMA) hit the lowest level since early 2023. Sharp reversals from multi-year troughs often signal a regime shift in liquidity, whether via settlement restructuring or preparations for higher exchange activity. Meanwhile, Binance saw its 30-day SMA netflow reach the highest since July 2024 on July 25 and Aug. 25, a level that historically coincided with reaccumulation phases before new local highs. Long-term holder (LTH) spending or possible profit-taking has also accelerated in recent weeks, with the 14-day SMA trending higher. Yet activity remains within cycle norms and well below the October–November 2024 peaks, suggesting measured distribution rather than aggressive selling. Bitcoin (BTC) showed signs of resilience this week after dipping to $107,300 on Monday, a level that aligns closely with its short-term realized price, hinting at potential support. From that low price, BTC rebounded sharply, breaking above Monday's $109,900 high during the New York trading session on Tuesday. The move comes after a two-week corrective phase, with lower time frames such as the 15-minute and 1-hour charts now flashing a bullish break of structure. For the recovery to continue, Bitcoin must clear immediate resistance between $112,500 and $113,650. Such a breakout could open the path toward liquidity targets at $116,300, $117,500, and potentially $119,500. However, traders should remain cautious given September's bearish seasonality. A failed breakout or sustained weakness below $113,650 would leave BTC vulnerable, with downside targets extending toward the order block between $105,000 and $100,000.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Family members of Donald J. Trump" hold 22.5 billion tokens, disclosures say The Trump family secured a roughly $5 billion windfall on Monday as trading of a digital token belonging to its primary cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, opened. That figure is based on public disclosures that report "certain family members of Donald J. Trump [hold] 22.5 billion $WLFI tokens." On Tuesday morning, the value of $WLFI hovered around 23 cents, leaving the Trump family with a stake of approximately $5 billion. World Liberty Financial said earlier Monday in a statement that tokens belonging to the founding "Team" were locked and therefore unable to be sold pending a "vesting schedule TBD," meaning the Trump family's $5 billion position exists only on paper for the time being. Trump is now listed on the website as "Co-Founder Emeritus" with a footnote that says, "Removed upon taking office." Earlier this summer, investors in World Liberty voted to make the coin tradeable, and on Monday, the company allowed coin owners to begin selling their stakes -- up to 20%, according to the company. Before settling at around 23 cents, shares of the token spiked early on Monday with its value peaking at roughly 40 cents before the shares' value tapered off, according to Binance. The White House has repeatedly denied critics' claims that Trump's role in his family's emerging cryptocurrency empire while overseeing crypto industry regulations poses any conflicts of interest or ethical concerns. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to Solana Status on X on Monday, 98.27% of SOL stakers that voted approved the proposal, with only 1.05% voting against and 0.36% abstaining. The community governance process for SIMD-0326: Alpenglow is complete. The upgrade introduces a new consensus protocol designed to dramatically improve transaction finality and network efficiency. At the heart of Alpenglow are two new components, Votor and Rotor, which will replace Solana's existing systems, Proof-of-History and TowerBFT. Currently, Proof-of-History timestamps transactions to preserve their order without slowing the network, while TowerBFT handles the voting process among validators. Votor will slash transaction finality times from over 12 seconds to around 150 milliseconds, delivering near-instant confirmation for users. Rotor, scheduled for a later rollout, will minimize data transfers between validators, a crucial improvement for high-demand applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based gaming. With the approval secured, Solana now prepares to implement the upgrade, a milestone expected to unlock greater speed, resilience, and scalability across its ecosystem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company's aggressive accumulation strategy, funded through various ATM offerings totalling $471.8 million, comes amid growing corporate treasury adoption trends. Strategy has acquired an additional 4,048 Bitcoin worth approximately $449.3 million at an average Bitcoin price of $110,981 per BTC, according to a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 2, 2025. The latest purchase was funded through multiple at-the-market (ATM) offering programs, including proceeds from the company's STRF, STRK, STRD, and MSTR ATMs. During the period from August 26 to September 1, Strategy raised $471.8 million through these offerings, demonstrating continued investor appetite for Bitcoin-linked securities. The company's aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy comes amid a broader trend of corporate treasury adoption. Strategy's financial innovation has created new Bitcoin-linked instruments attractive to institutional investors. The company recently updated its guidance to allow tactical equity issuance even when its premium to Bitcoin net asset value falls below the previous 2.5x threshold. Strategy may soon face another milestone with potential inclusion in the S&P 500 index. If admitted, the stock could see billions in passive inflows and would join Coinbase and Block in embedding Bitcoin exposure directly into mainstream equity portfolios. The company maintains a public dashboard on its website providing real-time updates on its Bitcoin holdings, market prices of outstanding securities, and other key performance indicators. As more corporations adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies, Strategy's approach serves as a template for striking a balance between aggressive accumulation and innovative financing structures. Trading at $111,000, Bitcoin price has maintained stability despite significant corporate buying pressure, suggesting substantial underlying market depth and growing institutional acceptance of the asset class.

European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) Executive Director Natasha Cazenave has indicated that current arrangements allowing tokenized deposits and electronic money tokens (stablecoins) in digital asset trading represent temporary solutions. The regulator has allowed participants in the DLT Pilot Regime to use these digital currencies but prefers central bank money for wholesale settlement.

During a speech at an event in Dubrovnik, Croatia, she emphasized that “these alternatives are only interim solutions” and stressed the importance of anchoring tokenization within a “stable monetary framework”.

“Central bank money will remain the benchmark for safety and stability in wholesale markets,” Cazenave stated, highlighting ongoing European Central Bank initiatives. These include Pontes, an interim solution that integrates existing settlement infrastructure for DLT settlement, such as Germany's Trigger solution. There are longer term plans for a wholesale CBDC as part of Project Appia.

For decades, physical notes and coins defined how people interacted with their economies, later giving way to credit cards, online banking, and digital wallets. But in recent years, money has been undergoing a profound transformation. A new idea has begun to take root: money that is digital at its very core, issued not by private corporations or decentralized communities, but directly by a nation's central bank. These new instruments are known as Central Bank Digital Currencies, or CBDCs. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are decentralized and often volatile, CBDCs are government-backed, regulated, and designed to exist as a stable counterpart to physical cash. Nowhere is this shift more visible than in Asia. Across the continent, countries are experimenting with or are already implementing CBDCs in ways that reflect their economic ambitions as well as social priorities. The rise of CBDCs in Asia illustrates both opportunity and risk. They promise more efficient payments, greater financial inclusion, and a stronger monetary sovereignty. But they also raise difficult questions about privacy, surveillance, and trust. To understand their future, it is essential to look at how they are being adopted, what challenges lie ahead, and how ordinary people feel about them. China has emerged as the global pioneer in CBDC development. China had conducted experimental implementations in many cities, namely Shenzhen, Chengdu, and Suzhou, where participants were chosen through a lottery draw. Beyond domestic convenience, the digital yuan also serves as a geopolitical tool. There are even plans to create yuan-backed stable coins for international usage. Reports suggest many users immediately convert the digital currency payments back into back deposits, showing that while the infrastructure is in place, public enthusiasm is still catching up. The Reserve Bank of India is now experimenting with ways to integrate the digital rupee directly into UPI apps such as Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm, so that making a CBDC payment would feel no different from scanning a QR code in a shop. India's ambitions do not stop at domestic use; it has also begun exploring cross-border pilots, particularly with trading partners like the UAE, to see how CBDCs could simplify international transactions. Japan, long known for its reliance on cash, has also entered the CBDC conversation. Unlike China and India, Japan is moving cautiously, focusing more on research and ensuring any rollout would complement existing financial systems rather than disrupt them. Still, the rapid pace of digital adoption among consumers has added urgency, with policymakers increasingly aware that the yen must adapt to remain relevant in a world dominated by digital payment. Elsewhere in Asia, smaller economies are also preparing to join the CBDC movement. Pakistan is working on launching its own pilot project, part of a border effort to modernize its financial sector and create a regulatory framework for virtual assets. Nepal has also announced plans to test a rupee-backed CBDC by 2025-26, with its central bank already conducting research on design and distribution models. This initiative is exploring how CBDCs can be used to facilitate faster, cheaper cross-border transactions, addressing a long-standing pain point in international finance. In China, platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay have redefined everyday commerce, handling billions of transactions monthly. Southeast Asia, too, has seen the rise of platforms like GrabPay and GoPay, further normalizing mobile-based financial interactions. With just a mobile phone, even in a rural or underserved area, individuals could store and transfer money securely, bypassing the need for traditional bank accounts. For governments, this is not only a social goal but also an economic one, as greater financial participation can stimulate growth. By issuing CBDCs, central banks can reinforce monetary sovereignty and reduce reliance on foreign currencies. For India, CBDCs offer a chance to strengthen its financial systems against the influence of private cryptocurrencies, which the government views with suspicion. Across the region, CBDCs are also seen as tools to ensure that state institutions, rather than private tech companies, remain at the center of financial infrastructure. Technically, they must operate at a scale that can support millions of transactions per second without compromising security or efficiency. Cybersecurity risks loom large, as do questions about resilience during system failures. The answer may vary from country to country, but they underline how CBDCs are not simply a technological innovation but a restructuring of financial systems. If every country develops its own CBDC without coordination, international payments could become more fragmented, not less. This is why regional projects like mBridge are so important. Perhaps the most sensitive challenge lies in public trust. Many people fear that CBDCs could enable government overreach, turning money into a tool of surveillance and control. Discussions on online forums often reflect these concerns, with some users warning of a future where governments could track every transaction or restrict how money is spent. These fears, whether exaggerated or not, highlight the need for privacy protections and transparency in CBDC design. Without them, adoption may stall, no matter how advanced the technology. Public attitudes toward CBDCs in Asia are mixed, reflecting both enthusiasm and scepticism. They see potential benefits in terms of convenience, efficiency, and security. In India, for example, where digital payments have already become routine, the idea of a government-backed digital currency feels natural rather than disruptive. Older generations, particularly in countries where cash remains culturally important, may find it difficult to trust a purely digital form of money. Meanwhile, critics warn that CBDCs could lead to unpredictable levels of governmental control, enabling authorities to monitor personal spending or even freeze accounts in times of dissent. What becomes clear is that trust will be the decisive factor. Central banks cannot simply impose CBDCs on the public; they must build confidence through transparency, strong privacy guarantees, and clear communication about how the system works. Education campaigns will be essential, as will demonstrations of practical benefits, such as cheaper remittances, faster transactions, or easier access for people without bank accounts. Governments must design them with transparency, privacy, and inclusivity in mind. The decision being made today, about architecture, governance, and regulation, will shape whether CBDCs empower citizens or control them. If managed wisely, they could create more inclusive, efficient, and resilient economies.

On August 28, 2025, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”) initiated a public consultation on draft guidance on Distributed Ledger Technologies (“DLTs”), with a focus on blockchain (the “Guidance”). The Guidance aims to assist organizations with their understanding of DLTs, in particular blockchain, and how data protection law may apply in different scenarios and transactions.

The Guidance is divided into different sections, highlighting several issues that organizations should consider, such as:

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ether Machine announced Tuesday that it raised another 150,000 ETH worth $654 million for its Ethereum treasury in August, cementing its position as the third-largest holder. "This is the largest follow-on investment of any crypto treasury company thus far, bringing our total committed capital up to over $2.5 billion," The Ether Machine posted on X. "With the landmark commitment from Ethereum originalist Jeff Berns, one of the largest individual investments ever in a crypto treasury company, we now have nearly 500,000 ETH — about $2.5 billion," the firm's co-founder and chairman Andrew Keys added. "That scale gives us unmatched strength and credibility in this market." The continued accumulation builds on the firm's 10,605 ETH purchase on Aug. 4 and 15,000 ETH buy on Ethereum's 10th anniversary, reflecting The Ether Machine's conviction in ETH and its goal to build a long-term, yield-generating institutional treasury — just two months after it was formed via a merger between the Ether Reserve and blank-check firm Dynamix Corporation. The deal was originally projected to raise more than $1.6 billion from investors, including Blockchain.com, Kraken, and Pantera Capital. However, The Ether Machine's holdings have already reached 495,362 ETH, worth around $2.14 billion, with another $367 million in capital remaining to acquire further ether ahead of its proposed Nasdaq listing, which is expected to close next quarter. That treasury total places The Ether Machine behind only Tom Lee's BitMine and Joe Lubin's SharpLink in the strategic ETH reserve rankings, according to data from SER, with those publicly-traded firms holding approximately 1.8 million ETH and 837,000 ETH, respectively. The Ether Machine is not stopping there, with its third round slated to start on Wednesday. "Citibank is leading our third capital raising round," Keys told Reuters, adding that it would raise at least $500 million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company announced on Tuesday an $18 million fundraise led by PayPal Ventures and General Catalyst. Participants in the Series A included 8VC, Samsung Next, and Alumni Ventures, among others. Chi Zhang, cofounder and CEO of Kite, declined to disclose her startup's valuation. She also declined to specify whether the raise was purely for equity or token warrants, which are promised tranches of a yet-to-be-released cryptocurrency. “But in the future, it's all going to be automated. So we won't need to leave, let's say, Perplexity, or ChatGPT.” Kite's $18 million raise follows a wave of hype for AI agents. Now, more and more developers are creating AI designed for specific use cases that can call up other applications on one's device or across the internet. Some companies, like Cursor, have created agents optimized for writing code. Others have created AI shopping agents, which can peruse items on, say, Amazon and give users options of what to buy. “If you look at the agentic level of activities, it's been, I would say, very small and experimental in nature,” Alan Du, a partner at PayPal Ventures, told Fortune. “I think there's a lot more infrastructure level building that still needs to happen in order for agents to truly become the transformative force that it's sort of destined for.” Formerly known as Zettablock, Kite aims to build that infrastructure. Zhang, who has a doctorate in statistics from the University of California, Berkeley, envisions an internet where AI agents interact with each other without humans in between. Blockchains, which are decentralized databases that no one controls, are the solution, she thinks, which is why Kite is building a blockchain for AI. One of her company's first projects is to build a means through which users can ask ChatGPT to find them, say, t-shirts from a store using Shopify and purchase the items—all through text. FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By no means does this list intend to be exhaustive, only informative. As Dickerman told me: “While its initial launch in mid-2023 was an experiment, the conviction around it—both internal and external—has grown. The platform has expanded since inception to include a weekly art show, interviews, articles and art designs (co-created with artist Justin Wetch) that celebrate the news du jour. Accessed via an innovative token-based subscription system, 24 Hours of Art generates value for its subscribers with every sun cycle. Newly launched in 2024, this Hamburg-based publication will soon present its second print edition. Their inaugural issue, Celebrating the Fusion, fêted the diversity of generative AI and featured works culled via an open call that saw hundreds of submissions from over 40 countries pour in. By contrast, The AI Art Magazine's second edition, Critical Intelligence, follows a thematic thread, exploring how artists critically engage with authorship, bias, representation, and the politics of machine-generated images. “We wanted to move beyond a superficial fascination with technology,” co-founder Mike Brauner told me in an interview. They choose a jury for their issues, whose members offer purposefully contrasting perspectives and aesthetic approaches. One feature Brauner is particularly keen to spotlight is the "Golden Ticket," via which each juror selects an artist whose work resonated and pens a dedicated essay on their work. This ensures that the selected artists will be written about with conviction. Founded in 2015, this Spanish-language publication is the single-handed effort of the fierce and fearless Doreen Ríos, who originally launched it as a directory of Mexico's digital arts ecosystem. When the recently graduated Ríos pitched an article on the local digital art culture to her then-boss, he requested she first summon a list of its “validators.” Ríos reminisced: “I wasn't fully aware of what ‘validation' meant in the context of contemporary art, hence the naive reasoning behind my original response, which was to create an online directory of artists, curators, and other art professionals working with/through digital art. When she began teaching a BA in digital art in 2018, she realized there were scant academic resources on the subject available in Spanish, and even less so emerging from Latin America, so she created a section devoted to pedagogical resources. Then, as her own curatorial career expanded, she saw how lengthy video works had a hard time making it into online exhibitions. Promptly, a new section, La Pixelería, was born, where guest curators select and reflect on extensive video works. This will be a luxuriously lengthy process, as Ríos mused: “One of the modes of working I've been exploring since 2021 is to practice deep observation and slowness. It might feel counterintuitive in today's technological climate, but in the wake of past-faced content creation, there is something to be said for processes that cook slowly but carefully.” Lula Criado launched CLOT Magazine in 2013, intent on plumbing the intricate intersection of art and technology. Their initial goal was to create a platform that highlighted experimental art forms, especially those that challenge conventional boundaries and engage with media theory, philosophy, and cultural studies. In the twelve years that've followed, CLOT Magazine has evolved from a niche digital publication into a voice serving the wider ecosystem, featuring interviews, essays, and curated projects that span from bio-art and body sculptures to artificial intelligence to hybrid art. Criado and Rosell noted: “This evolution mirrors the broader transformation in digital art itself, where artists increasingly blend disciplines, challenge norms, and utilize emerging technologies to express complex ideas." A few notable examples of CLOT's tentacular reach include collaborations with Goldsmith's Digital Arts Computing BSc, helmed by Rachel Falconer, write-ups by the likes of Natalie Mariko, Irem Erkin, Katažyna Jankovska, and Mila Azimonti, and play-by-play reporting on the Mutek AI Ecologies Lab's hackathon. Curator Cansu Peker founded Digital Arts Blog for a simple reason: support artists in their efforts to be seen. “The great thing about digital art is that all I need to spotlight someone's work is a JPEG file, which can be sent in moments from anywhere in the world,” Peker explained. Peker once had a film professor who encouraged his students to produce “essential work,” alleging that the world didn't need most art. Though doubtful of his claims, Peker proposes digital art as a compelling countering argument: digital artists create the most powerful and exciting forms of screen-based visuals, which businesses and brands actually need. “We're building toward a platform that not only showcases digital art but also lets the community participate, via user-generated content and a space where anyone can post opportunities or projects," Peker ruminated. Electric Chronicles was launched in late 2024 as a dynamic hub facilitated by the Trilitech Arts team and a number of contributors dedicated to featuring both the creators who're integrating new technologies into their artistic practices and the collectors supporting them in significant ways. What began as a series of spotlights developed into more consistent and expansive narratives. Today Electric Chronicles is actively documenting and contextualizing a wide breadth of practices reshaping contemporary art. Currently, Electric Chronicles has four core editorial approaches: documenting real-world events, conducting in-depth interviews with collectors, spotlighting new projects, and offering deep-dives into some of the most prominent digital collections. Through its approach, the publication aims to become a key reference point for those interested in understanding where the broader digital art ecosystem is heading. Aleksandra Artamonovskaja, who heads Trilitech's art team, revealed they're working on partner collaborations and “experimenting with formats that create deeper connections.” Given her extensive community building experience, it's wise to stay tuned. Through their Fakewhale Log, they document digital practices that are driving the narrative forward. Its approach hopes to provide vital resources for informing artists, collectors, and institutions, equipping them with the knowledge and tools to navigate an evolving landscape confidently. Recently, they published an in-depth article on the implications of collecting digital works that are presented with physical vessels. This article also delved into networked projects, such as Andreas Raus' eloquent and multifaceted Symphony for n Metronomes, released in partnership with Fakewhale Gallery, the platform's equally dynamic curatorial branch. Le Random's editorial wing was founded with a clear vision: “Publish content that enables the generative art community to understand its past, curate its present and anticipate its future.” Led by the thoughtful Peter Bauman since late 2022, Le Random publishes weekly Editorials, a podcast, a YouTube Channel and their widely celebrated Generative Art Timeline. Conrad House, who joined at the same time as Bauman, is Le Random's Collection Lead. Though initially focused on digital generative art, Le Random now pursues a more generous understanding of generativity, one that includes digital and material practices and that subscribes to Philip Galanter's system-based definition. As Bauman explained during our interview: “Due to the stochastic nature of neural networks, deep learning at its core is generative. AI art since the days of Harold Cohen with hard-programmed expert systems has been generative.” Paul's response: “Putting a text prompt into an image generator and creating beautiful—or not—visuals does not automatically result in AI art. When asked to contemplate where the future might take Le Random, Bauman's response was characteristically clear-minded: “We're headed where the artists working with technology go.” ArtReview and Nowness joined forces to create a space where artists working, engaging, and experimenting with emerging tech in relevant ways could share their art with a global audience. The online platform for MC2 launched just a month ago, in July, but the groundwork began in 2024 when ArtReview and Nowness conducted a global study on AI and creativity. The report captured global insights from artists, filmmakers, scholars, and audiences to help us better understand how AI is being used in creative practices and what implications it holds for the future. “What's been fascinating to see is how imaginative artists are with tech—it's not just about robots or algorithms; there's a strong sense of a human hand and artistic mind at work in the video pieces we've presented so far in our inaugural season, Alternate Realities,” Alaric Xinhao Cao, the platform's director, explained. On that note, they recently featured the work of Nouf Aljowaysir and Jonas Lund, artists who're exploring complex themes of (dis)embodied identity via AI (mis)representation. Expect much more to come from MC2, including hybrid formats, curated screenings, public programs, institutional partnerships, and investigative research. Now Media is the brainchild of Matt Medved (a fellow Forbes contributor) and Alejandro Navia, who launched it to report on the ins and outs of onchain art with a decidedly humanistic approach. “From day one, our mission has been to empower the creators of culture and bring this movement from niche to mainstream,” Medved told me in an interview. The Gateway's second iteration took place across multiple blocks of downtown Miami, filling them with pulsating digital art. Now Media has also hosted awards ceremonies, celebrating the accomplishments of a then-nascent—yet vigorous—Web3 community that were too often dismissed. Founded by Italian designer and art director Marco Pittarello in 2023, this bi-monthly print publication tracks what it considers to be a historic moment of rapid and profound change in creative practices, driven by the advent of generative AI. In a short period of time, PROMPT Magazine has flourished into a vibrant hub that hosts open calls, exhibitions, and special projects, collaborating with various festivals and universities. For Pittarello, it's exceedingly important to reach beyond the screen, where much of the digital art ecosystem's dissemination takes place, making it inaccessible for some. “Creating physical spaces for interaction—whether through events or the print publication itself—helps foster a broader and more global understanding of digital art,” Pittarrello affirmed. Regardless of the theme, every issue of PROMPT  brings together curators and writers from across the globe to explore ideas around generative AI, making it a powerful reference point for artists, galleries, and brands in discovering new talent and defining shared meaning. In 2021, following that year's historic NFT bull run, Jason Bailey and Chris King founded a company geared toward providing two essential services. ClubNFT launched as a safety net to protect the digital artifacts transacted via NFTs, backing up more than a million digital artworks and assets owned by the world's leading collectors. Through its editorial wing, Right Click Save, they also sought to offer critical discourse about art on the blockchain. Right Click Save, or RCS, has been helmed by art historian and editor extraordinaire Alex Estorick since inception. Under Estorick's watch, RCS has contextualized a movement for a new generation of collectors who're engaging with digital art as an asset class, establishing the cultural and historical lens through which these collectors might come closer to the very works they're acquiring. Case in point, Estorick hosted an interview between Art Blocks founder Erick Calderón and Mitchell F. Chan to celebrate the debut of Calderon's video game art piece LIFT. When I spoke to Estorick for Forbes, he expressed: “I'm proud that the magazine has always been a listening exercise that supports an inclusive vision of the art world, one that recognizes the true hybridity of contemporary practices, which increasingly cross-fertilise digital and analog media and human and nonhuman domains.” A formal announcement is imminent, but, for now, Estorick is happy to affirm: “As the digital and mainstream art worlds increasingly engage with one another, RCS will continue to serve as a bridge between their different communities by spotlighting artists at the intersection of art and technology.” As if all these publications weren't enough, two additional outlets must be mentioned. An eclectic mix of Web3-native headlines, from sales stats to upcoming events to brief artist shout outs, make this missive a must-read for any follower of the tokenized digital art community. This neighborhood bulletin board is free to read for any who wish to subscribe and is composed by one of today's most important digital art patrons, the anonymous Cozomo de'Medici “from [his] desk at the villa.” For daily capsules of crypto art commentary, follow Cozomo on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Their soon-to-be editorial efforts are helmed by formidable writer Nina Knaack, creator of WHITE MIRROR, a publication that's been placed on pause as she focuses on the imminent release of Silk Magazine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto exchange shops now greet customers in shopping malls. Hundreds of crypto ATMs have sprung up along the city's busy streets. And last week, Eric Trump – son of United States President Donald Trump and now a central figure in the family's crypto empire – was featured at the Bitcoin Asia summit in the global financial center. Hong Kong has ambitious plans to tap into the $3.8 trillion digital assets market with new legislation rolled out last month that will allow licensed businesses to issue stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to real-world assets like the US dollar. Some potential issuers have expressed frustration at the government's stringent requirements, like huge liquid reserve and client identity verification for anti-money laundering, which raises compliance costs, according to two industry sources familiar with relevant discussions. A few of these potential issuers who earlier expressed strong interest have now taken a wait-and-see approach, as they are hesitant to apply in the first licensing round, one of the sources added. An update in June declared its “commitment to establishing Hong Kong as a premier global hub for digital assets.” Beyond a bid to strengthen its position as an international financial hub, Hong Kong's push into stablecoins underscores China's growing interest in the sector. A thaw in Beijing's rhetoric in recent months reflects its bid to internationalize the yuan amid concerns that US dollar-backed stablecoins could further the greenback's hegemony. But its tight capital controls may prevent it from adopting the technology just yet. Dozens of firms have already expressed interest in applying for licenses to issue stablecoins, including major banks and tech companies such as Bank of China, China's ecommerce giant JD.com and Alibaba affiliate Ant Group. Yat Siu, executive chairman and founder of Web3 video gaming company Animoca Brands, described Hong Kong's stablecoin regime as the most advanced in Asia. Last month, Siu's company formed a joint venture, Anchorpoint, along with Standard Chartered bank and Hong Kong Telecom to apply for a stablecoin license. Siu noted that one key restriction posed by the stablecoin rules is the requirement for issuers to back their tokens fully with “very liquid treasuries.” The HKMA mandates that issuers maintain at least HK$25 million ($3.2 million) in capital, with reserves held in high-quality assets in segregated accounts and available for prompt redemption. Experts say these measures help ensure stability and protect holders, but also effectively shut out smaller players. Esme Pau, head of capital markets at blockchain security firm Certik, said the top hurdle facing stablecoin issuers is the “stringent safeguards” that contribute to a steep cost of entry. Principal among them is the Know-Your-Customer rules designed to curb money laundering, which drive up compliance expenses significantly, she explained. In one example, the HKMA expects stablecoin issuers to conduct rigorous identity checks on customers for transactions of HK$8,000 ($1,027) or above. “Such obligations create a challenging calculus: obtaining a license under the existing regime may limit near-term profitability, which explains fading market enthusiasm,” Pau said, adding that the high bar for issuers, however, produce a more resilient and trusted stablecoin ecosystem. Still, she struck a hopeful note, expecting the regulatory regime to evolve. “HKMA is adopting a prudent stance at launch. If implementation proceeds smoothly, requirements are likely to be recalibrated in a more commercially viable direction over time,” she said. But with the requirements resembling those imposed on banks, experts said Hong Kong regulators are likely to award the first batch of licenses to established financial institutions. That means the initial use will likely be limited to business-to-business scenarios rather than retail investors. “Entry is limited to large, well-capitalized issuers with strong compliance, operational resilience, and clear economic use cases – underscoring HKMA's high bar for sustainable, utility-driven stablecoin models,” Morgan Stanley's China economist Jenny Zheng wrote in a July report. Cryptocurrency is integrating with traditional finance more than ever before, thanks to legislative changes in Washington, like President Trump's recent executive order to allow for digital assets like crypto to be included in 401(k)s. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout reports from Bitcoin Asia 2025 in Hong Kong. At last week's Bitcoin Asia summit in Hong Kong, over 17,000 local and international attendees flocked to talks by industry experts. Despite China's restrictions on most crypto activities, the country boasts more crypto users than the US, with over 78 million owners, according to digital payment firm Triple A's 2023 estimate. Their citizens own a huge percentage of bitcoin. The annual bitcoin gathering came amid Beijing's softening stance on crypto and stablecoins. At China's top financial forum in June, central bank governor Pan Gongsheng highlighted stablecoins' role in facilitating cross-border payments at a faster pace, saying they have “fundamentally reshaped the traditional financial landscape. “After the passage of Genius Act, the use of stablecoins has extended beyond American borders, with other countries adopting similar mechanisms that, in effect, reinforce US dollar dominance,” he said. To boost the Chinese currency's digital presence, JD.com and Ant Group have urged China's central bank to authorize the launch of offshore yuan-backed stablecoins in Hong Kong to counter the dominance of US dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, Reuters reported in June, citing anonymous sources. Experts, however, said yuan-backed stablecoins are unlikely to emerge anytime soon — at least not until Hong Kong dollar–pegged tokens have proven successful. And so, this is just a perfect laboratory to trial some of these bleeding edge technologies,” Bailey said. For now, much depends on how the first batch of licenses is rolled out and the stablecoins are brought into circulation. Emil Chan, co-chair at industry group Hong Kong Digital Finance Association, said the broader challenge to the city's crypto hub ambitions is the conservative culture of its finance industry because of its long-standing success. Chan, who also teaches corporate executives in the city's universities, noted that few of these professionals have hands-on experience with digital wallets for cryptocurrency. Hong Kong's legacy as a leader in traditional finance, he said, is “restricting us from opening up our mind and embracing new products,” he said.
