                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery, the journal from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, suggests that prenatal detection of congenital heart disease (CHD) has improved in recent years largely due to advances in ultrasound screening practices. However, the study also found that detection rates still vary by region and type of defect, pointing to a need for continued improvements in prenatal care. Prenatal detection rates of CHD steadily increased from 2006 to 2023, reflecting advances in ultrasound screening. Highlighting the impact of the 2013 guideline updates, prenatal detection rates have increased for lesions not routinely detected on a 4-chamber view but visible on outflow tract views, in comparison to those routinely detected on a 4-chamber view. Despite overall progress, detection rates still vary significantly by region and type of defect. These differences reflect persistent disparities in prenatal CHD diagnosis across the U.S." The study analyzed data from the STS Congenital Heart Surgery Database, covering over 100,000 infants who had initial heart surgeries over 17.5 years. Researchers compared prenatal CHD detection rates before and after the 2013 ultrasound guideline update, breaking down findings by year, region, defect type, and imaging method (standard vs. advanced views). While the study shows progress in prenatal CHD detection, some lesion types remain underdetected, highlighting the need for continued improvements in obstetric screening. Future research should examine how earlier detection affects surgical timing, postnatal outcomes, and long-term health, as well as whether higher detection rates translate into improved results.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Medicines containing a type of PFAS or 'forever chemical' called fluorine are not leading to higher numbers of adverse drug reactions according to new data analysis. In a new paper published in PLOS ONE today, researchers from the University of Birmingham studied data from the MHRA's Yellow Card system on 13 drugs containing carbon-fluorine bonds as well as six drugs which were structurally similar but not containing this forever chemical. Using five years of data from 2019-2024, the research team analysed the number of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) per 1 million medicines dispensed. They found that most of the ADRs that were listed for drugs containing fluorine were associated with conditions outside of the scope of usual side effects from PFAS, and the highest prescribed drug lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acid, had a low rate of 14.1 ADRs per 1m items. Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are often referred to as "forever chemicals" due to their persistence in the environment and effects on human health. PFAS are found in a range of everyday products such as cookware or clothing. Recent changes to the classification of PFAS means certain essential medicines are now deemed to contain forever chemicals. In this study we explored adverse drug reactions reported to the MHRA Yellow Card scheme relative to their prescribing rate. Among the drugs with the highest level of fluorine, sitagliptin and flecainide didn't see highest levels of reactions. Observational suspected adverse drug reaction profiles of fluoro-pharmaceuticals and potential mimicry of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the United Kingdom.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The trial, led by Professor Robert Bals, Director of the Department of Internal Medicine V at Saarland University Medical Center and Professor of Internal Medicine at Saarland University, divided the 450 participants into two groups. During that same period, the 223 participants in the control group used a placebo spray three times a day. All infections were confirmed by PCR testing. In addition to showing a marked reduction in coronavirus infections, the azelastine group also displayed fewer symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, a lower overall number of confirmed respiratory infections, and, unexpectedly, a reduced incidence of rhinovirus infections, another major cause of respiratory illness. In the treatment group, 1.8% developed a rhinovirus infection, compared to 6.3% in the placebo group-a proportion similar to that seen for SARS-CoV-2. Previous in vitro studies on azelastine had already suggested antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. For Robert Bals, the results suggest practical applications: 'Azelastine nasal spray could provide an additional easily accessible prophylactic to complement existing protective measures, especially for vulnerable groups, during periods of high infection rates, or before travelling.' But Professor Bals also stressed the importance of further research: 'Our results highlight the need for larger, multicentre trials to continue exploring the use of azelastine nasal sprays as an on-demand preventive treatment, and to examine its potential effectiveness against other respiratory pathogens.' The Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland (HIPS) contributed through the research groups of Professor Smola and Professor Bals. The project serves as an excellent example of successful collaboration between academic research, industry partners and public health initiatives in the Saarland region.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new study, researchers from the University of Chicago discovered that zeaxanthin, a plant-derived carotenoid best known for protecting vision, may also act as an immune-boosting compound by strengthening the cancer-fighting activity of immune cells. We were surprised to find that zeaxanthin, already known for its role in eye health, has a completely new function in boosting anti-tumor immunity. Our study show that a simple dietary nutrient could complement and strengthen advanced cancer treatments like immunotherapy." By screening a large blood nutrient library, the team identified zeaxanthin as a compound that directly enhances the activity of CD8+ T cells, a crucial type of immune cell that kills tumor cells. This, in turn, triggers more robust intracellular signaling that boosts T-cell activation, cytokine production, and tumor-killing capacity. In mouse models, dietary supplementation with zeaxanthin slowed tumor growth. Importantly, when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors – a type of immunotherapy that has transformed cancer treatment in recent years – zeaxanthin significantly enhanced anti-tumor effects compared to immunotherapy alone. To extend the findings, the researchers tested human T cells engineered to recognize specific tumor antigens and found that zeaxanthin treatment improved these cells' ability to kill melanoma, multiple myeloma, and glioblastoma cells in laboratory experiments. "Our data show that zeaxanthin improves both natural and engineered T-cell responses, which suggests high translational potential for patients undergoing immunotherapies," Chen said. Zeaxanthin is sold as an over-the-counter supplement for eye health, and is naturally found in vegetables like orange peppers, spinach, and kale. It's inexpensive, widely available, well-tolerated and, most importantly, its safety profile is known – which means it can be safely tested as an adjunct to cancer therapies. In their previous research, Chen's group discovered that trans-vaccenic acid (TVA), a fatty acid derived from dairy and meat, also boosts T-cell activity – but through a different mechanism. Together, the findings suggest that nutrients from both plant and animal sources may provide complementary benefits to immune health. Most of the findings come from laboratory experiments and animal studies. Thus, clinical trials will be needed to determine whether zeaxanthin supplements can improve outcomes for cancer patients. "Our findings open a new field of nutritional immunology that looks at how specific dietary components interact with the immune system at the molecular level," Chen said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The use of assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization is becoming more common worldwide. However, while these technologies successfully create viable embryos, a little over half of all embryos are lost because they fail to implant into the uterus. These challenges made researchers wonder: what if they could find a way to keep part of the uterus alive outside of the body, so that implantation could be observed without any barriers? Previous studies have used model embryos, created from stem cells, to emulate embryonic development pre- and post-implantation. However, without the uterus, they cannot genuinely replicate embryo implantation, and studies have been unable to recreate this process." Using a specialized culture method, in which mouse uterine tissue is positioned between liquid and gas surfaces on either side, the researchers were able to place mouse embryos onto small pieces of endometrium tissue. They could then evaluate how the embryos implanted and developed. Impressively, their technique had over 90% efficacy for implantation, which was followed by embryo development and invasion of the uterine lining by the embryo. "We also saw some features that are characteristic of what happens in implantation inside the body," says Masahito Ikawa, senior author. They found that embryonic AKT, a protein that is involved in placental formation and arrangement as well as in cell survival, migration, and invasion, was affected by maternal COX-2. "Further experiments indicated that introducing an activated form of AKT into embryos recovered defective implantation that was triggered by maternal COX-2 inhibition," confirms Ikawa. It may also improve implantation rates in assisted reproductive technologies, thereby allowing families with previously untreatable conditions to achieve their dreams. Hiraoka, T., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many of her calls never got past the hold music. Frank and her husband, Allen, faced that ellipse of frustration because they were among 90,000 central Missouri patients caught in the middle of a contract dispute between University of Missouri, or MU, Health Care, a Columbia, Missouri-based health system, and Anthem, the couple's health insurance provider. The companies let their contract expire in April after failing to strike a deal to keep the hospital system and its clinics in-network. In New York City, negotiations between UnitedHealthcare and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center missed a June 30 deadline, briefly leaving some patients in limbo until a deal was reached the next day. And the Franks were nearly caught out-of-network previously, when a 2023 contract dispute between Anthem and a primary care group in Jefferson City, Missouri, prompted the couple to switch some providers to MU Health Care. Indeed, 18% of non-federal hospitals experienced at least one documented case of public brinksmanship with an insurance company from June 2021 to May 2025, according to preliminary findings by Jason Buxbaum, a health policy researcher at the Brown University School of Health. Over the same period, 8% of hospitals ultimately went out-of-network with an insurer, at least for a time. Industry observers say long-standing trends like hospital consolidation and rising health care costs contribute to the disputes, and Trump administration policies could make them more frequent as hospitals brace for about $1 trillion in cuts to federal health care spending as part of President Donald Trump's sweeping budget law. "They're going to be more hard-nosed at negotiating with the health plans because they're going to be in a survival mode," said John Baackes, a retired insurance executive and former board member of America's Health Insurance Plans, the national trade group representing the health insurance industry. Most people were unable to switch insurance midyear and faced the choice of paying higher prices upfront, delaying care, finding new providers, or running a paperwork gauntlet in hopes their medical conditions qualified for a 90-day coverage extension. When it happened, Amy drove him 24 miles to the nearest emergency room. The facility in Jefferson City had recently been taken over by MU Health Care, and Allen was soon transferred 30 miles farther by ground ambulance to the system's main hospital in Columbia for surgery to insert two metal plates and several screws to repair his collarbone. Health care consolidation has been booming nationwide for 30 years, with over 2,000 hospital mergers announced since 1998, including 428 from 2018 to 2023. Mergers may lead to some efficiencies and benefits for consumers, but they also reduce market competition and strengthen the hand of hospitals in negotiations with insurers. "Insurer markets have been consolidated for a long time," Brown's Buxbaum said. "What's changed is how consolidated the hospital markets have become." Now if a hospital system drops out of a network, he said, "it's not just going to be one key hospital. It's much more likely to be all the key facilities, or many of the critical mass of providers" in an area. In a statement, Buddy Castellano, spokesperson for Anthem's parent company, Elevance Health, wrote, "We approach negotiations with a focus on fairness, transparency, and respect for everyone impacted. Health plan rate discussions are complex and require thoughtful collaboration to ensure long-term sustainability. Our commitment remains clear: ensuring access to care while keeping coverage affordable for the families, employers, and communities we serve." A federal law dubbed the No Surprises Act, which took effect in 2022, offers protections for some patients whose provider drops out of network due to a contract dispute. People getting treatment for serious conditions can keep their in-network rates for up to 90 days with their current providers, delaying the need to find a new one or face higher rates. So Amy Frank worked the phones to get that continuity of care for her husband. If we go out-of-network, we're going to have to start completely over for the out-of-network deductible," she said. But when he showed up for an appointment to get an injection in his injured shoulder, he was told the health system didn't have a record of the approval. "It's just very frustrating," Amy Frank said in early July, before the sides had reached a deal. "I've got my own medical issues, and I don't feel like mine are bad enough to be fighting for a continuity of care." In an email, MU Health Care spokesperson Eric Maze wrote: "While our goal was to reach agreement prior to our contract terminating and to avoid disruption in care, we established processes and resources well in advance to facilitate continuity of care and reduce the burden for our patients. Rising health care costs are fueling contract disputes. Labor costs are the biggest driver, with advertised nursing salaries rising 26.6% faster than inflation from 2020 to 2024, the brief noted. Washington University in St. Louis health economist Tim McBride said that dynamic could be further enflamed by the massive tax-and-spending law. The measure makes significant cuts to federal health care spending over the next decade, including a $911 billion drop in Medicaid spending, and is expected to cause 10 million Americans to lose their insurance. On June 30, three months into the standoff, the Missouri Senate Insurance and Banking Committee called the two sides in for a hearing that broke months of deadlock and prompted new proposals from Anthem. "Anthem doubled their rate increase offer," Missouri Senate President Cindy O'Laughlin, a Republican whose district includes parts of central Missouri, wrote in a Facebook post on July 8, encouraging a deal. Amy Frank got several texts from friends and family about the agreement. "So you put everybody through all of this for nothing?" She had already sunk hours on the phone to ensure Allen's July 31 surgery to repair the plates holding his clavicle together would be covered. She was in no rush to call her doctors to reschedule the appointments she'd skipped, figuring their phone lines would be busy. The experience had her wondering if the two sides were trying to get people upset as a bargaining tactic. And after going through two disputes in three years, she can't help but wonder: How long until the next one?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That might be business-as-usual in this economy, but it wasn't business; he had called the Social Security Administration, where the questions often aren't generic and the callers tend to be older, disabled, or otherwise vulnerable Americans. McGing, calling on behalf of his son, had an in-the-weeds question: how to prevent overpayments that the federal government might later claw back. His call was intercepted by an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot. No matter what he said, the bot parroted canned answers to generic questions, not McGing's obscure query. Eventually, the bot "glitched or whatever" and got him to an agent. Unbeknownst to McGing, a former Social Security employee in Maryland, he had encountered a technological tool recently introduced by the agency. "With the new administration, they're just kind of like, let's go fast and fix it later, which I don't agree with, because you are going to generate a lot of confusion," said Marcela Escobar-Alava, who served as Social Security's chief information officer under President Joe Biden. In a survey conducted last fall, more than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford such necessities as food, clothing, or housing without it. At least some beneficiaries don't like it: Social Security's Facebook page is, from time to time, pockmarked with negative reviews of the uncooperative bot, as the agency said in July that nearly 41% of calls are handled by the bot. Lawmakers and former agency employees worry it foreshadows a less human Social Security, in which rushed-out AI takes the place of pushed-out, experienced employees. In May, a group of House Republicans wrote to the Social Security Administration expressing support for government efficiency, but cautioning that their constituents had criticized the agency for "inadequate customer service" and suggesting that some measures may be "overly burdensome." He has a laundry list of initiatives on which to spend the $600 million in new tech money in the Trump administration's fiscal 2026 budget request. "You referred to SSA being on an all-time staffing low; it's also at an all-time technological high," he snapped at one Democrat in a House hearing in late June. "Social Security's new AI phone tool is making it even harder for people to get help over the phone — and near impossible if someone needs an American Sign Language interpreter or translator," Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) Spokespeople for the agency did not reply to questions from KFF Health News. Using AI to automate customer service is one of the buzziest businesses in Silicon Valley. In theory, the new breed of artificial intelligence technologies can smoothly respond, in a human-like voice, to just about any question. That's not how the Social Security Administration's bot seems to work, with users reporting canned, unrelated responses. The Trump administration has eliminated some online statistics that obscure its true performance, said Kathleen Romig, a former agency official who is now director of Social Security and disability policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The old website showed that most callers waited two hours for an answer. Now, the website doesn't show waiting times, either for phone inquiries (once callback wait time is accounted for) or appointment scheduling. While statistics are being posted that show beneficiaries receive help — that is, using the AI bot or the agency's website to accomplish tasks like getting a replacement card — Romig said she thinks it's a "very distorted view" overall. Reviews of the AI bot are often poor, she said. Escobar-Alava said they had worked on such a bot, but wanted to clean up the policy and regulation data it was relying on first. Romig said one former executive told her that the agency had used canned FAQs without modifications or nuances to accommodate individual situations and was monitoring the technology to see how well it performed. In a letter to Warren, he said that agency leaders "are transforming SSA into a digital-first agency that meets customers where they want to be met," making changes that allow the vast majority of calls to be handled either in an automated fashion or by having a human return the customer's call. Using these methods also relieves burdens on otherwise beleaguered field offices, Bisignano wrote. The agency asked Congress for some $600 million in additional funding for investments, which he intends to use for online scheduling, detecting fraud, and much more, according to a list submitted to the House in late June. The agency has been updating its technology for years, but that does not necessarily mean thousands of its workers are suddenly obsolete, Romig said. It's not bad that the upgrades are continuing, she said, but progress has been more incremental than revolutionary. Some changes focus on spiffing up the agency's public face. Bisignano told House lawmakers that he oversaw a redesign of the agency's performance-statistics page to emphasize the number of automated calls and deemphasize statistics about call wait times. He called the latter stats "discouraging" and suggested that displaying them online might dissuade beneficiaries from calling. Warren said Bisignano has since told her privately that he would allow an "inspector general audit" of their customer-service quality data and pledged to make a list of performance information publicly available. The agency has since updated its performance statistics page. Other changes would come at greater cost and effort. In April, the agency rolled out a security authentication program for direct deposit changes, requiring beneficiaries to verify their identity in person if what the agency described in regulatory documents as an "automated" analysis system detects anomalies. According to documents accompanying the proposal, the agency estimated about 5.8 million beneficiaries would be affected — and that it would cost the federal government nearly $1.2 billion, mostly driven by staff time devoted to assisting claimants. It turned out that the agency had flagged her account for fraud.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a small but revealing study, scientists discovered that tears strongly mirror blood glucose and saliva may reflect vitamin D status. Study: Tears and Saliva as Biological Matrices for Vitamin D and Glucose Assessment: A Pilot Study. A new study published in the journal Physiologia explores the feasibility of saliva and tears as alternative biological fluids for measuring vitamin D and glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. It can be ingested through diet or synthesized in the human skin using high-energy ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It also plays crucial roles in reducing inflammation, promoting immune functions, and is linked to glucose metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to a range of health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and microbial infections. However, in most cases, vitamin D levels are primarily measured in blood samples, not other biological fluids. In the current study, researchers explored the feasibility of using other biological fluids, including saliva and tears, to assess vitamin D and glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study population included six adult patients with type 2 diabetes and eight healthy adults. After a minimum of three hours of fasting, blood, tears, and saliva samples were collected from the participants and analyzed using the electrochemiluminescence method to assess vitamin D and glucose levels. The biochemical assessment revealed similar vitamin D levels in blood samples collected from diabetic and healthy participants. A slightly higher blood vitamin D level in diabetic patients might be the effect of supplementation. However, no effect of supplementation was observed on vitamin D levels in saliva and tears samples. The correlation analysis between collected samples revealed that a higher blood vitamin D level is significantly associated with a lower salivary vitamin D level. A similar but non-significant negative correlation was observed between vitamin D levels in blood and tears. The study found a significantly positive association between blood and tears samples regarding glucose levels. The study suggests that saliva and tears indicate potential feasibility as alternative biological matrices for assessing vitamin D and glucose levels in diabetic patients and healthy adults. Existing evidence reports low vitamin D levels in blood and saliva samples collected from newly diagnosed diabetic patients. The current study reports a negative correlation between blood and salivary vitamin D levels in diabetic patients diagnosed with the disease for at least five years. These findings, therefore, suggest that salivary levels may reflect blood levels of vitamin D only in certain conditions. The study also finds a tendency toward a negative correlation between blood and tears vitamin D levels, with tears samples containing higher levels of this vitamin than blood samples in both diabetic and healthy adults. This observation indicates potential, but it has not yet been established as a reliable matrix for vitamin D detection. However, in contrast to the current study findings, previous studies involving healthy volunteers have shown a positive correlation between blood and tear levels of vitamin D. This difference in findings suggests that individuals' health conditions may potentially influence vitamin D levels in different biological samples. The study finds a significant positive correlation between blood and tear samples regarding glucose levels in diabetic patients. This suggests that tear sampling may serve as a potentially dependable, noninvasive alternative approach for glucose level monitoring in diabetic patients. Overall, the study highlights the potential feasibility of tear samples for glucose measurement and raises the possibility of saliva samples reflecting serum vitamin D under certain conditions. Still, it emphasizes that these findings are preliminary. However, researchers explain that it is vital to establish specific reference intervals for each biological fluid before clinical application, as differences in protein content, pH, enzymatic activity, and viscosity between these matrices are known to affect analyte distribution and assay performance. Since the study included a small number of participants, further large-scale studies are required to confirm the observed correlations and develop an accurate equation for estimating these biochemical parameters in these alternative matrices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Noninferiority was not demonstrated between immediate and staged complete revascularisation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and multivessel disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), according to late-breaking research presented in a Hot Line session today at ESC Congress 20251. Multivessel coronary artery disease - when at least two coronary arteries are blocked - affects almost half of patients who have STEMI, a type of heart attack. ESC Guidelines recommend complete revascularisation with PCI in patients with STEMI and multivessel disease, involving treating the blocked artery that caused the heart attack (culprit lesion) plus other affected vessels (non-culprit lesions).2 We included a broad population of patients with STEMI and multivessel coronary artery disease." Patients were eligible if they presented with STEMI and multivessel coronary artery disease and underwent successful PCI for a culprit artery. Patients were randomised 1:1 to either immediate complete revascularisation with simultaneous PCI for the culprit and non-culprit lesions or staged complete revascularisation that included PCI for non-culprit lesions on another day during the index hospitalisation. Median age was 66 years and 79% of patients were men. At 1 year, the primary endpoint of death, MI and any unplanned revascularisation occurred in 13.1% of patients in the immediate group and 10.8% in the staged group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86 to 1.79; p for noninferiority=0.24), with noninferiority not established. Immediate complete revascularisation was associated with more harm in patients with signs of heart failure (Killip class ≥II: HR 1.79; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.05) than in patients without heart failure signs (Killip class I: HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.41; p for interaction=0.04). In the OPTION-STEMI trial, immediate complete revascularisation was not noninferior to staged complete revascularisation during index hospitalisation, meaning we do not have conclusive evidence that immediate is similar to staged complete revascularisation." Youngkeun Ahn, Study Principal Investigator and Professor, Chonnam National University Hospital Ahn added, "Two recent trials have shown that immediate complete revascularisation was noninferior to staged complete revascularisation; however, one trial enrolled STEMI or non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome patients, while the other enrolled STEMI patients at low clinical risk." Given our findings in patients with signs of heart failure, it seems prudent to limit immediate complete revascularisation to stable STEMI patients with multivessel disease at low clinical risk," Ahn concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the University of Southampton, examining worldwide variations in funding for cancer research, say there's a pressing need to invest more in lower-income countries. They also reveal research into certain treatments urgently need more money, in particular surgery and radiotherapy, and that overall annual research investment has largely decreased globally since 2016. Globally, cancer is responsible for one in five deaths. Inequalities in investment across nations and low research funding for certain treatments can lead to an imbalance in the cancers we can tackle and the areas of the world benefiting. It's crucial we understand how and where money is allocated." Dr. Michael Head, Study Lead Author and Senior Research Fellow, University of Southampton They used machine learning, large language models, and expert scrutiny to analyse the allocation and distribution of grants. Largely, this funding was invested back into these lead nations and less so towards lower income countries. Globally, low-income countries received a tiny proportion of cancer research awards totalling just $8.4m, which equates to less than 0.1 percent of money awarded during the study period. The researchers point to this as a problem, as these countries carry a heavy cancer burden, and inequalities restrict the ability for all to benefit from cancer knowledge. Anbang Du, another lead author from the University of Southampton, cautions: "Unless we scale up targeted investments and build local research capacity, the inequalities will continue to persist – if the US reduces its funding, that gap will widen even further. It is crucial for nation groups like the Commonwealth to coordinate efforts to mobilise funding, build sustained partnerships and strengthen training and infrastructure so that advances in cancer science benefit everyone, everywhere." However, cancer surgery and radiotherapy research were found to be particularly underfunded at 1.7 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively. Both these treatments are integral to a wide spectrum of cancer care, causing the researchers to urge a strong case for increased funding in these areas. Apart from a sharp increase in 2021, global cancer research investment has decreased annually, with the Commonwealth following this trend. Investment from five BRICS countries, including Russia, India and China, rose until 2018, but has since declined.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Depression alters how people pursue rewards, but, conversely, whether depressive symptoms influence how people learn to avoid nonrewarding, unpleasant events is less clear. Ryan Tomm and colleagues, from the University of British Colombia, addressed this question in their eNeuro paper to shed more light on the relationship between depression and learning. This work brought together researchers from preclinical, cognitive, and clinical backgrounds, building stronger connections across fields to better understand the mechanisms of depression. The researchers developed a behavioral task for study volunteers based off rodent research that involves participants listening to sounds while looking at a screen with visual cues signaling sounds to come. From a sample of 465 participants with a wide range of depressive symptoms from low to severe, the researchers found that people with more severe symptoms struggled to learn to actively avoid aversive sounds compared to those with less severe symptoms. However, once they did learn the task, their ability to actively avoid unpleasant sounds matched those with less symptoms. Thus, according to the authors, depressive symptoms may interfere specifically with learning to actively avoid unpleasant events, rather than with avoidance more broadly. What we still don't know, is how depressive symptoms affect avoidance when people continue to learn after being proficient at an avoidance task, or in more complex situations where the best way to avoid something is unclear. As we actively explore these questions, we hope our work will provide a deeper understanding of how depression shapes avoidance behavior across different contexts."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although this type of tumor is usually not life-threatening, the unchecked growth of tumor cells can disrupt normal brain development and function. Current treatments focus mainly on removing the tumor cells, but recent studies have shown that non-cancerous cells, such as nerve cells, also play a role in brain tumor formation and growth, suggesting novel approaches to treating these cancers. Scientists have long known that a nerve cell signaling chemical called glutamate can increase growth of cancers throughout the body, but despite years of investigation, they haven't figured out exactly how this happens, or how to stop it. Now, an interdisciplinary team of researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis has uncovered how glutamate regulates pediatric brain tumor growth. They also observed that drugs that block these glutamate receptors - including memantine, which is approved to treat dementia and Alzheimer's disease - reduced human pediatric brain tumor growth in mice, a finding that points to a potential new treatment opportunity. With these kinds of pediatric brain tumors, we just don't have that many tools in our toolbox for treating patients. The potential to repurpose drugs that are already in use for other neurological disorders means we may have another trick up our sleeves for treating patients." David Gutmann, MD, PhD, senior author, the Donald O. Schnuck Family Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine The research team, which included first author Corina Anastasaki, PhD, a research assistant professor of neurology at WashU Medicine, also showed for the first time that glutamate receptors abnormally couple with growth receptors in PAs to fuel the tumors. Glutamate is what is known as a neurotransmitter, a molecule that nerve cells, including neurons in the brain, use to communicate with each other. On their path to understand how glutamate helps brain tumors grow, Gutmann, who is also the director of the Neurofibromatosis Center at WashU Medicine, and Anastasaki worked closely with collaborators across WashU Medicine - including in neurosurgery, pediatrics, genetics, neuropathology, biostatistics and more - to acquire and analyze samples of PAs that had been surgically removed. They found that these PA cells had unusually high levels of glutamate receptors. By testing how glutamate affected these tumors, the researchers discovered that glutamate increased PA cell numbers by kicking off a chain reaction inside the tumor cells that urged cells to divide. These findings suggest that tumor cells exploit normal brain-cell interactions to spur their own growth. "This novel mechanism for tumor growth combines two normal but unconnected brain processes - growth and electrical signaling - in an aberrant way," Anastasaki said. Understanding that will tell us why tumors grow and behave the way they do. That may lead to us treating them very differently." The researchers showed that inhibiting glutamate receptors of tumor cells in mice with PAs - either with medications or by genetically altering the cells - reduced tumor growth. The next steps are to determine whether such medications are safe to use in children with brain tumors and in what amounts they would be effective, Gutmann noted, which will require clinical trials. "This study provides compelling preclinical data to look at medications that are otherwise safe and approved to treat other neurological conditions," Gutmann said. "That would enable new therapeutic approaches and could help minimize the damage to a child's developing brain by reducing engagement between brain cells and tumor cells."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dual antiplatelet therapy after heart bypass surgery is not more effective than aspirin alone - and it increases the risk of excessive bleeding. This has now been shown in a study of 2,201 patients at 22 Nordic heart surgery units.The study was published on Monday in The New England Journal of Medicine at the same time that the results are being presented in Madrid at this year's ESC Congress, the leading international cardiology congress. The TACSI study compares two different antiplatelet (blood thinning) therapies after heart bypass surgery for acute coronary heart disease. On the one hand single antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) alone, and on the other hand dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor (Brilique). Dual antiplatelet therapy is currently recommended for these patients in international guidelines. It is unequivocal that this patient group needs antiplatelet therapy. However, until now it has been unclear whether dual therapy after surgery further reduces the risks of death and cardiovascular complications after the operation. The follow-up period was 12 months after surgery. The proportion affected within one year was just under 5 percent for both groups. Excessive bleeding was seen in 4.9 percent of patients on dual therapy, as compared to 2.0 percent in the other patient group. Anders Jeppsson notes that while the patients need to be followed up for more than one year, we can still draw some conclusions: Our 12-month data do not support the use of dual therapy over aspirin alone in patients with acute coronary syndrome who have undergone heart bypass surgery. We did not observe any improvement in serious cardiovascular events, but a higher risk of excessive bleeding in the dual antiplatelet therapy group."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not all acute myocardial infarction patients should be offered routine screening for the stomach ulcer bacterium Helicobacter pylori. However, it is possible that some patient groups with an elevated risk of post-infarction gastrointestinal bleeding benefit from such a test, concludes a large-scale study from Karolinska Institutet and Södersjukhuset in Sweden published in the journal JAMA. It's associated with increased mortality and the risk of recurring cardiovascular events. We therefore wanted to examine if screening for the common Helicobacter pylori bacterium, which causes gastritis and gastric ulcers, can reduce the risk of bleeding. Robin Hofmann, study's lead author, senior consultant at the Department of Cardiology, Södersjukhuset, and associate professor at the Department of Clinical Science and Education, Södersjukhuset, Karolinska Institutet The randomized study included almost 18,500 myocardial infarction patients at 35 hospitals in Sweden. Half the group was tested for the bacterium and treated with antibiotics and protein pump inhibitors by their doctors if testing positive, while the other half received routine care without an extra test or treatment. However, they found a positive effect of the screening when studying specific sub-groups of patients, such as those with anaemia or kidney failure. A particularly positive effect was observed in patients with moderate to severe anaemia, who suffered gastrointestinal bleeding at roughly half the rate if they underwent screening. "Our results suggest that screening for Helicobacter pylori does not need to be done routinely for all individuals following a heart attack," says Dr Hofmann. "On the other hand, testing and treatment could be a meaningful complement for selected patient groups with an elevated risk of bleeding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Black adults in the U.S. are first hospitalized for heart failure nearly 14 years earlier than white adults, reports a Northwestern Medicine study that analyzed data from more than 42,000 patients across hundreds of hospitals nationwide. Using statistical modeling, the Northwestern scientists determined that these differences were associated with social and economic factors, such as whether people had health insurance, if they lived in areas with high unemployment and the level of education in their communities. Heart failure, a condition in which the heart cannot pump blood effectively, affects over 6 million U.S. adults and is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades. "These are striking differences, especially for Black patients," said study first author Dr. Xiaoning Huang, research assistant professor of cardiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Huang and his colleagues analyzed hospital records from over 42,000 patients across 713 hospitals between 2016 and 2019 using the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines – Heart Failure Registry. Our study shows that social risk factors, including insurance status and area-level educational and economic opportunities, played a major role. These factors often limit people's access to quality health care and shape people's health long before they develop heart problems." Huang stressed that closing these disparities will take more than medical treatment alone. "Raising awareness is the first step toward advocating for policies that ensure everyone has educational and economic opportunities, healthy food, affordable and high-quality care, and freedom from discrimination, so that neither your ZIP code nor your racial background determines how soon you face serious heart problems," he said. At the clinical level, Huang added that health systems need to be aware that heart failure can strike much earlier in certain communities. "This means starting prevention earlier and screening risk factors sooner," he said. The study, titled "Racial and Ethnic Differences in Patient Age at First Hospitalization for Heart Failure," was funded by the American Heart Association (grant number 24GWTGDRA1308856).
