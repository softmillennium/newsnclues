                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A US Immigration and Customs Enforcement flight returned 161 Cuban deportees to the communist-run island last week, the first time many of the men and women aboard had touched Cuban soil in years. Upon arrival, the deportees had shackles removed from their wrists and ankles and one at a time descended the stairway of the chartered 767 aircraft to be reprocessed by waiting Cuban immigration and health officials. Some seemed visibly dazed to suddenly be back in their homeland. Shortly after Fidel Castro took power and aligned his revolution with the Soviet Union, Cubans, for the most part, were treated by both Democrat and Republican administrations alike as political refugees – not immigrants – with a unique fast track to US residency. Tens of thousands of Cubans who traveled to the US during the Biden administration expecting to be able to stay – as Cubans had for a generation – could now face possible deportation. As attitudes and official restrictions on travel slowly shifted, Cubans traveling abroad and returning – by their own accord or because they were deported – has become commonplace. “They are Cuban,” Lt. Col Lourdes Gil Robaina, a Cuban immigration official told CNN, the first international television network to be allowed to witness how Cuban deportees are processed upon return to their country. They don't have a problem with immigration to be reinserted into society.” But many of the returning Cubans complained about their treatment by ICE officials –showing marks from the tight handcuffs on their wrists and told of dehumanizing lost weeks in an archipelago of detention centers. I have conflicting feelings,” said deportee Tania Carbonell Cruz, who left behind three grown children – who also emigrated from Cuba – in Texas. She said her children, who had arrived in the US years ahead of her, were able to get residency while she missed the cut off so the family was now split. After more than three years living in the US with her children, Carbonell said she was told by ICE she faced deportation and she quickly agreed to return rather than suffer a lengthy detention process. I lost her,” wailed Yudierquis Reyes Merino, who gave birth to a daughter conceived with another Cuban immigrant shortly after they crossed into the US from Mexico in 2022. Reyes said she was detained by ICE officials in June in Nebraska, where she worked cleaning offices and meatpacking plants, during a routine check-in with immigration officials. After weeks in ICE detention centers, Reyes said she agreed to be deported if she could bring her young daughter with her but ICE officials placed her on the plane without the girl. In response to a CNN request for information about Reyes, a Department of Homeland security official responded by email: “Yudierquis Reyes Merino, a criminal illegal alien (from) Cuba, crossed the border illegally in 2022 near Eagle Pass, Texas. She was previously charged with CHILD ABUSE, second-degree domestic assault, use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony. “Under President (Donald) Trump and (Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi) Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the US.” Prosecutors in Nebraska dropped that charge after Reyes pleaded no contest to the assault, court records show. When contacted by CNN, the father of Reyes' daughter, said he was a US resident, not a US citizen as the DHS official had stated. “Life would be too hard for her there now,” the girl's father, Miguel Camacho, told CNN in a phone interview. Painful family separations are likely to become even more common for Cubans if the Trump administration plows ahead with plans to deport the thousands currently stuck in immigration limbo. For deportees like Yudierquis Reyes the lasting damage is already done. Interviewed at the home of relatives in central Cuba, following her reprocessing, Reyes said she had to live with family members since she had sold her home to finance her journey to the US. Recounting how she had crossed the Darien Gap, evaded kidnappers in Mexico and ridden atop the infamous migrant “train of death” in that country to reach the US, Reyes swore to endure the danger-ridden journey all over again to be reunited with her daughter. “Donald Trump only has three years left, I have the rest of my life,” Reyes said. I don't care if they give me 20 years in jail.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When President Donald Trump sat down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last month, the topic was the weighty issue of ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But at one point, Trump took a provocative diversion into domestic politics. Zelensky noted that, in his country, the law doesn't allow for elections during periods of martial law. “So let me just say, three and a half years from now – so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections? Trump wondered aloud what the “fake news” would do with his comment. Trump hasn't explicitly said he plans to cancel elections, and he said last month he would “probably not” run for a third term, which the Constitution forbids anyway. But the president has certainly floated such possibilities before and done plenty of anti-democratic things. And his extraordinary moves to take more control over the voting process and dispatch troops on US soil are already raising alarm bells. (A judge said Tuesday that Trump was, in effect, “creating a national police force with the President as its chief.”) JB Pritzker claimed Sunday that Trump's threat to send troops into cities like Chicago was part of the plan. “He'll just claim that there's some problem with an election, and then he's got troops on the ground that can take control if, in fact, he's allowed to do this.” Pritzker, who may have his own White House ambitions, pointed to how Adolf Hitler took just 53 days to turn Germany into a dictatorship. Gavin Newsom floated a very similar theory last week. Asked about his own plans for running for president in 2028, Newsom shrugged them off by casting doubt on whether that election would be above-board or even happen at all. He cited how Trump's recently passed domestic agenda law made Immigration and Customs Enforcement the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency, claiming ICE is increasing Trump's “private police force.” He predicted that federal agents would be sent to polling places. And then he predicted Trump would try to halt elections altogether. “I don't think Donald Trump wants another election,” Newsom said at an event hosted by Politico. These are the most powerful Democrats to float such theories. “Watch Trump fantasize about dragging America into a war as a pretense to cancel our elections,” she said on X. Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, who administers that state's elections, said Trump's push to end mail voting is part of a pattern. “What in the world does that pattern lead to?” Fontes told local KTAR News. “It leads to the further erosion of our trust in our elections that might justify his ability to determine that there's an emergency and cancel the 2026 elections.” Fontes added: “This is where all the evidence is going, and at every turn Donald Trump gives us another reason to believe that that might be true.” And Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner last week told CNN's “Early Start” that Trump's use of troops in cities is an attempt to create a pretext. “The only crisis here is Donald Trump, and he wants a crisis because he wants an excuse to cancel elections down the road,” Krasner said. All of these warnings might sound rather alarmist and conspiratorial. Trump certainly lacks the legal power to cancel elections under federal law. But he's also flirted with these kinds of things plenty of times and shown a real disregard for democratic norms and election law: After those last comments blew up, Fox News host Laura Ingraham invited Trump to clarify them. But Trump repeatedly declined to directly rebut those critics. The president has also recently sought to expand his control over elections – and done so unilaterally, by executive action. But what Democrats are increasingly suggesting could happen is not a legal effort to commandeer or cancel elections, but an extralegal one – or one that seizes on a manufactured crisis. And the idea that Trump could take all of it too far is a concern that may not seem so ridiculous to many Americans. (And this wasn't just a case where all partisans assumed the other side would do that; only 28% had the same worry about Kamala Harris.) The question, as always with Trump, is whether he's being provocative for the sake of provocation, or he really has designs on burrowing his way into the election process to try to hold onto power. Democrats are increasingly calling on people to start paying attention.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. In March 2024, then-first-year law student at the City University of New York's Law School, Sarah Southey, filed a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request to obtain CUNY's financial investment information, including what companies are held in their financial portfolio. This came months into the ongoing genocide waged by Israel in Gaza, as well as a growing pro-Palestine movement on college campuses across the United States. One of the demands of the student activists was — and still is at many colleges — for colleges and universities to disclose what financial ties they have with companies and businesses supporting the Israeli occupation in Palestine. CUNY has constantly tried to silence organizing for Palestine. Instead, she went to court, filing a suit with the New York Civil Liberties Union in November 2024. The case's preliminary statement wrote that Southey, the plaintiff, “seeks these records to support student efforts to advocate for CUNY's divestment from certain companies implicated in Israel's military campaigns.” In a highly anticipated decision, the Supreme Court of New York ruled on August 20 that CUNY must disclose its financial portfolio, specifically contracts with businesses supporting or benefiting from the genocide in Gaza, such as Boeing, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, and Northrup Grumman. While this wasn't a First Amendment suit, the case (and its ruling) has a direct relationship to students' exercise of free speech and expression on campus. And the precedent this sets for financial disclosure at other universities is yet to be seen. We can demand that they divest from specific companies. “The reaction was almost kind of a disbelief, but also understanding that this was a milestone we knew we were going to hit,” Nadia, a second-year law student at CUNY, told Mondoweiss, who added that the decision was especially surprising “given how much repression has been happening to all students all across the boroughs of New York.” On August 27, CUNY Law Students for Justice in Palestine held a press conference to share and celebrate their win for the student movement. A handful of universities, including Brown University, Evergreen State College, and Northwestern University, have committed to disclosing their investments tied to Israel. However, the vast majority of universities have refused to meet students' demands regarding disclosure or divestment. At the same time, students at many schools advocated for divestment from private prisons, and some agreed, including Columbia University, where student protests calling for divestment from Israel have become international news. “It wasn't until this student who is a member of Students for Justice in Palestine and CUNY Law Students for Justice in Palestine reached out and sought the exact same records — this time, perhaps for a different purpose for the BDS movement — that CUNY pushed back and actually forced us to litigate the issue,” Veronica Salama, a lawyer at the New York Civil Liberties Union and litigator on the case, told Mondoweiss. This decision also comes amid ongoing crackdowns on student protesters advocating for disclosure and divestment. Dozens of CUNY student activists were charged with felonies following last spring's encampment. And just this past May, a protest at CUNY Brooklyn College led to even more arrests. But this court ruling gives these students a win, showing that their advocacy — which includes the exercise of free speech — works, putting pressure on their college's administration. “This was not a First Amendment case, but it absolutely sends CUNY a reminder about its own statutory and constitutional obligations, and it just lets them know that they are on notice and that we are watching them and ensuring that they are dutifully obliging to their obligations.” In a statement sent from a CUNY spokesperson to Mondoweiss, they wrote: “The University is reviewing the court's decision, its legal options and possible next steps.” While this ruling does not directly apply to private institutions — like Columbia University and Harvard University, where there have been large student movements — Salama still views this win as one that can benefit student protesters at many different colleges. “This would not apply strictly to private universities, but I think much like we see with all forms of advocacy, when universities disclose records, whether they're forced to do it or they do it willingly, that can have a ripple effect on the sort of pressure that we can put [on them].” But more than that, we're just using this energy to keep fighting and to make sure that we do what we can to get CUNY's money out of these companies that are profiting off this genocide.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Laken Ashlee Snelling, a 21-year-old cheer team member, faces charges of corpse abuse and evidence tampering A University of Kentucky athlete allegedly placed her dead infant inside a trash bag later found in a closet while trying to hide the baby's birth, leading to her being jailed, according to local authorities and media reporting. Laken Ashlee Snelling, 21, faces charges of corpse abuse, tampering with physical evidence and concealing the birth of an infant after her arrest on Sunday in the markedly grisly case, police in Lexington, Kentucky, said in a statement. Her arrest citation, which was obtained and reviewed by WLEX, says police were called out to Snelling's home on 27 August to investigate a report of “a deceased infant being located inside … a closet”. The baby was “wrapped in a towel inside … a black trash bag”, prompting police to read Snelling her Miranda rights as well as interrogate her, the citation said. The citation added that Snelling admitted to investigators that she had given birth to the child and then tried to conceal that by “cleaning any evidence, placing all cleaning items used inside of a black trash bag, including the infant”. Details about whether a bond was set for her – or its amount – were not immediately available. Snelling no longer appeared to be in the custody of Lexington's jail by Tuesday morning. The more serious charges against Snelling are corpse abuse and tampering with physical evidence. Under Kentucky state law, both are considered class D felonies, meaning people convicted of those crimes in particular could receive between one and five years in prison as well as a fine of up to $10,000.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supreme court justice says overturning Roe v Wade respected voters' will, though polls show majority back abortion rights That percentage stood only four points lower in 2021, one year before Barrett joined the court's four other ultraconservatives in removing national protections and leaving states to set their own abortion laws. Numerous states moved quickly to ban or severely restrict access to abortions, with legal proceedings still playing out in a number of others. According to the New York Times, 19 states have laws that either outlaw the procedure completely, or limit it to earlier in a pregnancy than the “fetal viability” standard of Roe v Wade. Barrett's book, CNN said, also takes on religious bias and details her decision-making process. But she states at the outset that she would not reveal details of court deliberations about specific cases – or identify her seven children or other family members by name “for the sake of their privacy”. It gave Trump his third supreme court pick and cemented an unassailable 6-3 conservative majority that has repeatedly ruled in his favor during his second presidency, which began in January, including landmark decisions expanding presidential power. Barrett's confirmation, just eight days before the November 2020 election that Trump lost to Joe Biden, stood in stark contrast to McConnell's handling of the aftermath of the death of another conservative justice, Antonin Scalia, in February 2016. Then, McConnell celebrated his successful stalling of Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, for almost a year, until Trump took office and replaced Scalia with Neil Gorsuch in April 2017. CNN said Barrett refers to Trump “only in passing” and states, dispassionately, that the court has always been entangled with its times. After one “particularly tricky” opinion Barrett wrote, and other justices supported, staff in her chambers celebrated with champagne. Their dissent cited Ginsburg and declared that the 49 years of Roe v Wade being in effect “protected the liberty and equality of women” and guaranteed “government could not control a woman's body or the course of a woman's life”. But Barrett, in her book, claims that the “complicated moral debate” about abortion distinguishes it from other rights more traditionally recognized as fundamental that enjoy broad public support, including “the rights to marry, have sex, procreate, use contraception”, CNN reported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new grant will cover a full year of salary for the Kyiv Independent's front-line reporter, Francis Farrell, and videographer Olena Zashko for 2025–2026. Last year, the trust's support fully covered Francis' salary and reporting work. Now, in 2025, it extends its funding to also support Olena, ensuring the Kyiv Independent's front-line reporting team can continue documenting Russia's war from the ground. The donation comes at a pivotal moment in summer 2025, as Russia intensifies its attacks on civilian infrastructure across Ukraine and mounts renewed offensives along several sectors of the front line. “Although they still maintain teams or individual correspondents in Ukraine, coverage of the actual battlefield by large Western media outlets has plummeted over the past year. There are two main reasons for this: first, the declining importance placed on Ukraine by newsrooms around the world; and second, perhaps more importantly, the increased danger from drones in front-line areas — even as far back as 20 kilometers from the zero line itself. “In this environment, Western audiences — whether ordinary people at home who want to understand what's really happening on the front line, or policymakers, diplomats, journalists, and experts — are all starved of high-quality coverage. “Despite this, we at the Kyiv Independent have not stopped making regular trips to the battlefield, always striving for deeper, closer, and higher-quality reporting, even as the danger grows with each passing month. This support allows us to continue our work frequently, independently, and at a high level of quality,” Francis said. Each year, the trustees evaluate proposals and subjects suitable for the annual awards, continuing their mission to support quality journalism and research. “We, as journalists, are risking our lives to bring information from the front lines to our audience. And now, it's a war that has reached my native village in eastern Ukraine. Our front-line video reports have received thousands of views. I don't believe that my videos alone can stop the war, but I truly believe they can become part of future change — and help show the world that Russia is responsible for the destruction and the deaths caused by this war. It is a great honor that the Charles Douglas-Home Memorial Trust is willing to support us in this work,” Olena said. “This is the second consecutive year that we are pleased to stand behind the Kyiv Independent's front-line reporting. It is a particular honour to support both front-line reporter Francis Farrell and videographer Olena Zashko, as they bring the world the truth from Ukraine's front lines. At a moment when so many international outlets have stepped back, we feel it is essential that independent journalism from Ukraine continues to reach the world. This is the largest charitable grant we have ever given,” said Christopher McKane, trustee of the Charles Douglas-Home Memorial Trust. The Kyiv Independent is an award-winning English-language media outlet that offers on-the-ground reporting from Ukraine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: The story was updated with Russian President Vladimir Putin's quotes regarding Ukraine's access to reverse gas flows. Russian President Vladimir Putin met Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Beijing on Sept. 2, where the two discussed Russia's war against Ukraine, relations with Western countries, and economic ties, Russian state-run media outlet RIA Novosti reported. Fico traveled to China to attend events marking the anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, making Slovakia the only EU country represented. After meeting Putin, he is expected to hold talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky later in the week. At the meeting, Fico said Slovakia sought to "standardize" relations with Moscow, saying the two countries "should look for opportunities to deepen and broaden cooperation." Fico also pledged to raise with Zelensky what he described as the inadmissibility of attacks on energy infrastructure, a reference to recent Ukrainian strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline, which supplies Russian crude to Hungary and Slovakia. Meanwhile, Slovakia remains one of the key routes for reverse gas supplies to Ukraine. "Ukraine receives significant energy resources through its neighbors in Eastern Europe. Putin also used the talks to accuse Ukraine of escalating strikes against Russian energy facilities, claiming Moscow refrained from targeting Ukrainian infrastructure "for a long time." "We did not take any actions concerning civilian infrastructure, especially during the winter period, and for a very long time we tolerated when Ukrainian troops were striking our energy facilities," he said. His remarks contradict the record: in 2024, Russia launched at least 13 mass drone and missile attacks against Ukraine's energy grid, forcing emergency blackouts nationwide. Just days earlier, Russian strikes on Odesa Oblast left more than 29,000 consumers without power. Since returning to office in 2023, Fico has ended military aid to Ukraine from Slovak army stocks and questioned EU sanctions on Russia, moves that drew criticism from Kyiv and Brussels. The Russian president praised Bratislava's stance, calling it an "independent foreign policy" that produces "positive results." At the meeting, Prime Minister Robert Fico said Slovakia sought to "standardize" relations with Moscow, saying the two countries "should look for opportunities to deepen and broaden cooperation." Ukraine's former pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych seemingly resurfaced publicly for the first time in years on Sept. 1, claiming that he had always backed Ukraine's path toward the European Union. The air alert, triggered by Russian drones, began at 9:20 a.m. local time and lasted over three hours, catching many children on their way to school before classes could start. The suspect in the murder of Andrii Parubii said he wants to be exchanged for Ukrainian prisoners of war held in Russia to go look for his son's body. The comments, made during Putin's meeting with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Beijing, represent an apparent shift from Moscow's previous refusal of any changes regarding the Ukrainian plant's oversight. Vladyslav Nahornyi's wife reported his disappearance after he left the hospital without warning. But specifically, as far as I know, there was no agreement between Putin and Trump on this," Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI tools are diverting traffic and attention away from Wikipedia and other websites, starving them of the revenue that they need to survive, researchers have concluded.Gregory Bull/The Associated Press One foundational rule of the internet has been the social contract between website owners and search giants such as Google. If they didn't want their website to be indexed, they could politely note it in what's called a “robots.txt” file on their server, and upon seeing it, the bot would leave the site unindexed. Without intervention from any political or legal bodies, most companies have complied (with some hiccups) with the voluntary standard since its introduction in 1994. That is, until the latest generation of large language models, or LLMs, emerged. A previous version of ChatGPT, OpenAI's chatbot model, was reportedly trained with data equivalent to 10 trillion words, or enough to fill more than 13 billion Globe and Mail op-eds. As it turns out, there aren't nearly enough websites that allow bots to collect data to create better chatbots. But even when these pledges are genuine, companies benefit from another loophole in robots.txt: To block a bot, the website owner must be able to specify the bot's name. And many AI companies' bots' names are only disclosed or discovered after they have crawled freely through the internet. Take Wikipedia, for example: Its content is freely licensed, allowing bots to crawl through its trove of high-quality information. Between January, 2024, and April, 2025, the non-profit found that its multimedia downloads increased by 50 per cent, driven in large part by AI companies' bots downloading licence-free images to train their products. Wikipedia says the bot traffic is adding to its operating costs. Instead, researchers have concluded that as AI tools divert traffic and attention away from Wikipedia and other websites, those sites are increasingly starved of the revenue that they need to survive, even as the tools themselves rely on those sites for input. Figures published by Similarweb indicate a 22.7-per-cent drop in Wikipedia's overall traffic between 2022 and 2025. Instead of a quid pro quo of letting search engines crawl websites and serving traffic to them through search results, the current arrangement means websites face increased costs while seeing fewer actual visitors, and while also providing the resources to train ever-improving AI chatbots. In response, companies such as Cloudflare, a web-services provider, have started treating AI bots as hackers trying to compromise their customers' cybersecurity. In August, Cloudflare alleged that Perplexity, a leading AI company, is actively developing new ways to hide its crawling activities to circumvent existing cybersecurity barriers. However, given competitive pressures, companies aren't incentivized to do the right thing. For example, Canada's Online News Act was an attempt to compel social-media companies to compensate news organizations for lost revenue. Instead of achieving that goal, Ottawa learned that companies such as Meta would rather remove Canadians' access to news on their platforms than compensate publishers. Our next-best bet is an international agreement, akin to the Montreal Protocol, which bound countries to co-ordinate laws phasing out substances that eroded the Earth's ozone layer. Absent American leadership, Canada should lead in establishing a similar protocol for AI bots.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Xi hosted Vladimir Putin for talks at the Great Hall of the People and then at his personal residence, calling him his “old friend.” A few hours later, Kim Jong Un's armoured train was spotted by a Reuters witness arriving in the Chinese capital. The three are set to take centre stage at a massive military parade on Wednesday, where the Chinese president will flaunt his vision for a new global order as U.S. President Donald Trump's “America First” policies strain Western alliances. Defying U.S. pressure, China's Xi advances his vision for a new global order It would also be a blow for Trump, who has talked up his close relations with Putin, Xi and Kim and touted his peacemaking credentials as Russia's three-and-a-half-year war with Ukraine has raged on. Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un are attending a massive military parade in Beijing alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi also held talks on Monday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, whose country has been targeted by Trump over its purchases of Russian oil seen as helping finance Putin's war effort. Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the summit “performative” and accused China and India, the biggest buyers of Russian crude, of being “bad actors” by fuelling Russia's war. At a time when Trump has set his sights on a Nobel Peace Prize, any new concentration of military power in the East that includes Russia will ring alarm bells for the West. “Trilateral military exercises between Russia, China and North Korea seem nearly inevitable,” wrote Youngjun Kim, an analyst at the U.S.-based National Bureau of Asian Research, in March, citing how the conflict in Ukraine had pushed Moscow and Pyongyang closer. “Until a few years ago, China and Russia were important partners in imposing international sanctions on North Korea for its nuclear and missile tests ... [they] are now potential military partners of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea during a crisis on the Korean Peninsula,” he added, using the diplomatically isolated country's official name. Kim is an important player in the conflict in Ukraine: the North Korean leader has supplied more than 15,000 troops to support Putin's war. North Korea leader Kim Jong Un arrives at a railway station in Beijing on Tuesday, in a photo released by Chinese state news outlet Xinhua News Agency.Pang Xinglei/The Associated Press About 600 North Korean soldiers have been killed fighting for Russia in the Kursk region, according to South Korea's intelligence agency, which believes Pyongyang is planning another deployment. Painstaking planning has also gone into China's “Victory Day” parade, marking 80 years since Japan's defeat at the end of the Second World War, with downtown Beijing paralyzed by security measures and traffic controls for weeks. Alongside the showcase of cutting-edge military hardware in front of an estimated 50,000 spectators, authorities plan to release more than 80,000 “peace doves” during the event.

NEW YORK, September 2. /TASS/. The recent summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has made it clear that the leaders of Russia, China and India are united in opposition to the Western world order, Newsweek writes.

The magazine points out that the three leaders "hailed their new – and growing – alliances" at the summit.

Newsweek also pointed to their "jovial" exchange on the event's sidelines. "Such a scene would have been almost unthinkable until recent weeks," the media outlet notes, adding that "all three leaders are now united in opposition to a world order dominated by the United States."

The SCO summit took place in the Chinese city of Tianjin between August 31 and September 1. The organization currently has ten member states: Russia, Belarus, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Additionally, the SCO has two observer states, Afghanistan and Mongolia, and 14 dialogue partners: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Bahrain, Egypt, Cambodia, Qatar, Kuwait, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Sri Lanka.</p>

BEIJING, September 2. /TASS/. Beijing is ready to work together with Moscow to promote the formation of a fairer system of global governance, Chinese President Xi Jinping said at a meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Beijing.

"Working together with you, we are ready to support each other's national development and prosperity, resolutely safeguard international justice and equality, and promote the formation of a fairer, rational system of global governance," he stated.

According to Xi, in recent years, China and Russia have achieved fruitful results in terms of multilateral cooperation.

Putin is currently on a visit to China. He took part in a Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit between August 31 and September 1. On September 2, talks between Putin and Xi Jinping are taking place in Beijing. On September 3, the Russian leader will attend celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the victory over militarist Japan and the end of World War II.</p>

KABUL, Sept 1 (Reuters) – One of Afghanistan's worst earthquakes killed more than 800 people and injured at least 2,800, authorities said on Monday, as rescuers struggled to reach remote areas due to rough mountainous terrain and inclement weather. Sharafat Zaman, spokesperson for the health ministry in Kabul, called for international aid to tackle the devastation wrought by the quake of magnitude 6 that struck around midnight local time, at a depth of 10 km (6 miles). “We need it because here lots of people lost their lives and houses,” he told Reuters. Ziaul Haq Mohammadi, a student at Al-Falah University in the eastern city of Jalalabad, was studying in his room at home when the quake struck. “We spent the whole night in fear and anxiety because at any moment another earthquake could happen,” Mohammadi said. Casualties could rise as rescue teams access more isolated “All our … teams have been mobilised to accelerate assistance, so that comprehensive and full support can be provided,” said health ministry spokesperson Abdul Maten Qanee, citing efforts in areas from security to food and health. Reuters Television images showed helicopters ferrying out the affected, while residents helped security forces and medics carry the wounded to ambulances in an area with a long history of earthquakes and floods. Military rescue teams fanned out across the region, the defence ministry said, with 40 flights carrying away 420 wounded and dead. Some villagers sat weeping amid the piled ruins of their homes. The entire village has been destroyed,” one victim told reporters. “Children and elders are trapped under the rubble. It was Afghanistan's third major deadly quake since the Taliban took over in 2021 as foreign forces withdrew, triggering a cut to the international funding that formed the bulk of government finances. Diplomats and aid officials say crises elsewhere in the world, along with donor frustration over the Taliban's policies towards women, including curbs on those who are aid workers, have spurred the cuts in funding. Even humanitarian aid, aimed at bypassing political institutions to serve urgent needs, has shrunk to $767 million this year, down from $3.8 billion in 2022. Humanitarian agencies say they are fighting a forgotten crisis in Afghanistan, where the United Nations estimates more than half the population is in urgent need of humanitarian aid. “So far, no foreign governments have reached out to provide support for rescue or relief work,” a spokesperson of Afghanistan's foreign office said on Monday. Later, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said it was ready to provide disaster relief assistance “according to Afghanistan's needs and within its capacity”. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar of India said it had delivered 1,000 family tents to Kabul and was moving 15 tonnes of food material to Kunar, with more relief material to be sent from India starting on Tuesday. Afghanistan has been badly affected since U.S. President Donald Trump's administration in January began slashing funding to its humanitarian arm, USAID, and aid programs worldwide as part of a broader plan to end what it deems wasteful spending. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said its mission in Afghanistan was preparing to help those in areas devastated by the quake. Pope Leo also sent condolences for the dead. Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. GARY ROUGHEAD is Robert and Marion Oster Distinguished Military Fellow at the Hoover Institution. MARISE PAYNE is a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution. NICHOLAS CARTER is a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution. JAMES MATTIS is Davies Family Distinguished Fellow at the Hoover Institution. Gary Roughead, Marise Payne, Nicholas Carter, and James Mattis The review—designed to determine whether the AUKUS agreement is aligned with U.S. President Donald Trump's priorities—has sparked angst among stakeholders in all three countries. The second Trump administration, after all, has not been shy about revamping Washington's major partnerships. It is not unusual for an incoming administration to review major programs and initiatives in its early days, as the Trump administration is now doing with AUKUS. In an unsettled international environment, AUKUS serves each member country's urgent national security needs and advances shared priorities. It enables a frictionless defense environment among the three countries, and is a stimulus for reforming dated yet compatible defense industrial bases. AUKUS is often seen in terms of its pillars and programs. At a time when questioning the meaning, value, and obligations of partnerships is in vogue and doubts about the United States' reliability swirl, AUKUS can show that Washington remains dependable and prove that democratic forms of government, particularly when working together, yield strong economies and military capabilities. Washington should thus do more than just recommit to AUKUS. In matters of defense, AUKUS can help all three countries rapidly adopt new technologies. It can aid them in developing coherent research initiatives, leveraging their comparative advantages, and coordinating (rather than replicating) investments so that they can quickly apply game-changing innovations in a variety of areas—such as undersea warfare, hypersonic weapons, cyber-capabilities, and drones. AUKUS can also help speed up the delivery processes for new technologies by acting as a forcing function and convening mechanism. A collective approach, by contrast, could build integrated workforces and supply chains and establish more locations from which the three countries' forces could operate with common support. The benefits of working together will become even more consequential, for example, as digital designing and the 3D printing of complex parts allow the military to more quickly repair its platforms and systems. AUKUS could help its members take advantage of these advances by providing a global allied logistics and maintenance network, in which engineers, technicians, and artisans collaborate across time zones. This shared enterprise would serve as a strong deterrent against China and Russia, which see the allies' distance from their areas of interest and potential conflict as a liability that works to China's and Russia's advantage. Instead, under this evolved AUKUS model, the tyranny of long supply lines would come to an end. Defense platforms would no longer be tied to each country's specific support sites and systems. Australia's investments in its naval industrial base will, for the first time, provide AUKUS partners with a substantial, modern nuclear submarine base and maintenance and repair facility in the Indian Ocean. That base, named HMAS Stirling, will give all three countries access to key sea-lanes in the Indian Ocean. It will be the closest facility that each country's nuclear submarines have to critical Indo-Pacific chokepoints, making it essential in the event of a crisis in the East China or South China Seas. Currently, the closest similar base and nuclear-capable maintenance and repair complex is in Hawaii, which is 7,800 miles away from the strait. Even if it didn't shorten transit, having two robust nuclear submarine repair facilities serving the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean is better than one. Building up HMAS Stirling is, to be sure, costly. These goals may appear bifurcated, but they will become increasingly intertwined in the years ahead. The extreme endurance of stealthy nuclear submarines—which can remain submerged far longer and move much faster than conventionally powered submarines—makes them essential to deterrence. Nuclear submarines will also be the silent motherships for advanced autonomous undersea and, potentially, air systems. Nuclear submarines, paired with those Pillar 2 offshoots, will therefore be transformational. But the partnership's work on emerging Pillar 2 technologies is less coherent than AUKUS plans for Australian nuclear submarines. Frankly, this effort is operationally adrift, and hopefully, the Department of Defense review should drive change. AUKUS has succeeded in catalyzing some long-needed reforms to export regulations that limit the sale of emerging military and dual-use technologies to other countries, and it has facilitated collaboration in some technology development. But more must be done, particularly to help small and medium-sized defense firms that lack large compliance teams but want to grow their customer bases. Its members should agree on Pillar 2 technology priorities—emphasizing, for example, those that enhance undersea warfare and autonomous systems—and quickly remove the remaining impediments to the diffusion of U.S. technologies. Washington needs a tool for breaking through defense industrial bureaucratic inertia, so even if there weren't an AUKUS, the United States would have to create one. The strongest argument for AUKUS is that China and Russia object to it. China and Russia are right to see AUKUS as a threat. Increased numbers of more capable nuclear submarines among all three partners, operating out of a closer operating base, would complicate their nuclear strategies. They would also threaten Chinese ships and military installations, including those recently established in the South China Sea. Although Moscow has spent decades contending with U.S. and British submarines operating in the Atlantic and in the Pacific, adding Australian nuclear submarines to the mix would make AUKUS submarine numbers greater and more fungible. The addition of Australian nuclear submarines in the Pacific would enable U.S. and British submarines to be on patrol elsewhere as circumstances demand. When it comes to the advanced technologies of Pillar 2, meanwhile, Moscow and Beijing have already made significant progress in many of those areas on their own, and they do not want Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to apply their innovation engines toward shared military ends. The Trump administration, in concert with Australia and the United Kingdom, can refine AUKUS and make it fit for today's purpose. In fact, AUKUS can serve as a vehicle for the administration's drive to streamline government. In doing so, AUKUS can reinforce an “America first” agenda and still advance the interests of all three partners. AUKUS, for example, can serve as the impetus for streamlining processes, clearing out burdensome bureaucratic hurdles, and thinning out regulations around technology and defense manufacturing. American investors, businesses, and, just as important, their workforces and suppliers need such changes to better help the armed services. National security leaders in all three countries must commit to more multiyear procurement contracts and authorize and appropriate more funding for cutting-edge defense technologies. They must be willing to gamble—yes, gamble—on introducing emerging technologies faster. Otherwise, new innovations will struggle to take root and thrive. Officials cannot expect small companies and their investors to participate if orders cannot be assured and if those orders are limited to a single year. Another is that providing nuclear submarines to Australia will mean fewer submarines for the United States, at a time when the U.S. industrial base can't meet U.S. needs. The three states will essentially be operating common submarines, which will ultimately provide industry with a longer runway and thus the necessary industrial predictability to increase production. It will create a more fungible allied submarine force over time that will improve responsiveness to the challenges of the future. Finally, AUKUS partners must establish a more decisive leadership and coordination model. Vesting oversight primarily in defense departments and ministries is a traditional inclination. Such leaders must possess the authority necessary to effectively coordinate and, when required, compel action. This is, unquestionably, an unusual and potentially bureaucratically contentious proposal. Abandoning AUKUS would do the work of Washington's adversaries for them. It is time to change the order of things and, as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said, go forward together.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. HUSSEIN KALOUT is a Research Scholar at Harvard University and a member of the International Advisory Board for the Brazilian Center for International Relations. He served as Brazil's Special Secretary for Strategic Affairs from 2016 to 2018. In April, when Donald Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs on dozens of countries, Brazil emerged largely unscathed. In late July, however, Trump declared that Brazilian exports would now face tariffs of 50 percent, one of the highest rates Washington has imposed anywhere in the world. They constitute very public attacks on the legitimacy of Brazil's democratic institutions. The Brazilian government has perceived these actions, coupled with the new tariffs, as egregious violations of its sovereignty and as deliberate attempts to weaken the position of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who defeated Bolsonaro, ahead of planned elections in October 2026. Washington has undermined its credibility as a reliable partner to a friend with whom it has maintained more than two centuries of diplomatic and economic cooperation. Rather than furthering American (or Trump's) interests, these measures have triggered a backlash in Brazil. As a result, even conservative sectors once eager to play Washington's tune are now more inclined to support the Brazilian government's strategy of diversifying economic partnerships and reducing dependence on the United States. Beijing has been steadily deepening its presence in Brazil through investments in critical areas such as energy, agriculture and food security, defense, advanced technology, automobile manufacturing, a joint satellite program, and strategic infrastructure such as ports. Most notably, China is building an ambitious transcontinental railway in Brazil to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. These developments not only erode Washington's standing in Brazil but also recalibrate the broader regional balance of power. Instead of being able to balance relations with both the United States and its traditional rivals while also cultivating ties across the so-called global South, Brazil is being pushed toward a binary choice: align completely with Washington or with Beijing. Faced with growing threats from Washington, Brasília may ultimately conclude that its options are far starker than it expected. During World War II, for instance, Brazil aligned with the United States and allowed it to construct air bases in the country's northeast in exchange for economic assistance and industrial development—a foundational moment in the hemisphere's defense strategy. More recently, there has been intense cooperation in regional security and in countering the illicit drug trade, particularly through mechanisms such as the U.S.-Brazil Defense Cooperation Agreement of 2010, which deepened institutional ties between the two countries' security forces. This is not to say there have been no divergences or tensions, particularly when Brazil has sought to pursue a more autonomous foreign policy. Brazil's leadership within the global South, especially during Lula's first presidency (2003–11) and under his successor, Dilma Rousseff (2011–16), often clashed with U.S. priorities. Washington perceived several strategic misalignments: Brazil's outspoken opposition to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, in 2003; its central role in 2009 in creating the BRICS, an expanding intergovernmental bloc with growing global influence; and its joint effort with Turkey in 2010 to broker a nuclear agreement with Iran, which the Obama administration ultimately sidelined in favor of negotiations with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany. More recently, Washington has expressed concern over Brazil's growing ties with China, which have deepened since Bolsonaro's defeat. Within this paradigm, Brazil aspires to help steer the trajectory of global governance and development. It advances this latter point primarily through the BRICS, which has become an important structural element of Brazil's foreign policy. Its framework has been instrumental, for instance, in furnishing joint security endeavors between Brazil and India; in the creation of the New Development Bank, which helps finance infrastructure and development projects in Brazil and other emerging markets; and in coordinating efforts to reduce its members' dependence on the U.S. dollar. Still, Brazil has no intention of turning its back on the United States. And Lula, Latin America's most influential political leader, remains open to renewed trade negotiations with Washington. Lula, a diplomatic pragmatist, has historically demonstrated a willingness to make concessions if talks are conducted in good faith and premised on mutual respect. Questions of sovereignty become especially acute when Brazil resists aligning with U.S. strategic priorities—whether on migration, climate diplomacy, agricultural trade, commerce, or multilateral governance reforms. For Brazil, projecting an autonomous international identity is essential to its aspiration of leadership in the global South. Yet this aspiration is increasingly tested by the realities of a multipolar order: as more major powers compete for influence, Brazil must navigate a narrowing space between preserving its autonomy, sustaining cooperation with the United States, and avoiding overdependence on any single partner, be it China or anyone else. Now Washington seems keen on flexing its asymmetric power. Trump's inner circle increasingly views Brazil as a threat to U.S. supremacy in Latin America because of the country's expanding partnership with China. Opinion polls so far indicate that Lula has benefited from a “rally around the flag” effect typical in countries subjected to external sanctions. Moreover, it is unlikely that any future right-wing government in Brazil would radically shift the country's foreign policy alignment toward the United States. Even agribusiness constituencies in the Brazilian heartland, long a Bolsonaro stronghold, recognize that Brazil cannot simply distance itself from Beijing. Trump has thus misread the Brazilian political landscape by assuming that external pressure would weaken Lula, overlooking the extent to which Brazil's economic interdependence with China and the pragmatism of its electorate constrain any sharp foreign policy realignment in Washington's favor. Such measures, however, would almost certainly generate an even stronger increase in political support for Lula. With Brazil, Trump seems to have walked into a trap of his own making. With the exception of Bolsonaro's core supporters and a handful of governors, virtually every major political force in Brazil has sharply criticized the move. These constituencies view the sanctions and the tariffs as otherwise legal instruments weaponized for geopolitical purposes—and as direct affronts to Brazil's democratic integrity. Trump's attempt to rehabilitate Bolsonaro is also out of step with prevailing political sentiments in Brazil. Bolsonaro and his son Eduardo, who has been actively lobbying against Brazil in Washington, have both been branded as traitors by Lula supporters. Even some right-wing parties have cautiously distanced themselves from the disgraced former president. Lula has few incentives to comply with Washington's economic and legal pressure. Backing down would undermine his narrative of defending national sovereignty and cost him political capital, particularly within the progressive and nationalist constituencies that form his core base. Even if Brazil were to offer strategic concessions, such as granting the United States preferential access to rare-earth minerals, there is little evidence that Washington would back down. CAMEX has until late September to submit its findings. Additionally, Brazil is taking steps to offset the impact of Trump's pressure campaign—for example, by buying locally produced goods targeted by the U.S. tariffs such as açaí, coconut water, and honey for food programs or national reserves. Brazil has also looked to bolster its other trading partnerships. Most recently, Canada's trade minister announced during an official visit to Brasília that his country planned to sign a bilateral deal with Mercosur, the South American trade bloc of which Brazil is a member. Trump's approach is eroding the United States's soft power and global legitimacy while also empowering its rivals, including China, by weakening the very structures that once sustained U.S. primacy. When Brazilian foreign policy elites witness Trump's adversarial stance toward other traditional U.S. allies—including Australia, Canada, Japan, and Europe—it only reinforces their impression that Washington cannot offer Brazil a viable partnership in the medium term. As a result, Brazil's relationship with China will almost certainly grow stronger. In response to the U.S. tariffs on Brazilian goods, China declared its intention to expand its imports of key Brazilian commodities such as coffee, meat, and grain, signaling a strategic realignment in trade relations. A growing segment of Brazil's right-wing leadership now views China as a more stable and pragmatic long-term economic partner than the United States. Crucially, Brazil's foreign policy has consistently refrained from adopting an explicitly anti-American or anti-Western posture. Rather, Brazil has preferred a multidirectional diplomatic approach, grounded in the principles of autonomy, pragmatism, and constructive engagement with a diverse array of global actors. As a result, Brazil has not found the idea of choosing between Beijing and Washington viable or desirable. Still, the increasingly confrontational and coercive stance adopted by the Trump administration has shaken Brazil's diplomatic calculus and accelerated its geopolitical tilting toward Beijing. Were this alignment to become permanent, the effects would be far-reaching. Economically, the deepening of trade and investment ties would solidify China as Brazil's primary external partner, firmly embedding Chinese firms in strategic sectors. Geopolitically, it would make it harder for Brazil to serve as a bridge between the global South and Western countries, limiting its multipolar aspirations and narrowing its diplomatic flexibility. These scenarios already feature in political debates in the lead-up to the 2026 elections: opposition figures warn of “excessive dependence” on China while government allies frame diversification as essential to defending national sovereignty in an era of great-power rivalry. That diversification, however, may become trickier to pull off.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Cricketers at the Women's World Cup in India and Sri Lanka will play for $13.8 million in prize money from this month, two years after the men played for $10 million. The 2022 Women's World Cup in New Zealand had an overall purse of $3.5 million. “This four-fold increase in prize money is a landmark moment for women's cricket and reflects our clear commitment to its long-term growth,” International Cricket Council chairman Jay Shah said in a statement on Monday. “Our message is simple: Women cricketers must know they will be treated on par with men if they choose this sport professionally. Women's cricket is on a remarkable upward trajectory, and with this step we are confident the momentum will accelerate.” The Women's World Cup starts on Sept. 30 when co-hosts India and Sri Lanka meet in Guwahati. Each game winner in the group stage will receive another $34,314. “The uplift (in prize money),” Shah said, “underscores our ambition to deliver a world-class ICC Women's Cricket World Cup and to inspire the next generation of players and fans.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>
