                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he will ask the Supreme Court for an "expedited ruling" to overturn an appeals court decision that found most of his tariffs on imports from other countries are illegal. "If you take away tariffs, we could end up being a third-world country," Trump told reporters at the White House. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in a 7-4 ruling on Friday, said that Trump does not have the authority to implement most of his tariffs. "We're going to be going to the Supreme Court, we think tomorrow, because we need an early decision," Trump said Tuesday, arguing that the "financial fabric of our country" is at stake "We're going to be asking for early admittance ... we're going to ask for expedited, an expedited ruling." Trump also claimed that the U.S. stock market indices were trying lower Tuersday because of Friday's ruling. The tariffs affected by Friday's ruling were implemented by Trump this year under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and slapped duties as high as 50% on imports from some countries. The Federal Circuit appeals court, in ruling that those tariffs are not legal, said, "The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested  exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution." "Tariffs are a core Congressional power," the court said. Before the ruling, the Tax Foundation found that Trump's tariffs would affect nearly 70% of U.S. imports. If the ruling is upheld, just 16% of imports would be tariffed. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI continued its spending spree, announcing on Tuesday that it's acquired Statsig, a product development startup, for $1.1 billion. As part of the acquisition, Statsig CEO Vijaye Raji is joining OpenAI as technology chief in the applications unit. "Working with the incredible team at OpenAI to build AI-powered experiences at scale for people and businesses is a rare and meaningful opportunity," Raji wrote in a post on LinkedIn. "Doing that with the help of tools we built at Statsig makes it even more special." Statsig will continue to operate independently and serve customers out of its Seattle office, OpenAI said. The acquisition is still subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval. "Vijaye has a remarkable record of building new consumer and B2B products and systems at scale," Simo said in a statement. Its biggest splash came in May, when OpenAI acquired Jony Ive's AI devices startup IO for close to $6.5 billion in an all-equity deal that pushes the company firmly into hardware. Prior to that, OpenAI acquired analytics database company Rockset for an undisclosed sum in 2024. Earlier this year, OpenAI had planned to buy AI-assisted coding tool Windsurf for $3 billion, but a deal never materialized, and Google ended up bringing on the startup's co-founder as part of a $2.4 billion licensing deal. "The journey with Statsig has been deeply gratifying, leading me to this moment and giving me conviction that we will continue helping teams ship better software every day," Raji said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So I asked Indeed to run a similar study, this time focusing on tech job listings since ChatGPT came out in November 2022. They ran the numbers through November 2024, for a clean two-year look at how AI has changed employment prospects across the sector. Mobile developer job listings have plummeted more than 70% since ChatGPT came out. This could be because AI coding tools are making it easier for more people to develop apps themselves. This programming language is often used for mobile apps. Cloud architects and engineering managers are also down a lot. On the upside, AI architects and data center technicians are in demand. That's no surprise, given the boom in AI-related work and data center construction since ChatGPT emerged. The real in-demand tech roles are mostly related to running core systems of record for companies: HR software for managing employees, along with databases that help companies run their financial and sales operations. This stuff may be considered a bit boring, but it's essential and relatively hard for companies to replace.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's trade war suffered a big setback with many of his administration's tariffs ruled illegal by a federal appeals court last Friday. Billions of dollars in trade duties may potentially need to be refunded to businesses as trade deals struck by the White House with other nations are thrown into question. "Right now, we have not heard anything much or seen any changes," said Paul Brashier, vice president of global supply chain for ITS Logistics. There has been a lot of frontloading as well so impact for now should be minimal," he said, referring to the period early this year when imports surged as businesses loaded up on inventory to avoid tariff effective dates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday he believes the Supreme Court will uphold Trump's use of a 1977 emergency powers law to impose the tariffs on trading partners, and the administration has a backup plan if it does not. "This decision concerns reciprocal tariffs on goods from most countries, in addition to drug-related tariffs affecting imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. These tariffs account for the lion's share of the duty outlay for many of our customers, so despite no immediate change, they're eager to know and plan for the 'what ifs,'" said Short. Alan Baer, CEO of OL USA, said companies are dealing with a lot of mixed signals as products ordered and arriving in October is already on the water. "Most companies will remain cautious with their forward ordering unless they see demand picking up," Baer added. So far this fiscal year, the U.S. has generated $142 billion in tariff revenue, according to the most recent Treasury Department data. Short said if the Supreme Court reviews the case and upholds the lower courts' decision, it remains unclear whether their ruling will specify retroactive refunds of duties already paid or only prevent tariffs from being applied to future shipments. If the ruling does address refunds, these may occur in one of two ways: either Customs will process the refunds automatically, or brokers will need to undertake additional work to secure them, according to Short. "In the latter scenario, the workload for our customs teams would double overnight and be met with importers very eager to get those dollars back," he said. If tariffs do need to be refunded, Dan Anthony, President of Trade Partnership Worldwide, says the process would only be as difficult as the administration chooses to make it. "Blanket refunds are fairly straightforward: all affected imports have an IEEPA-specific code and related tariff amount that should allow for automated refunds of payments," Anthony said. "An individual request process would make it infinitely more complex. But any sympathy should be for the importers forced to jump through hoops, not government agencies that created work for themselves in an effort to keep illegal tariffs paid by Americans," he said. The U.S. Customs Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) provides duty rates for virtually every existing product. Lowell added the Section 232 tariffs are more targeted. "There may be 800 or so codes targeted by the Section 232 tariffs, but they also cover a wide range of products beyond just what an importer may think of as aluminum, copper, or steel products," he said. Felicia Pullam, former executive director of the Office of Trade Relations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection and senior director for geo-commerce in APCO's Center for Trade, Investment and Market Access, said that in the short-term, refunding the tariffs would be an enormous challenge for the administration, but doable. "It's not something that could be done overnight, but I think they could put processes and resources in place to do manage it over time," said Pullam. "The funds that CBP collects from tariffs goes into the U.S. Treasury – they are not earmarked for anything," she said. If they had to be refunded, it would contribute to the U.S. budget deficit and overall debt, "just like most other kinds of federal spending," she said. Small businesses that use a third party (e.g. UPS, FedEx, DHL, brokers) as the importer of record would face additional challenges. In these cases, the U.S. government would refund the third party, which must then create a process for refunding customers, according to Anthony. "This can lead to significant delays for actual importers even if the government process goes off without a hitch," he said. Tariff experts said that shippers have 314 days from the time their freight is processed through U.S. Customs to file an appeal. "For that reason, since these tariffs have always been considered legally risky, it might be in the best interest of the country and of the Trump administration to switch over to other types of tariffs sooner, rather than later," she said. But she does not think a loss in court would undo any of the trade deals. Additionally, the administration has already prepared to roll out tariff alternatives quickly if IEEPA tariffs are overturned. "We would just lose federal revenue and move onto another stage of the negotiations," she added. But Pullam says more extreme fears about the impact of court decisions do not concern her. Claims to the contrary sound more like desperation," she said. Short said companies also need to keep in mind that regardless of the outcome of those court proceedings, it's clear that tariff and trade disruptions are far from over. Multiple Section 232 investigations are active — spanning sectors such as lumber, pharmaceuticals, furniture, aerospace, trucks and truck parts, seafood, and critical minerals. As we saw with copper in July, these investigations can swiftly lead to new tariffs. The steel and aluminum tariff had 700 product categories added to it as well," he said. Lowell said the court decision has only increased uncertainty for importers. "At a practical level, nothing is new today compared to this time last week. But we're still seeing a flurry of questions indicating the ruling is creating internal questions for businesses," he said. "Most of those questions assume the tariffs are here to stay.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic on Tuesday announced it has closed a $13 billion funding round at a $183 billion post-money valuation, roughly triple what the artificial intelligence startup was worth as of its last raise in March. The most recent funding round was led by Iconiq, Fidelity Management & Research Co. and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Other investors including Altimeter, General Catalyst and Coatue also participated, Anthropic said. "This financing demonstrates investors' extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth," Anthropic finance chief Krishna Rao said in a statement. Anthropic's valuation has been on a steep climb since it announced its AI assistant Claude in March 2023. The Amazon-backed startup was founded by former OpenAI research executives, including its CEO Dario Amodei. OpenAI and Anthropic are fierce competitors in the AI market. OpenAI, which rocketed into the mainstream following the release of its AI chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, is preparing to sell stock as part of a secondary sale that would value the company at roughly $500 billion, as CNBC reported in August. As of August, Anthropic said its run-rate revenue has reached more than $5 billion, up from roughly $1 billion at the beginning of the year. Anthropic said it will use its fresh capital to deepen safety research, meet growing enterprise demand and support international expansion.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly 600 economists signed an open letter Tuesday warning that President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook threatens the central bank's independence and erodes trust in a key pillar of the U.S. financial system. "We stand with Governor Cook and with the institutional safeguards that have long underpinned American economic strength," they added. The 593 signatories include Nobel Laureates Joseph Stiglitz, Claudia Goldin, Alvin Roth, Paul Migrom and Paul Romer, as well as multiple former Federal Reserve economists. Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein, who led the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, respectively, also signed the letter. On Aug. 25, Trump publicly posted a letter to Cook saying she had been removed from her position after an administration official accused Cook of having committed "mortgage fraud." In the letter, Trump said those allegations and a criminal investigation into them that was quickly launched by his Department of Justice, constituted "cause" for Cook's removal. But the economists in Tuesday's open letter pushed back, noting that the Federal Reserve Act, which Congress passed in 1913, designed the Fed to be independent and "insulated from day-to-day politics." Trump has been openly pressuring members of the Federal Reserve board for months to lower borrowing costs, accusing them of holding back U.S. economic growth. Before accusing Cook of fraud and trying to fire her over it, Trump had floated similar accusations against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell over claims he had mishandled building renovations to the Fed's historic headquarters in Washington, D.C. "It's possible there's fraud involved with the $2.5 billion renovation," Trump told reporters in July at the height of his campaign to find a reason to fire Powell. After Trump backed off Powell, he pivoted to Cook. The Fed appears poised to vote to lower its target interest rate by a quarter of a percent in September. But Trump and his allies want steeper cuts. "This approach threatens the fundamental principle of central bank independence and undermines trust in one of America's most important institutions. They also warn that weakening the high standard for removing a governor "increases monetary policy uncertainty and forces markets to price political risk into interest rates, raising those rates and costs for families and businesses." Cook has filed a federal lawsuit to block Trump from firing her and said in court filings that the allegations against her are pretextual and untrue. The judge in the case has yet to issue a decision after a hearing Friday on Cook's request for a quick ruling to temporarily bar Trump from firing her while the proceedings continue. The economists' letter was organized by Tatyana Deryugina, as associate finance professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and first reported by Bloomberg.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The studio announced Tuesday that it had inked a deal with Microsoft-owned Activision to develop, produce and distribute a live-action feature film based on the first-person shooter game. "As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty this is truly a dream come true," David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, said in a statement. "From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I've spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love." Paramount and Activision said they will honor the brand's "rich narrative and distinctive style" for fans of the video game franchise. Call of Duty has been the best-selling video game series in the U.S. for 16 consecutive years, with more than 500 million copies sold globally, the companies said. "I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand," Ellison said. The deal is yet another major announcement from Paramount since it officially merged with Skydance in early August. Days later the studio announced it had signed The Duffer Brothers, the creative team of Matt and Ross Duffer who created Netflix's "Stranger Things," to a four-year agreement for feature films, television and streaming projects. Ellison said in an open letter shortly after the merger that the company would invest in "high-quality storytelling and cutting-edge technology" to help "define the next era of entertainment."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warren Buffett told CNBC on Tuesday that he is disappointed in the Kraft Heinz split that unwinds much of the blockbuster merger he masterminded a decade ago. With a 27.5% stake in the company, Berkshire Hathaway is Kraft Heinz's largest shareholder. Shares of the company were down more than 7% following Buffett's comments. Buffett told CNBC's Becky Quick on Tuesday that the merger didn't turn out to be a brilliant idea, but he does not think that taking the company apart will fix its problems. Greg Abel, who will take reins at Berkshire Hathaway from Buffett at the end of the year, expressed disappointment to Kraft Heinz, according to Buffett. The split announced earlier Tuesday once again separates Kraft Heinz into two companies: one focused on sauces, spreads and shelf-stable meals and a second that includes North American staples like Oscar Mayer, Kraft singles and Lunchables. 3G Capital quietly exited its Kraft Heinz investment in 2023, after years of periodically trimming its stake as the company struggled. Though it holds a roster of iconic brands like Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, Kraft Heinz saw its U.S. sales slip just a few years after the merger. Some analysts also blamed the company's slump on cost-cutting measures that kept Kraft Heinz from investing in its brands at a time when they needed it most. In an effort to turn around the business, Kraft Heinz sold off some of its portfolio, like Planters nuts and some of its cheese division. The company has also been investing in some of its brands, like Lunchables and Capri Sun. In May, Kraft Heinz executives said the company was weighing strategic changes and potential transactions. Since the deal closed in 2015, Kraft Heinz shares had tumbled nearly 70% as of Friday's close, dragging the company's market value down to $33 billion. Even as other investors have lost faith in Kraft Heinz, Buffett has stood by the company, although he did tell CNBC after a disastrous quarter in 2019 that Berkshire overpaid for Kraft. Regarding Berkshire's future as a Kraft Heinz investor, Buffett told CNBC on Tuesday that Berkshire will do whatever is in the best interest of the firm. If Berkshire is approached to sell its shares, the firm will not accept a block bid unless other shareholders receive the same offer, according to Buffett.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla CEO Elon Musk predicted that Optimus robots, which have yet to hit the market, will eventually make up more than three-quarters of his automaker's value. In mid-2024, Musk predicted that Optimus robots would someday turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company, which was equal to more than half of the entire value of the S&P 500 at the time of his comment. With Tesla in the midst of a multi-quarter sales slump due to competition from lower-cost Chinese competitors, an aging lineup of electric vehicles, and Musk's incendiary political rhetoric and involvement with the Trump administration, the world's richest person has been trying to convince Wall Street to look to the future. For Tesla, that dream revolves around a world filled with robotaxis and humanoid robots, powered by artificial intelligence. "It is important to note that Tesla is by far the best in the world at real-world AI," Musk said on the company's second-quarter conference call with analysts in July. The problem for Tesla is that it's behind in those key markets. Meanwhile, competition in humanoid robots is coming from the likes of Chinese companies like Unitree, which won multiple medals at the World Humanoid Robot Games. Others in the space include Boston Dynamics, Agility Robotics, Apptronik, 1X and Figure. Musk said in March that Tesla plans to make 5,000 of its Optimus robots this year. In its first-quarter shareholder deck, Tesla said it was on target for "builds of Optimus on our Fremont pilot production line in 2025, with wider deployment of bots doing useful work across our factories." Milan Kovac, Tesla's vice president of Optimus robotics, announced his departure in June after nine years at the company. Tesla is developing Optimus with the aim of someday selling it as a bipedal, intelligent robot capable of everything from factory work to babysitting. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Tuesday barred President Donald Trump from deploying National Guard and other military troops in California to execute law-enforcement actions there, including making arrests, searching locations, and crowd control. The ruling came in connection with a lawsuit filed in early June by the state of California challenging Trump's and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's deployment of the Guard and Marines to deal with protests in Los Angeles over the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies. Judge Charles Breyer said that Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops and 700 Marines to L.A. "willfully" violated the federal Posse Comitatus Act, which bars U.S. Military forces from enforcing the law domestically. Breyer's injunction in U.S. District Court in San Francisco is limited to California, and the judge stayed the decision until Sept. 12 to give the Trump administration time to appeal it. But the decision comes as Trump has considered deploying National Guard troops to other U.S. cities to deal with crime, including Oakland and San Francisco. In mid-August, Trump placed Washington, D.C.'s police force under federal control and deployed National Guard troops in that city to address what he claims is a rampant crime problem. On Tuesday, Trump, in a social media pos,t said that at least 54 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend, and warned, "I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC." Breyer in his ruling warned that further deployments of Guard and military troops in other American cities would create "a national police force with the President as its chief." "President Trump's recent executive orders and public statements regarding the National Guard raise serious concerns as to whether he intends to order troops to violate the Posse Comitatus Act elsewhere in California," the judge wrote. Gavin Newsom gloated about the ruling in a social media post. "DONALD TRUMP LOSES AGAIN," Newsom wrote on X. Breyer, in his ruling, wrote, "Congress spoke clearly in 1878 when it passed the Posse Comitatus Act, prohibiting the use of the U.S. military to execute domestic law." "Nearly 140 years later, Defendants — President Trump, Secretary of Defense Hegseth, and the Department of Defense — deployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, ostensibly to quell a rebellion and ensure that federal immigration law was enforced," the judge wrote. "There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence," Breyer wrote. "Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law." Breyer said that evidence introduced during a trial for the lawsuit shows that the defendants had "systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles." No president is a king — not even Trump — and no president can trample a state's power to protect its people." "That's exactly what we've been warning about for months. Trump's attempt to use federal troops as his personal police force is illegal, authoritarian, and must be stopped in every courtroom across this country."
