                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jackie Gleason's former residence, affectionately dubbed “The Mothership,” has been listed for $5.5 million, drawing renewed attention to its spaceship-like design and storied past. Built in the 1950s in Cortlandt Manor, the circular home reflects Gleason's fascination with UFOs and outer space, a passion that reportedly extended to alleged encounters facilitated by none other than President Richard Nixon. According to a recent listing highlighted in the New York Post, the home retains original elements like curved walls, built-in furniture, and a central atrium, all crafted under the guidance of architect Paul Mayen, a disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright. Reports from Dwell magazine detail how the structure, inspired by Gleason's interest in extraterrestrial phenomena, was designed to host lavish parties attended by celebrities like Marilyn Monroe. Historical accounts suggest Gleason's UFO enthusiasm peaked after a purported 1973 visit to Homestead Air Force Base, where he claimed to have seen alien bodies, as recounted in various biographies. This obsession materialized in “The Mothership,” which he used as a weekend retreat while filming his iconic shows. The home's previous listing in 2018 fetched interest at $12 million, per coverage in 6sqft, but market shifts have now positioned it at a more accessible price point amid fluctuating luxury real estate dynamics. Preserving such a unique structure has not been without hurdles. The current owners have maintained its mid-century modern integrity, including the original cork floors and radial layout, as noted in a 2025 article from Hudson Valley News & Events. Yet, modern buyers may grapple with updating the 3,500-square-foot space to contemporary standards while honoring its heritage status—it's not officially landmarked but carries significant cultural weight. Real estate experts point to the property's location in affluent Peekskill as a selling point, with proximity to New York City and natural beauty enhancing its appeal. Today's market sees it positioned against a backdrop of rising interest in vintage celebrity homes, with comparable properties in the Hudson Valley fetching premiums for their historical narratives. For industry insiders, the sale underscores broader trends in preserving mid-century architecture amid sustainability concerns. As Curbed reported in its 2025 update, potential buyers might include entertainment moguls or tech entrepreneurs drawn to its quirky allure, potentially transforming it into a modern creative hub.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘Two great countries will get this solved': Scott Bessent on India-US trade tensions, calls SCO summit ‘performative' The ₹1 crore illusion: Why your retirement number is a myth US President Donald Trump is set to make an “announcement” from the Oval Office on Tuesday, September 2, at 2 pm ET, according to US reports. The 2 PM slot has been reserved for an unspecified announcement, which will follow a week-long public silence from the Republican politician's side. Some have already started wondering if the president may be ready to announce his resignation. Internet-famed independent reporter and attorney Aaron Parnas also shared via an Instagram video just over half-an-hour ago that Trump would be speaking in Oval Office “after days of no public events.” “This is an unspecified announcement and it comes after one week of real silence from the president outside of Truth Social post,” Parnas said in the clip. He was seen leaving from the White House for Trump National Golf Course in Sterling, Virginia, on Monday (US time). Internet users couldn't ignore his apparent weakened gait, while some even speculated whether he was balding. Just days ago, he re-posted a message, quoting his father: “I've never felt better in my life.” He then added to the post himself, saying, “The radical left is so sick and twisted.” The White House says President Trump will make “an announcement” tomorrow at 2pm ET. These Trump-related conspiracy theories about his allegedly dwindling health particularly hit their peak after Vice President JD Vance's comments in an interview with USA Today gained attention. “And if, God forbid, there's a terrible tragedy, I can't think of better on-the-job training than what I've gotten over the last 200 days.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Do you think it was a UFO or something else? In the trending video, which was posted by Meli (@melitonns), she was filming by the Seaport Village in San Diego when she and a friend saw something unusual. “Oh, I saw that, yo,” her friend says in the clip, reacting to the sight in real time. In the video, there's a speck of light that moves erratically through the sky and suddenly out of frame. “It happened so fast so I didn't get to catch it,” Meli said in the caption. “But I saw a flock of UFOs maybe like 15 to 20 of them flying, thought they were birds at first, but when I looked better they were glowing orbs. They appeared for a couple seconds then disappeared.” Navy pilots and crews have reported far more unidentified aerial phenomena than their Air Force counterparts. Experts say that's because many of these sightings happen over water—where unusual lights or objects are seen emerging from or diving into the ocean. For decades, the U.S. government has investigated strange lights in the sky, unusual radar readings, and claims of crashed spacecraft, National Geographic reported. The modern UFO era began after World War II. From 1947 to 1969, the Air Force ran Project Blue Book. A later study concluded most sightings could be explained by natural phenomena or hoaxes. That office investigated reports, including the now-famous 2004 Navy encounter off San Diego, when pilots saw a 40-foot-long craft with no visible wings or exhaust that outran F-18s. In the following years, Navy pilots reported more encounters. Those encounters included near-collisions on the East Coast. Pilots captured videos of objects that seemed to defy normal flight behavior, like rotating, flying at hypersonic speeds, and maneuvering without traditional propulsion. Some officials suggested these could be advanced surveillance craft from rival nations. By 2020, both the Pentagon and NASA had announced official task forces to investigate what are now called Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAPs. A 2021 intelligence report reviewed sightings from 2004 to 2021, leaving 171 unexplained. But I saw a flock of UFOs maybe like 15-20 of them flying , thought they were birds at first but when I looked better they were glowing orbs , they appeared for a couple seconds then disappeared.</p>
