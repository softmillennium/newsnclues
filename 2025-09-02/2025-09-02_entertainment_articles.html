                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oscar winner Kathryn Bigelow lit the fuse on A House of Dynamite on Tuesday evening at the Venice Film Festival, where the nuclear thriller premiered in competition and received an almost 13-minute ovation. This is Bigelow's first feature since 2017's Detroit and rounds up a starry cast that includes Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Gabe Basso, Jared Harris, Tracy Letts, Anthony Ramos, Moses Ingram, Jonah Hauer-King, Greta Lee and Jason Clarke.

That is how close mankind might be to blowing itself up if warnings like this exceptionally powerful and brilliantly directed movie's message isn't heeded.” RELATED: ‘A House Of Dynamite': What The Critics Are Saying About Kathryn Bigelow's Nuclear Thriller Earlier today, Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty filmmaker Bigelow told the Venice press corps she took the project on as a way to promote immediate discussion about nuclear disarmament across the globe. “Hope against hope,” she added, “maybe we reduce the global stockpile someday, but in the meantime we are really living in a house of dynamite.” Executive producers are Brian Bell and Sarah Bremner.

After having gone nearly a decade without releasing a feature, the consensus on the ground at Venice: director Kathryn Bigelow's latest film “A House of Dynamite” was well worth the wait. After her last film, “Detroit,” failed to receive the same awards attention her previous two Oscar-winning films, “The Hurt Locker” and “Zero Dark Thirty,” enjoyed the Best Director winner needed a break to find her next subject. At the “A House of Dynamite” festival press conference on Tuesday, she said, “I have to be passionate about a subject matter. Related Stories Michelle Yeoh Tells Us Why ‘Ne Zha 2' Needed a Dub ‘A House of Dynamite' Review: We're All F**ked in Kathryn Bigelow's Horrifically Gripping and Hopeless Nuclear Missile Thriller “A House of Dynamite,” a Netflix release, takes the audience through various perspectives on what would happen if the White House were to face an impending nuclear missile strike. “This is kind of a global issue, where we are with nuclear weapons. And, of course, hope against hope, maybe we reduce the nuclear stockpile someday,” said Bigelow of her motivation and message behind the film. And so my interest was to get that information out there.” Bigelow notably did not opt to write “Dynamite,” instead bringing in Oscar nominee and former President of NBC News Noah Oppenheim (“Jackie”), to pen the thriller. Of their collaboration, the screenwriter said, “One of the many things that make Kathryn such an extraordinary filmmaker is her commitment to authenticity, and from the very beginning, her mandate was ‘Let's find out how this would really work. Let's take people into these rooms where these decisions would be made, and show how it would actually unfold.' He had come from documentaries, so it's really just a natural translation and transition into a theatrical piece,” she said. In terms of Ackroyd's technique for immersing the audience inside the situation, “A House of Dynamite” actor Tracy Letts said, “At any given moment, I might have 20 cameras on me. The actor and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright is a standout among an all-star cast that includes Rebecca Ferguson, Idris Elba, Jared Harris, Greta Lee, and many, many more familiar faces from TV and film (including multiple “Hamilton” alumni). With a cast so huge, it may be hard for Academy members to find consensus on which specific actors to vote for. During the festival press conference, Letts further commended the work of Bigelow and Oppenheim, saying, “The movie could be performed as purely procedural, and we simply see people doing their jobs and nothing but their jobs. But the truth is, they're human beings performing these functions. Later, Bigelow chose to highlight still more below-the-line crew that were key toward capturing her hauntingly prophetic vision. “We have [production designer] Jeremy Hindle, who built the sets, and provided environments that these people also give it a degree of reality that, yes, the script is extraordinary,” she said. Finally, recent Oscar winner Volker Bertelmann was mentioned for his “off the charts” score, which keeps viewers firmly planted at the edge of their seat. After all, as Oppenheim said, “The world's always unstable in some way or another. We've constructed this [nuclear] weaponry that could end all life, and it's miraculous, frankly, that something horrific hasn't happened already.” “A House of Dynamite” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global music publishers group ICMP says songs by The Beatles and Michael Jackson are among those being illegally scraped to train genAI systems by the likes of Meta, OpenAI, X and Microsoft. LONDON — Some of the world's biggest technology companies, including Google, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI and X, scraped copyright-protected music from millions of songwriters, composers and artists to train generative artificial intelligence systems, says international music publishing trade association ICMP. The documents were gathered by ICMP using publicly available registries, open-source repositories of training content, leaked materials, research papers and independent research by AI experts. Documents ICMP shared with Billboard showing the commercial for-profit use of songwriters' music without a license include: ·  Private datasets that demonstrate the illegal scraping of copyright-protected music from YouTube by U.S.-based music-making apps Udio and Suno. ·  Analysis of Meta's Llama 3 open-source large language model outputs, which indicates it was trained on copyright-protected music and/or lyrics by The Weeknd, Lorde, Bruno Mars, Childish Gambino, Imagine Dragons, Alicia Keys, Ed Sheeran and Kanye West, among many others. ·  Court filings from a lawsuit filed by a group of music publishers against Anthropic, highlighting evidence that Anthropic infringed publishers' copyrighted song lyrics on a massive scale, by copying those lyrics both as input to train its AI model Claude and in the output Claude generates. The publishers' complaint includes examples of Claude output copying the lyrics to hundreds of their songs, including Don McLean's “American Pie,” Lynyrd Skynyrd's “Sweet Home Alabama,” Beyoncé's “Halo” and Mark Ronson's “Uptown Funk” featuring Bruno Mars. ·  Evidence that suggests Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has illegally copied, reproduced and distributed copyright-protected lyrics without a license. ·  An admission from OpenAI's chatbot (following enquiries from ICMP) that its OpenAI Jukebox music-making app was trained on copyright-protected music by a wide range of artists, including The Beatles, Elton John, Madonna, Elvis Presley, Drake, Kanye West, Frank Sinatra, Beyoncé and Ariana Grande. (In April 2020, when OpenAI launched Jukebox, the company publicly disclosed that it had trained the app on a dataset of 1.2 million songs, 600,000 of which were English-language, although it has never revealed what songs or artists were used.) Examples cited by ICMP include Bob Dylan's “Knockin' On Heaven's Door,” Michael Jackson's “Billie Jean” and Childish Gambino's “This Is America.” ·  A written admission from Google's Gemini chatbot that it is “highly likely” that Google's music generation model MusicLM had trained on copyright-protected music, which, it says, “could raise legal concerns” were the product to be used for commercial purposes. ·  Generative AI output that strongly suggests Midjourney copied and issued direct replicas of album art by artists such as Gorillaz, Dr. Dre, Michael Jackson, Bob Marley and many more for commercial use. ·  Datasets provided by Google initiative AudioSet, including for model training purposes, which demonstrate mass-scale scraping of music from YouTube without a license, thereby potentially breaching the DSP's terms of service as well as copyright laws. Other evidence of generative AI output built on copyright-protected music provided by ICMP includes the copying and distribution of song lyrics by X's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok. Over the past 18 months, ICMP has presented the documents to dozens of international policymakers and government representatives during private discussions around AI and its regulation, as well as excerpts to some targeted rights holders whose works have been similarly infringed. The international trade body has not shared them with any journalists or media other than Billboard. “Despite their public claims that they're not training upon copyright-protected works, we've caught many of them [tech companies] red-handed,” Phelan continues. “These AI tools are being used in ways that will displace lyric writers and undermine existing royalty streams. Although Large Language Model (LLM) lyrics may never have the creativity of a human, LLMs trained on human lyrics coupled with their speed, scale and economy, will undermine the incentive to create new art, which is the core mission of copyright law.” Billboard contacted all the tech companies mentioned by ICMP in its dossier of evidence. This disclosure by ICMP follows a rush of legal actions against AI companies from music rights holders, film studios, publishers and other media firms over alleged copyright infringement. Outside of the music industry, the London High Court is currently hearing a landmark copyright case brought by Getty Images against artificial intelligence company Stability AI over its image-generating tool, while Hollywood film studios Universal and Disney are suing San Francisco-based Midjourney, which they called a “bottomless pit of plagiarism,” for copyright infringement. In March, a California federal judge rejected a preliminary bid from the music publishers to block Anthropic from using copyright-protected lyrics to train its systems, stating, “It is an open question whether training generative AI models with copyrighted material is infringement or fair use.” However, ruling in Meta's favor, Judge Vince Chhabria warned that the judgment “does not stand for the proposition that Meta's use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful. It instructs tech companies to respect existing copyright law, including respecting music publishers' and record labels' rights reservations and training transparency obligations — currently a mostly black-box activity, with rights holders having no way of knowing on what material an AI system is being trained. Other jurisdictions and international governments, including the U.S., are in the process of drawing up their own AI laws, with questions around fair use-style exceptions for copyrighted material becoming a hotly contested battleground between music and tech lobbyists. ICMP points to legal clauses it has found contained in the terms of conditions and service contracts for numerous AI providers, including Facebook, YouTube, X, Google's Gemini, OpenAI, Suno, Udio, Microsoft and Adobe, that all expressly prohibit the scraping, access, duplication or publishing of the tech companies' content without prior written consent. “With AI and tech companies, all we hear is, ‘We need exceptions to build an open internet and access data, wholescale, without licenses, for our training,'” says Phelan. “What our work on AI shows is that at the very same time, they're demanding everybody else get prior written permission before using their content. The trade group says another example of big tech's double standards can be found in the training data sets used by generative AI developers like OpenAI, Udio and Runway. The datasets for GenAI often contain detailed identifiers per song ingested, including song titles, album names, songwriter names, genre, lyrics, tempo and year of release. “The data we have gathered and how [tech companies] are collating it explodes a lot of the myths being pushed about complexity to comply with copyright, or that it is too difficult to disclose what it is AI companies are training on,” says Phelan. He says the data ICMP has uncovered serves as “clear-cut evidence” that generative AI companies are training their systems on data “scraped from licensed services such as YouTube and Spotify without permission nor respect for laws.” Going forward, the organization says it will continue to build up its body of evidence and is sharing its research and analysis with ICMP member companies and their legal teams, a number of whom are taking legal steps. “The future,” Phelan says, “needs to be one of ‘license or desist.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturday Night Live has added five new cast members ahead of Season 51. The most headline grabbing name is that of Ben Marshall, one of the founders of comedy troupe Please Don't Destroy, which regularly make digital videos for the show and appear in sketches. Please Don't Destroy consists of Marshall, John Higgins, and Martin Herlihy, who all joined the show in 2021. Herlihy is thought to be staying as a writer with Higgins leaving. Elsewhere, Tommy Brennan, Jeremy Culhane, Kam Patterson and Veronika Slowikowska are joining the show. It comes after Heidi Gardner, Devon Walker, Emil Wakim and Michael Longfellow left the show, not quite the exodus that many were expecting. It also means that unless any of the other current cast members leave, the cast will be bigger than it was last year. Saturday Night Live, which is produced by Broadway Video, returns on October 4. Brennan, who was previously a New Face of Comedy at Just for Laughs in 2023, has performed on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Culhane is a regular on Dropout TV, formerly known as CollegeHumor, and also performs with the Upright Citizens Brigade in Los Angeles. Patterson is a stand-up comedian who is a regular on live comedy podcast Kill Tony, which has aired on Netflix, and will appear in the streamer's 72 Hours comedy movie that stars Kevin Hart and SNL's Marcello Hernández.

Eighteen minutes is all we have to save the country (or not) upon news of an impending nuclear missile in Kathryn Bigelow‘s horrifically gripping and cautionary “A House of Dynamite.” If we don't do something about the lunatics in power globally, and specifically at the helm of nine countries with a nuclear stockpile (including the United States), well then, we're fucked. Bigelow's explosively entertaining real-time thriller, told from multiple perspectives at various levels of government from situation room deputies to POTUS (Idris Elba) himself, does not mince on hopelessness. Here is a movie that will ruin your day. Noah Oppenheim's rigorously researched and vividly jargonistic script (he comes from a background in broadcast news at NBC) doesn't mince, either, on the mundanity of incompetence. — underlines how the United States' all-scenarios plan of military response to a nuclear attack is futile in the wake of an actual missile heading toward either Louisville, Chicago, Columbus, or best-guess somewhere else in the Midwest. Senior situation room duty officer Olivia Walker (Rebecca Ferguson) is having a normal day until U.S. intelligence reveals a likely nuclear object hurtling toward America. The film never identifies the missile's source, though hotshot deputy national security advisor Jake Baerington is tasked with brokering peace with Russia and a promise not to retaliate if the U.S. government is forced to attack another nuclear-armed nation preemptively — and on a phone call in which he reveals his wife is six months pregnant. Everyone has something or someone to lose here, including Jared Harris as Secretary of Defense Reid Baker, who's got an estranged daughter (Kaitlyn Dever) in Chicago who he knows is going to die. Then, there's Elba as the coolly serene president, who is ripped out of a PR-boosting photo opp with schoolchildren by his security details in a moment that eerily recalls George Bush being whispered to while reading “The Pet Goat” to a class of second-graders on September 11. Tracy Letts is having a whale of a time playing an almost somnambulant general who, eyes and spirit glazed over ahead of a wall of monitors displaying only bad news, matter-of-factly tells the president, “This is not insanity. It's reality.” He says something about the “dual phenomenology” of the attack — whatever that means, but it evidently has something to do with being confirmed by both satellite and ground intelligence before a retaliation rather than with the philosophies of Edmund Husserl — with a sardonic bemusement typical of the actor and playwright. Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd's camera zigs like a documentary rig, with crash zooms on stunted faces and, combined with the talky verisimilitude of a script that amplifies the inherent ridiculousness of red-tape protocol, “A House of Dynamite” sometimes feels like a horror movie version of television's “Veep.” Bigelow's work is procedural to its core, and that this film is a speculative what-if is made all the more horrifying because of its banality. “Surrender or suicide” is basically one of the unfortunate calls to action in a portfolio of doomsday scenarios POTUS likens to a diner menu: There are three options — “rare, medium, and well-done,” Jonah Hauer-King's lieutenant commander Robert Reeves tells him — and none are good. The first lady, meanwhile, is on a safari in Africa and hard to pin down, and a moment where POTUS' phone call with her drops out as 18 minutes turn into four and even fewer is one of an arsenal of devastating hammers Bigelow drops on you. “A House of Dynamite” moves at a whirring gradient with the ever-widening ensemble — which includes Greta Lee, Jason Clarke, and Moses Ingram as various cogs — that can be challenging to keep track of. Bigelow's grindingly focused direction is peerless here, with her already established as a frank and fearless chronicler of American political ambiguity in films like “The Hurt Locker” and “Zero Dark Thirty,” with “A House of Dynamite” seemingly completing a trilogy about the collapse of the American dream in war times. Both those films wrapped on woundingly open-ended notes, with an Iraq War veteran ambivalently marching off into another tour of duty in “The Hurt Locker” and a CIA analyst breaking down in her military transport after leading the manhunt to catch and kill Osama Bin Laden in “Zero Dark Thirty.” “A House of Dynamite” similarly ends without finishing the sentence, not with a bang or “Melancholia”-level explosion, but in silence. Hardly mere agitprop due to the stylistic intensity of its filmmaking, this gun-to-your-head engrossing movie — with its eardrum-piercing and death-rattling sound design and a score by Volker Bertelmann so oppressive it could swallow you whole — also wants to shake you out of your slumber with a cataclysmic whisper of an ending. “A House of Dynamite” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jane Krakowski will don Mary Todd Lincoln's curly wig in Cole Escola's outrageous, anachronistic, Tony Award-winning play later this fall. The 30 Rock star will spend eight weeks sucking down paint thinner and antagonizing her very famous husband from October 14 through December 17, Playbill reports. It's not hard to picture the 30 Rock character sweeping into the studio in a full hoop skirt to announce her new gig. Here's what Krakowski herself had to say about the role: “Thank you, Cole, for giving us this madcap work of genius, directed to perfection by Tony Award winner Sam Pinkleton… I am so honored to slip into the bratty curls previously worn by (my Tony Award–winning zaddy) Cole Escola, (my sister wife) Betty Gilpin, (my comedy brother) Tituss Burgess, and (mother) Jinkx Monsoon.” “From the first time I watched Oh, Mary! After seeing Burgess' performance earlier this year, The A.V. has room for many Marys, all of whom could bring something very different to the part.” We'll see what Krakowski brings to the cabaret-obsessed character in just a few weeks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HUNTR/X continues slaying all competitors (demon or otherwise) as “Golden” leads the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts for a seventh week each. 1 on each list for the act, whose music is voiced by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI. Songs from Netflix's animated smash KPop Demon Hunters account for half the Global 200's top 10 for a second week. Below “Golden,” Saja Boys remain at No. 3; both are sung by Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee. Plus, HUNTR/X's “How It's Done” holds at its No. 5 high and “What It Sounds Like,” likewise from the movie and soundtrack, jumps 10-7 for a new best. Elsewhere, Stray Kids' “Ceremony” bounds in at No. U.S. charts rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States. Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations. “Golden” tops the Global 200 with 120 million streams and 17,000 sold (up 6% week-over-week in each metric) worldwide in the week ending Aug. 28. Gains for the song were helped by KPop Demon Hunters' sing-along wide release in movie theaters Aug. 23-24 and that version's premiere on Netflix Aug. 25. The only song not from KPop Demon Hunters in the Global 200's top five, Alex Warren's “Ordinary,” is steady at No. 2 after 10 weeks on top beginning in May. Stray Kids' “Ceremony” launches at No. 10 on the Global 200 with 44 million streams and 10,000 sold worldwide. U.S. with 35.9 million streams and 5,000 sold outside the U.S. 1 on the Billboard 200 — is their third top 10 on each global chart, after “Chk Chk Boom” and “LALALALA.” The two tracks also reached No. 10 on the Global 200, in August 2024 and November 2023, respectively. 1 starting in May; “Soda Pop” repeats at its No. 3 high; BLACKPINK's “Jump” stays at No. 4, after it led in its debut week in July; and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” rises 7-5 following 17 weeks at No. 1 beginning a year ago this week. U.S. charts (dated Sept. 6, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Sept. 2 (one day later than usual due to the Labor Day holiday Sept. 1).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(One imagines this final crossover is on its way.) Our reader poll also continues, allowing you to split the decision around any matchup you think isn't getting a fair shake. Rush Hour and Rambo already set that poll apart, skating by on name recognition, while Jason Bourne beat out the dynamic cop duo of Lethal Weapon. But a TV star against an unknown Alan Rickman? The series lost its way when John McClane became a supersoldier. Speaking of, the loose In The Line Of Duty anthology burst onto the Hong Kong action scene with killer leads, relentless cops, dizzying choreography, and a who's who of martial arts staples. Cynthia Khan is a particular hidden gem after she takes over for Michelle Yeoh. Donnie Yen's epic, sprawling ode to Bruce Lee's martial arts master—a glossy historical epic that becomes more fawning and nationalistic as it goes—capably demonstrates Ip Man's near-magical abilities with Wing Chun. Yen's lithe movements and noble bearing are winning, to be sure. But Jackie Chan's impeccable stunt spectaculars win out the day because they're so grungy, tactile, and visibly dangerous. The incredible only impresses if one can tell that it's not impossible; Police Story weaponizes Chan's clownish cop bravado while making its realism clear in every frame. Even as the franchise descends into misfires and spin-offs, its early go-for-broke high points overcome the smooth consistency of its more respectable opponent. The polar opposite heroes of these franchises—the mega-suave, typically lean 007 and the bumbling, beefed-up Columbo that is Ma Seok-do, a man who politely bullies criminals until forced to use his sedan-sized body to inflict moderate helpings of police brutality upon them—belie a shared affection for making large-scale villainy more palatable thanks to a larger-than-life agent of order. But as much silly fun as it is watching the massive Ma Dong-seok play dumb and slap the ever-loving hell out of crooks, The Roundup franchise's films blend together into an affably repetitive blur. But there's enough diversity in its filmmakers' tone and approach to action that for every cornball set-up or predictable groaner, there's an imaginative stunt or killer fistfight bold enough to bring you to the edge of your seat. By making its spy antics bigger than the hero at their center, Bond remains flexible and—as the agent always does—lives to die another day. By Lethal Weapon 4, it had grown to an action-comedy ensemble, welcoming Rene Russo as an Internal Affairs love interest, Chris Rock as Murtaugh's future son-in-law, and Joe Pesci's squeaky shining star of the franchise. Characters accumulated around Murtaugh and Riggs despite the mortal danger they attracted, while bad guys died with exponential frequency. Subsuming more than three decades of action cinema, anime, and sci-fi, they wielded groundbreaking special effects and Yuen Woo-ping's fight choreography to craft a vibrant post-apocalyptic cyber-hell. Their setpieces have been etched into the firmament of genre filmmaking. But whereas Donner's auteurism is debatable, The Matrix films represent an exquisitely personal vision. Resurrections, Lana's solo-directed film, contends with the original's battered legacy by having Neo contend with the legacy of being Neo in that original film. At the heart of Mission: Impossible and Once Upon A Time In China are supermen: magnificently athletic, heroically asexual, capable of saving the world. Wong Fei-hung, the legendary and often fictionalized martial arts master, is played in four of the Once Upon A Time films by Jet Li as an ageless Forrest Gump-like avatar of Chinese nationalism, spectacularly colliding with Western imperialism. In stark contrast, Tom Cruise inhabits international superspy Ethan Hunt through all eight Missions: Impossible. Cruise could never say goodbye to Ethan Hunt, because he is Ethan Hunt, and Ethan Hunt is Tom Cruise, or at least the closest we'll ever get to knowing Tom Cruise. The series is not only his life's masterpiece, but his most precise expression of love for the movies, and for sacrificing his life to them—which he demonstrates through some of the most beautifully executed action scenes ever crafted. As much as Tsui Hark's direction cradles each of his Once Upon A Time entries' historical ills in endlessly attractive acrobatics and lavish sets, and as much as the series' theme song (Wong Jim's “A Man Of Determination”) is an all-time banger, Mission: Impossible thrums with cosmic desperation. Despite rotating directors, each entry stays remarkably consistent, plots unfolding endlessly around Cruise knocking on death's door. Clinging to the side of the Burj Khalifa, HALO jumping, sprinting nimbly down a Shanghai waterfront, holding his breath so long that you realize you are too—at their apexes, these films are elemental. Even if the Fast & Furious films seem like they're heading towards a technological future where Dominic Toretto somehow rides Skynet like a motorcycle, those hotrod melodramas wane in power even as they encroach upon the Terminator franchise‘s science fiction. There's a bit of Stockholm syndrome with the F&F movies; they become increasingly endearing as you feel more connected to the ever-expanding onscreen family, through time and ticket purchases, if nothing else. But the Terminator franchise didn't need to zip between countless countries, recruit cameos from musicians and models and MMA fights, or endlessly up its ante. Its effectiveness lies in its elegance, even when explosive—and, unlike F&F, it would've been even better had it just stopped after two entries. Cameron's second film perfectly established the mega-macho summer blockbuster template: An effects spectacular with catchphrases, enemies-turned-friends, and a propulsive construction that would shape films as seemingly distant from time-travel and killer AI as Fast & Furious. The Yautja may have alien technology on their side, but they've historically gotten their asses handed to them by humans far less deadly than the Baba Yaga himself. As cool as those mandible-mouthed bloodsport enthusiasts might be—and with, their consistent bag of tricks and defiant dedication to the thrill of the hunt, they're cool enough to hold their own as antiheroes—their action bona fides cower in the face of one middle-aged juggernaut. If we're simply comparing these two as movie-monsters, as otherworldly slasher villains whose violence tears through swathes of musclebound heavies, John Wick not only avoids being smoked by run-of-the-mill mercs, but goes out on his own terms after becoming more feared than a mere Predator ever was. And he does all this without the cheap cop-out of invisibility or plasma weaponry. I'll be honest: It's been hard to write this blurb, simply because I keep getting distracted imagining Chow Yun-fat driving a car in a Mad Max movie. Chow's intense cool factor powered the Better Tomorrow trilogy—he was so charismatic, in fact, that after his character dies in the first film, the sequel introduces his twin brother just because it couldn't do without a big dose of Chow. Despite its title, this singular hero is what Mad Max lacks, exchanging that specificity for something far more sweeping and grandiose. The compulsive, primal franchise of chases, revenge, and survival speaks to an eternal fear of extermination and an animalistic desire to escape it—a poetic drive outracing even that of Woo's heroic bloodshed films. George Miller's evolving, heart-revving vision from the original film forward has eclipsed anything as limiting as a character or an actor, which is what makes it great. We're already deviating in an interesting way in our parallel poll, but that just means more opportunity to tell us that we're wrong. (And there are just never enough chances for that, right?)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As President Donald Trump threatens to deploy federal troops to Chicago in a continuation of his attempted power grab within prominent Democratic cities, a federal judge has ruled that his deployment of military personnel to Los Angeles in June violated the Posse Comitatus Act. On Tuesday, Northern District of California Judge Charles Breyer ruled that the Trump administration “violated the Posse Comitatus Act,” which prohibits the use of the military as a mechanism of civilian law enforcement, when it deployed hundreds of members of the National Guard, and later U.S. Marines, to Los Angeles in response to protests against raids and arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Breyer added that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities across the country — including Oakland and San Francisco, here in the Northern District of California — thus creating a national police force with the president as its chief.” Hours before Breyer issued his ruling, Trump suggested on Truth Social that he's planning to replicate his crackdown on blue cities — which has so far targeted Los Angeles and Washington D.C. — in Chicago. Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet. Chicago will be safe again, and soon,” the president wrote. So, it's clear that in secret they're planning this — well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops, if they in fact do that,” he told CBS's Face The Nation on Sunday.

With Breyer's ruling against the Trump administration, Pritzker and other Democratic states looking to enjoin Trump's attempted takeover of local law enforcement should expect more favorable outcomes in court.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gérard Depardieu will return to criminal court in Paris for a new rape and sexual assault trial tied to accusations brought by the actress Charlotte Arnould, The Associated Press reports. Depardieu is accused of sexually assaulting Arnould and rape by digital penetration. The alleged attack took place at Depardieu's home in Paris in August 2018 while the pair were reportedly rehearsing a scene for a play. Arnould reported the alleged attack to police a few days after, but the actor wasn't indicted and charged until 2021. Her lawyer, Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, echoed the sentiment to Franceinfo, saying she was “extremely satisfied” and called the decision “a moment of judicial truth in this case.” Depardieu has previously denied the allegation, claiming his encounter with Arnould had been consensual.

His story is both inspirational and revelatory for all generations.” In “Truly,” according to Richie's website, he “revisits hilarious and harrowing events that seek to inspire all who doubt themselves or feel their dreams don't matter.” The description continues, “Lionel chronicles lessons learned in the course of his most unlikely of success stories—from a painfully shy, ‘tragically' late bloomer to his dramatic transformation into a world-class entertainer and composer of love songs that have played as the soundtrack of our lives.” Richie will hit the road for a star-studded book tour with town hall conversations in four cities. On the eve of his book launch, September 29, he'll be in New York with “Good Morning America” anchor Robin Roberts. Richie will head to Las Vegas on October 2 for a night with comedian Sebastian Maniscalco, and he'll be in Los Angeles on October 6 for a town hall hosted by late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The popular video game franchise will become a live action film through the deal, which Paramount CEO David Ellison calls a "dream come true." Video game IP has become a prized asset for film and TV executives, with homegrown original franchises  still hard to come by. Sonic the Hedgehog is a hit for Paramount already, with films based on games like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Metal Gear Solid and Elden Ring also in line for film treatments in the next few years. “From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I've spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love. Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honor and a responsibility that we don't take lightly.” “We're approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve,” he continued. When asked by The Hollywood Reporter earlier this month about his future plans for Paramount, and whether video games would be a part of it, Ellison said that “gaming is absolutely going to be an area that we obviously look towards,” with Skydance already investing in the space. That has included a $7.7 billion deal for UFC rights, and an exclusive multi-year deal with the Duffer brothers, the creators of Netflix's hit Stranger Things. “Throughout its history, Call of Duty has captured our imagination with incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world, and that focus on making incredible Call of Duty games remains unwavering,” Activision president Rob Kostich added. “With Paramount, we have found a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment. The film will honor and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started. Our shared goal is quite simple — to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans of the franchise.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
