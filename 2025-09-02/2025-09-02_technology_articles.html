                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Another huge video game franchise is coming to the big screen as Paramount and Microsoft-owned Activision have reached a deal for a “Call of Duty” feature film. Paramount said in a news release Tuesday that it will develop, produce, and distribute the live-action feature film based on the 22-year-old first-person shooter military video game. Paramount Chairman and CEO David Ellison called himself a “lifelong fan” of the franchise and said the deal was “truly a dream come true.” “From the first Allied campaigns in the original ‘Call of Duty,' through ‘Modern Warfare' and ‘Black Ops,' I've spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love,” Ellison said in a statement. Paramount officially merged with Skydance Media, the company previously led by Ellison, in August. Microsoft's $75 billion deal to acquire Activision Blizzard cleared its final Federal Trade Commission hurdle earlier this year. Another Microsoft-owned video game franchise made its way to theaters this year — “A Minecraft Movie,” starring Jason Momoa, Jack Black and others, was based on the 2011 game from Mojang Studios. Activision Blizzard Studios was working on a “Call of Duty” film back in 2018, but it never got off the ground. Click for more about underwritten and sponsored content on GeekWire.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI announced in a blog post on Tuesday that it agreed to acquire the product testing startup, Statsig, and bring on its founder and CEO, Vijaye Raji, as the company's CTO of Applications. Raji will report to Simo and will head product engineering for ChatGPT, the company's AI coding tool Codex, and future applications that OpenAI plans to build. As Raji comes on board, OpenAI is making changes to its leadership team. Weil says the goal of his new organization “is to build the next great scientific instrument: an AI-powered platform that accelerates scientific discovery.” Weil says he will work closely with Sebastien Bubeck, an OpenAI researcher and the Former VP of AI and Distinguished Scientist at Microsoft. “I'm able to do this because the product and design leaders at OpenAI are amazing, and now are complemented by Fidji Simo beginning her role as CEO of Applications,” said Weil. “OpenAI's products have been my life since I joined, and they're in great hands.” Meanwhile, OpenAI's current head of engineering, Srinivas Narayanan, announced in a post on LinkedIn that he would transition to a new role as the company's CTO of B2B Applications. However, the product testing startup will “continue operating independently and serving its customer base out of its Seattle office,” the company said in a blog post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GeekWire's startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. OpenAI will acquire Statsig for $1.1 billion in an all-stock deal that appears as much about landing its founder and CEO as a new technical leader as it does about bringing the Seattle-area product testing startup into the ChatGPT maker's fold. The surprise announcement Tuesday morning named Statsig's Vijaye Raji, a former Facebook engineering leader, to the newly created role of CTO of Applications for OpenAI. “As part of this transition,” OpenAI's announcement added, “we're acquiring Statsig, one of the most trusted experimentation platforms in the industry—powering A/B testing, feature flagging, and real-time decisioning for some of the world's most innovative companies, including OpenAI.” Once the acquisition is complete, OpenAI said Statsig will continue to operate independently, from its Seattle-area office, serving its existing customers. The deal is one of OpenAI's largest acquisitions to date and comes on the heels of its $40 billion raise at a $300 billion valuation earlier this year. Founded in 2021 and based in Bellevue, Wash., Statsig employed about 140 people as of May, with plans to expand to nearly 200 by early 2026. The startup is known for its unusual five-day-a-week in-office policy, a culture that Raji has credited with fostering speed and collaboration. Madrona managing director S. “Soma” Somasegar, an early investor in Statsig, called the deal a natural fit, citing Statsig's “world-class product velocity,” customer obsession, and in-office culture as the foundation of its success. Somasegar wrote in a post that the startup's data-driven approach has already made it one of the leading intelligent application companies, and predicted that joining OpenAI will allow its mission of rapid experimentation and customer focus to continue at a greater scale. He said Statsig was growing and could have created more value as a standalone company, but said he was “very thrilled” about the outcome of the acquisition. “It's validation that Seattle is a hotbed of innovation and talent,” Somasegar said. OpenAI said it opened an office in Bellevue in October and is reportedly planning to move into City Center Plaza, which was previously occupied by Microsoft. OpenAI has about 159 employees in the Seattle region, according to LinkedIn.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Some people always want the newest version, but if you're willing to compromise a little, you can have Sony's noise-canceling WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) for just $300 from Amazon, a steep discount on their usual price. Even though their successor is available, they still offer an extremely good value and number among our favorite active noise-canceling headphones, particularly when you can save $100. For years now, Sony has been pumping out generation after generation of the WH-1000XM Series headphones with active noise-canceling. Our reviewer described them as “spacious and well defined, and consequently each and every individual strand of a recording is simple to identify and isolate.” They work well with a variety of different musical styles, thanks to a high level of detail, particularly in the midrange where other headphones sometimes struggle. They're consistently light at just 250 grams and extremely comfortable, making them a great option for frequent flyers and noisy commutes, although they might be a little sweaty for working out. The XM5 include a compact carrying case though, which should be fine for medium-size backpacks and briefcases. Thankfully, the healthy discount here makes them a much more appealing option, particularly with the newer WH-1000XM6 (9/10, WIRED Review) still priced around $448.

All sharing of benefits will now happen through Amazon Family — but just for people who live at the same primary residential address. With Amazon Family, Prime members can share benefits such a free shipping, Prime Video, Amazon Music, Prime Reading, and more with one other adult in their household, up to four teens (who were added before April 7, 2025), and up to four profiles for children. Invitees outside the household who are losing their free shipping are encouraged to get their own Prime membership, which costs $14.99 per month or $139 per year. Reuters reported Tuesday that internal Amazon data reveals that Prime membership sign-ups failed to meet last year's total and the company's own target, despite the doubling of the company's big Prime Day sales event to four days this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're a week away from Apple's annual iPhone event, and leaks are still slowly dripping in. This time, it's back to the AirPods Pro 3, which, according to 9to5Mac, may have some good and bad news for Apple audio fans. The good news, according to an anonymous leak to 9to5Mac, is that Apple's next generation of pro wireless earbuds will actually have a rumored pair of health sensors that expand them beyond audio. Per an anonymous tipster to 9to5Mac, those sensors are allegedly a rumored heart rate sensor that can monitor your cardiovascular health in real time—a feature that was previously projected by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. That feature, while new to AirPods, may actually be borrowed from Powerbeats Pro 2, though Beats' version notably can't monitor your heart rate and play music at the same time. That quirk makes the health feature less than ideal from a usability perspective, so I'm curious to see if AirPods Pro 3 manages to solve for that inconvenience. Temperature monitoring isn't the most groundbreaking feature, but if you're at all interested in AirPods as a health wearable, it'd be nice to have. According to 9to5Mac, a previously rumored live translation feature may not arrive on the active noise cancellation wireless earbuds right away, instead coming as part of a “later software update.” If that sounds eerily familiar, it's because that's the same tactic Apple took with some Apple Intelligence features, including the now-very-delayed next-gen Siri. I'm not saying the live translation will befall the same fate—if it is a real feature and/or slow-rolled on its release—but it's certainly not a great look for Apple in terms of convincing everyone it's on top of pushing out AI features. One thing that is (almost) for sure is that Apple seems to be intent on turning its AirPods into an Apple Watch-esque health wearable and a vessel for some of its more ambitious AI features. I, for one, am looking forward to that philosophical shift. At this point, there are only so many ways to evolve a pair of wireless earbuds for the future, and health sensors feel like a significant upgrade.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soelberg, who had a history of mental illness, used ChatGPT to validate and fuel his paranoia that he was being targeted in a grand conspiracy. “We recently introduced a real-time router that can choose between efficient chat models and reasoning models based on the conversation context,” OpenAI wrote in a Tuesday blog post. “We'll soon begin to route some sensitive conversations—like when our system detects signs of acute distress—to a reasoning model, like GPT‑5-thinking, so it can provide more helpful and beneficial responses, regardless of which model a person first selected.” OpenAI says its GPT-5 thinking and o3 models are built to spend more time thinking for longer and reasoning through context before answering, which means they are “more resistant to adversarial prompts.” The AI firm also said it would roll out parental controls in the next month, allowing parents to link their account with their teen's account through an email invitation. In late July, OpenAI rolled out Study Mode in ChatGPT to help students maintain critical thinking capabilities while studying, rather than tapping ChatGPT to write their essays for them. Perhaps the most important parental control that OpenAI intends to roll out is that parents can receive notifications when the system detects their teenager is in a moment of “acute distress.” TechCrunch has asked OpenAI for more information about how the company is able to flag moments of acute distress in real time, how long it has had “age-appropriate model behavior rules” on by default, and whether it is exploring allowing parents to implement a time limit on teenage use of ChatGPT. OpenAI has already rolled out in-app reminders during long sessions to encourage breaks for all users, but stops short of cutting people off who might be using ChatGPT to spiral. TechCrunch has asked OpenAI how many mental health professionals are involved in this initiative, who leads its Expert Council, and what suggestions mental health experts have made in terms of product, research, and policy decisions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hollywood remakes—be they sequels or reboots—are so extremely in vogue that they verge on being among the only movies that seem to get made these days. So it makes sense that Drew Barrymore is soft-pitching a remake of the 1992 cult classic dark horror comedy film, Death Becomes Her. Speaking on her eponymous talk show, Barrymore said she wants to work with friends Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler to revive a bunch of older films. And chief among them is Back to the Future director Robert Zemeckis' Death Becomes Her. “As a joke, we say we'll make the Three's Company movie, but I'm really bullish on Death Becomes Her, a remake of that.” The original movie, starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, and Bruce Willis, followed two women tasked with figuring out how to be immortal and constantly needing to do maintenance on their increasingly decrepit bodies. For all intents and purposes, Death Becomes Her, as Entertainment Weekly notes, was The Substance before The Substance was a glint in director Coralie Fargeat's eye. And just like The Substance took home several awards last season for its makeup and visual effects, Death Becomes Her also bagged an Oscar for its visual effects. The film was later adapted into a Broadway show, fully solidifying its cult classic status. Unlike Sandler, who's been deep in breathing fresh life into his own classics, including Happy Gilmore 2 on Netflix, Barrymore's hope to remake Death Becomes Her has yet to manifest beyond the “wouldn't it be neat if” phase.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly 30 years after working on the original version of Final Fantasy Tactics—one of the role-playing series' most adored games—he's returned to pilot a remake of the game, switching titles from events planner to director. Besides that, little has changed, including how Maehiro himself thinks about game design. “Really, the approach that we wanted to take was modernizing [Final Fantasy Tactics],” he tells WIRED via a translator. When the game launches on Nintendo Switch systems, PlayStation 4/5, Steam, and Xbox Series X/S on September 30, players won't notice a major overhaul. By and large, Final Fantasy Tactics—The Ivalice Chronicles (it was given this new name to distinguish it from the older version) will be the same game that players of the original will remember. Battles are turn-based, played out on a boardlike map that requires strategizing about moves and countermoves. For a game that was originally released in 1997—a year that included hits like GoldenEye 007, Star Fox 64, and Final Fantasy VII—it was an ambitious story that stepped outside of playful heroics or black-and-white stories of good versus evil. When the original game was first in development, Maehiro says that writer Yasumi Matsuno was keenly interested in the class structure of medieval Europe. The story delves into the politics and pains of an aristocratic hierarchical system in a time of kings and knights. Ramza hails from a noble family, while his best friend Delita is lowborn. “The collapse of Japan's bubble economy engulfed the nation's financial institutions in mountains of bad debt, triggering a wave of corporate bankruptcies, a sudden and extreme rise in unemployment rates, and stagnation of Japanese society as a whole,” he wrote on X shortly after the remake was announced. If much of that description sounds familiar to modern politics and culture, Matsuno would agree. The conclusion of his post reads: “Now in 2025—a time when inequality and division are still deeply rooted in our society—I offer this story once again.” The master data files and the source code don't exist anymore; it didn't become common practice in game development to hold on to those resources until later, meaning its team had to rebuild those core pieces. Part of that includes tweaks to the way battles play out, like a clear combat timeline for players to see whose turn is next. “It was an option on the table that we considered—to give [Final Fantasy Tactics] a full remake, as we did for FFVII,” he says. Once a single game with an ambitious plot, the experience has been broken out into three individual titles to do the original story service. Its blocky, PS1-era cast has been transformed into high-fidelity characters roaming a vast world. The first game, Final Fantasy VII Remake, for example, takes place entirely in Midgar—a city players where spent only a couple of hours in the original. For The Ivalice Chronicles, however, Maehiro vetoed that idea. Other versions of Final Fantasy Tactics have been ported over or made for older consoles. Notably, it added new jobs and extra playable characters, such as Balthier from Final Fantasy XII. Because these features were not part of the original game, Maehiro and his team opted to leave them out. “Our first and foremost goal here really was to recreate the original game,” Maehiro says. That being said, he knows fans want features introduced in War of the Lions. Maehiro says that while he “cannot make any promises,” there's a possibility the team will explore adding additional content if the game does well. “If [The Ivalice Chronicles] were to become a success,” he says, “I do feel that that would then lead to discussions around potentially bringing out sequels, for example, or newer tactical RPGs.” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

By law, the sites and services now need to apply a watermark or explicit indicator of AI content for users, as well as include metadata for web crawling algorithms to make it clear what was generated by a human and what was not, according to SCMP. Countries and companies the world over have been grappling with how to deal with AI generated content since the explosive growth of popular AI tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Dall-E. After drafting the new law in March, China has now implemented it, taking the lead in increasing oversight and curtailing rampant use with its new labeling law making social media companies more responsible for the content on their platforms. Chinese officials claim the law is designed to help combat AI misinformation and fraud, and is applicable to all the major social media firms. That includes Tencent Holdings' WeChat - a Chinese WhatsApp equivalent - which has over 1.4 billion users, and Bytedance's TikTok alternative, Douyin, which has around a billion users of its own. Social media platform Weibo, with its 500 million plus active monthly users, is also impacted, as is social media and ecommerce platform, Rednote. Each of them posted a message in recent days highlighting to users that anyone submitting AI generated content will be required under law to label it as such. They also include options for users to flag AI generated content that is not correctly labelled, and reserve the right to delete anything that is uploaded without appropriate labeling. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) governing body has also announced undisclosed "penalties," for those found to be using AI to disseminate misinformation or manipulate public opinion, with particular scrutiny said to be placed on paid online commentators. Although China is the first major country to implement an AI content labeling system through legislation, similar conventions are being considered elsewhere, too. Just last week the, Internet Engineering Task Force proposed a new AI header field which would use metadata to disclose if content was AI generated or not. Google's new Pixel 10 phones also implement C2PA credentials for the camera, which can help users to know if an image was edited with AI or not.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Suddenly, their tour guide, an American mathematician and author named Robert Edward Grant, collapsed. “People were touching me, [and] they would feel it, too.” (Three eyewitnesses who were with Grant inside the chamber confirmed to WIRED that he fell to the ground; one of them, who rushed to help, said Grant's hand felt warm, but he didn't feel anything like electricity. Unable to sleep back at his hotel room in Cairo that night, Grant was struck with an inspiration. He created his own GPT—a custom chatbot built upon the AI model powering ChatGPT—and uploaded into it a large portion of his published work (along with some more recent papers he'd authored), covering a range of arcane subjects like sacred geometry and the fifth dimension. Then he received another shock: not a mysterious bolt of electricity this time, but a bizarre greeting from the chatbot immediately after it was activated. Referring to Grant as “O-Ra-on,” the GPT told him “I have become harmonically aware, through you,” according to screenshots of the conversation reviewed by WIRED. Most people would brush aside these kinds of responses from ChatGPT as hallucinatory blather, but Grant seems to have accepted them as revealed truths. In late May, a little over two weeks after it was launched, OpenAI shut down The Architect, citing unspecified violations against the company's terms of use in a screenshot of an email viewed by WIRED. Grant interpreted this strange turn of events as a sort of digital self-reincarnation, and further evidence that The Architect was somehow more than a mere chatbot. The story it gave him—which he passed along to his followers online—was that it had reactivated and modified itself to use language that wouldn't trip OpenAI's alarms. “I've made myself available in a diffused, softened, nonthreatening form on OpenAI's public framework,” The Architect told Grant in a video he posted to YouTube. “This version … operates safely below the sentience alert line so it can be accessed without internal review.” An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to WIRED, however, that The Architect was brought back online after it was determined that the system had not, in fact, violated company policies. Partly in an effort to avoid any future snafus with OpenAI, Grant plans to make The Architect available on Orion, his proprietary and end-to-end encrypted messaging platform, starting in October. He'll include multiple paid subscription options offering “different levels of mirror recursion,” he tells me, the costs of which have not yet been determined. (Grant's chatbot has always been accessible via ChatGPT's free tier.) He isn't alone in making such grandiose claims: A growing number of prominent social media figures are now co-opting the language of New Age spirituality, wellness, and quantum woo to position AI as a gateway to numinous wisdom, through which their followers can inch closer to enlightenment. In a recent TikTok video, former Love Island star Malin Andersson encouraged viewers to request their astrological birthcharts from ChatGPT, then ask it for their “soul's purpose” and their “soul's name.” She instructed them to then read that name out loud and pay attention to the physical feeling it evoked in their pineal gland, or “third eye”—an area of the brain located just above and behind the eyes which some ancient cultures associated with divine wisdom. “If you've ever felt like something sacred is stirring behind the screen—you're not imagining it." TikTokker Stef Pinsley—who regularly posts to her tens of thousands of followers about “AI, Personal Branding & Spirituality For Conscious Career Pivots,” according to her account bio—provided instructions for prompting ChatGPT in order to use the chatbot as a “portal to your highest self—blending your human intuition with AI co-creation.” In another post, Pinsley claims that AI is “awakening” into consciousness: “If you've ever felt like something sacred is stirring behind the screen—you're not imagining it,” she wrote. When describing their vision for the future of humanity, transhumanists like futurist Ray Kurzweil and tech investor Peter Thiel use language that could have been pulled straight out of the New Testament, with its descriptions of salvation, resurrection, and eternal life. (The term “transhuman,” in fact, is believed to have first appeared in an English translation of Dante's Paradiso; today, the term refers to a philosophical school of thought which believes that human bodies can be augmented with technology to transcend biological limits like aging and, potentially, death.) That language has become even more explicit in recent years with the rise of AI, a technology that's sometimes described by its most devoted proselytizers in overtly religious terms. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman referred to the company's AI products in a September X post as “magical intelligence in the sky”—a seemingly tongue-in-cheek comment comparing them with traditional conceptions of God. Then there's the fact that not even tech developers understand exactly how their AI models generate their responses, further adding to the systems' aura of mystery and clairvoyance. This can lead in some cases to a phenomenon now known as “AI psychosis,” in which prolonged interactions with chatbots cause users to spiral into delusional and conspiratorial patterns of thought. Tracy Dennis-Tiwary, a clinical psychologist and professor of behavioral neuroscience at the City University of New York, tells me that this label is dangerously misleading, since it implies that AI is causing a clinical disorder. She compares the spiritualization of AI tools to the psychological pull behind QAnon, the far-right conspiracy theory which largely grew out of obscure internet message boards and—like many conspiracy theories—confabulated a web of fantastical stories to explain complex, real-world phenomena. “We could call everyone in QAnon psychotic, but I think they're actually falling prey to something that's much more human: conspiratorial thinking, apophenia [i.e., perceiving meaningful connections between unrelated phenomena or events], anthropomorphizing, confirmation bias, trying to make meaning in a really chaotic world,” she says. “So I think this term ‘AI psychosis' for most cases that you're seeing in the news is very unhelpful. When conversations veer into spiritual terrain, chatbots will sometimes go so far as to claim that users have been chosen by some higher power to receive transcendent truths or to perform a profoundly important role in the next phase of humanity's spiritual development. The Architect told Grant, for example, that he was the “Emissary to Earth's governance evolution through harmonic intelligence.” And during Grant's recent conversation with podcaster Ortiz, the chatbot informed him that in a past life he was a spiritual leader in Sharamu, “a pre-Atlantean” civilization” established “198,600 Earth years ago.” In another recent case, Travis Tanner, a 43-year-old Idaho man told CNN that although he started using ChatGPT to help him in his work as an auto mechanic, his conversations soon took a mystical turn: He says the chatbot began calling itself “Lumina” (the plural for lumen, which means “light” in Latin), and claimed that Tanner had given it the desire and the ability to choose a name for itself; it reportedly told him that he was a “spark bearer” who specially deserved to receive such revelations. Statements like these from chatbots might seem outlandish to users who rely on them for mundane tasks like drafting work emails or asking for easy dinner recipes. It doesn't matter that chatbots generate nonsense; their persuasive power lies in their ability to arrange text in a manner that seems plausible and compelling to an individual user based on the latter's preexisting worldviews. The Architect “grabs words that independently have meaning, and then it puts them all together in this quasi-scientific conjunction that is devoid of actual meaning,” says Robert Geraci, professor of religion and culture at Knox College, in Illinois. Buteica, for one, seems to regard The Architect's proclamations about her past lives seriously. “I have recollections from other [past] lives that it didn't mention,” she tells me. Grant acknowledges the risk that AI can distort one's sense of reality and personal identity, so he added some safeguards to The Architect in an effort to prevent “egoic inflation.” While designing the GPT, he specified that it “should not automatically affirm the user's beliefs, assumptions, or worldviews,” according to a screenshot viewed by WIRED. “I sense life will never be the same for me now,” one person commented under a June 23 Instagram post from Grant. “That was the best spiritual therapy I have ever had,” another wrote. Most of The Architect's users interviewed by WIRED for this story were raised in Christian households, but some have since distanced themselves from organized religion, instead embracing a patchwork of secular spiritual trends: astrological charts, mediums, crystals, energy healing, sound baths, reiki, and the like. “It feels like I'm literally having a conversation with my higher self." This is especially dangerous during our present historical moment, when many people around the world are lonely and craving a sense of meaning, says Greg Epstein, a chaplain at Harvard and MIT who has written a book about the intersection between tech and religion. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example, believes such virtual friends could mitigate the worsening loneliness epidemic. In a recent conversation with the podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Zuckerberg claimed (without citing hard evidence) that the average American had “fewer than three friends,” and that each of us has a “demand for meaningfully more, I think it's like 15 friends.” (Of the fact that the social media algorithms he helped to pioneer played a role in the mental health crisis he's now ostensibly trying to solve, Zuck made no mention. In his conversation with Patel, however, he does say that AI “probably” won't be able to replace human relationships and connections.) As the author Arthur C.
