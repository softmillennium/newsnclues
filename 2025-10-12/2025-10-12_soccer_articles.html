The Netherlands will aim to place one foot in the 2026 World Cup's list of qualified teams as it seeks a fifth qualifying win at home to Finland on Sunday. Ronald Koeman's hosts will feel upbeat about their chances of a third straight qualifying win given they beat Finland 2-0 in Helsinki four months ago. That marked a fifth straight defeat to the Dutch in their head-to-head, and it's now been 75 years since Finland's only win over the Netherlands to date. Memphis Depay's injury-time finish in Thursday's 4-0 win over Malta took him two goals clear of Robin van Persie as the Netherlands' all-time top scorer, with 52 goals to his name. The Corinthians attacker doesn't appear to have lost his sheen since moving to Brazil and will be out for blood after scoring in the win over Finland earlier this year, with five goals to his name in qualifying thus far.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea owner Todd Boehly has made it his mission to bring some of the top young players to his clubs since investing, and now one of the top talents in the United States is reportedly on their radar. The Blues have spent big money on bringing in wonderkids to both Chelsea and Strasbourg, and Chelsea are finally starting to reap the rewards of this strategy. Despite a plethora of talent already on their books, they are continuing to analyse around the world for top players they can bring in to either BlueCo club. One of those who is standing out right now is Seattle Sounders star Obed Vargas, who was recently voted as number one on the MLS' list of 22 under 22. According to The Telegraph, he is on the radar of BlueCo, who own both of Chelsea and Strasbourg. The Ligue 1 side are very much being used as a feeder club for the Blues at the moment, with a number of their top performers set for long careers in West London. Kendry Paez, Mike Penders, Mamadou Sarr and Emanuel Emegha are all currently owned by the Blues, however will remain with Strasbourg for this season at least. Seattle Sounders didn't make it out of the group stage at the Club World Cup, however there was time for Vargas to make his mark. He left the tournament as one of the most promising young players, who has gained the attention of a number of clubs around Europe as a result. BlueCo have already signed Julio Enciso, who has a chance of making it at Stamford Bridge, and the same could be on the cards for Vargas if he does move to Strasbourg.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Milan wingback Federico Dimarco and striker Francesco Pio Esposito were among the stars in Italy's win over Estonia. This is the view in today's print edition of Turin-based newspaper Tuttosport, via FCInterNews. Italy got a hugely significant win over Estonia yesterday evening. The Azzurri have been at risk of missing out on a third straight World Cup. They had already failed to qualify for the 2018 and 2022 editions of the tournament, and did not get their qualification off to the best of starts this time around. In the view of Tuttosport, two of Italy's top performers were Inter wingback Federico Dimarco and striker Francesco Pio Esposito. He assisted Moise Kean's opening goal within the first few minutes. Overall, Dimarco had a strong match, Tuttosport argue, continuing his bright start to the season with Inter. Meanwhile, Francesco Pio Esposito came on as a substitute for Kean after the Fiorentina striker suffered an injury. In the view of Tuttosport, Pio Esposito's display was outstanding. In the view of Tuttosport, meanwhile, Inter midfielder Nicolo Barella and defender Alessandro Bastoni enjoyed solid matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Milan striker Francesco Pio Esposito has been named as the “MVP” for Italy in yesterday's World Cup qualifying win over Estonia. Today's print edition of Milan-based newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, via FCInterNews, highlight the 20-year-old's sparkling display. The newspaper also praises Nerazzurri duo Nicolo Barella and Federico Dimarco. Italy secured a hugely important victory over Estonia yesterday. At risk of missing out on a third consecutive World Cup, the EURO 2020 winners needed to take three points. Italy got off to just the right start. This courtesy of an assist from Inter wingback Federico Dimarco. Then, Mateo Retegui doubled Italy's advantage a few minutes before halftime. Italy conceded a second half goal that introduced some major doubts. The 20-year-old's performance was more than just his vital goal. Pio Esposito gave the Azzurri a boost with his energy and physicality as soon as he stepped out onto the pitch. Your email address will not be published.

Barcelona are believed to be delighted with Marcus Rashford's progress and are considering sealing a permanent transfer for the Englishman next summer, following an impressive start to life in Catalunya. Rashford joined on an initial loan deal from Manchester United in August, with Barca bosses said to be wary that the deal seemed "too good to be true". The 27-year-old has proven his worth, particularly as he fired La Blaugrana to victory at Newcastle in the Champions League, and he may see his Barcelona story stretch beyond next summer.</p>
