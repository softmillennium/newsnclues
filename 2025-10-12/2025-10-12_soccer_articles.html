                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tiny Faroe Islands took a big step toward its first World Cup on Sunday with a stunning 2-1 win against the Czech Republic. The Faroe Islands, located halfway between Scotland and Iceland, has a land area of just 540 square miles. It has long been a minnow of European soccer and at its lowest point was ranked 198th. Substitute Martin Agnarsson scored in the 81st minute to not only deliver a blow to Czech chances of qualifying automatically as group winner but place major doubts over the runner-up position with one game remaining for both teams. Hanus Sorensen had put host Faroe Islands ahead in the 67th minute at Torsvollur, a stadium with a capacity of just over 6,000 in the capital Torshavn. Croatia leads the group on goal difference and played Gibraltar later Sunday. The former Manchester United forward has scored seven goals in six qualifying games during this campaign. Donyell Malen, Virgil van Dijk and Cody Gakpo were also on target for the Dutch who top the group on 16 points with two games remaining. Scotland picked up a third win in Group C by beating Belarus 2-1. Goals from Che Adams and Scott McTominay put Scotland in control at Hampden Park, with Gleb Kuchko pulling one back in stoppage time for Belarus. Scotland leads the group ahead of second-placed Denmark's home game against Greece later Sunday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Death of Mark Townsend at Hillsborough A fan cheers USMNT's draw against Ecuador in Austin. It led to a spell of possession that ended with a Diego Luna shot, but the buzz in the stadium didn't drop. Two minutes later, Tim Weah had a look at goal on a left-footed shot that sizzled well over the goal. Seconds after that, the U.S. forced a turnover deep in Ecuador's end, Tanner Tessmann found Malik Tillman, and his square pass was finished off by Folarin Balogun for the equalizer. It set off a celebration at Q2 Stadium. “The fans were amazing and how important it (was) when they started chanting, ‘USA, USA,'” head coach Mauricio Pochettino said. If this U.S. team starts to turn things around, if they start to sustain a decent level of soccer and a string of positive results, that moment in the 68th minute in Austin will feel like a turning point. The U.S. needs to carry forward this momentum. There is risk, no doubt, in overblowing a 1-1 draw with Ecuador in a friendly eight months before the World Cup. But I think there's a reason for the positivity coming out of Friday's result. Positive results against non-CONCACAF opponents have been rare, and there haven't been a lot of moments where the team has had a pro-U.S. crowd that influenced the result. The positivity around Friday's draw is representative of where things stand with this national team. Fans want to believe in this team. They just haven't had much reason to believe. Part of what has made this World Cup cycle so frustrating is that this group was supposed to be different. Fans looked at the clubs where its young players were signing and started calling it a golden generation. A positive showing at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar felt like a marker on the path toward something more. Since leaving Qatar, however, there has been more chaos around this team than progress. This 2026 cycle was supposed to be about taking the potential of a young U.S. group and growing up into something more meaningful. The core of players that got the U.S. back to the World Cup after the 2018 disaster were going to be four years older and four years more experienced than they were in Qatar. They were supposed to take the next steps at their clubs and that would translate to the national team. That hasn't exactly gone to plan. It's why the 1-1 draw with a good Ecuador side was something worth feeling good about. Consecutive performances in which the U.S. team looked purposeful is allowing people to peek their heads out and wonder whether they can start to believe again. Pochettino is, as he said, building things back up. For that to be true, the U.S. will need another positive performance and another positive result on Tuesday. As we race toward next summer's World Cup, it's on this U.S. team to give them a reason. Otherwise, that moment in Austin — one that feels like it could be a turning point — might just be a meaningless blip in a fall friendly that we're overblowing months before a World Cup.

Austria was the last team to beat Romania in a competitive matchup and will look to repeat the feat in World Cup qualifying on Sunday. A thrilling weekend of 2026 World Cup qualification action will come to a close on Sunday when Romania hosts Austria in a bid to inject some much-needed life into its group campaign. Austria currently leads UEFA qualifying Group H by two points with only three games to play, while Romania is wallowing in third and six points off the top two. That means anything but a win for the host in Bucharest could effectively mean an end to Romania's chances of reaching next year's tournament in North America. Romania has lost back-to-back meetings with Das Team for the first time in its history and is on the verge of a dreaded third in a row. However, with so much at stake, manager Mircea Lucescu will hope his side has something up their sleeve as they stand on the precipice of elimination from the running.

The Netherlands will aim to place one foot in the 2026 World Cup's list of qualified teams as it seeks a fifth qualifying win at home to Finland on Sunday. Ronald Koeman's hosts will feel upbeat about their chances of a third straight qualifying win given they beat Finland 2-0 in Helsinki four months ago. That marked a fifth straight defeat to the Dutch in their head-to-head, and it's now been 75 years since Finland's only win over the Netherlands to date. Memphis Depay's injury-time finish in Thursday's 4-0 win over Malta took him two goals clear of Robin van Persie as the Netherlands' all-time top scorer, with 52 goals to his name. The Corinthians attacker doesn't appear to have lost his sheen since moving to Brazil and will be out for blood after scoring in the win over Finland earlier this year, with five goals to his name in qualifying thus far.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea owner Todd Boehly has made it his mission to bring some of the top young players to his clubs since investing, and now one of the top talents in the United States is reportedly on their radar. The Blues have spent big money on bringing in wonderkids to both Chelsea and Strasbourg, and Chelsea are finally starting to reap the rewards of this strategy. Despite a plethora of talent already on their books, they are continuing to analyse around the world for top players they can bring in to either BlueCo club. One of those who is standing out right now is Seattle Sounders star Obed Vargas, who was recently voted as number one on the MLS' list of 22 under 22. According to The Telegraph, he is on the radar of BlueCo, who own both of Chelsea and Strasbourg. The Ligue 1 side are very much being used as a feeder club for the Blues at the moment, with a number of their top performers set for long careers in West London. Kendry Paez, Mike Penders, Mamadou Sarr and Emanuel Emegha are all currently owned by the Blues, however will remain with Strasbourg for this season at least. Seattle Sounders didn't make it out of the group stage at the Club World Cup, however there was time for Vargas to make his mark. He left the tournament as one of the most promising young players, who has gained the attention of a number of clubs around Europe as a result. BlueCo have already signed Julio Enciso, who has a chance of making it at Stamford Bridge, and the same could be on the cards for Vargas if he does move to Strasbourg.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Milan wingback Federico Dimarco and striker Francesco Pio Esposito were among the stars in Italy's win over Estonia. This is the view in today's print edition of Turin-based newspaper Tuttosport, via FCInterNews. Italy got a hugely significant win over Estonia yesterday evening. The Azzurri have been at risk of missing out on a third straight World Cup. They had already failed to qualify for the 2018 and 2022 editions of the tournament, and did not get their qualification off to the best of starts this time around. In the view of Tuttosport, two of Italy's top performers were Inter wingback Federico Dimarco and striker Francesco Pio Esposito. He assisted Moise Kean's opening goal within the first few minutes. Overall, Dimarco had a strong match, Tuttosport argue, continuing his bright start to the season with Inter. Meanwhile, Francesco Pio Esposito came on as a substitute for Kean after the Fiorentina striker suffered an injury. In the view of Tuttosport, Pio Esposito's display was outstanding. In the view of Tuttosport, meanwhile, Inter midfielder Nicolo Barella and defender Alessandro Bastoni enjoyed solid matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Milan striker Francesco Pio Esposito has been named as the “MVP” for Italy in yesterday's World Cup qualifying win over Estonia. Today's print edition of Milan-based newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, via FCInterNews, highlight the 20-year-old's sparkling display. The newspaper also praises Nerazzurri duo Nicolo Barella and Federico Dimarco. Italy secured a hugely important victory over Estonia yesterday. At risk of missing out on a third consecutive World Cup, the EURO 2020 winners needed to take three points. Italy got off to just the right start. This courtesy of an assist from Inter wingback Federico Dimarco. Then, Mateo Retegui doubled Italy's advantage a few minutes before halftime. Italy conceded a second half goal that introduced some major doubts. The 20-year-old's performance was more than just his vital goal. Pio Esposito gave the Azzurri a boost with his energy and physicality as soon as he stepped out onto the pitch. Your email address will not be published.
