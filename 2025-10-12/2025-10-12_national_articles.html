Journalist and pro-Israel activist Emily Austin joins 'Fox & Friends First' to break down the Virginia gubernatorial debate and President Trump not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. With just weeks left before Virginians head to the voting booth, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger has been rattled by twin controversies — a violent text message scandal involving a fellow Democrat and fresh criticism over her stance on transgender bathroom policies. In 2022, Virginia state attorney general candidate Jay Jones told a colleague via text that he wished violence against former Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his children. The private messages, which recently came to light, have sparked outrage from Republicans and discomfort among Democrats, forcing Spanberger to navigate one of the most volatile moments of her campaign. Spanberger's cautious tone carried into last Thursday's debate, where she faced off against GOP nominee Winsome Earle-Sears. "Jay Jones advocated the murder — Abigail — the murder of a man, a former speaker, as well as his children who were 2 years and 5 years old. Would it take him pulling the trigger? "Please ask him to get out of the race. Spanberger's campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. A split of Winsome Earle-Sears and Abigail Spanberger. Meanwhile, fellow Democrats have rallied around Jones, emphasizing forgiveness and unity as the campaign enters its final stretch. He told Fox News Digital he's still a supporter of the embattled candidate for his state's attorney general seat. "I think those statements were not in character, and he has apologized — I wish other people in public life would sincerely apologize for stuff," the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee said. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., did not respond when Fox News Digital repeatedly asked whether Jay Jones should end his campaign. Warner was also pressed on whether he would seek the return of a $25,000 August donation from Jones or express regret over the show of support, but once again declined to respond. Jay Jones, who is running to become Virginia's attorney general in 2025, has come under fire for a series of text messages calling for the death of political opponents and remarks about police officers. "We are lined up, ten toes down, ready to organize, mobilize and deliver voters for Jay and our entire Democratic ticket," the statement read. We say, let those without sin cast the first stone. Jay Jones has taken responsibility, apologized and shown he is committed to serving with integrity and accountability that his public record already shows." Last week, President Donald Trump called for Jones to drop out of the race, calling the text messages "sick" and "demented." "Democrat Jay Jones should drop out of the race immediately and the people of Virginia must continue to have a great attorney general in Jason Miyares who, by the way, has my complete and total endorsement," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Oct. 5. The latest revelation comes amid heightened political tensions and a growing number of incidents that have fueled concerns about violence in national politics. Abigail Spanberger's campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Glenn Youngkin issued an executive directive ensuring bathrooms, locker rooms and other intimate spaces remain separated by sex assigned at birth. The directive also instructs the state Board of Health to bar biological males from competing on female athletic teams. When asked, point-blank, whether she would rescind that directive, Spanberger refused to give a definitive answer. "My answer is that in each local community decisions should be made between parents and educators, and teachers in each community. It shouldn't be dictated by politicians," Spanberger responded. "I'm a mother of three daughters in Virginia public schools, and nothing is more important to me than their safety and their experience in schools," Spanberger added in response to questions about her stance on transgender issues.

Federal and local authorities rescued more than 30 missing children and uncovered multiple trafficking operations targeting vulnerable youth during a coordinated crackdown across Texas. The effort, centered in San Antonio, led to arrests, felony warrants and several new investigations under a joint mission known as "Operation Lightning Bug." Marshals Service (USMS) out of San Antonio, Del Rio, Midland, and Pecos joined forces with San Antonio Police Department's Missing Persons Unit, Special Victims Unit, Street Crimes Unit and covert operatives. More than 30 children were rescued in the San Antonio area. Each recovered child was interviewed by SAPD's Special Victims Unit to determine whether they had been victimized. Survivors were referred to support services provided by agencies such as Health and Human Services to ensure long-term care and protection. Marshal Susan Pamerleau, for the Western District of Texas, said in a statement that protecting children remains central to the Marshals Service's mission. "The safety of our children is the safety of our communities, and justice demands that we protect those who cannot protect themselves," Pamerleau said. "Through Operation Lightning Bug, we reaffirm our promise to safeguard the most vulnerable and strengthen the safety of our communities." Marshals Service and local law enforcement have been cracking down on trafficking operations. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus echoed those sentiments, praising the effort as an example of law enforcement unity. "Every suspect arrested, juvenile returned home and survivor taken out of harm's way matters," McManus said. "This operation demonstrates what can be achieved when law enforcement agencies unite to protect children." That law also led to the creation of the USMS Missing Child Unit, which leads similar recovery efforts nationwide. Marshals Service said protecting children remains central to its mission. Kirsta Leeberg-Melton, founder and CEO of the Institute to Combat Trafficking, said operations like this one underscore the larger issue of exploitation in Texas and beyond. "Trafficking is something that the city of San Antonio and the state of Texas and the nation have been grappling with for a considerable period of time," she said in an interview with Fox News Digital. She said traffickers often target instability — children without consistent housing, food or family support. "They are easy pickings for traffickers to take advantage of," she warned. "They exploit these needs by offering those items and then calling in debts and putting those kids in a position where they are able to exploit them for sex or for labor." Leeberg-Melton said the public often underestimates how widespread trafficking is — and how much it has evolved, especially online. "Trafficking is the exploitation of men, women and children for forced sex or forced labor by a third party for their profit or gain. "What hasn't really been around is people's understanding of that crime and their knowledge that it's happening everywhere!" She added that traffickers increasingly use technology to recruit and control victims. "The internet allows them to connect with victims and buyers far beyond their local area." Traffickers are increasingly using technology to prey on victims, Kirsta Leeberg-Melton said. Leeberg-Melton emphasized that trafficking is not limited to border regions. "The biggest myth is that it happens somewhere else, and it happens to someone else," she said. "Until we start recognizing that people have value, no matter who they are, where they come from, what they've done or what's been done to them, we will continue to excuse some level of exploitation." Leeberg-Melton also described sextortion as a growing form of trafficking that uses coercion to force sexual conduct or imagery. "When you have someone that you are holding something over their head and then you are asking them for additional photographs or additional sexual conduct with the threat…that is a form, frankly, of human trafficking," she said. If you suspect someone is a victim of trafficking, contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or report anonymously at humantraffickinghotline.org.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JB Pritzker (D-IL) on Sunday said President Donald Trump can't invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy the National Guard to Chicago unless there is a “rebellion” or an “insurrection.” On President Trump's threats to invoke the Insurrection Act as part of his efforts to deploy the National Guard in Chicago, Illinois Gov. “But if the Constitution means anything … the Insurrection Act cannot be invoked to send them in because they want to fight crime.” Last week, Trump said he was open to using the Insurrection Act to keep people safe if court rulings prevented his administration from sending troops to Chicago and other sanctuary cities. “If people were being killed and courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I'd do that,” he said when asked if he would invoke the 19th-century federal law. We have to make sure that our cities are safe.” Pritzker says the federal government wants to activate National Guard units in Chicago to quell riots and protests at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the area, while Trump and others in the White House say the troop deployment is only about addressing crime. “They're claiming in court that this is about protecting ICE facilities and ICE agents, and not about crime on the streets. But then you hear Vice President Vance and the president of the United States contravening that and saying exactly what they actually think,” he added. “They just want troops on the ground because they want to militarize, especially blue cities and blue states.” The presence of immigration authorities has led to hostile clashes with protesters in recent weeks.</p>

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discusses the artificial food dyes used by American food companies and more on ‘America's Newsroom.' One of America's favorite snacks, Doritos, along with Cheetos, will be getting a recipe change. Doritos, owned by PepsiCo, will no longer be made with artificial flavors or colors. PepsiCo will be removing artificial flavors and colors from its products, the company announced in its third-quarter earnings remarks this week. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced in April that it would be working with industry leaders to eliminate petroleum-based dyes from the food supply by the end of next year. PepsiCo said it plans to eliminate petroleum-based synthetic dyes from popular snacks Doritos and Cheetos. Doritos Nacho Cheese has all three of those artificial colors, while Cheetos contains Yellow 6. Board-certified and licensed dietitian nutritionist Kendall Mackintosh told Fox News Digital these additives have been linked to hyperactivity, inflammation and oxidative stress. Robert Kennedy Jr.'s lead and the "Make America Healthy Again" initiative. Cheetos are currently made with artifical dye Yellow 6. Artificial food colorings were originally manufactured from coal tar, with most synthetic food dyes today made from petroleum, or crude oil, according to the American Chemical Society (ACS) website. "Consumer demand is driving this shift — when we stop buying these products, companies are forced to change," said Mackintosh. A new line of Doritos will also be introduced that are "protein-packed." Mackintosh said that "protein can help with satiety and muscle recovery." Doritos will also be launching a new protein chip. She said consumers should be cautioned when consuming protein products, sharing that "many of these products use isolated or processed protein sources, artificial flavorings, and additives." She added, "It's important to look beyond the ‘protein' label and check for ingredient quality — whole-food protein sources are always best, especially organic plant and grass-fed animal proteins." Registered dietitian Erin Palinski-Wade, based in New Jersey, previously told Fox News Digital that adding protein can help people feel fuller for longer. On average, she recommends around 20 to 30 grams per meal, she said, with 20% to 25% of total daily calories coming from protein, depending on activity level. PepsiCo said all of its core Lay's products in the U.S. will be made without artificial flavors or colors from artificial sources by the end of 2025. PepsiCo also shared it will be expanding the use of avocado and olive oil in select products. Fox News Digital reached out to PepsiCo for further comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Struggles by several top 10 teams in Week 7 of college football should send shockwaves through the latest AP Top 25 rankings, dropping at 2 p.m. 3 Oregon suffered its first loss of the season, delivered by No. 7 Indiana in a 30-20 road win. 4 Ole Miss pulled out a 24-21 victory over Washington State in a game that shouldn't have been close. 6 Oklahoma was outperformed by the Texas Longhorns, whose stint as an unranked team will likely be short-lived after a convincing 23-6 win. So how will the top of the poll shake out? Follow live updates from The Associated Press below for poll projections, game recaps, analysis and voter answers to fan questions, all in one place. ▶ Show your appreciation for one of college football's longest-running traditions. Nine AP Top 25 teams maintained an undefeated record through Week 7: No. Memphis entered the Top 25 just last week after a 45-7 win against Tulsa. The Tigers had the week off and will return to game action on Oct. 18 with a trip to UAB. BYU squeaked by Arizona in a double-overtime thriller on Saturday night. A 7-yard rushing touchdown by BYU freshman quarterback Bear Bachmeier sealed the deal for the Cougars. Future games holds significant value. For example, Ole Miss and Tennessee did not have convincing games this week. However, they will be heavily monitored next week because of their matchups against ranked opponents.

Texas came out on top of the Red River Rivalry, beating No. Utah rounded out competition for the day with a dominant 42-10 win against No. 9 Texas Tech could see its highest ranking of the season after a 42-17 win against Kansas. Alabama's opening season loss to FSU will weigh down its record. However, three straight Top 25 wins in SEC play has them as the frontrunner to win the conference. Their biggest strength right now is the defense coming up big late in games and the brilliance of QB TY Simpson as one of the best passers in the country.

The Rebels pulled out a 24-21 win, but could see a slight drop off in the rankings after the uninspiring outing. 6 Oklahoma could drop out of the top 10 for the first time in weeks after losing to an unranked Texas team on Saturday. Indiana is off to a 6-0 start and now has two wins against ranked teams after having zero in 2024. It's worth considering that this may be the best year in Indiana history. So moving them up was a given, seeing how the rest of their conference schedule holds up. For Oregon, the remaining schedule does include quality opponents like USC and Washington, but none are against teams that entered this weekend ranked inside the Top 25. Not to mention, the Ducks' best win is against Penn State, who just dropped back-to-back losses to conference opponents. Jerry Humphrey is a Top 25 voter and an Auburn sports writer for AL.com.

College football writer and Top 25 voter Jerry Humphrey will answer a few questions before and after the rankings drop. No organization has been ranking teams and naming a major college football national champion longer than The Associated Press, since 1936. AP employees don't vote themselves, but they do choose the voters. AP Top 25 voters comprise around 60 writers and broadcasters who cover college football for AP members and other select outlets. The goal is to have every state with a Football Bowl Subdivision school represented by at least one voter. Voting is a straight points system: A first-place vote is worth 25 points, a second-place vote is worth 24 points, down to 1 point for a 25th-place vote. Then it's just a summary of which teams are 1-25 based on the totals. Others receiving votes are also noted. ▶ Read more about the history of the AP Top 25 poll and how it works</p>

President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented war against cartels and has threatened narco-terrorists, saying he will "blow you out of existence" as his administration seeks to curb the influx of drugs into the U.S. The White House sent lawmakers a memo Sept. 30 informing them that the U.S. is now participating in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug smugglers — on top of conducting four fatal strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean since September. These recent developments suggest that Trump is eyeing targets within Venezuela, not just those within international waters, according to Geoff Ramsey, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council international affairs think tank. "This is a sign that President Trump is taking the US war on drugs in Latin America to the next level," Ramsey said in a Monday email to Fox News Digital. "By involving the military, the president is going after drug cartels in a way that no previous US administration has dared to so far. I think it is likely that we will see the Pentagon evaluate targets inside Venezuela." President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he ordered a lethal strike on a vessel linked to a designated terrorist organization operating in the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility Sept. 19, 2025. Additional strikes could target more drug shipments or drug flights, which often take off from covert airfields near the Colombian border, Ramsey said. "It's a bad time to be posted in a guerrilla camp on the Colombian border or operating a Tren de Aragua safe house along the Caribbean trafficking route," Ramsey said. Even so, Ramsey said it would be challenging to strike within Venezuela's territory. Doing so would require the U.S. to dismantle Venezuela's air defense system, which would escalate hostilities by openly engaging with Venezuela's military, he said. That's a departure from the current approach, in which the U.S. has intentionally avoided targeting Venezuelan military assets, Ramsey said. "When two Venezuelan F-16s flew over a US destroyer last month, the fact that those planes weren't blown out of the sky suggests that the US is not interested in a shooting war with Venezuela's military," Ramsey said. Trump himself has not ruled out conducting strikes within Venezuela though, and signaled such strikes could happen when he told military leaders in Quantico, Virginia, Sept. 30 that his administration would "look very seriously at cartels coming by land." President Donald Trump speaks to a gathering of top U.S. military commanders at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Sept. 30, 2025, in Quantico, Virginia. So far, the Trump administration has utilized maritime forces to address drug threats, and has beefed up naval assets in the Caribbean in recent months. For example, Trump approved sending several U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers to bolster the administration's counter-narcotics efforts in the region starting in August. "I expect these deployments to continue for months or more than a year, with new ships rotating in to replace those that need to return home for maintenance or crew rest," Bryan Clark, director of the Hudson Institute think tank's Center for Defense Concepts and Technology, told Fox News Digital in September. Nathan Jones, a nonresident scholar in drug policy and Mexico studies at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, predicted the strikes are unlikely to impact the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. That's because fentanyl precursors originate in China, and are then produced in labs in Mexico before they head north without a pathway into the Caribbean. "I wouldn't expect your drug flow to be affected because of these strikes," Jones told Fox News Digital Tuesday. "This could, though, leave transnational criminal organizations running a little scared in terms of what the administration is going to do." The strikes have prompted members of Congress to question their legality and senators Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., filed a war powers resolution in September that would block U.S. forces from engaging in "hostilities" against certain non-state organizations. "There has been no authorization to use force by Congress in this way," Schiff told reporters Wednesday. The fact that the administration claims to have a list and has put organizations on a list does not somehow empower the administration to usurp Congress's power of declaring war or refusing to declare war or refusing to authorize the use of force." Even so, the measure attracted support from Republicans Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted alongside their Democratic counterparts for the resolution. Other Republicans have defended the strikes though, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, said that Trump's actions were well within his rights and that the resolution was "unreasonable." "When he sees an attack like this coming — an attack of drugs or explosives or anything else that's going to kill Americans — he not only has the authority to do something about it, he has the duty to do something about it," Risch said Wednesday before the vote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four people were killed and at least 20 others were injured in a mass shooting at a South Carolina bar early Sunday, according to police. At least four victims were in critical condition following the shooting at Willie's Bar and Grill on St. Helena Island before 1 a.m., the Beaufort County Sheriff's Office said. “Upon arriving at the scene deputies made contact with a large crowd of people, several of which were suffering from gunshot wounds. “More victims continued to show up at area hospitals seeking medical attention from injuries sustained at the scene.” Sunday's shooting in South Carolina comes two days after two separate shootings in Mississippi killed at least eight people, including a pregnant woman. There was a similar third shooting in another part of the state that came under investigation, but it appeared there were no injuries from that incident. In Alabama, there was a shooting that left two people dead last weekend. Gunfire erupted between different parties after a college football game in downtown Montgomery. On Friday, local police announced a suspect had been arrested and charged with capital murder, first-degree assault, and second-degree assault. Montgomery's mayor said authorities are searching for additional suspects in that case.</p>

Filmmaker Woody Allen, left, greets actress Diane Keaton onstage to present her with the 45th AFI Life Achievement Award on June 8, 2017, in Los Angeles. A family member told The Associated Press that Keaton died in California with loved ones. People magazine first reported the death on Saturday, noting that her health had suddenly declined. No other details were immediately available and representatives did not respond to request for comment. Francis Ford Coppola, who cast her in “The Godfather,” wrote on Instagram that, “Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful...Everything about Diane was creativity personified.” Bette Midler, who she costarred with Keaton in “The First Wives Club,” wrote, “She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. Leonardo DiCaprio, who played her nephew in “Marvin's Room” when he was 18, wrote on Instagram that she was “one of a kind. Brilliant, funny and unapologetically herself...she will be deeply missed.” Keaton was the kind of actor who helped make films iconic and timeless, from her “La-dee-da, la-dee-da” phrasing as Annie Hall, bedecked in that necktie, bowler hat, vest and khakis, to her heartbreaking turn as Kay Adams, the woman unfortunate enough to join the Corleone family. Keaton won an Oscar for “Annie Hall” and would go on to be nominated three more times, for “Reds,” playing the journalist and suffragist Louise Bryant, “Marvin's Room,” as a caregiver who suddenly needs care herself, and “Something's Gotta Give,” as a middle-aged divorcee who is the object of several men's affections.

Joffe, best picture for “Annie Hall"; Diane Keaton, best actress for “Annie Hall"; presenter Jack Nicholson, and producer Jack Rollins of United Artists. Actors' Equity already had a Diane Hall in their ranks, and she took Keaton, her mother's maiden name, as her own. “More than anything, Sanford Meisner helped me learn to appreciate the darker side of behavior,” she wrote in her 2012 memoir, “Then Again.” “I always had a knack for sensing it but not yet the courage to delve into such dangerous, illuminating territory.” FILE - Acting teacher Sanford Meisner, right, greets his former student Diane Keaton at a party held in his honor by his students at the Neighborhood Playhouse School in New York City, Tuesday evening, Oct. 8, 1980. Keaton made her film debut in the 1970 romantic comedy “Lovers and Other Strangers,” but her big breakthrough would come a few years later when she was cast in Francis Ford Coppola's “The Godfather,” which won best picture and become one of the most beloved films of all time. The 1970s were an incredibly fruitful time for Keaton thanks in part to her ongoing collaboration with Allen in both comedic and dramatic roles. She appeared in “Sleeper,” “Love and Death,” “Interiors,” Manhattan,” and the film version of “Play it Again, Sam.” The 1977 crime-drama “Looking for Mr. Goodbar” also earned her raves. Allen and the late Marshall Brickman gave Keaton one of her most iconic roles in “Annie Hall,” the infectious woman from Chippewa Falls whom Allen's Alvy Singer cannot get over. The film is considered one of the great romantic comedies of all time, with Keaton's eccentric, self-deprecating Annie at its heart. His camera finds beauty and emotional resources that somehow escape the notice of other directors. She acknowledged parallels between Annie Hall and real life, while also downplaying them. Woody and I did share a significant romance, according to me, anyway,” she wrote. Keaton and Allen were also in a romantic relationship, from about 1968, when she met him while auditioning for his play, until about 1974. “He was so hip, with his thick glasses and cool suits,” Keaton wrote in her memoir. She was also romantically linked to Pacino, who played her husband in “The Godfather,” and Warren Beatty who directed her and whom she co-starred with in “Reds.” She never married but did adopt two children when she was in her 50s: a daughter, Dexter, and a son, Duke. “I figured the only way to realize my number-one dream of becoming an actual Broadway musical comedy star was to remain an adoring daughter. “The names changed, from Dave to Woody, then Warren, and finally Al. Could I have made a lasting commitment to them? Subconsciously I must have known it could never work, and because of this they'd never get in the way of achieving my dreams.” Not all of Keaton's roles were home runs, like her foray into action in George Roy Hill's John le Carré adaptation of “Little Drummer Girl.” But in 1987 she'd begin another long-standing collaboration with Nancy Meyers, which would result in four beloved films. Reviews for that first outing, “Baby Boom,” directed by Charles Shyer, might have been mixed at the time but Pauline Kael even described Keaton's as a “glorious comedy performance that rides over many of the inanities.” She and Steve Martin played the flustered parents to the bride which would become a big hit and spawn a sequel. Her character Erica Barry, with her beautiful Hamptons home and ivory outfits was a key inspiration for the recent costal grandmother fashion trend. FILE - U.S. movie stars Diane Keaton, left, and Jack Nicholson laugh before a news conference of their film “Something's Gotta Give” during a photocall at the 54th Berlinale International film festival in Berlin, Feb. 6, 2004. Keaton continued working steadily throughout the 2000s, with notable roles in “The Family Stone,” as a dying matriarch reluctant to give her ring to her son, in “Morning Glory,” as a morning news anchor, and the “Book Club” films. Filmmaker Woody Allen, left, greets actress Diane Keaton onstage to present her with the 45th AFI Life Achievement Award on June 8, 2017, in Los Angeles. Keaton was celebrated with an AFI Life Achievement Award in 2017, telling the AP at the time that it was a surreal experience. In 2022, she “cemented” her legacy with a hand and footprint ceremony outside the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, with her children looking on. “I don't think about my film legacy,” she said at the event. “I'm just lucky to have been here at all in any way, shape or form. I don't see myself anything other than that.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Education Department spokesperson confirmed Friday that the agency would be included in the reduction in force but did not specify how many positions would be cut or which divisions would be affected. She added that workers in the department's TRIO college access program, housed in a separate office, were also among those let go. “Once again, the Trump administration is acting as though they have impunity to cut staff from an already lean, efficient agency,” Gittleman said in a prepared statement. Education Secretary Linda McMahon has repeatedly emphasized that protecting the rights of students with disabilities and ensuring they receive the educational resources guaranteed to them by law are among her highest priorities. She has repeatedly said her goal is to shift more authority and responsibility for education to state and local government. Following a series of buyouts, early retirements, voluntary departures, and a Reduction in Force earlier this year, its workforce has been cut by nearly half. In a court filing Friday, the Justice Department reported that more than 460 Education Department employees had been laid off, eliminating roughly one-fifth of the agency's already depleted workforce. President Trump has said that oversight of special needs and student nutrition programs will eventually move to the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., though that transfer has not yet taken place. The layoffs, affecting employees across more than half a dozen federal agencies, are part of a broader Trump administration strategy to increase pressure on congressional Democrats to resolve the ongoing government shutdown. At the Education Department, nearly 90% of staff remain furloughed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hundreds of staff fired from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Friday have been reinstated, according to the American Federation of Government Employees. After a new round of layoff notices sent late Friday night to around 1,300 workers at the CDC, approximately 700 were reinstated on Saturday, while about 600 remain laid off, according to the union, which represents federal workers. Among reinstated employees are staff that publish the agency's flagship journal, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, according to Dr. Debra Houry, who recently resigned as the agency's chief medical officer and deputy director for program and science. Houry and other high-level CDC officials resigned in August in protest over the firing of recently confirmed CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez. Staff were also reinstated at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, the Global Health Center, and the Public Health Infrastructure Center, which manages more than $3 billion in grants to 107 state and local governments to help build local public health workforces, said Dr. Brian Castrucci, who is president and chief executive officer of the de Beaumont Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for public health workers. Trump's move to fund military paychecks during shutdown comes as families face strain and uncertainty Staff and officers at the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service who were able to check their emails have also received notices that their firings were in error, according to a CDC official with knowledge of the situation who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation. Epidemic Intelligence Service officers, also known as “disease detectives,” are often the first to respond to disease threats when they arise. The mistakenly fired employees were sent incorrect notifications because of a coding error on the notices, according to an HHS official. President Donald Trump said late Friday afternoon that he planned to fire “a lot” of federal workers in retaliation for the government shutdown, vowing to target those deemed to be aligned with the Democratic Party. Trump did not provide details on what qualified the affected workers as “Democrat-oriented.” The legality of firing federal workers during a government shutdown is also in question. Shortly after Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought posted “The RIFs have begun” on X on Friday AFGE replied “The lawsuit has been filed.” A court filing in that case indicates more than 4,100 federal workers were impacted by the cuts at HHS as well as the departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Homeland Security and Treasury.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 1926 fresco of Hernan Cortes and La Malinche by Jose Clemente Orozco decorates the Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City, Wednesday, April 26, 2023. Her work as translator and interpreter for Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés made her a protagonist in a violent colonial period whose effects still reverberate through Latin America. Her story, told only by others, generated myths and legends. A slave using her language skills to survive? Or someone with agency who influenced Cortés and shaped major events? Five centuries later, the debate continues and Mexico's first woman leader, President Claudia Sheinbaum, is weighing in. “We have a working group of anthropologists, historians, and philosophers studying this important, much-maligned figure, and it is very important to vindicate her,” Sheinbaum said recently. Born around 1500, Malinche learned Nahuatl and the now near-disappeared Oluteco, growing up south of the Gulf of Mexico. The Aztecs sold her as a slave to a Mayan people who later gave her and other women to the Spanish after being defeated in battle. By then, she could speak two more Mayan languages. Malinche was “at their mercy as a victim,” said Camilla Townsend, a historian at Rutgers University and an expert on Malinche. As a translator for Cortés, she bridged two radically different worldviews, relaying the desires of Cortés and possibly trying to influence negotiations. “She was forced to be an intermediary between the Spaniards and these other poor women who were going to be raped,” Townsend said. Most academics today don't see her as a traitor, because the Aztecs were her enemies in a world of constant wars between different peoples that only centuries later were lumped together as “Indigenous” in a violent colonial system. Still, viewing her objectively is impossible, according to Federico Navarrete, historian at Mexico's National Autonomous University, because the race and class conflicts left by the conquest persist. Yet, schools only teach a “nationalist” perspective, downplaying nuances such as the support of some Indigenous groups for the Spanish. Yásnaya Aguilar, a Mixe linguist who has written about Malinche, described her as “a native woman who moved from being a slave to being respected and honored by society in her time.” In fact, the name Malinche was also used to refer to Cortés: they were considered one, but she was the voice. She died around the age of 30, apparently in an epidemic. Malinche was largely forgotten until the early 19th century, when Mexico won its independence from Spain and Spain's allies became enemies. She first appears as “a lascivious and scheming traitor” in a popular, anonymously published novel in 1826, so she became the perfect villain for the new country, according to Townsend. Malinche's negative image was solidified by Nobel Prize in Literature winner Octavio Paz. In his emblematic work of Mexican identity “The Labyrinth of Solitude,” Paz described her as “a figure representing the Indian women who were fascinated, violated or seduced by the Spaniards” and for whom “the Mexican people have not forgiven her betrayal.” It carried an idealized romantic relationship with Cortés that historians consider uncalled for and that Aguilar characterized as “patriarchal and chauvinistic.” It's a caricature that has extended far beyond Mexico's modern borders. “They call me Malinche too from the left for allying myself with white men … with whom we work against extractivist policies,” said Toribia Lero, an Indigenous Bolivian activist of the Sura de los Andes people. Mexico's Indigenous peoples, however, maintained respect for the woman, naming volcanoes, peaks and ceremonial dances after her. Since the 1970s, Malinche's negative image began to be questioned among Chicana feminists in the U.S. because they knew it was very hard to be a bridge between two peoples and they empathized with her, Townsend said. Now there is a growing body of academic literature attempting to contextualize her life. Follow AP's coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday expressed confidence that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which went into effect earlier Friday, will hold. Trump also confirmed that he will deliver an address to the Knesset and meet with world leaders in Egypt. Displaced Palestinians walk with their belongings past destroyed buildings as they return to their homes in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Friday, Oct. 10, 2025, after Israel and Hamas agreed to a pause in their war and the release of the remaining hostages. It is a moment, the Republican president says, that has been helped along by his administration's support of Israel's decimation of Iranian proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The White House says momentum is also building because Arab and Muslim states are demonstrating a renewed focus on resolving the broader, decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict and, in some cases, deepening relations with the United States It would take a small fraction of their wealth to do that. Trump will visit Israel first to meet with hostage families and address the Knesset, or parliament, an honor last extended to President George W. Bush during a visit in 2008. Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said Trump also was likely to meet with newly freed hostages, too. “Knock on wood, but we feel very confident the hostages will be released and this president is actually traveling to the Middle East, likely this evening, in order to meet them and greet them in person,” Vance told CBS' “Face the Nation.” It is a tenuous truce and it is unclear whether the sides have reached any agreement on Gaza's postwar governance, the territory's reconstruction and Israel's demand that Hamas disarm. Negotiations over those issues could break down, and Israel has hinted it may resume military operations if its demands are not met. “I think the chances of (Hamas) disarming themselves, you know, are pretty close to zero,” H.R. McMaster, a national security adviser during Trump's first term, said at an event hosted by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies on Thursday. He said he thought what probably would happen in the coming months is that the Israeli military “is going to have to destroy them.” Israel continues to rule over millions of Palestinians without basic rights as settlements expand rapidly across the occupied West Bank. Despite growing international recognition, Palestinian statehood appears exceedingly remote because of Israel's opposition and actions on the ground, The war has left Israel isolated internationally and facing allegations of genocide, which it denies. International arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister are in effect, and the United Nations' highest court is considering allegations of genocide brought by South Africa. But the Islamic militant group is still intact and could eventually rebuild if there's an extended period of calm. Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would continue with its demilitarization of Hamas after the hostages are returned. “Hamas agreed to the deal only when it felt that the sword was on its neck — and it is still on its neck,” Netanyahu said Friday as Israel began to pull back its troops. The territory's roughly 2 million residents continue to struggle in desperate conditions. Under the deal, Israel agreed to reopen five border crossings, which will help ease the flow of food and other supplies into Gaza, parts of which are experiencing famine. Trump is also standing up a U.S.-led civil-military coordination center in Israel to help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into Gaza. Roughly 200 U.S. troops will help support and monitor the ceasefire deal as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players. U.S. troops will not be sent to Gaza, Adm. Brad Cooper, the U.S. military commander for the region, said in a social media post Saturday. The White House has signaled that Trump is looking to quickly return attention to building on a first-term effort known as the Abraham Accords, which forged diplomatic and commercial ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. A permanent agreement in Gaza would help pave the path for Trump to begin talks with Saudi Arabia as well Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country, toward normalizing ties with Israel, according to a senior Trump administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity. But brokering such an agreement remains a heavy lift as the kingdom has said it won't officially recognize Israel before a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China signaled Sunday that it would pursue countermeasures in response to President Donald Trump's threat to implement a 100% tariff increase, which threatens to derail months of progress in trade talks between the two nations. China imposed export restrictions on rare earth minerals last week, prompting Trump to float the possibility of raising tariffs. “If the U.S. persists in acting unilaterally, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the ministry added. “Our position on a tariff war remains consistent — we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one.” The U.S. and China were previously engaging in negotiations to avert a trade war. In April, both nations significantly escalated tariffs to over 100% until Trump reversed course and initiated a truce. They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it's not manufactured in China,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Friday. “Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one,” he continued. There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,' but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time.” The U.S. is also expected to impose export controls on “any and all critical software” starting next month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Marcelo Lombardi, 45, complained he was feeling sleepy on a Friday, his family didn't think much of it. Lombardi often put in long hours running his family's 17-year-old real estate business in São Paulo, Brazil, working alongside two of his older sisters. Fernanda Lombardi, one of his sisters, recalled their life being “perfect” until that day, September 26. “Earlier in the week, he came home with some groceries, which included a bottle of vodka,” she told CNN. “It took them about five hours to tell us that my brother had been poisoned,” Fernanda said. “By then, all of his organs were shutting down. He looked me in the eye and said, ‘I'm not leaving this place. The colorless liquid is now responsible for an ongoing health crisis that has triggered a nationwide panic affecting about 100 million people across six states in Brazil, according to health authorities. Methanol is a clear, odorless, highly flammable liquid found in antifreeze, varnish and fuel. Ingesting just a few milliliters can cause blindness or death. Federal authorities are investigating several fronts to determine how industrial methanol entered Brazil's consumer alcohol supply. In Brazil, methanol commerce is regulated by the government, restricted to industrial uses such as biodiesel production, solvents, and laboratory applications. Its sale is legal but strictly controlled, and every transaction must be registered. One main line of investigation is that methanol, cheaper than ethanol, may have been intentionally used by counterfeiters to cut liquor production costs. Federal police are examining whether the chemical used by clandestine factories was purchased from gas stations and later diverted to illicit alcohol production. Investigators are also probing whether smuggled or diverted industrial methanol entered Brazil's black market and if it has been used for bottle washing or sterilization by underground distilleries, contaminating drinks later sold illegally. Don't drink local ‘Tiger' vodka and whisky in Laos, Australia warns after tourist deaths As a precaution, health and trade associations are urging consumers and bars to destroy or properly dispose of empty bottles to prevent counterfeiters from reusing them in the production of fake liquor. Federal investigators have uncovered a massive black-market supply chain flooding bars, venues and homes with counterfeit liquor. Hospitals are also reporting rapid-onset blindness, irreversible comas and organ failure within hours of ingestion. Between early and late September, his team saw 10 suspected cases across São Paulo and neighboring cities – enough to trigger a nationwide alert. “We've seen spikes before, in 2023 and 2024, among unhoused people who drank fuel-grade ethanol,” Capitani said. “This time, victims were drinking cocktails at bars and parties. Capitani said Brazil's public health system reacted quickly, but the crisis exposed deep structural weaknesses: Few hospitals have labs capable of testing for methanol or its toxic byproduct, formic acid, and fewer stocked the antidotes needed to treat patients fast. For Fernanda Lombardi, racing to find an antidote in pharmacies brought a feeling she will never forget. Within 24 hours, patients may lose their vision and struggle to breathe. Treatment requires intravenous administration of ethanol or fomepizole, a specific antidote that blocks methanol's toxic conversion. “We're working to keep our antidote reserve full,” she told CNN on Thursday from the airport, “but it's hard to predict how much we'll need.” Australian teens among six tourists dead as countries warn of suspected methanol poisonings in Laos “Many hospitals didn't have 100 percent ethanol in sufficient quantities. Until it arrives, sometimes hours later, that time can cost a patient their vision or life.” Brazil's Ministry of Health addressed the issue in a statement to CNN: “But now,” Capitani cautioned, “that's become a Russian roulette, because even vodka could be contaminated.” Themis Mizerkowski Torres, a rheumatologist and toxicologist leading efforts at São Paulo's Center for Intoxication Control, says the crisis is unprecedented. But as Health Minister Alexandre Padilha stressed in a recent news conference, “there's no such thing as completely safe drinking right now.” Some have stopped selling vodka, whiskey and cachaça entirely. From São Paulo to Pernambuco, fear now overshadows Brazil's vibrant bar culture – a sobering reminder of how one contaminated bottle can devastate families and test the country's ability to contain a crisis. Fernanda Lombardi says her brother's death destroyed their family and community. “Someone thought about money and not a human life. We want justice, so no other family has to go through this.” At his funeral, hundreds of mourners came to pay respects.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? It's not millennial cringe to wonder if you can enjoy the work of problematic artists. Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity: My partner and I are having a disagreement about JK Rowling that we want you to weigh in on. For reference, we're a same-sex couple, and despite our different upbringing, we tend to have similar moral compasses and political feelings. I love the Harry Potter world — books, movies, broadway plays, video games, etc. To assuage my guilt, whenever I buy something Harry Potter-related that might make JK Rowling any money, I then donate a larger sum of money to the Human Rights Campaign. I've encountered this dilemma before, and I'll tell you straight off the bat that I'm not the type to condemn you as a Slytherin just because you still want to engage with the works of JK Rowling. I'm totally fine with reading books penned by problematic writers — even if their views have seeped into the books themselves — because I believe I'm capable of separating the wheat from the chaff in these works. In fact, so many of us have practically had to become experts at this sort of literary winnowing, because 99 percent of the books humanity has thrown at us contain that chaff. I'm a queer Jewish woman, and if I had to excise from my library every book whose writer was anti-LGBTQ, antisemitic, or misogynist, my shelves would be pretty much empty! We all know at this point how anti-trans the writer is and how much pain she's caused her fans. Or when the goblins are portrayed as an antisemitic stereotype? Or when the werewolves are presented as a metaphor for HIV? Or when we're told that the house elves actually like being enslaved because their race makes them naturally subservient? Feel free to fill out this anonymous form! We shouldn't be like Voldemort or like the Death Eaters, who believe “pure-blood” wizards and witches are inherently better than everyone else. We should recognize that everyone (even Snape, the Slythiest of Slytherins!) This is the core message that made so many of us fall in love with the Harry Potter world as kids. It made us feel that it's okay to be different — that difference should be respected and even celebrated. Even though Rowling often undercut that open-hearted message with nonsense like “rightfully” enslaved house elves, most of us picked up the main moral message in spite of these flaws. And in that way, the books successfully achieved what good fiction is meant to achieve. By exposing us to scene after scene of characters encountering moral conundrums, Nussbaum argues, good fiction trains our capacity for moral attention — the capacity to notice the morally salient features of a given situation so that we can respond appropriately. And it's on precisely that basis that many of those young readers, now all grown up, reject Rowling's anti-trans views. These readers can choose to reject her books, too. But some don't — and I think that's totally alright too. In a 2020 episode of the popular podcast Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, co-hosts Casper ter Kuile and Vanessa Zoltan interviewed trans author Jackson Bird. As Bird said of such texts, “We continue to interrogate, but we still acknowledge and accept the ways in which they are useful for us, or healing.” The “continue to interrogate” part is key here. Any fandom — whether it's centered on the Christian canon or the Harry Potter canon — is responsible for continuously revising how its canonical texts do and don't get to guide action. Religious communities have been proving that for ages. As early as 2000 years ago, Jewish theologians were inventing a genre called Midrash, which is basically ancient fanfiction; it reimagines problematic bits of the Bible in ways that make them more palatable or meaningful. And over the centuries, many Muslim and Christian theologians have been busy transforming their traditions, giving us everything from Islamic Modernism to Black liberation theology. So, for you, what can interrogating the Potter canon look like in practice? I'd suggest connecting with other Potterheads so you can both enjoy and interrogate the content together. Whether that's a book club, a movie-watching marathon, a video game night with friends, or a Harry Potter and the Sacred Text episode that you listen to with your partner in the car, the point is to engage with the content and then critically discuss it. The benefit of doing this in community is that it can actually generate social good. If you end up discussing the house elves, say, you might end up talking about how even the good guys in Rowling's books are way too content with maintaining the status quo rather than calling for systemic change (Dumbledore treats his enslaved house elves nicely, but he still enslaves house elves!). That could lead you into all sorts of discussions about how you are or aren't challenging the status quo in our Muggle world. If you engage with Rowling's work this way, I think it's plausible that the positive social value you'll be generating will outweigh any negative social value you might create by continuing to be a Potterhead. And, crucially, I suspect you'll stop feeling guilty. Right now, your strategy to ward off guilt is to focus on the financial aspect of all this — how your Potter-related purchases end up materially benefiting Rowling and, through her, the type of organizations she might support. On a dollar-for-dollar level, this is something you can “offset” by donating to the Human Rights Campaign. In fact, since Rowling is already a billionaire, buying a video game now is not appreciably moving the needle for her, while donating hundreds or thousands of dollars to the HRC could plausibly make a difference to that nonprofit. So this strategy is nothing to sneeze at. And we can tell it's not enough because you still feel guilty. On its own, offsetting feels cheap, and the reason it feels cheap is that it's not demanding that any transformative work take place — either for you personally or for society more broadly. It's letting you throw a pittance at the problem without requiring you to participate, through your own hard work, in changing the status quo and creating systemic change. Remember, shying away from systemic change is how Rowling deals with problems in her books. Here at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An impactful nor'easter is unleashing damaging wind gusts, heavy rain and coastal flooding as it tracks up the mid-Atlantic coast. The storm is packing a serious punch as it slowly moves north and disrupts air travel at major Northeast airports and threatens to push the ocean into homes and onto roads along the mid-Atlantic coast through Monday. This coastal storm is called a nor'easter due to the prevailing wind direction from the northeast ahead of its center. These northeast winds push water toward the coast, causing it to erode beaches and pile up and cause flooding. Dozens of river gauge locations are expected to reach moderate or major flood stage, the most severe level, from this nor'easter through Monday. Areas from the Virginia Tidewater into Delaware and southern New Jersey are of particular concern. Water levels climbed into minor flood stage on Sunday afternoon in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and shut down Route 40 and Route 30 in both directions in and out of the city. The flood threat will climb even higher to above 8 feet Monday, which would be the highest level observed since Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Levels at Cape May, New Jersey, are projected to reach over 8 feet on Monday and would be the third-highest on record and the highest since January 2016. Portions of North Carolina Highway 12 were closed Sunday due to ocean overwash. Ongoing beach erosion in the Outer Banks will add to concerns there. At least nine unoccupied homes have collapsed into the Atlantic since September 30 due to intense wave action and erosion from recent storms. Charleston Harbor in South Carolina reached major flood stage Saturday afternoon and Friday morning, flooding streets there. Leaders up and down the East Coast have told residents in their states to be cautious. Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency that went into effect Saturday night “out of an abundance of caution,” asking residents to stay off the roads “unless absolutely necessary.” “I also encourage all Marylanders to ensure their loved ones and neighbors are properly monitoring the potential for high winds, rain, and flooding,” Moore said. Atlantic City has been getting ready for the storm over the last week, Mayor Marty Small Sr. told CNN on Sunday, adding the city had learned from past storms like Sandy how best to prepare. Strong, prolonged damaging wind gusts of 40 to 55 mph will lash the coast as the storm crawls north. Some of the strongest gusts over 55 mph are expected from New Jersey into southern New England. The high winds could last into Tuesday morning along the Northeast coast and could down tree branches and send unsecured objects flying. Power outages are possible, especially in coastal areas, and gusty winds will stretch farther inland to more heavily populated areas. Rainfall of 1 to 3 inches will be common along the East Coast, with some spots in eastern North Carolina and southeastern New England possibly picking up totals of up to 6 inches. Localized flash flooding will be a concern in areas that experience multiple rounds of heavy rain. CNN's Leigh Waldman, Caroll Alvarado and Sara Smart contributed reporting to this story.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An impactful nor'easter is strengthening and unleashing damaging wind gusts, heavy rain and coastal flooding as it tracks up the mid-Atlantic coast.

Water levels could climb near major flood stage Sunday afternoon at Atlantic City, New Jersey, and then rise above 8 feet Monday, which would be the highest level observed since Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Atlantic City water levels were nearing moderate flood stage early Sunday afternoon and enough floodwater had already come ashore to shut down Route 40 in both directions in and out of the city.

Charleston Harbor in South Carolina reached major flood stage Saturday afternoon and Friday morning, flooding streets there. Heavy rain is also amping up the threat level: The motorists rescued from floodwater in Georgetown, South Carolina, were “checked on by fire personnel, removed from their vehicles and brought to dry ground,” Ellis said, adding no injuries have been reported. He did not have an exact number of people rescued but estimated about a half dozen were assisted within the city. Though officials there hope the worst is behind them, Ellis urged motorists to “turn around, don't drown” when encountering flood water or barricades.
