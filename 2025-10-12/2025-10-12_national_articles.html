Fox News correspondent Garrett Tenney has the latest on President Donald Trump's efforts to create a National Guard presence in Illinois on ‘America Reports.' Tech billionaire Marc Benioff is shifting his tone toward President Donald Trump, saying he "fully" supports the president and is now urging him to deploy the National Guard to Benioff's home city of San Francisco. "We don't have enough cops, so if [the National Guard] can be cops, I'm all for it," Benioff said in an interview with The New York Times. "I fully support the president," he added. "I think he's doing a great job." He complained to the Times that he has to pay out of pocket for off-duty police officers to bolster security in the convention area every year. Marc Benioff, chief executive officer of Salesforce Inc., speaks during a keynote at the 2024 Dreamforce conference in San Francisco, California, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2024. When you walk through San Francisco next week, there will be cops on every corner," he promised. The friendly words for Trump are an about-face for the California billionaire, however, having spent recent years funneling tens of millions of dollars toward left-wing activist groups. Benioff's company, Salesforce, has also a championed transgender ideology. Between 2022 and 2024 alone, Salesforce donated over $23 million to the left-wing Tides Foundation. Salesforce also created the "Pledge 1%" program, a model that encourages corporations to donate 1% of equity, product, profit, and employee time to charity. President Donald Trump sat across from Benioff at King Charles' state dinner in Windsor Castle last month. Salesforce kicked the program over to Tides Foundation, which has been handling the Pledge 1% funds since at least 2019. Salesforce says at least 9,000 companies have joined the program since its inception. Salesforce also donated $1.5 million to the liberal dark money group New Venture Fund. Aside from funding, Benioff's company has used its own reach to push transgender activism, using its social media accounts to hail a transgender athlete and defend transgender people in the U.S. military. San Francisco has struggled deeply with crime and homelessness in recent years. Despite the left-wing resume, Benioff has been successful in getting closer to Trump's orbit since his election in 2024. Benioff sat across from Trump at the state dinner hosted by King Charles in the U.K. last month. The White House did not immediately respond when Fox News Digital reached out regarding any plans to deploy National Guard to San Francisco.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 1926 fresco of Hernan Cortes and La Malinche by Jose Clemente Orozco decorates the Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City, Wednesday, April 26, 2023. Her work as translator and interpreter for Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés made her a protagonist in a violent colonial period whose effects still reverberate through Latin America. Her story, told only by others, generated myths and legends. A slave using her language skills to survive? Or someone with agency who influenced Cortés and shaped major events? Five centuries later, the debate continues and Mexico's first woman leader, President Claudia Sheinbaum, is weighing in. “We have a working group of anthropologists, historians, and philosophers studying this important, much-maligned figure, and it is very important to vindicate her,” Sheinbaum said recently. Born around 1500, Malinche learned Nahuatl and the now near-disappeared Oluteco, growing up south of the Gulf of Mexico. The Aztecs sold her as a slave to a Mayan people who later gave her and other women to the Spanish after being defeated in battle. By then, she could speak two more Mayan languages. Malinche was “at their mercy as a victim,” said Camilla Townsend, a historian at Rutgers University and an expert on Malinche. As a translator for Cortés, she bridged two radically different worldviews, relaying the desires of Cortés and possibly trying to influence negotiations. “She was forced to be an intermediary between the Spaniards and these other poor women who were going to be raped,” Townsend said. Most academics today don't see her as a traitor, because the Aztecs were her enemies in a world of constant wars between different peoples that only centuries later were lumped together as “Indigenous” in a violent colonial system. Still, viewing her objectively is impossible, according to Federico Navarrete, historian at Mexico's National Autonomous University, because the race and class conflicts left by the conquest persist. Yet, schools only teach a “nationalist” perspective, downplaying nuances such as the support of some Indigenous groups for the Spanish. Yásnaya Aguilar, a Mixe linguist who has written about Malinche, described her as “a native woman who moved from being a slave to being respected and honored by society in her time.” In fact, the name Malinche was also used to refer to Cortés: they were considered one, but she was the voice. She died around the age of 30, apparently in an epidemic. Malinche was largely forgotten until the early 19th century, when Mexico won its independence from Spain and Spain's allies became enemies. She first appears as “a lascivious and scheming traitor” in a popular, anonymously published novel in 1826, so she became the perfect villain for the new country, according to Townsend. Malinche's negative image was solidified by Nobel Prize in Literature winner Octavio Paz. In his emblematic work of Mexican identity “The Labyrinth of Solitude,” Paz described her as “a figure representing the Indian women who were fascinated, violated or seduced by the Spaniards” and for whom “the Mexican people have not forgiven her betrayal.” It carried an idealized romantic relationship with Cortés that historians consider uncalled for and that Aguilar characterized as “patriarchal and chauvinistic.” It's a caricature that has extended far beyond Mexico's modern borders. “They call me Malinche too from the left for allying myself with white men … with whom we work against extractivist policies,” said Toribia Lero, an Indigenous Bolivian activist of the Sura de los Andes people. Mexico's Indigenous peoples, however, maintained respect for the woman, naming volcanoes, peaks and ceremonial dances after her. Since the 1970s, Malinche's negative image began to be questioned among Chicana feminists in the U.S. because they knew it was very hard to be a bridge between two peoples and they empathized with her, Townsend said. Now there is a growing body of academic literature attempting to contextualize her life. Follow AP's coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america</p>

Adam Swart, CEO of Crowds on Demand, says the upcoming "No Kings" protest risks being exploited by agitators and interest groups "making money off chaos," while organizers defend their nonviolent record and security plans. The head of a national crowd-for-hire firm is warning that America's protest culture has become a target for exploitation — by paid agitators, profit-driven interest groups and even foreign actors seeking to fuel division. Adam Swart, CEO of Crowds on Demand, told Fox News Digital that his company has witnessed firsthand how demonstrations can be co-opted by people "making money off chaos" rather than advancing genuine civic causes. "My concern is that there are forces — some domestic, some maybe foreign — that actually want to pull America apart," Swart said. His remarks come as organizers prepare for the "No Kings" protest, a nationwide demonstration planned for Oct. 18 that is expected to denounce political elitism and government overreach. Thousands of protesters gather outside the Texas State Capitol building in Austin, June 14, to take part in a ''No Kings'' protest against President Donald Trump. Swart said his company was approached about the event but declined to participate, calling it "a dud in the making" — another example, he said, of political theater that risks being exploited rather than achieving real persuasion. Organizers behind the "No Kings" movement pushed back on Swart's characterization, saying the event is expected to draw turnout "comparable to or larger than" the first nationwide demonstration, which they claim attracted about 5 million participants. A spokesperson told Fox News Digital the protest "has nothing to do with raising money or energizing voters," describing it instead as an effort to "demonstrate and build the resistance to the authoritarian." The spokesperson said the movement is built around a commitment to nonviolence and employs extensive security and de-escalation training for volunteers. "We're monitoring what's going on online in advance and being proactive against any identified threats," the spokesperson said, calling No Kings "mindful, thoughtful, organized and centered on nonviolence." Protesters march during a No Kings rally in Washington, D.C., Saturday, June 14, 2025. While the movement has drawn support from some progressive groups, Swart said his concerns apply broadly — to any large-scale protest vulnerable to manipulation or infiltration. Swart described what he calls a "protest industry" — an ecosystem of consultants, operatives and influencers who build brands and bankrolls from political outrage. He said many movements, regardless of ideology, now operate less as grassroots expressions and more as "performative activism" built to attract funding, followers or online engagement. But I don't want to be part of the noise." Swart said Crowds on Demand now declines contracts that he views as divisive or volatile, choosing instead to support peaceful, purposeful demonstrations. "I want to elevate productive expression — not mob theatrics," he said. Swart cautioned that not all demonstrations are what they appear to be. "I know how you'd structure a web of advocacy groups legally — and how someone could mirror that illegally," he said. Swart said growing political polarization has created fertile ground for opportunists — both domestic and foreign — who thrive on outrage and confusion. "Every time there's an incident, both sides start finger-pointing," he said. They want Democrats and Republicans blaming each other instead of asking who's profiting from it." Swart said he's seen examples where the goal of protest activity was less about persuasion and more about generating viral conflict — an approach that, in his view, benefits those monetizing clicks, chaos and outrage. His remarks echo recent U.S. intelligence warnings that foreign actors—particularly Russia, China and Iran—use disinformation to amplify divisive narratives in the U.S., and could try to spur unrest around major political events. Demonstrators hold various signs including "The Power of the People" and "No Kings No Royalty" at a pro-democracy rally in Hancock Adams Common on April 19, 2025. Swart also blamed major social-media platforms for monetizing outrage and accelerating polarization. "They only make money when you're doom-scrolling," he said. "If people liked each other, Facebook and X would be a tenth of their size." He said the problem cuts across ideological lines and is driven by the economics of engagement rather than politics. "People try to label Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg politically, but both make money off division," Swart said. Swart said the exploitation of division has become a national security concern, warning that agitators and influence networks may be working to destabilize the country for profit or geopolitical gain. "This is one of the greatest national security threats that we face — America coming apart," he said. "The sources of it are not right or left. The sources are far more sinister than that." Swart emphasized that his warnings aren't about any single protest or political movement but about a larger pattern — one where manipulation and misinformation can turn public expression into a tool for profit or chaos. "The protest space has to be about purpose again," he said. "If we don't figure that out, we're going to keep getting played by the people who thrive on conflict." Swart said he remains hopeful that awareness and transparency can help reduce the risks. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Marcelo Lombardi, 45, complained he was feeling sleepy on a Friday, his family didn't think much of it. Lombardi often put in long hours running his family's 17-year-old real estate business in São Paulo, Brazil, working alongside two of his older sisters. Fernanda Lombardi, one of his sisters, recalled their life being “perfect” until that day, September 26. “Earlier in the week, he came home with some groceries, which included a bottle of vodka,” she told CNN. “It took them about five hours to tell us that my brother had been poisoned,” Fernanda said. “By then, all of his organs were shutting down. He looked me in the eye and said, ‘I'm not leaving this place. The colorless liquid is now responsible for an ongoing health crisis that has triggered a nationwide panic affecting about 100 million people across six states in Brazil, according to health authorities. Methanol is a clear, odorless, highly flammable liquid found in antifreeze, varnish and fuel. Ingesting just a few milliliters can cause blindness or death. Federal authorities are investigating several fronts to determine how industrial methanol entered Brazil's consumer alcohol supply. In Brazil, methanol commerce is regulated by the government, restricted to industrial uses such as biodiesel production, solvents, and laboratory applications. Its sale is legal but strictly controlled, and every transaction must be registered. One main line of investigation is that methanol, cheaper than ethanol, may have been intentionally used by counterfeiters to cut liquor production costs. Federal police are examining whether the chemical used by clandestine factories was purchased from gas stations and later diverted to illicit alcohol production. Investigators are also probing whether smuggled or diverted industrial methanol entered Brazil's black market and if it has been used for bottle washing or sterilization by underground distilleries, contaminating drinks later sold illegally. Don't drink local ‘Tiger' vodka and whisky in Laos, Australia warns after tourist deaths As a precaution, health and trade associations are urging consumers and bars to destroy or properly dispose of empty bottles to prevent counterfeiters from reusing them in the production of fake liquor. Federal investigators have uncovered a massive black-market supply chain flooding bars, venues and homes with counterfeit liquor. Hospitals are also reporting rapid-onset blindness, irreversible comas and organ failure within hours of ingestion. Between early and late September, his team saw 10 suspected cases across São Paulo and neighboring cities – enough to trigger a nationwide alert. “We've seen spikes before, in 2023 and 2024, among unhoused people who drank fuel-grade ethanol,” Capitani said. “This time, victims were drinking cocktails at bars and parties. Capitani said Brazil's public health system reacted quickly, but the crisis exposed deep structural weaknesses: Few hospitals have labs capable of testing for methanol or its toxic byproduct, formic acid, and fewer stocked the antidotes needed to treat patients fast. For Fernanda Lombardi, racing to find an antidote in pharmacies brought a feeling she will never forget. Within 24 hours, patients may lose their vision and struggle to breathe. Treatment requires intravenous administration of ethanol or fomepizole, a specific antidote that blocks methanol's toxic conversion. “We're working to keep our antidote reserve full,” she told CNN on Thursday from the airport, “but it's hard to predict how much we'll need.” Australian teens among six tourists dead as countries warn of suspected methanol poisonings in Laos “Many hospitals didn't have 100 percent ethanol in sufficient quantities. Until it arrives, sometimes hours later, that time can cost a patient their vision or life.” Brazil's Ministry of Health addressed the issue in a statement to CNN: “But now,” Capitani cautioned, “that's become a Russian roulette, because even vodka could be contaminated.” Themis Mizerkowski Torres, a rheumatologist and toxicologist leading efforts at São Paulo's Center for Intoxication Control, says the crisis is unprecedented. But as Health Minister Alexandre Padilha stressed in a recent news conference, “there's no such thing as completely safe drinking right now.” Some have stopped selling vodka, whiskey and cachaça entirely. From São Paulo to Pernambuco, fear now overshadows Brazil's vibrant bar culture – a sobering reminder of how one contaminated bottle can devastate families and test the country's ability to contain a crisis. Fernanda Lombardi says her brother's death destroyed their family and community. “Someone thought about money and not a human life. We want justice, so no other family has to go through this.” At his funeral, hundreds of mourners came to pay respects.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? It's not millennial cringe to wonder if you can enjoy the work of problematic artists. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity: My partner and I are having a disagreement about JK Rowling that we want you to weigh in on. For reference, we're a same-sex couple, and despite our different upbringing, we tend to have similar moral compasses and political feelings. I love the Harry Potter world — books, movies, broadway plays, video games, etc. However, I still want to engage in the Harry Potter world, which I feel sends a positive message overall. To assuage my guilt, whenever I buy something Harry Potter-related that might make JK Rowling any money, I then donate a larger sum of money to the Human Rights Campaign. I've encountered this dilemma before, and I'll tell you straight off the bat that I'm not the type to condemn you as a Slytherin just because you still want to engage with the works of JK Rowling. I'm totally fine with reading books penned by problematic writers — even if their views have seeped into the books themselves — because I believe I'm capable of separating the wheat from the chaff in these works. In fact, so many of us have practically had to become experts at this sort of literary winnowing, because 99 percent of the books humanity has thrown at us contain that chaff. I'm a queer Jewish woman, and if I had to excise from my library every book whose writer was anti-LGBTQ, antisemitic, or misogynist, my shelves would be pretty much empty! Or when the goblins are portrayed as an antisemitic stereotype? Or when the werewolves are presented as a metaphor for HIV? Or when we're told that the house elves actually like being enslaved because their race makes them naturally subservient? Feel free to fill out this anonymous form! Newsletter subscribers will get my column before anyone else does and their questions will be prioritized for future editions. We shouldn't be like Voldemort or like the Death Eaters, who believe “pure-blood” wizards and witches are inherently better than everyone else. We should recognize that everyone (even Snape, the Slythiest of Slytherins!) This is the core message that made so many of us fall in love with the Harry Potter world as kids. It made us feel that it's okay to be different — that difference should be respected and even celebrated. Even though Rowling often undercut that open-hearted message with nonsense like “rightfully” enslaved house elves, most of us picked up the main moral message in spite of these flaws. And in that way, the books successfully achieved what good fiction is meant to achieve. By exposing us to scene after scene of characters encountering moral conundrums, Nussbaum argues, good fiction trains our capacity for moral attention — the capacity to notice the morally salient features of a given situation so that we can respond appropriately. And it's on precisely that basis that many of those young readers, now all grown up, reject Rowling's anti-trans views. These readers can choose to reject her books, too. But some don't — and I think that's totally alright too. In a 2020 episode of the popular podcast Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, co-hosts Casper ter Kuile and Vanessa Zoltan interviewed trans author Jackson Bird. As Bird said of such texts, “We continue to interrogate, but we still acknowledge and accept the ways in which they are useful for us, or healing.” The “continue to interrogate” part is key here. Any fandom — whether it's centered on the Christian canon or the Harry Potter canon — is responsible for continuously revising how its canonical texts do and don't get to guide action. Religious communities have been proving that for ages. As early as 2000 years ago, Jewish theologians were inventing a genre called Midrash, which is basically ancient fanfiction; it reimagines problematic bits of the Bible in ways that make them more palatable or meaningful. And over the centuries, many Muslim and Christian theologians have been busy transforming their traditions, giving us everything from Islamic Modernism to Black liberation theology. So, for you, what can interrogating the Potter canon look like in practice? I'd suggest connecting with other Potterheads so you can both enjoy and interrogate the content together. Whether that's a book club, a movie-watching marathon, a video game night with friends, or a Harry Potter and the Sacred Text episode that you listen to with your partner in the car, the point is to engage with the content and then critically discuss it. The benefit of doing this in community is that it can actually generate social good. If you end up discussing the house elves, say, you might end up talking about how even the good guys in Rowling's books are way too content with maintaining the status quo rather than calling for systemic change (Dumbledore treats his enslaved house elves nicely, but he still enslaves house elves!). That could lead you into all sorts of discussions about how you are or aren't challenging the status quo in our Muggle world. If you engage with Rowling's work this way, I think it's plausible that the positive social value you'll be generating will outweigh any negative social value you might create by continuing to be a Potterhead. And, crucially, I suspect you'll stop feeling guilty. Right now, your strategy to ward off guilt is to focus on the financial aspect of all this — how your Potter-related purchases end up materially benefiting Rowling and, through her, the type of organizations she might support. On a dollar-for-dollar level, this is something you can “offset” by donating to the Human Rights Campaign. In fact, since Rowling is already a billionaire, buying a video game now is not appreciably moving the needle for her, while donating hundreds or thousands of dollars to the HRC could plausibly make a difference to that nonprofit. So this strategy is nothing to sneeze at. And we can tell it's not enough because you still feel guilty. On its own, offsetting feels cheap, and the reason it feels cheap is that it's not demanding that any transformative work take place — either for you personally or for society more broadly. It's letting you throw a pittance at the problem without requiring you to participate, through your own hard work, in changing the status quo and creating systemic change. Remember, shying away from systemic change is how Rowling deals with problems in her books.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During Trump's first administration, first daughter Ivanka, for example, was criticized for her brand endorsements, including a social media post about Goya beans. Five years later, with no members of the first family part of the president's second administration, first granddaughter Kai Trump last month launched her own clothing line using photographs taken at the White House and first son Eric Trump this month is embarking on a book tour for his new memoir, “Under Siege: My Family's Fight to Save Our Nation,” with fewer or at least less vocal critics. Earlier this year, eldest first son Donald Trump Jr., also opened a private social club called the Executive Branch with membership fees reportedly $500,000, Eric's former Republican National Committee co-chair wife Lara, debuted a new television show on Fox News, and first lady Melania Trump created a memecoin. The first lady's documentary, Melania, for which Amazon MGM Studios paid $40 million, is being released on Jan. 30, too. For Public Citizen government affairs lobbyist Craig Holman, the Trump family “cashing in” on the presidency “is a family affair on a scale never before seen in American political history,” as other experts underscore that it is not illegal. “There have been occasional embarrassments to former presidents by a relative seeking financial gain from a family member serving as president, such as Hunter Biden receiving consulting fees from foreign governments and Billy Carter lending his family's reputation to sell a beer,” Holman told the Washington Examiner. The 18-year-old golfer's profile has increased exponentially since her primetime appearance during last year's Republican National Convention. “For monogrammed sweatshirts priced at $130 each, Kai's financial gain will also prove to be lucrative,” he said. Eric Trump spokeswoman Kimberly Benza dismissed ethics concerns regarding her boss, particularly with respect to his upcoming book. “Unlike Hunter Biden, who cashed in on his father's position, selling influence and finger paintings, Eric Trump is a businessman, who has been in the private industry for 25 years, employing tens of thousands of people and has spent the last decade enduring relentless attacks from the radical left — attacks aimed at destroying his family, their business, and his father's legacy,” Benza told the Washington Examiner. To that end, Hunter Biden wrote his own memoir in 2021 called Beautiful Things. Another example from Hunter Biden, other than his amateur artwork being valued at $500,000, includes a report this week that he pursued a real estate deal in 2017 with a Chinese company for land around the U.S. Embassy in Romania predicated on relationships formed when his father was vice president. “I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden,” Hunter said in 2019. “There's literally nothing, as a young man or as a full grown adult that — my father in some way hasn't had influence over. Kushner has been in the Middle East this week, despite not formally being part of the administration, to help negotiate the peace deal between Israel and Hamas, as well as to have meetings with the likes of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, alongside U.S. Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff, after multiple sit-downs with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Kushner last month struck a different deal with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and other stakeholders to take video-game maker Electronic Arts private through a $55 billion deal that is the largest leveraged buyout in history so far. The Abraham Accords normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries. “We had a very smart group of people working this. Earlier this month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned a reporter for asking how the administration decided it was “appropriate” for Kushner to become an emissary to “Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia — three countries that combined have given him more than $2.5 billion for his investment firm,” Affinity Partners. “I think it's frankly despicable that you're trying to suggest that it's inappropriate for Jared Kushner, who is widely respected around the world and has great trust and relationships with these critical partners in these countries, to strike a 20-point comprehensive, detailed peace plan that no other administration would ever be able to achieve,” Leavitt said. Other examples include Trump's announcement last month that he would hold next year's Group of 20 leaders summit at his golf course in Miami, Florida, after the same proposal was postponed during his first administration because of ethics concerns and the COVID-19 pandemic – not to mention his own merchandise, from gold sneakers to bibles. Regardless, Northeastern University politics professor Costas Panagopoulos reiterated that “while some may find capitalizing on these opportunities distasteful, it does not mean it is necessarily illegal or even unethical.”</p>
