Journalist and pro-Israel activist Emily Austin joins 'Fox & Friends First' to break down the Virginia gubernatorial debate and President Trump not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. With just weeks left before Virginians head to the voting booth, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger has been rattled by twin controversies — a violent text message scandal involving a fellow Democrat and fresh criticism over her stance on transgender bathroom policies. In 2022, Virginia state attorney general candidate Jay Jones told a colleague via text that he wished violence against former Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his children. The private messages, which recently came to light, have sparked outrage from Republicans and discomfort among Democrats, forcing Spanberger to navigate one of the most volatile moments of her campaign. Spanberger's cautious tone carried into last Thursday's debate, where she faced off against GOP nominee Winsome Earle-Sears. "Jay Jones advocated the murder — Abigail — the murder of a man, a former speaker, as well as his children who were 2 years and 5 years old. "Please ask him to get out of the race. Spanberger's campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. A split of Winsome Earle-Sears and Abigail Spanberger. Meanwhile, fellow Democrats have rallied around Jones, emphasizing forgiveness and unity as the campaign enters its final stretch. He told Fox News Digital he's still a supporter of the embattled candidate for his state's attorney general seat. "I think those statements were not in character, and he has apologized — I wish other people in public life would sincerely apologize for stuff," the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee said. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., did not respond when Fox News Digital repeatedly asked whether Jay Jones should end his campaign. Warner was also pressed on whether he would seek the return of a $25,000 August donation from Jones or express regret over the show of support, but once again declined to respond. Jay Jones, who is running to become Virginia's attorney general in 2025, has come under fire for a series of text messages calling for the death of political opponents and remarks about police officers. "We are lined up, ten toes down, ready to organize, mobilize and deliver voters for Jay and our entire Democratic ticket," the statement read. "Recent press may have spotlighted past mistakes. We say, let those without sin cast the first stone. Jay Jones has taken responsibility, apologized and shown he is committed to serving with integrity and accountability that his public record already shows." Last week, President Donald Trump called for Jones to drop out of the race, calling the text messages "sick" and "demented." "Democrat Jay Jones should drop out of the race immediately and the people of Virginia must continue to have a great attorney general in Jason Miyares who, by the way, has my complete and total endorsement," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Oct. 5. The latest revelation comes amid heightened political tensions and a growing number of incidents that have fueled concerns about violence in national politics. Abigail Spanberger's campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Glenn Youngkin issued an executive directive ensuring bathrooms, locker rooms and other intimate spaces remain separated by sex assigned at birth. The directive also instructs the state Board of Health to bar biological males from competing on female athletic teams. When asked, point-blank, whether she would rescind that directive, Spanberger refused to give a definitive answer. "My answer is that in each local community decisions should be made between parents and educators, and teachers in each community. It shouldn't be dictated by politicians," Spanberger responded. "I'm a mother of three daughters in Virginia public schools, and nothing is more important to me than their safety and their experience in schools," Spanberger added in response to questions about her stance on transgender issues.

Federal and local authorities rescued more than 30 missing children and uncovered multiple trafficking operations targeting vulnerable youth during a coordinated crackdown across Texas. The effort, centered in San Antonio, led to arrests, felony warrants and several new investigations under a joint mission known as "Operation Lightning Bug." Marshals Service (USMS) out of San Antonio, Del Rio, Midland, and Pecos joined forces with San Antonio Police Department's Missing Persons Unit, Special Victims Unit, Street Crimes Unit and covert operatives. More than 30 children were rescued in the San Antonio area. Each recovered child was interviewed by SAPD's Special Victims Unit to determine whether they had been victimized. Survivors were referred to support services provided by agencies such as Health and Human Services to ensure long-term care and protection. Marshal Susan Pamerleau, for the Western District of Texas, said in a statement that protecting children remains central to the Marshals Service's mission. "The safety of our children is the safety of our communities, and justice demands that we protect those who cannot protect themselves," Pamerleau said. "Through Operation Lightning Bug, we reaffirm our promise to safeguard the most vulnerable and strengthen the safety of our communities." Marshals Service and local law enforcement have been cracking down on trafficking operations. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus echoed those sentiments, praising the effort as an example of law enforcement unity. "Every suspect arrested, juvenile returned home and survivor taken out of harm's way matters," McManus said. "This operation demonstrates what can be achieved when law enforcement agencies unite to protect children." That law also led to the creation of the USMS Missing Child Unit, which leads similar recovery efforts nationwide. Marshals Service said protecting children remains central to its mission. Kirsta Leeberg-Melton, founder and CEO of the Institute to Combat Trafficking, said operations like this one underscore the larger issue of exploitation in Texas and beyond. "Trafficking is something that the city of San Antonio and the state of Texas and the nation have been grappling with for a considerable period of time," she said in an interview with Fox News Digital. She said traffickers often target instability — children without consistent housing, food or family support. "They are easy pickings for traffickers to take advantage of," she warned. "They exploit these needs by offering those items and then calling in debts and putting those kids in a position where they are able to exploit them for sex or for labor." Leeberg-Melton said the public often underestimates how widespread trafficking is — and how much it has evolved, especially online. "Trafficking is the exploitation of men, women and children for forced sex or forced labor by a third party for their profit or gain. "What hasn't really been around is people's understanding of that crime and their knowledge that it's happening everywhere!" She added that traffickers increasingly use technology to recruit and control victims. "The internet allows them to connect with victims and buyers far beyond their local area." Traffickers are increasingly using technology to prey on victims, Kirsta Leeberg-Melton said. Leeberg-Melton emphasized that trafficking is not limited to border regions. "The biggest myth is that it happens somewhere else, and it happens to someone else," she said. "Until we start recognizing that people have value, no matter who they are, where they come from, what they've done or what's been done to them, we will continue to excuse some level of exploitation." Leeberg-Melton also described sextortion as a growing form of trafficking that uses coercion to force sexual conduct or imagery. "When you have someone that you are holding something over their head and then you are asking them for additional photographs or additional sexual conduct with the threat…that is a form, frankly, of human trafficking," she said. If you suspect someone is a victim of trafficking, contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or report anonymously at humantraffickinghotline.org.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Struggles by several top 10 teams in Week 7 of college football should send shockwaves through the latest AP Top 25 rankings, dropping at 2 p.m. 3 Oregon suffered its first loss of the season, delivered by No. 7 Indiana in a 30-20 road win. 4 Ole Miss pulled out a 24-21 victory over Washington State in a game that shouldn't have been close. 6 Oklahoma was outperformed by the Texas Longhorns, whose stint as an unranked team will likely be short-lived after a convincing 23-6 win. Follow live updates from The Associated Press below for poll projections, game recaps, analysis and voter answers to fan questions, all in one place. ▶ Show your appreciation for one of college football's longest-running traditions. Nine AP Top 25 teams maintained an undefeated record through Week 7: No. Memphis entered the Top 25 just last week after a 45-7 win against Tulsa. The Tigers had the week off and will return to game action on Oct. 18 with a trip to UAB. BYU squeaked by Arizona in a double-overtime thriller on Saturday night. A 7-yard rushing touchdown by BYU freshman quarterback Bear Bachmeier sealed the deal for the Cougars. Future games holds significant value. For example, Ole Miss and Tennessee did not have convincing games this week. However, they will be heavily monitored next week because of their matchups against ranked opponents.

The Trojans could return to the rankings after outplaying No. Texas came out on top of the Red River Rivalry, beating No. Utah rounded out competition for the day with a dominant 42-10 win against No. 9 Texas Tech could see its highest ranking of the season after a 42-17 win against Kansas. Alabama's opening season loss to FSU will weigh down its record. However, three straight Top 25 wins in SEC play has them as the frontrunner to win the conference. Their biggest strength right now is the defense coming up big late in games and the brilliance of QB TY Simpson as one of the best passers in the country.

The Rebels pulled out a 24-21 win, but could see a slight drop off in the rankings after the uninspiring outing. 6 Oklahoma could drop out of the top 10 for the first time in weeks after losing to an unranked Texas team on Saturday. Indiana is off to a 6-0 start and now has two wins against ranked teams after having zero in 2024. It's worth considering that this may be the best year in Indiana history. So moving them up was a given, seeing how the rest of their conference schedule holds up. For Oregon, the remaining schedule does include quality opponents like USC and Washington, but none are against teams that entered this weekend ranked inside the Top 25. Not to mention, the Ducks' best win is against Penn State, who just dropped back-to-back losses to conference opponents. Jerry Humphrey is a Top 25 voter and an Auburn sports writer for AL.com.

College football writer and Top 25 voter Jerry Humphrey will answer a few questions before and after the rankings drop. No organization has been ranking teams and naming a major college football national champion longer than The Associated Press, since 1936. AP employees don't vote themselves, but they do choose the voters. AP Top 25 voters comprise around 60 writers and broadcasters who cover college football for AP members and other select outlets. The goal is to have every state with a Football Bowl Subdivision school represented by at least one voter. Voting is a straight points system: A first-place vote is worth 25 points, a second-place vote is worth 24 points, down to 1 point for a 25th-place vote. Then it's just a summary of which teams are 1-25 based on the totals. Others receiving votes are also noted. ▶ Read more about the history of the AP Top 25 poll and how it works</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Panelists Brent Sadler and Derek Maltz weigh in on the Pentagon taking aim at narcoterrorists near Venezuela on ‘America Reports.' President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented war against cartels and has threatened narco-terrorists, saying he will "blow you out of existence" as his administration seeks to curb the influx of drugs into the U.S. The White House sent lawmakers a memo Sept. 30 informing them that the U.S. is now participating in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug smugglers — on top of conducting four fatal strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean since September. These recent developments suggest that Trump is eyeing targets within Venezuela, not just those within international waters, according to Geoff Ramsey, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council international affairs think tank. "This is a sign that President Trump is taking the US war on drugs in Latin America to the next level," Ramsey said in a Monday email to Fox News Digital. "By involving the military, the president is going after drug cartels in a way that no previous US administration has dared to so far. I think it is likely that we will see the Pentagon evaluate targets inside Venezuela." President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he ordered a lethal strike on a vessel linked to a designated terrorist organization operating in the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility Sept. 19, 2025. Additional strikes could target more drug shipments or drug flights, which often take off from covert airfields near the Colombian border, Ramsey said. "It's a bad time to be posted in a guerrilla camp on the Colombian border or operating a Tren de Aragua safe house along the Caribbean trafficking route," Ramsey said. Even so, Ramsey said it would be challenging to strike within Venezuela's territory. Doing so would require the U.S. to dismantle Venezuela's air defense system, which would escalate hostilities by openly engaging with Venezuela's military, he said. That's a departure from the current approach, in which the U.S. has intentionally avoided targeting Venezuelan military assets, Ramsey said. "When two Venezuelan F-16s flew over a US destroyer last month, the fact that those planes weren't blown out of the sky suggests that the US is not interested in a shooting war with Venezuela's military," Ramsey said. Trump himself has not ruled out conducting strikes within Venezuela though, and signaled such strikes could happen when he told military leaders in Quantico, Virginia, Sept. 30 that his administration would "look very seriously at cartels coming by land." President Donald Trump speaks to a gathering of top U.S. military commanders at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Sept. 30, 2025, in Quantico, Virginia. So far, the Trump administration has utilized maritime forces to address drug threats, and has beefed up naval assets in the Caribbean in recent months. For example, Trump approved sending several U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers to bolster the administration's counter-narcotics efforts in the region starting in August. "I expect these deployments to continue for months or more than a year, with new ships rotating in to replace those that need to return home for maintenance or crew rest," Bryan Clark, director of the Hudson Institute think tank's Center for Defense Concepts and Technology, told Fox News Digital in September. Nathan Jones, a nonresident scholar in drug policy and Mexico studies at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, predicted the strikes are unlikely to impact the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. That's because fentanyl precursors originate in China, and are then produced in labs in Mexico before they head north without a pathway into the Caribbean. "I wouldn't expect your drug flow to be affected because of these strikes," Jones told Fox News Digital Tuesday. "This could, though, leave transnational criminal organizations running a little scared in terms of what the administration is going to do." The strikes have prompted members of Congress to question their legality and senators Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., filed a war powers resolution in September that would block U.S. forces from engaging in "hostilities" against certain non-state organizations. "There has been no authorization to use force by Congress in this way," Schiff told reporters Wednesday. The fact that the administration claims to have a list and has put organizations on a list does not somehow empower the administration to usurp Congress's power of declaring war or refusing to declare war or refusing to authorize the use of force." Even so, the measure attracted support from Republicans Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted alongside their Democratic counterparts for the resolution. Other Republicans have defended the strikes though, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, said that Trump's actions were well within his rights and that the resolution was "unreasonable." "When he sees an attack like this coming — an attack of drugs or explosives or anything else that's going to kill Americans — he not only has the authority to do something about it, he has the duty to do something about it," Risch said Wednesday before the vote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four people were killed and at least 20 others were injured in a mass shooting at a South Carolina bar early Sunday, according to police. At least four victims were in critical condition following the shooting at Willie's Bar and Grill on St. Helena Island before 1 a.m., the Beaufort County Sheriff's Office said. “Upon arriving at the scene deputies made contact with a large crowd of people, several of which were suffering from gunshot wounds. “More victims continued to show up at area hospitals seeking medical attention from injuries sustained at the scene.” Sunday's shooting in South Carolina comes two days after two separate shootings in Mississippi killed at least eight people, including a pregnant woman. There was a similar third shooting in another part of the state that came under investigation, but it appeared there were no injuries from that incident. In Alabama, there was a shooting that left two people dead last weekend. Gunfire erupted between different parties after a college football game in downtown Montgomery. On Friday, local police announced a suspect had been arrested and charged with capital murder, first-degree assault, and second-degree assault.

Actress Diane Keaton shot to fame after starring in ‘The Godfather' and collaborated with Woody Allen in ‘Annie Hall.' More details surrounding Diane Keaton's death continue to emerge. According to the 911 audio obtained by TMZ, a dispatcher revealed there was a "person down" in the early hours of Saturday morning. The outlet reported that Keaton was transported to a local hospital by the Los Angeles Fire Department. Keaton died at the age of 79, her family confirmed to People magazine. "She declined very suddenly, which was heartbreaking for everyone who loved her," a friend of the Oscar winner told People. "It was so unexpected, especially for someone with such strength and spirit." "In her final months, she was surrounded only by her closest family, who chose to keep things very private. Even longtime friends weren't fully aware of what was happening," the friend added. Grammy and Oscar-winning songwriter Carole Bayer Sager detailed her final visit with Keaton just weeks before her death. "I saw her two or three weeks ago, and she was very thin," Sager, who co-wrote Keaton's single, "First Christmas," told People. The legendary actress's health declined rapidly, according to an insider. Despite her health struggles, said Sager, "she was a magic light for everyone." She was funny right up until the end and she had this way of making even ordinary moments feel special. After news broke of Keaton's passing, there was an outpouring of tributes to the Hollywood legend from her former co-stars and other celebrities. Keaton had lost a significant amount of weight weeks before her death, according to a close friend. Goldie Hawn, Steve Martin, Kimberly Williams-Paisley were among the many stars who honored Keaton's legacy. Martin, who played Keaton's on-screen husband in the hit 1991 comedy "Father of the Bride" and its 1995 sequel "Father of the Bride II," which also starred Martin Short, shared a humorous remembrance of the actress as he posted a screenshot of quotes from a joint interview with his co-stars. "I mean, you're both idiots," Keaton replied. "Don't know who first posted this, but it sums up our delightful relationship with Diane," Martin wrote in the caption. The Hollywood icon was honored by fellow colleagues. "Diane, working with you will always be one of the highlights of my life," Williams-Paisley wrote in the caption. "You are one of a kind, and it was thrilling to be in your orbit for a time. Hawn, who co-starred with Keaton and Bette Midler in the 1996 hit ensemble comedy "The First Wives Club," shared an emotional post on Instagram. "Diane, we aren't ready to lose you. Both Bette Mitler and Goldie Hawn paid trubite to their "First Wives Club" co-star. She continued: "How do we say goodbye? What words can come to mind when your heart is broken? You never liked praise, so humble, but now you can't tell me to ‘shut up' honey. There was, and will be, no one like you. You stole the hearts of the world and shared your genius with millions, making films that made us laugh and cry in ways only you could." "I was blessed to make ‘First Wives Club' with you, our days starting with coffee in the makeup trailer, laughing and joking, right through to the very last day of filming," Hawn added. "It was a roller coaster of love. "We agreed to grow old together, and one day, maybe live together with all our girlfriends," Hawn wrote. "Shine your fairy dust up there, girlfriend. I'm going to miss the hell out of you. My heart goes out to your beautiful children, Dex and Duke," the Academy Award winner concluded. Midler also paid tribute to Keaton, posting a black-and-white image of the actress on her Instagram page along with a heartfelt caption. "The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died," she wrote. "I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. "She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star," Midler added. "What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!" Fox News Digital's Ashley Hume contributed to this post. Christina Dugan Ramirez is an entertainment writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Education Department spokesperson confirmed Friday that the agency would be included in the reduction in force but did not specify how many positions would be cut or which divisions would be affected. She added that workers in the department's TRIO college access program, housed in a separate office, were also among those let go. “Once again, the Trump administration is acting as though they have impunity to cut staff from an already lean, efficient agency,” Gittleman said in a prepared statement. Education Secretary Linda McMahon has repeatedly emphasized that protecting the rights of students with disabilities and ensuring they receive the educational resources guaranteed to them by law are among her highest priorities. She has repeatedly said her goal is to shift more authority and responsibility for education to state and local government. Following a series of buyouts, early retirements, voluntary departures, and a Reduction in Force earlier this year, its workforce has been cut by nearly half. In a court filing Friday, the Justice Department reported that more than 460 Education Department employees had been laid off, eliminating roughly one-fifth of the agency's already depleted workforce. President Trump has said that oversight of special needs and student nutrition programs will eventually move to the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., though that transfer has not yet taken place. The layoffs, affecting employees across more than half a dozen federal agencies, are part of a broader Trump administration strategy to increase pressure on congressional Democrats to resolve the ongoing government shutdown. At the Education Department, nearly 90% of staff remain furloughed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hundreds of staff fired from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Friday have been reinstated, according to the American Federation of Government Employees. After a new round of layoff notices sent late Friday night to around 1,300 workers at the CDC, approximately 700 were reinstated on Saturday, while about 600 remain laid off, according to the union, which represents federal workers. Among reinstated employees are staff that publish the agency's flagship journal, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, according to Dr. Debra Houry, who recently resigned as the agency's chief medical officer and deputy director for program and science. Houry and other high-level CDC officials resigned in August in protest over the firing of recently confirmed CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez. Staff were also reinstated at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, the Global Health Center, and the Public Health Infrastructure Center, which manages more than $3 billion in grants to 107 state and local governments to help build local public health workforces, said Dr. Brian Castrucci, who is president and chief executive officer of the de Beaumont Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for public health workers. Trump's move to fund military paychecks during shutdown comes as families face strain and uncertainty Staff and officers at the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service who were able to check their emails have also received notices that their firings were in error, according to a CDC official with knowledge of the situation who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation. Epidemic Intelligence Service officers, also known as “disease detectives,” are often the first to respond to disease threats when they arise. The mistakenly fired employees were sent incorrect notifications because of a coding error on the notices, according to an HHS official. President Donald Trump said late Friday afternoon that he planned to fire “a lot” of federal workers in retaliation for the government shutdown, vowing to target those deemed to be aligned with the Democratic Party. Trump did not provide details on what qualified the affected workers as “Democrat-oriented.” The legality of firing federal workers during a government shutdown is also in question. Shortly after Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought posted “The RIFs have begun” on X on Friday AFGE replied “The lawsuit has been filed.” A court filing in that case indicates more than 4,100 federal workers were impacted by the cuts at HHS as well as the departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Homeland Security and Treasury.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 1926 fresco of Hernan Cortes and La Malinche by Jose Clemente Orozco decorates the Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City, Wednesday, April 26, 2023. Her work as translator and interpreter for Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés made her a protagonist in a violent colonial period whose effects still reverberate through Latin America. Her story, told only by others, generated myths and legends. A slave using her language skills to survive? Or someone with agency who influenced Cortés and shaped major events? Five centuries later, the debate continues and Mexico's first woman leader, President Claudia Sheinbaum, is weighing in. “We have a working group of anthropologists, historians, and philosophers studying this important, much-maligned figure, and it is very important to vindicate her,” Sheinbaum said recently. Born around 1500, Malinche learned Nahuatl and the now near-disappeared Oluteco, growing up south of the Gulf of Mexico. The Aztecs sold her as a slave to a Mayan people who later gave her and other women to the Spanish after being defeated in battle. By then, she could speak two more Mayan languages. Malinche was “at their mercy as a victim,” said Camilla Townsend, a historian at Rutgers University and an expert on Malinche. As a translator for Cortés, she bridged two radically different worldviews, relaying the desires of Cortés and possibly trying to influence negotiations. “She was forced to be an intermediary between the Spaniards and these other poor women who were going to be raped,” Townsend said. Most academics today don't see her as a traitor, because the Aztecs were her enemies in a world of constant wars between different peoples that only centuries later were lumped together as “Indigenous” in a violent colonial system. Still, viewing her objectively is impossible, according to Federico Navarrete, historian at Mexico's National Autonomous University, because the race and class conflicts left by the conquest persist. Yet, schools only teach a “nationalist” perspective, downplaying nuances such as the support of some Indigenous groups for the Spanish. Yásnaya Aguilar, a Mixe linguist who has written about Malinche, described her as “a native woman who moved from being a slave to being respected and honored by society in her time.” In fact, the name Malinche was also used to refer to Cortés: they were considered one, but she was the voice. She died around the age of 30, apparently in an epidemic. Malinche was largely forgotten until the early 19th century, when Mexico won its independence from Spain and Spain's allies became enemies. She first appears as “a lascivious and scheming traitor” in a popular, anonymously published novel in 1826, so she became the perfect villain for the new country, according to Townsend. Malinche's negative image was solidified by Nobel Prize in Literature winner Octavio Paz. In his emblematic work of Mexican identity “The Labyrinth of Solitude,” Paz described her as “a figure representing the Indian women who were fascinated, violated or seduced by the Spaniards” and for whom “the Mexican people have not forgiven her betrayal.” It carried an idealized romantic relationship with Cortés that historians consider uncalled for and that Aguilar characterized as “patriarchal and chauvinistic.” It's a caricature that has extended far beyond Mexico's modern borders. “They call me Malinche too from the left for allying myself with white men … with whom we work against extractivist policies,” said Toribia Lero, an Indigenous Bolivian activist of the Sura de los Andes people. Mexico's Indigenous peoples, however, maintained respect for the woman, naming volcanoes, peaks and ceremonial dances after her. Since the 1970s, Malinche's negative image began to be questioned among Chicana feminists in the U.S. because they knew it was very hard to be a bridge between two peoples and they empathized with her, Townsend said. Now there is a growing body of academic literature attempting to contextualize her life. Follow AP's coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday expressed confidence that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which went into effect earlier Friday, will hold. Trump also confirmed that he will deliver an address to the Knesset and meet with world leaders in Egypt. Displaced Palestinians walk with their belongings past destroyed buildings as they return to their homes in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, Friday, Oct. 10, 2025, after Israel and Hamas agreed to a pause in their war and the release of the remaining hostages. It is a moment, the Republican president says, that has been helped along by his administration's support of Israel's decimation of Iranian proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The White House says momentum is also building because Arab and Muslim states are demonstrating a renewed focus on resolving the broader, decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict and, in some cases, deepening relations with the United States It would take a small fraction of their wealth to do that. Trump will visit Israel first to meet with hostage families and address the Knesset, or parliament, an honor last extended to President George W. Bush during a visit in 2008. Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said Trump also was likely to meet with newly freed hostages, too. “Knock on wood, but we feel very confident the hostages will be released and this president is actually traveling to the Middle East, likely this evening, in order to meet them and greet them in person,” Vance told CBS' “Face the Nation.” It is a tenuous truce and it is unclear whether the sides have reached any agreement on Gaza's postwar governance, the territory's reconstruction and Israel's demand that Hamas disarm. Negotiations over those issues could break down, and Israel has hinted it may resume military operations if its demands are not met. “I think the chances of (Hamas) disarming themselves, you know, are pretty close to zero,” H.R. McMaster, a national security adviser during Trump's first term, said at an event hosted by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies on Thursday. He said he thought what probably would happen in the coming months is that the Israeli military “is going to have to destroy them.” Israel continues to rule over millions of Palestinians without basic rights as settlements expand rapidly across the occupied West Bank. Despite growing international recognition, Palestinian statehood appears exceedingly remote because of Israel's opposition and actions on the ground, The war has left Israel isolated internationally and facing allegations of genocide, which it denies. International arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister are in effect, and the United Nations' highest court is considering allegations of genocide brought by South Africa. But the Islamic militant group is still intact and could eventually rebuild if there's an extended period of calm. Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would continue with its demilitarization of Hamas after the hostages are returned. “Hamas agreed to the deal only when it felt that the sword was on its neck — and it is still on its neck,” Netanyahu said Friday as Israel began to pull back its troops. The territory's roughly 2 million residents continue to struggle in desperate conditions. Under the deal, Israel agreed to reopen five border crossings, which will help ease the flow of food and other supplies into Gaza, parts of which are experiencing famine. Trump is also standing up a U.S.-led civil-military coordination center in Israel to help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into Gaza. Roughly 200 U.S. troops will help support and monitor the ceasefire deal as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players. U.S. troops will not be sent to Gaza, Adm. Brad Cooper, the U.S. military commander for the region, said in a social media post Saturday. The White House has signaled that Trump is looking to quickly return attention to building on a first-term effort known as the Abraham Accords, which forged diplomatic and commercial ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. A permanent agreement in Gaza would help pave the path for Trump to begin talks with Saudi Arabia as well Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country, toward normalizing ties with Israel, according to a senior Trump administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity. But brokering such an agreement remains a heavy lift as the kingdom has said it won't officially recognize Israel before a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Marcelo Lombardi, 45, complained he was feeling sleepy on a Friday, his family didn't think much of it. Lombardi often put in long hours running his family's 17-year-old real estate business in São Paulo, Brazil, working alongside two of his older sisters. Fernanda Lombardi, one of his sisters, recalled their life being “perfect” until that day, September 26. “Earlier in the week, he came home with some groceries, which included a bottle of vodka,” she told CNN. “It took them about five hours to tell us that my brother had been poisoned,” Fernanda said. “By then, all of his organs were shutting down. He looked me in the eye and said, ‘I'm not leaving this place. The colorless liquid is now responsible for an ongoing health crisis that has triggered a nationwide panic affecting about 100 million people across six states in Brazil, according to health authorities. Methanol is a clear, odorless, highly flammable liquid found in antifreeze, varnish and fuel. Ingesting just a few milliliters can cause blindness or death. Federal authorities are investigating several fronts to determine how industrial methanol entered Brazil's consumer alcohol supply. In Brazil, methanol commerce is regulated by the government, restricted to industrial uses such as biodiesel production, solvents, and laboratory applications. Its sale is legal but strictly controlled, and every transaction must be registered. One main line of investigation is that methanol, cheaper than ethanol, may have been intentionally used by counterfeiters to cut liquor production costs. Federal police are examining whether the chemical used by clandestine factories was purchased from gas stations and later diverted to illicit alcohol production. Investigators are also probing whether smuggled or diverted industrial methanol entered Brazil's black market and if it has been used for bottle washing or sterilization by underground distilleries, contaminating drinks later sold illegally. Don't drink local ‘Tiger' vodka and whisky in Laos, Australia warns after tourist deaths As a precaution, health and trade associations are urging consumers and bars to destroy or properly dispose of empty bottles to prevent counterfeiters from reusing them in the production of fake liquor. Federal investigators have uncovered a massive black-market supply chain flooding bars, venues and homes with counterfeit liquor. Hospitals are also reporting rapid-onset blindness, irreversible comas and organ failure within hours of ingestion. Between early and late September, his team saw 10 suspected cases across São Paulo and neighboring cities – enough to trigger a nationwide alert. “We've seen spikes before, in 2023 and 2024, among unhoused people who drank fuel-grade ethanol,” Capitani said. “This time, victims were drinking cocktails at bars and parties. Capitani said Brazil's public health system reacted quickly, but the crisis exposed deep structural weaknesses: Few hospitals have labs capable of testing for methanol or its toxic byproduct, formic acid, and fewer stocked the antidotes needed to treat patients fast. For Fernanda Lombardi, racing to find an antidote in pharmacies brought a feeling she will never forget. Within 24 hours, patients may lose their vision and struggle to breathe. Treatment requires intravenous administration of ethanol or fomepizole, a specific antidote that blocks methanol's toxic conversion. “We're working to keep our antidote reserve full,” she told CNN on Thursday from the airport, “but it's hard to predict how much we'll need.” Australian teens among six tourists dead as countries warn of suspected methanol poisonings in Laos “Many hospitals didn't have 100 percent ethanol in sufficient quantities. Until it arrives, sometimes hours later, that time can cost a patient their vision or life.” Brazil's Ministry of Health addressed the issue in a statement to CNN: “But now,” Capitani cautioned, “that's become a Russian roulette, because even vodka could be contaminated.” Themis Mizerkowski Torres, a rheumatologist and toxicologist leading efforts at São Paulo's Center for Intoxication Control, says the crisis is unprecedented. But as Health Minister Alexandre Padilha stressed in a recent news conference, “there's no such thing as completely safe drinking right now.” Some have stopped selling vodka, whiskey and cachaça entirely. From São Paulo to Pernambuco, fear now overshadows Brazil's vibrant bar culture – a sobering reminder of how one contaminated bottle can devastate families and test the country's ability to contain a crisis. Fernanda Lombardi says her brother's death destroyed their family and community. “Someone thought about money and not a human life. We want justice, so no other family has to go through this.” At his funeral, hundreds of mourners came to pay respects.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? It's not millennial cringe to wonder if you can enjoy the work of problematic artists. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity: My partner and I are having a disagreement about JK Rowling that we want you to weigh in on. For reference, we're a same-sex couple, and despite our different upbringing, we tend to have similar moral compasses and political feelings. I love the Harry Potter world — books, movies, broadway plays, video games, etc. To assuage my guilt, whenever I buy something Harry Potter-related that might make JK Rowling any money, I then donate a larger sum of money to the Human Rights Campaign. I've encountered this dilemma before, and I'll tell you straight off the bat that I'm not the type to condemn you as a Slytherin just because you still want to engage with the works of JK Rowling. I'm totally fine with reading books penned by problematic writers — even if their views have seeped into the books themselves — because I believe I'm capable of separating the wheat from the chaff in these works. In fact, so many of us have practically had to become experts at this sort of literary winnowing, because 99 percent of the books humanity has thrown at us contain that chaff. I'm a queer Jewish woman, and if I had to excise from my library every book whose writer was anti-LGBTQ, antisemitic, or misogynist, my shelves would be pretty much empty! We all know at this point how anti-trans the writer is and how much pain she's caused her fans. Or when the goblins are portrayed as an antisemitic stereotype? Or when the werewolves are presented as a metaphor for HIV? Or when we're told that the house elves actually like being enslaved because their race makes them naturally subservient? Feel free to fill out this anonymous form! Newsletter subscribers will get my column before anyone else does and their questions will be prioritized for future editions. We shouldn't be like Voldemort or like the Death Eaters, who believe “pure-blood” wizards and witches are inherently better than everyone else. We should recognize that everyone (even Snape, the Slythiest of Slytherins!) This is the core message that made so many of us fall in love with the Harry Potter world as kids. It made us feel that it's okay to be different — that difference should be respected and even celebrated. Even though Rowling often undercut that open-hearted message with nonsense like “rightfully” enslaved house elves, most of us picked up the main moral message in spite of these flaws. And in that way, the books successfully achieved what good fiction is meant to achieve. By exposing us to scene after scene of characters encountering moral conundrums, Nussbaum argues, good fiction trains our capacity for moral attention — the capacity to notice the morally salient features of a given situation so that we can respond appropriately. And it's on precisely that basis that many of those young readers, now all grown up, reject Rowling's anti-trans views. These readers can choose to reject her books, too. But some don't — and I think that's totally alright too. In a 2020 episode of the popular podcast Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, co-hosts Casper ter Kuile and Vanessa Zoltan interviewed trans author Jackson Bird. As Bird said of such texts, “We continue to interrogate, but we still acknowledge and accept the ways in which they are useful for us, or healing.” The “continue to interrogate” part is key here. Any fandom — whether it's centered on the Christian canon or the Harry Potter canon — is responsible for continuously revising how its canonical texts do and don't get to guide action. Religious communities have been proving that for ages. As early as 2000 years ago, Jewish theologians were inventing a genre called Midrash, which is basically ancient fanfiction; it reimagines problematic bits of the Bible in ways that make them more palatable or meaningful. And over the centuries, many Muslim and Christian theologians have been busy transforming their traditions, giving us everything from Islamic Modernism to Black liberation theology. So, for you, what can interrogating the Potter canon look like in practice? I'd suggest connecting with other Potterheads so you can both enjoy and interrogate the content together. Whether that's a book club, a movie-watching marathon, a video game night with friends, or a Harry Potter and the Sacred Text episode that you listen to with your partner in the car, the point is to engage with the content and then critically discuss it. The benefit of doing this in community is that it can actually generate social good. If you end up discussing the house elves, say, you might end up talking about how even the good guys in Rowling's books are way too content with maintaining the status quo rather than calling for systemic change (Dumbledore treats his enslaved house elves nicely, but he still enslaves house elves!). That could lead you into all sorts of discussions about how you are or aren't challenging the status quo in our Muggle world. If you engage with Rowling's work this way, I think it's plausible that the positive social value you'll be generating will outweigh any negative social value you might create by continuing to be a Potterhead. And, crucially, I suspect you'll stop feeling guilty. Right now, your strategy to ward off guilt is to focus on the financial aspect of all this — how your Potter-related purchases end up materially benefiting Rowling and, through her, the type of organizations she might support. On a dollar-for-dollar level, this is something you can “offset” by donating to the Human Rights Campaign. In fact, since Rowling is already a billionaire, buying a video game now is not appreciably moving the needle for her, while donating hundreds or thousands of dollars to the HRC could plausibly make a difference to that nonprofit. So this strategy is nothing to sneeze at. And we can tell it's not enough because you still feel guilty. On its own, offsetting feels cheap, and the reason it feels cheap is that it's not demanding that any transformative work take place — either for you personally or for society more broadly. It's letting you throw a pittance at the problem without requiring you to participate, through your own hard work, in changing the status quo and creating systemic change. Remember, shying away from systemic change is how Rowling deals with problems in her books.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Afghanistan said Sunday it killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in overnight border operations, in response to what it called repeated violations of its territory and airspace. Afghan refugees sit next to their belongings loaded onto vehicles as they wait for opening of the border crossing point, which closed following Afghan and Pakistani security forces exchanged cross border firing, at a camp in Chaman, Pakistan, Sunday, Oct. 12, 2025. Afghan refugees girls sit over a truck loaded with their belongings as they with others wait for opening of the border crossing point, which closed following Afghan and Pakistani security forces exchanged cross border firing, at a camp in Chaman, Pakistan, Sunday, Oct. 12, 2025. This is a locator map for Pakistan with its capital, Islamabad, and the Kashmir region. KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Afghanistan said Sunday it killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in overnight border operations, in response to what it called repeated violations of its territory and airspace. Pakistan's army gave far lower casualty figures, saying 23 troops were killed. “The situation on all official borders and de facto lines of Afghanistan is under complete control, and illegal activities have been largely prevented,” Mujahid told a news conference in Kabul. Pakistan has previously struck locations inside Afghanistan, targeting what it alleges are militant hideouts, but these have been in remote and mountainous areas. The Taliban government's Defense Ministry said early Sunday morning its forces had conducted “retaliatory and successful operations” along the border. The Torkham crossing, one of two main trade routes between the two countries, did not open on Sunday at its usual time of 8 a.m. The crossing at Chaman, southwest Pakistan, was also closed. People, including Afghan refugees leaving Pakistan, were turned away due to the worsening security situation. An Associated Press reporter in Chaman heard jets over Spin Boldak, a city in Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province, and saw smoke rising after an explosion. Islamabad says the group carries out deadly attacks inside Pakistan, but Kabul denies the charge, saying it does not allow its territory to be used against other countries. Pakistan is grappling with surging militancy, especially in areas bordering Afghanistan. It also accuses its nuclear-armed neighbor and rival India of backing armed groups, without providing any evidence. The overnight border clashes could fuel regional instability, as India and Pakistan came close to war earlier this year after a tourist massacre in the disputed region of Kashmir. India has also boosted its relations with Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, most recently announcing an upgrade of its technical mission in Kabul to a full embassy. The Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who is in India on an official visit, told journalists that Afghanistan respected the calls made by the two Gulf powers to stop what he called “retaliatory strikes” against Pakistan. But he also warned that Kabul reserved the right to protect itself. “We want a peaceful resolution of the situation, but if the peace efforts don't succeed, we have other options,” Muttaqi said. Before the Afghan claim of casualties, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the assault and said the country's army “not only gave a befitting reply to Afghanistan's provocations but also destroyed several of their posts, forcing them to retreat.” Pakistani security officials shared videos purporting to show destroyed Afghan checkpoints, but the footage could not be independently verified because the media does not have access to these areas. The Pakistani army said more than 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralized, while the number of injured is much higher.” One official in Islamabad told The Associated Press that Pakistan had taken control of 19 Afghan border posts from where attacks were being launched. “The Taliban personnel at these posts have either been killed or fled.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During Trump's first administration, first daughter Ivanka, for example, was criticized for her brand endorsements, including a social media post about Goya beans. Five years later, with no members of the first family part of the president's second administration, first granddaughter Kai Trump last month launched her own clothing line using photographs taken at the White House and first son Eric Trump this month is embarking on a book tour for his new memoir, “Under Siege: My Family's Fight to Save Our Nation,” with fewer or at least less vocal critics. Earlier this year, eldest first son Donald Trump Jr., also opened a private social club called the Executive Branch with membership fees reportedly $500,000, Eric's former Republican National Committee co-chair wife Lara, debuted a new television show on Fox News, and first lady Melania Trump created a memecoin. The first lady's documentary, Melania, for which Amazon MGM Studios paid $40 million, is being released on Jan. 30, too. For Public Citizen government affairs lobbyist Craig Holman, the Trump family “cashing in” on the presidency “is a family affair on a scale never before seen in American political history,” as other experts underscore that it is not illegal. “There have been occasional embarrassments to former presidents by a relative seeking financial gain from a family member serving as president, such as Hunter Biden receiving consulting fees from foreign governments and Billy Carter lending his family's reputation to sell a beer,” Holman told the Washington Examiner. The 18-year-old golfer's profile has increased exponentially since her primetime appearance during last year's Republican National Convention. “For monogrammed sweatshirts priced at $130 each, Kai's financial gain will also prove to be lucrative,” he said. Eric Trump spokeswoman Kimberly Benza dismissed ethics concerns regarding her boss, particularly with respect to his upcoming book. “Unlike Hunter Biden, who cashed in on his father's position, selling influence and finger paintings, Eric Trump is a businessman, who has been in the private industry for 25 years, employing tens of thousands of people and has spent the last decade enduring relentless attacks from the radical left — attacks aimed at destroying his family, their business, and his father's legacy,” Benza told the Washington Examiner. To that end, Hunter Biden wrote his own memoir in 2021 called Beautiful Things. Another example from Hunter Biden, other than his amateur artwork being valued at $500,000, includes a report this week that he pursued a real estate deal in 2017 with a Chinese company for land around the U.S. Embassy in Romania predicated on relationships formed when his father was vice president. “I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden,” Hunter said in 2019. “There's literally nothing, as a young man or as a full grown adult that — my father in some way hasn't had influence over. Kushner has been in the Middle East this week, despite not formally being part of the administration, to help negotiate the peace deal between Israel and Hamas, as well as to have meetings with the likes of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, alongside U.S. Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff, after multiple sit-downs with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Kushner last month struck a different deal with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and other stakeholders to take video-game maker Electronic Arts private through a $55 billion deal that is the largest leveraged buyout in history so far. The Abraham Accords normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries. “We had a very smart group of people working this. Earlier this month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned a reporter for asking how the administration decided it was “appropriate” for Kushner to become an emissary to “Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia — three countries that combined have given him more than $2.5 billion for his investment firm,” Affinity Partners. “I think it's frankly despicable that you're trying to suggest that it's inappropriate for Jared Kushner, who is widely respected around the world and has great trust and relationships with these critical partners in these countries, to strike a 20-point comprehensive, detailed peace plan that no other administration would ever be able to achieve,” Leavitt said. Other examples include Trump's announcement last month that he would hold next year's Group of 20 leaders summit at his golf course in Miami, Florida, after the same proposal was postponed during his first administration because of ethics concerns and the COVID-19 pandemic – not to mention his own merchandise, from gold sneakers to bibles. Regardless, Northeastern University politics professor Costas Panagopoulos reiterated that “while some may find capitalizing on these opportunities distasteful, it does not mean it is necessarily illegal or even unethical.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An impactful nor'easter is strengthening and unleashing damaging wind gusts, heavy rain and coastal flooding as it tracks up the mid-Atlantic coast. The storm is packing a serious punch as it slowly moves north and disrupts air travel at major Northeast airports and threatens to push the ocean into homes and onto roads along the mid-Atlantic coast. This coastal storm is called a nor'easter due to the prevailing wind direction from the northeast ahead of its center. These northeast winds push water toward the coast, causing it to erode beaches and pile up and cause flooding. Dozens of river gauge locations are expected to reach moderate or major flood stage, the most severe level, from this nor'easter. Areas from the Virginia Tidewater into Delaware and southern New Jersey are of particular concern. The major coastal flooding could inundate roads and homes, as well as cause beach erosion when combined with the heavy rain and strong winds. Water levels could climb near major flood stage Sunday afternoon at Atlantic City, New Jersey, and then rise above 8 feet Monday, which would be the highest level observed since Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Atlantic City water levels were nearing moderate flood stage early Sunday afternoon and enough floodwater had already come ashore to shut down Route 40 in both directions in and out of the city. Levels at Cape May, New Jersey, are projected to reach over 8 feet and would be the third-highest on record and the highest since January 2016. Portions of North Carolina Highway 12 are closed Sunday due to ocean overwash. Ongoing beach erosion in the Outer Banks will add to concerns there. At least nine unoccupied homes have collapsed into the Atlantic since September 30 due to intense wave action and erosion from recent storms. Charleston Harbor in South Carolina reached major flood stage Saturday afternoon and Friday morning, flooding streets there. Heavy rain is also amping up the threat level: The motorists rescued from floodwater in Georgetown, South Carolina, were “checked on by fire personnel, removed from their vehicles and brought to dry ground,” Ellis said, adding no injuries have been reported. He did not have an exact number of people rescued but estimated about a half dozen were assisted within the city. Though officials there hope the worst is behind them, Ellis urged motorists to “turn around, don't drown” when encountering flood water or barricades. Leaders up and down the East Coast have told residents in their states to be cautious. Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency that went into effect Saturday night “out of an abundance of caution,” asking residents to stay off the roads “unless absolutely necessary.” “I also encourage all Marylanders to ensure their loved ones and neighbors are properly monitoring the potential for high winds, rain, and flooding,” Moore said. Atlantic City has been getting ready for the storm over the last week, Mayor Marty Small Sr. told CNN on Sunday, adding the city had learned from past storms like Sandy how best to prepare. The high winds could last into Tuesday morning along the Northeast coast and could down tree branches and send unsecured objects flying. Power outages are possible, especially in coastal areas, and gusty winds will stretch farther inland to more heavily populated areas. Rainfall of 1 to 3 inches will be common along the East Coast, with some spots in eastern North Carolina and southeastern New England possibly picking up totals of up to 6 inches. Localized flash flooding will be a concern in areas that experience multiple rounds of heavy rain. CNN's Leigh Waldman and Sara Smart contributed reporting to this story.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The families of 16 victims killed in a devastating blast at a Tennessee explosives plant have been notified of their loss, as investigators methodically work to clear the scene and gather evidence to determine what caused the tragedy in the tight-knit community. “Due to the constraints that we have here … we're literally having to take one foot at a time,” said Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis. The thundering early morning blast at Accurate Energetic Systems reverberated across the surrounding community Friday, razing an entire building on the plant's sprawling campus and leading to a painstaking search that ultimately found no survivors. “We're moving to recovery,” an emotional Davis said during a news conference Saturday, his voice trailing off at times. “Every effort is being made to conduct a thorough, methodical and science-based investigation to find the answers that led to this tragedy and the answers that this community deserves,” Cunningham said at a news conference Saturday evening. “Once we get inside there, then we'll start looking at what's remaining, what is in that scene,” he said. “The team will document every piece of evidence that we recover as we move from that outside to the inner explosive scene,” McCracken said. Investigators are also pulling employment records and conducting controlled explosions, a source familiar with the investigation said. ATF will ensure “that if criminal activity is involved, those responsible will be held accountable, and if it was accidental, that lessons have been learned to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again,” Cunningham said. Meanwhile, the central Tennessee community that is home to the plant is grappling with a wave of grief as 16 of their families try to make sense of the tragedy. This don't only affect those families, it runs deeper … this could be people that you grew up with,” Davis said. “This is their extended family,” Davis said Saturday. Sammy Creech, a 78-year-old former employee who lives about 12 miles away from the facility, thought the explosion was an earthquake at first. “The blast shook our house,” he told CNN Saturday. He described them as “good people” from neighboring counties. “I might've slept three hours last night, off and on,” Creech said. “And I just feel sorry for all their families.” Safety concerns have previously been raised at the plant, which faced federal fines several years ago related to workplace safety practices, according to federal records. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company $7,200 after a 2019 inspection found violations related to personal protective equipment, employee exposure to contaminants and inadequate safety training, among other citations. Creech alleged he had been discriminated against because of his age. Creech, a diabetic, said the company did not like that he took snack breaks during the day to keep his blood sugar regulated. His supervisors were repeatedly told by plant management to replace Creech because he was “too old and too slow” to complete his job duties, the complaint filed in the lawsuit alleges. The fire happened in October 2020, in the same building where Friday's explosion happened, according to Creech, who said he was told days later he was being terminated for “poor housekeeping” that contributed to the fire. Friday's tragedy has placed a heavy strain on the area's close-knit community, many of whom have come together at vigils honoring the victims and praying for them. “When you have small counties like this, we know each other … we love each other,” Davis said. Among those believed to have died was Melissa Dawn Stanford, a 53-year-old production supervisor at the plant, her niece, Brittany Kirouac, told CNN in a statement Saturday. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation informed Kirouac they don't believe her aunt could have survived, she said. We are honestly at a loss for words and grief is not linear. In the past 24 hours I have seen: anger, sadness, bargaining, denial, and acceptance,” Kirouac said. “Not only from our family, but from the families who surrounded us waiting to hear news about their loved ones,” she continued. Kirouac asked for prayers as her family, like so many others, attempts to “navigate these coming days, weeks, and months.” “It's going to be a sad, sad day in our community for a while,” she lamented, urging people to “give us time to heal, and pray for us.” “The time is not to worry about why it happened. It's to worry about who it happened to, the families,” said Brown, adding the victims “were loved by their families and by their communities … Everybody knew them.” For some, the deadly blast brought back painful memories of another past disaster that swept the area years ago. “Both our counties was hit pretty hard in '21,” Davis said as he choked up, seemingly referring to devastating flooding that hit Humphreys County, killing 20 people and destroying or damaging hundreds of homes and businesses. “We've already taken plans to prepare to take care of our loved ones and our families even more,” he said. Counseling will be provided at schools starting Monday to help families involved, Davis said.</p>
