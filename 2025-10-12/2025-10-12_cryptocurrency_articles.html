                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. But many of those cards end up forgotten in drawers, unspent or lost to expiration dates. A new kind of gift card aims to change that by turning gifting into an investment opportunity: Bitcoin. Fold (NASDAQ:FLD), a fintech company founded to make Bitcoin more accessible to everyday consumers, recently launched what it calls the first-ever Bitcoin gift card. Meet Flippy: The AI Robot Helping Fast Food Brands Cut Tens of Billions in Labor Costs — And You Can Invest Early Accredited Investors Can Now Tap Into the $36 Trillion Home Equity Market — Without Buying a Single Property Fold started by letting users earn Bitcoin instead of traditional cash-back or airline miles rewards. Since its founding, Reeves says customers have earned over $90 million in Bitcoin rewards, compared to less than $20 million had they opted for cash back. The Bitcoin gift card functions like a traditional one, but with digital potential. Once redeemed, recipients can save, spend, or even cash out their Bitcoin through Fold's app. "You can send it to someone else, you can turn it into physical cash at an ATM, you can use it to spend on a debit card, and earn more Bitcoin rewards," Reeves told Benzinga. "So it creates a great and very flexible environment for people to receive Bitcoin." For many, volatility remains a concern when it comes to Bitcoin. Reeves acknowledged that while price swings are part of the asset's nature, gifting offers a safe entry point. "This is not you putting up your own hard-earned money or hard-earned savings," he said, adding that some may be nervous because of a temporary downturn. Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. "Bitcoin has been very heavily male-dominated in terms of who is adopting it," he said. He added that he believes Fold — and particularly this Bitcoin gift card — will speak to broader demographics because it makes crypto so much more accessible. Reeves is optimistic about where this gift card could lead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) says its new rare-earth export controls are lawful national-security steps — not blanket bans — and that licenses will be issued for eligible civilian trade, according to a spokesperson's Q&A posted on X Sunday morning local time. Rare earths — a group of 17 elements used in permanent-magnet motors for electric vehicles (EVs) and wind turbines, defense electronics and other high-tech gear — occupy an outsized role in supply chains because China dominates the sector. Beijing accounts for roughly 70% of global production and about 90% of processing and refining; so licensing shifts can ripple downstream even when mining or final manufacturing happens elsewhere. In remarks published only hours ago, the MOFCOM spokesperson framed the Oct. 9 action — taken with the General Administration of Customs — as part of a longer effort to “refine” China's export control system in line with domestic law and non-proliferation obligations. The spokesperson cited the military relevance of medium- and heavy rare earths and said partners were notified in advance through bilateral export-control dialogue mechanisms. Implementation, the ministry said, will hinge on licensing rather than prohibition. Reviews will be conducted under law, licenses will be granted where applications qualify, and Beijing is “actively considering” facilitation measures — including potential general licenses and license exemptions — to promote legitimate trade. Separate comments criticized U.S. port fees due to take effect Oct. 14 on certain Chinese-linked vessels. Combined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025 Both Beijing and Washington moved to calm trade tensions over the weekend.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These tokens managed to rebound faster than others, showing strong on-chain activity and retail demand even as larger assets lag behind. This article discusses those three crash-beating altcoins and how their price charts are shaping up amid the broader market weakness. Radiant Capital — a DeFi lending platform built to bridge liquidity across chains — has emerged as one of the few altcoins to beat the crypto market crash. RDNT rallied nearly 100% in the past 24 hours, rebounding to around $0.029. The move is powered by an interesting split between retail excitement and cautious large-holder interest. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures how much institutional or large-wallet money is flowing in or out of a token, remains just below zero. However, it has started curling upward, suggesting that big players are slowly returning — but still trading carefully. In contrast, the Money Flow Index (MFI), which tracks trading volume and retail inflows, has surged to an overheated 94.68, reflecting intense retail buying. This shows smaller investors are aggressively chasing every rise and dip, driving short-term euphoria around Radiant. Technically, while RDNT's 100% surge looks impressive, the chart flashes an early warning. Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya's Daily Crypto Newsletter here. At the same time, the RDNT price has just broken out of a descending channel, a bearish structure it had traded in for months. The breakout is promising, but it's not yet a confirmed bullish reversal. Failure to do so could invite selling pressure back toward $0.020 or lower. Morpho has quietly become another DeFi token, beating the crypto market crash, showing that decentralized lending projects may be leading the recovery. At the current price of $1.68, that translates to a stash worth nearly $8 million. This accumulation came even as exchange balances rose 2.66%, showing that selling is continuing across cohorts, primarily by retail and smart money. The bearish bars have shrunk sharply since October 10, suggesting that selling pressure is fading and that bulls might be regaining control. For the recovery to continue, the price must hold above $1.61 and push through $1.91 to retest higher resistance levels at $2.47 and $2.85. Despite market-wide volatility, Morpho's steady whale accumulation and fading bearish power suggest that it could remain one of the few DeFi altcoins outperforming during the crypto market crash, provided large money keeps backing the rebound. Succinct's PROVE token, which powers its zero-knowledge proof (ZK-proof) infrastructure network, has emerged as one of the altcoins beating the crypto crash. Over the past 24 hours, PROVE is up nearly 19%, signaling renewed confidence in infrastructure-based DeFi projects even as most of the market struggles to recover. On-chain data paints a clear picture of who's driving the move. This means buyers remain active, but the momentum is largely retail-driven, and may need fresh whale inflows to stay strong. Between September 26 and October 10, the price made a lower low while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) formed a higher low, showing bullish divergence and fading selling momentum. For now, retail enthusiasm continues to drive PROVE's recovery, but whale re-entry will decide whether it can extend its lead among the altcoins already beating the crypto crash. While these DeFi names impressed during the recovery, Zcash (ZEC) deserves an honorary mention for completely defying the crypto market crash. Both retail and institutional money continue flowing into ZEC, keeping the rally alive even as most other altcoins struggle to recover. For more insights, read our full Zcash analysis here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After months of debate, Kenya's parliament has passed the country's first comprehensive crypto legislation. In Uganda, an initiative to launch the country's first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is going into effect. CBDC continues to lose momentum as stablecoins, like the USDC and USDT, take over This bill creates a licensing and supervisory framework for crypto service providers in the country. One notable requirement for service providers is having a physical office in the country and at least three natural persons on their board of directors. Binance-linked lobby group, Virtual Assets Chamber of Commerce, played a role in changes to the bill. Uganda has launched a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot programme. It will feature a $5.5Bn real-world asset tokenization project led by Global Settlement Network (GSN) and Diacente Group. “We're building infrastructure that goes beyond theory — a programmable economy grounded in real assets, regulatory collaboration, and mass accessibility,” Some target assets for the new portfolio are food production, mining, renewable energy, and trade. Uganda has a broad range of possible tokenized assets, and this project intends to leverage these possibilities. Due to its inherent architecture, Bitcoin has historically faced scalability problems. The Lightning Network came to improve payment efficiency and ensure Bitcoin could become more compatible with merchants' instant settlement needs. The total number of merchants now accepting crypto payments is approximately 650,000. This increased rate is a strong representation of South African business.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An onchain investigation by crypto researcher Eye has linked the mysterious Hyperliquid whale, who controls over 100,000 BTC, to Garrett Jin, the former CEO of BitForex, a now-defunct exchange embroiled in a fraud scandal. In a Saturday post on X, the onchain sleuth noted that the whale's main wallet, ereignis.eth, was connected to another ENS name, garrettjin.eth, which directly leads to Jin's verified X (Twitter) account, @GarrettBullish. The wallet activity also matched Jin's known business dealings, including transfers to staking contracts and addresses funded by exchanges he had past ties with, such as Huobi (HTX). Related: Trader loses $21M on Hyperliquid after private key leak: How to stay protected The exchange was later accused of falsifying trading volumes and flagged by Japan's Financial Services Agency for operating without registration. Hong Kong's SFC later issued a warning for suspected fraud, and users claimed millions in unrecovered funds. Following BitForex's collapse, Jin founded several ventures, including WaveLabs VC (2020), TanglePay (2021), IotaBee (2022) and GroupFi (2023). In 2024, he launched XHash.com, a platform for institutional Ethereum staking, which investigators allege may have been used to onboard questionable funds.
