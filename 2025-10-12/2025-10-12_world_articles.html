                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• The 20 hostages held in Gaza thought to be alive are expected to be released early Monday morning local time before being transferred to the Red Cross, an Israeli government spokesperson said today. Nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel will also be freed. • US President Donald Trump will depart for the Middle East today ahead of a speech at Israel's parliament on Monday and meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as the families of the hostages. Leaders from more than 20 countries will then join Trump in Egypt for a summit on Gaza's future. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have returned home to find only ruins as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas enters a third day. Palestinian Authority Vice President Hussein Al-Sheikh said on Sunday he met former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to discuss their future vision for Gaza. “I met today with Mr. Tony Blair to discuss the day after and ways to support President (Donald) Trump's efforts aimed at ending the war and establishing lasting peace in the region,” Al-Sheikh posted on X. Remember: Under the ceasefire agreement, Israel must free 250 Palestinian prisoners who hold life sentences, as well as 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza detained after October 7, 2023. As Israel prepares for the arrival of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, the country's hospitals are also making sure they are well-equipped to handle any medical needs that may arise once they arrive home. Dr Eli Sprecher, the CEO of Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital, showed CNN's Wolf Blitzer around his medical center today and said that his staff were “all very much looking forward to that truly historical moment.” Some 24 hostages who were previously freed from Gaza have been treated at the hospital, Sprecher said. Medical teams are preparing for the latest hostage release based off their past experience. The hostages could also face orthopedic problems from being kept underground in tunnels for so long, as well as psychological difficulties from two years of captivity, he added. Sprecher said that the hospital is trying to recreate a “home-like atmosphere” for those admitted tomorrow. Hospital rooms will have two beds in them so the hostages can sleep with a family member nearby and a playground has been set up for the hostages who have children, he said. US Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza will be released soon. Earlier, a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office, said hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees set to be released Monday will be driven into Gaza once the hostages held in the enclave cross back into Israel, He gave unusual authorities to people who had never been in diplomacy before, he actually broke the mold,” Vance said. He gave Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner a remarkable amount of authority to go and get a peace deal done.” “He is not planning to put boots on the ground in Gaza or Israel,” Vance said. Israel's Knesset committee chair has said today “we're all eagerly waiting” to thank Trump during tomorrow's visit “for everything he's done,” according to a spokesperson. On Sunday, the Knesset committee also approved a “special session” to honor Trump, which will take place tomorrow, the spokesperson said. Remember: Trump will then travel to Egypt, where he is due to co-chair a summit on Gaza alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. This means that at least 67,806 people have been killed in Gaza during the last two years of war, with 170,066 reported injuries, according to the health ministry. A spokesperson for Gaza's Civil Defense told CNN yesterday that approximately 10,000 Palestinians are believed to have been buried under rubble across Gaza since October 7, 2023. We heard earlier from a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office on how they expect Monday's final exchange of hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners and detainees to take place. Ruby Chen can only hope for a miracle. His 19-year-old son Itay Chen, a soldier with the Israel Defense Forces, was initially believed to have been taken hostage during the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel, but was later declared dead by the IDF. “It's like a suspended situation,” he told CNN's Becky Anderson earlier today, while speaking from Netanya, Israel. That leaves some sort of doubt that hopefully, even tomorrow, there might be some sort of surprise for us. “On one hand, excitement for those that will be able to hug their loved ones. Anticipation that finally this chapter of the people of Israel that began two years ago will finally come to an end,” he said. As thousands of displaced Palestinians make their way back north to Gaza City, many are returning to scenes beyond their imagination. Another Gaza City resident, Um Abdullah, showed CNN video of the destroyed nursery that her sister helped to build – and then ran for 20 years. Some grew up to become journalists, doctors; she raised many generations,” Um Abdullah said of her sister. The United Nations said in August that more than 90% of Gaza's schools have been either destroyed or severely damaged, with 518 out of 564 school buildings needing either full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again. Younis Ahmed Mahmoud, a resident of Gaza City's Al-Shati Camp, said he did not recognize his neighborhood. “I got lost in the street… I struggled to reach my house… it looked like an earthquake hit the area,” he said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) earlier this month estimated that around 900,000 of the city's 1 million residents had left, figures that CNN is unable to verify. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said last week that over 200,000 people had remained in Gaza City. “The Palestinian prisoners will be released once Israel has confirmation that all of our hostages set to be released tomorrow are (across) the border into Israel,” she adds. More now from Israel's Prime Minister's spokesperson, Shosh Bedrosian, who has just said if Hamas is unable to find the bodies of some of the hostages held in Gaza, an international committee will help locate them. Three Israeli sources told CNN earlier this week that Israel assesses the militant group may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza. “An international body, which was agreed on in this (ceasefire) plan, will help locate the hostages if they are not found and released tomorrow,” Bedrosian adds. “The Prime Minister (Benjamin Netanyahu) insists that we will act to locate all of these hostages as soon as possible, and we will do that as a sacred duty of communal responsibility,” she added. “All 48 of our hostages will be returning back to Israel, whether they are alive or deceased,” the spokesperson said. No Hamas propaganda will be displayed during the release of the hostages being held in Gaza tomorrow, Shosh Bedrosian now says. In previous hostage releases, Hamas has staged macabre ceremonies before transferring the people they kidnapped over to the Red Cross - both living and deceased. This time round, the 20 living hostages held in Gaza will be “released together at one time to the Red Cross and transported among six to eight vehicles without any sick displays by Hamas, the terror organization,” Bedrosian adds. The hostages who have been held in Gaza will be released early on Monday morning, a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office has just said. A regional diplomat familiar with the matter also told CNN that Iran had received a formal invitation to attend the summit. At least 20 countries are expected to attend the ceremony, the Egyptian Presidency said without clarifying which nations have been invited. Among the confirmed attendees are France, Britain, Jordan and Germany. Israel is waiting to receive the 48 remaining hostages held in Gaza, who are expected to be freed Monday morning, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they are “prepared and ready” for their imminent arrival home. We can bring you some footage now from Gaza City, obtained by the Reuters news agency. It shows markets bustling as crowds gathered today in the streets to browse stalls and buy essential goods. Another Palestinian resident, Ahmed Hamadeh, said safety and security had returned due to the ceasefire. “Despite the destruction and everything we went through, thank God once the truce was announced, life returned to normalcy,” he said. The ceasefire in Gaza agreed upon by Israel and Hamas has “given a spark of hope in the Holy Land,” Pope Leo XIV said today, speaking after a mass in St Peter's Square. “Two years of conflict have left death and rubble everywhere, especially in the hearts of those who have brutally lost their children, parents, friends, everything,” he said. Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza is being prepared to receive hundreds of prisoners and detainees that Israel is set to release early next week, the Palestinian health ministry says. “We are preparing Nasser Hospital to receive 1,900 detainees that the occupation will release tomorrow, in addition to receiving a large number of bodies,” the ministry's Director-General Dr. Munir Al-Bursh wrote on X. Most of the detainees due to be released are suffering from diseases and will require urgent medical attention, he said. Earlier this week, the Israeli justice ministry published the names of 250 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails and set for release as part of a ceasefire agreement that will first see Hamas free the remaining hostages it holds. Israel is also due to release around 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza, detained after the October 7 attacks. Al-Bursh also called on the international community to “open the crossings and bring in medical supplies and equipment” in his statement. Israel is “prepared and ready for the immediate reception of all our hostages,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has just said. Netanyahu spoke with Hostage and Missing Persons Coordinator Gal Hirsch today. Of those captured on October 7, 2023, 20 are presumed alive and 25 are believed to be dead, with the status of two others uncertain. There is one additional hostage whose body was held in Gaza before the October 7 attacks. He is an IDF soldier who was killed in 2014. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has released an itinerary ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the country tomorrow. This itinerary largely aligns with Trump's official schedule of the visit, which was released overnight. Trump will then travel to Egypt, where he is due to co-chair a summit on Gaza alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since it was last updated at the end of September, 2,485 additional Russian military personnel have been confirmed killed. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, memorial community tree-plantings, regional media reports, statements from local authorities, among other sources. In August, Mediazona, in collaboration with independent Russian outlet Meduza, released a report estimating that an estimated 220,000 Russians have been killed in the country's war against Ukraine — although that number has grown since. Moscow and Kyiv rarely officially report their losses. Ukraine estimates that Russia's overall casualties during the full-scale war have surpassed 1 million. In a briefing to reporters on Aug. 12, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Russian losses are approximately three times greater than that of Ukraine, without specifying the total number of losses suffered. Despite the heavy losses, Russia has been able to make advances in Donetsk Oblast in Ukraine's east as it is able to offset its casualties through fresh contract soldiers. In turn, Kyiv faces increasingly serious manpower shortages, particularly among infantry units holding the front line. As of Oct. 11, Ukraine's General Staff estimates that Russia has lost 1,121,570 troops in Ukraine since the start of the war on Feb. 24, 2022. The numbers are largely in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies. Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent. The two leaders discussed air defense support and long-range strikes, as Russia ramps up its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. "Not only is this an attempted theft of a peaceful Ukrainian nuclear facility. A second vessel of the same class is expected to be delivered by the end of 2025, with crew training already underway, said Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa. Ukrainian forces downed 103 out of the 118 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. A missile and 15 drones struck 10 different locations, according to the statement. Ukrainian troops have liberated the village of Mali Shcherbaky in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine's 24th Separate Assault Battalion "Aidar" announced on Oct. 12, releasing footage purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers in the settlement. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur breaks down renewed U.S. discussions about supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles — and Russia's reaction. In a renewed effort to disrupt Ukraine's energy grid ahead of winter, Russia carried out several large-scale missile and drone strikes on energy and gas facilities this week. Sources told the Financial Times that the U.S. is involved at every stage of operational planning, although Kyiv retains control over target selection, with Washington advising on target vulnerabilities. The Atesh partisan group sabotaged railway infrastructure in Russia's Rostov Oblast, disrupting Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on Oct. 12. An estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Cuban fighters are actively participating in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported Oct. 5, citing an internal U.S. State Department cable obtained by the outlet.</p>
