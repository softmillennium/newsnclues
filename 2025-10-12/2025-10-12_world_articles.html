                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice-president calls crime ‘out of control' in US cities as Trump faces legal battles for use of federal forces Vance was asked on NBC News's Meet the Press whether Donald Trump was seriously considering invoking the emergency power to deploy national guard forces and even the US military in domestic settings. “The president's looking at all of his options,” he said, adding that “we are talking about this because crime has gotten out of control in our cities”. The vice-president's ominous remarks came days after Trump referred to the Insurrection Act from the Oval Office, bluntly stating: “If I had to enact it, I would do that.” Military forces are forbidden from engaging in law enforcement duties on home soil. But under the Insurrection Act, which was signed in 1807, the president can deploy them domestically in cases of insurrection or rebellion, violence that is preventing the functioning of federal laws. In Sunday's Meet the Press interview, Vance said Trump “hasn't felt he needed to” invoke the Insurrection Act up to this point. But he confirmed that it was among the tactics being considered as the administration continues to be stymied in federal courts from deploying federalised national guard forces in Democratic-run cities. Federal courts have blocked the White House from using troops in Oregon and Illinois. On Thursday a federal judge prohibited the deployment of federalised national guard personnel in Chicago, admonishing the administration that she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois”. National guard troops have been sent into Illinois by the Trump administration from both Texas and California but under the temporary court order cannot be put out into the streets. Vance told NBC News that options such as the Insurrection Act were being considered because “there are places in Chicago where people are afraid to take their children … for fear of gun violence, for fear of gang drive-by shootings”. In a separate interview with This Week on ABC News, Vance said that Chicago had been given over to “lawlessness and gangs” and had a murder rate “that rivals the worst places in the third world”. In fact, violent crime has been falling at unprecedented rates in America's biggest cities including Chicago over the past two years. Chicago is not in the top four large US cities with the highest murder rates – all of whom are in states controlled by Republicans. The vice-president was repeatedly asked by George Stephanopoulos on ABC News whether the Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, had committed a crime that could see him being prosecuted by the Department of Justice as have several other of Trump's “political enemies”. Whether he has violated a crime I would leave to the courts, but he has certainly violated his oath of office and that seems pretty criminal to me.” But as I have said before, come and get me. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, told Fox News Sunday that the crisis had been orchestrated by Democratic leaders in Congress as a partisan move “so that they can prove to their Marxist base that they are willing to fight Trump”. “We will sit down with anyone, any time, any place, go back to the White House, to have a bipartisan discussion about reopening the government,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The potential supply of U.S. Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine has raised "extreme concern" in the Kremlin, which warned that the war has reached a "very dramatic moment" with tensions escalating from all sides. "The topic of Tomahawks is of extreme concern," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said and added that "Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides." U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the matter on Oct. 6, saying he would need to know Ukraine's intended use for the missiles before agreeing to provide them, as he does not wish to escalate the war. The Tomahawk is a subsonic, long-range cruise missile designed for precision strikes. "Just imagine: a long-range missile is launched and is flying and we know that it could be nuclear. Military experts overseas should understand this," Peskov said. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously warned that providing these missiles would be a "qualitatively new stage of escalation," claiming they cannot be used without the direct involvement of U.S. military personnel. The war is framed by Putin as a pivotal point stemming from what he describes as the West's post-1991 humiliation of Russia, while Ukraine and its allies condemn it as an act of imperial-style land seizure. Olena Goncharova is the Head of North America desk at The Kyiv Independent, where she has previously worked as a development manager and Canadian correspondent. She first joined the Kyiv Post, Ukraine's oldest English-language newspaper, as a staff writer in January 2012 and became the newspaper's Canadian correspondent in June 2018. "Just imagine: a long-range missile is launched and is flying and we know that it could be nuclear." Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine's railway infrastructure as autumn sets in, resulting in increasing train delays and cancellations. The two leaders discussed air defense support and long-range strikes, as Russia ramps up its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. "Not only is this an attempted theft of a peaceful Ukrainian nuclear facility. A second vessel of the same class is expected to be delivered by the end of 2025, with crew training already underway, said Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa. Ukrainian forces downed 103 out of the 118 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. A missile and 15 drones struck 10 different locations, according to the statement. Ukrainian troops have liberated the village of Mali Shcherbaky in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine's 24th Separate Assault Battalion "Aidar" announced on Oct. 12, releasing footage purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers in the settlement. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur breaks down renewed U.S. discussions about supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles — and Russia's reaction. In a renewed effort to disrupt Ukraine's energy grid ahead of winter, Russia carried out several large-scale missile and drone strikes on energy and gas facilities this week. Sources told the Financial Times that the U.S. is involved at every stage of operational planning, although Kyiv retains control over target selection, with Washington advising on target vulnerabilities. The Atesh partisan group sabotaged railway infrastructure in Russia's Rostov Oblast, disrupting Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on Oct. 12.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European leaders are ready for reckless actions because they don't believe that Russia may use nuclear weapons, Ukraine's former Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov told TASS. "Based on their possibilities - and they do have them, they want to ensure their superiority over Russia in terms of conventional arms and unleash a conflict. They make no secret of this and speak about 2027 or 2030 as the latest," he said. "They [European politicians] don't think that this is a reckless step. They think that Russia will never venture to use nuclear weapons. They really believe that Russia will not use its nuclear arms," he said, adding that "this is what their strategy of building up arsenals of conventional weapons is based on." According to Azarov, Europe needs to be reassured that "Russia has the right to deliver a preemptive strike defending itself or respond as it should in such a situation." He noted that changes in Europe are inevitable, with "more realistic politicians coming to power." In his words, politicians should not play believe-it-or-not games but make decisions based on realities. "And the realities are that Russia has nowhere to retreat: if the European Union attacks it, I think, the Russian leadership will use every opportunity to inflict a defeat on the one who attacked it," he underscored.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• The 20 hostages held in Gaza thought to be alive are expected to be released early Monday morning local time before being transferred to the Red Cross, an Israeli government spokesperson said today. Nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel will also be freed. • US President Donald Trump will depart for the Middle East today ahead of a speech at Israel's parliament on Monday and meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as the families of the hostages. Leaders from more than 20 countries will then join Trump in Egypt for a summit on Gaza's future. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have returned home to find only ruins as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas enters a third day. Palestinian Authority Vice President Hussein Al-Sheikh said on Sunday he met former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to discuss their future vision for Gaza. “I met today with Mr. Tony Blair to discuss the day after and ways to support President (Donald) Trump's efforts aimed at ending the war and establishing lasting peace in the region,” Al-Sheikh posted on X. Remember: Under the ceasefire agreement, Israel must free 250 Palestinian prisoners who hold life sentences, as well as 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza detained after October 7, 2023. As Israel prepares for the arrival of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, the country's hospitals are also making sure they are well-equipped to handle any medical needs that may arise once they arrive home. Dr Eli Sprecher, the CEO of Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital, showed CNN's Wolf Blitzer around his medical center today and said that his staff were “all very much looking forward to that truly historical moment.” Some 24 hostages who were previously freed from Gaza have been treated at the hospital, Sprecher said. Medical teams are preparing for the latest hostage release based off their past experience. The hostages could also face orthopedic problems from being kept underground in tunnels for so long, as well as psychological difficulties from two years of captivity, he added. Sprecher said that the hospital is trying to recreate a “home-like atmosphere” for those admitted tomorrow. Hospital rooms will have two beds in them so the hostages can sleep with a family member nearby and a playground has been set up for the hostages who have children, he said. US Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza will be released soon. Earlier, a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office, said hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees set to be released Monday will be driven into Gaza once the hostages held in the enclave cross back into Israel, He gave unusual authorities to people who had never been in diplomacy before, he actually broke the mold,” Vance said. He gave Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner a remarkable amount of authority to go and get a peace deal done.” “He is not planning to put boots on the ground in Gaza or Israel,” Vance said. Israel's Knesset committee chair has said today “we're all eagerly waiting” to thank Trump during tomorrow's visit “for everything he's done,” according to a spokesperson. On Sunday, the Knesset committee also approved a “special session” to honor Trump, which will take place tomorrow, the spokesperson said. Remember: Trump will then travel to Egypt, where he is due to co-chair a summit on Gaza alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. This means that at least 67,806 people have been killed in Gaza during the last two years of war, with 170,066 reported injuries, according to the health ministry. A spokesperson for Gaza's Civil Defense told CNN yesterday that approximately 10,000 Palestinians are believed to have been buried under rubble across Gaza since October 7, 2023. We heard earlier from a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office on how they expect Monday's final exchange of hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners and detainees to take place. Ruby Chen can only hope for a miracle. His 19-year-old son Itay Chen, a soldier with the Israel Defense Forces, was initially believed to have been taken hostage during the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel, but was later declared dead by the IDF. “It's like a suspended situation,” he told CNN's Becky Anderson earlier today, while speaking from Netanya, Israel. That leaves some sort of doubt that hopefully, even tomorrow, there might be some sort of surprise for us. “On one hand, excitement for those that will be able to hug their loved ones. Anticipation that finally this chapter of the people of Israel that began two years ago will finally come to an end,” he said. As thousands of displaced Palestinians make their way back north to Gaza City, many are returning to scenes beyond their imagination. Another Gaza City resident, Um Abdullah, showed CNN video of the destroyed nursery that her sister helped to build – and then ran for 20 years. Some grew up to become journalists, doctors; she raised many generations,” Um Abdullah said of her sister. The United Nations said in August that more than 90% of Gaza's schools have been either destroyed or severely damaged, with 518 out of 564 school buildings needing either full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again. Younis Ahmed Mahmoud, a resident of Gaza City's Al-Shati Camp, said he did not recognize his neighborhood. “I got lost in the street… I struggled to reach my house… it looked like an earthquake hit the area,” he said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) earlier this month estimated that around 900,000 of the city's 1 million residents had left, figures that CNN is unable to verify. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said last week that over 200,000 people had remained in Gaza City. “The Palestinian prisoners will be released once Israel has confirmation that all of our hostages set to be released tomorrow are (across) the border into Israel,” she adds. More now from Israel's Prime Minister's spokesperson, Shosh Bedrosian, who has just said if Hamas is unable to find the bodies of some of the hostages held in Gaza, an international committee will help locate them. Three Israeli sources told CNN earlier this week that Israel assesses the militant group may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza. “An international body, which was agreed on in this (ceasefire) plan, will help locate the hostages if they are not found and released tomorrow,” Bedrosian adds. “The Prime Minister (Benjamin Netanyahu) insists that we will act to locate all of these hostages as soon as possible, and we will do that as a sacred duty of communal responsibility,” she added. “All 48 of our hostages will be returning back to Israel, whether they are alive or deceased,” the spokesperson said. No Hamas propaganda will be displayed during the release of the hostages being held in Gaza tomorrow, Shosh Bedrosian now says. In previous hostage releases, Hamas has staged macabre ceremonies before transferring the people they kidnapped over to the Red Cross - both living and deceased. This time round, the 20 living hostages held in Gaza will be “released together at one time to the Red Cross and transported among six to eight vehicles without any sick displays by Hamas, the terror organization,” Bedrosian adds. The hostages who have been held in Gaza will be released early on Monday morning, a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office has just said. A regional diplomat familiar with the matter also told CNN that Iran had received a formal invitation to attend the summit. At least 20 countries are expected to attend the ceremony, the Egyptian Presidency said without clarifying which nations have been invited. Among the confirmed attendees are France, Britain, Jordan and Germany. Israel is waiting to receive the 48 remaining hostages held in Gaza, who are expected to be freed Monday morning, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they are “prepared and ready” for their imminent arrival home. We can bring you some footage now from Gaza City, obtained by the Reuters news agency. It shows markets bustling as crowds gathered today in the streets to browse stalls and buy essential goods. Another Palestinian resident, Ahmed Hamadeh, said safety and security had returned due to the ceasefire. “Despite the destruction and everything we went through, thank God once the truce was announced, life returned to normalcy,” he said. The ceasefire in Gaza agreed upon by Israel and Hamas has “given a spark of hope in the Holy Land,” Pope Leo XIV said today, speaking after a mass in St Peter's Square. “Two years of conflict have left death and rubble everywhere, especially in the hearts of those who have brutally lost their children, parents, friends, everything,” he said. Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza is being prepared to receive hundreds of prisoners and detainees that Israel is set to release early next week, the Palestinian health ministry says. “We are preparing Nasser Hospital to receive 1,900 detainees that the occupation will release tomorrow, in addition to receiving a large number of bodies,” the ministry's Director-General Dr. Munir Al-Bursh wrote on X. Most of the detainees due to be released are suffering from diseases and will require urgent medical attention, he said. Earlier this week, the Israeli justice ministry published the names of 250 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails and set for release as part of a ceasefire agreement that will first see Hamas free the remaining hostages it holds. Israel is also due to release around 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza, detained after the October 7 attacks. Al-Bursh also called on the international community to “open the crossings and bring in medical supplies and equipment” in his statement. Israel is “prepared and ready for the immediate reception of all our hostages,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has just said. Netanyahu spoke with Hostage and Missing Persons Coordinator Gal Hirsch today. Of those captured on October 7, 2023, 20 are presumed alive and 25 are believed to be dead, with the status of two others uncertain. There is one additional hostage whose body was held in Gaza before the October 7 attacks. He is an IDF soldier who was killed in 2014. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has released an itinerary ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the country tomorrow. This itinerary largely aligns with Trump's official schedule of the visit, which was released overnight. Trump will then travel to Egypt, where he is due to co-chair a summit on Gaza alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>María Corina Machado's Nobel award puts focus on country but analysts doubt it will produce democratic change Six and a half years later, on Friday Machado used almost identical words to celebrate winning the Nobel peace prize for her “extraordinary” – yet incomplete – struggle against Venezuela's “brutal, authoritarian state” under the president, Nicolás Maduro. For all Machado's relentless optimism, one question lingered after Friday's surprise announcement in Oslo: this time, was she right? Would receiving the prestigious prize advance Machado's tenacious campaign to unseat Maduro, or could it backfire and lead to greater repression from the autocrat's feared security forces? International supporters voiced confidence that political change was coming for a country that has slipped into authoritarianism and economic malfunction since Maduro succeeded Hugo Chávez in 2013, with about 8 million citizens fleeing abroad. This perfectly complements her quasi-religious public image,” Lizarralde said of Machado, a devout Catholic who before going into hiding after last year's rigged presidential election attended rallies clutching a rosary and wearing crosses around her neck. David Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela expert, said the prize would “definitely draw more international attention to the Venezuelan conflict and perhaps [create] more resolve” to end it. “But judging by past Nobel winners, it will not be fundamental,” Smilde added, noting how the 1994 prize shared by Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin did not fundamentally reconfigure the interests and forces involved in the Middle East conflict. Ronald Krebs, a political scientist who has studied the impact of Nobel peace prizes awarded in the hope of promoting political change in authoritarian countries, said his research showed they rarely succeeded. Krebs cited Liu Xiaobo, the Chinese poet and activist who received the prize in 2010 while in prison – a decision Beijing called an “anti-China farce”. Liu died seven years later, still in custody and with his homeland having become an even more repressive one-party state under its Communist party leader, Xi Jinping. “But it did absolutely nothing for those who were not similarly protected … if anything they were further repressed because of the Nobel peace prize,” he said. Krebs said peace prizes could inspire human rights defenders “to come forward with greater vigour”. “[But] at the same time it gives the repressive regime even more incentive to repress those who would seek to effect change. [So] it creates a really problematic and worrisome dynamic that … ultimately works to the detriment of those who are advocating for domestic political change … The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” Allies hope Machado's prize will “bulletproof” her against regime reprisals. Andrés Izarra, a former minister for Maduro's mentor Chávez, was also doubtful, although he said Venezuela's authoritarian president was facing the greatest challenge of his 12-year reign. Internationally isolated after being accused of stealing last year's election from Machado's ally Edmundo González, Maduro is also facing an unprecedented US pressure campaign that many suspect is aimed at forcing regime change. Since August, Donald Trump has ordered a major naval buildup off Venezuela's Caribbean coast, with a series of deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug smuggling boats. “There's never been a clearer chance of displacing [Maduro] from power than now,” Izarra said. “What you have in the Caribbean is a regime change operation … but it's a performative one,” he said, designed to coerce Maduro into making concessions during secret talks Izarra believes are happening between US and Venezuelan officials. “This is all going to resolve itself at the negotiating table,” Izarra predicted. Maduro and his allies were “never going to surrender power voluntarily” but equally Trump would never alienate his anti-intervention Maga movement by putting boots on the ground. “She's a true fighter,” said Lizarralde, predicting Machado would battle on.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hamas' internal security forces were pictured on the streets of Gaza City on Saturday, and there have been multiple reports of clashes between the group and clans opposing it in recent days. “A number of collaborators and informants were apprehended and arrested in Gaza City, after it was proven that they were involved in spying for the enemy,” as well as “participating in the assassination of several resistance members,” the Palestinian Home Front, a Telegram channel affiliated with Hamas, said Sunday. Other social media videos showed armed and masked Hamas personnel walking through a street market in Gaza City, and the Hamas-run interior ministry shared images of officers with rifles and baseball caps that read “police” in Gaza City interacting with locals. Hamas has long held an iron grip over Gaza that continued even into the war. CNN has reported on Hamas executing and maiming alleged looters, a sign of the group's continuing power despite being weakened by Israel. The Hamas-controlled interior ministry has declared a week-long amnesty to begin Monday for members of criminal gangs “not involved in bloodshed or killings.” Some of those groups have received protection from the Israeli military. Social media channels affiliated with Hamas reported clashes in the Sabra area of Gaza City between a prominent family and security forces during which Muhammad Imad Aql, the son of a senior Hamas military commander, was killed. Hamas forces surrounded the Dughmush family's neighborhood on Friday night. Sources told CNN that several members of the family had been killed, and a large number of masked, armed men had been deployed around the Jordanian hospital in Gaza City. CNN was told Sunday that clashes continued in the area. One of its commanders, Hussam al-Astal, posted on Facebook Saturday: “To all the Hamas rats, your tunnels are destroyed, your rights no longer exist. Repent before it's too late – there is no Hamas from today onward.” “They commit to psychological warfare… and they will use all their power to prove that there is no other option in the strip but them.” However, Popular Forces members are thought to have relocated behind what is known as the ‘yellow line' inside southern Gaza, where Israeli forces are still present. US President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan, published last week, says that “Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty.” In the complex reality of Gaza's current situation, such a force could take months or longer to establish, especially amid a humanitarian crisis and massive damage to buildings and other infrastructure. “Deployment (of the ISF) in the required numbers will have to occur over some time, and will be a major logistical challenge,” according to London-based think tank Chatham House. Casualties among Gaza's police force during the two-year conflict have contributed to a deterioration in security, with looting of aid becoming commonplace. But it's unclear when that force will begin to patrol the streets of Gaza, and whether Hamas' internal security forces will disappear when it does.</p>

Trump responded by taking a less confrontational approach without retreating from his demands, while his vice president seemed to warn Beijing not to react aggressively. “China's stance is consistent,” the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online. It was China's first official comment on Trump's threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products. “Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!” the Republican president wrote. “Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senior officials at the education and treasury departments have been engaged in internal conversations about offloading select, high-performing segments of the government's student debt holdings, according to a Politico report this week. These loans are part of the larger portfolio owed by roughly 45 million borrowers nationwide. Administration officials have also reportedly reached out to figures in the financial industry, including potential buyers, to discuss the idea. The deliberations, which began earlier this year, initially included “department of government efficiency” (Doge) officials stationed at the education department but are now being guided primarily by senior political appointees. Selling them off now, he said, would shift repayment and management responsibilities to private entities, raising questions about enforcement, oversight, and the continuity of borrower protections. “If you're talking about unilateral cancellation, like what president Biden had been talking about, the department would certainly lose all authority to tell a private company that they had to cancel a debt,” he said. “Now we know why President Trump and Secretary [Linda] McMahon are hell bent on squeezing every last dollar out of families with student debt,” Mike Pierce, executive director of Protect Borrowers, said in a statement. “This is all part of that same conversation, because the department manages this huge, billion plus dollar loan portfolio,” Zampini said. “You can't really wind down the department while still having responsibility for this type of loan portfolio. It's driven by their desire to wind down the department more broadly. Any attempt to sell off federal student loans would raise major legal and logistical questions. Borrowers could face uncertainty about whether current consumer protections, often more favorable than those offered in the private market, would remain intact. Zampini adds that the move would put borrower protections at particular risk “because there's really no precedent for this”. And if there is interest, their interest would likely be to squeeze as much profit from the repayment as they could,” she said. “And so the interest of a private purchaser and a private investor would very likely not be to provide borrowers with any type of generous benefits or relief programs.” During Trump's first term, the education department hired consulting firms to evaluate the student loan portfolio and estimate its potential sale value. “I don't think this is driven by an interest in helping borrowers,” Zampini said. “Certainly, I don't think it's driven by an interest in improving the program. And I also don't think it's driven by an actual interest in saving taxpayers money. I think it's driven mostly by a political interest.” The administration has already rolled back nearly all Biden-era policies that offered loan forgiveness or expanded repayment options. It has also resumed collecting defaulted loans for the first time since March 2020, when the pandemic prompted a nationwide pause. Still, it's not completely clear how feasible these plans are under the current legal system. The concerns are not just that current borrowers might be at risk of losing their protections, but that a student loan market controlled by private entities would increase the barriers to attend college. And so it's hard to see how someone looking to make a return on these loans, on this portfolio, would do anything but increase as much as they can the amount of payment and decrease the relief programs and the flexibilities that the federal government offers.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This country was founded on splitting the difference, creating a political culture that is proving to be remarkably resilient to extremism In Thanksgiving 2025, Canadians should be grateful that this country's political culture appears to have largely escaped the intense polarization that afflicts many of our allies and friends. In the United States and in parts of Europe, resentments that were once expressed through fringe elements are taking centre stage. Far-right political movements are no longer very far away at all. The long Canadian tradition of muddling through conflicts and concerns has thus far kept our politics relatively civil – a blessing in these troubled times. Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have more than simply dampened growth. They threaten the future of our trading relationship with the United States, which for decades has been fundamental to this country's economy. Prime Minister Mark Carney meets with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House.Evan Vucci/The Associated Press It remains far too difficult for people, goods and services to move freely across the country, within a uniform regulatory environment. Our national security is threatened, not only by Russian and Chinese ambition in the Arctic, but by our own miserable record of underinvestment in defence. And regional resentments threaten national unity, while younger generations who struggle to find secure jobs and homes that they can afford look with resentment toward the we're-all-right-Jack complacency of the older and better-off. And yet these problems pale in comparison to those of some other democracies. For good measure, he has accused former president Barack Obama of treason. Barring a huge political reversal, he is likely to become prime minister after the next general election. French President Emmanuel Macron reappointed Sébastien Lecornu (pictured) as Prime Minister, just five days after Mr. Lecornu resigned from the post.Stephanie Lecocq/The Associated Press France has had five prime ministers in less than two years, as opposition politicians, labour groups and the general public resist the efforts of President Emmanuel Macron and his allies to rein in the country's spiralling debt through reduced spending and entitlements. Globalized capitalism has left many people feeling that the very wealthy and other privileged elites use government to promote their own interests, leaving the common folk dispossessed. In many cases, resentment flows not only toward those elites, but toward immigrants, who are seen as a threat to the traditional national culture. Canadians are in no way immune to the stresses that account for the rise of populist, right-wing, anti-immigrant parties in other countries. The populist, immigration-unfriendly People's Party of Canada, led by former Conservative cabinet minister Maxime Bernier, received 0.7 per cent of the vote in last April's federal election. Polls show that, in recent years, a majority Canadians have come to believe that too many immigrants are entering Canada, but this shift in attitude largely appears to stem from objections to the utter mismanagement of the immigration system by the Trudeau-era Liberal government, which allowed a flood of temporary foreign workers and international students into the country, rather than from nativist resentment of immigrants. Partly that's because four in 10 Canadians are themselves either immigrants or the children of at least one immigrant, according to the 2021 census. No major political party could have any hope of forming a national government while stoking nativist resentment. That's because, for more than two centuries, French and English have co-existed within what was once called British North America. In Europe, the French and English had been at war with each other as often as not for hundreds of years. How could the two cultures possibly inhabit a single political space? Separatist sentiment in Quebec led to two referendums on sovereignty. Alberta could one day hold a sovereignty referendum of its own. But whatever the strains and stresses, the very forces that have prevented Canada from gelling into a nation state have also contributed to the broad attitude of tolerance and accommodation that continue to define this country. But whatever awaits us, we will face it with less distrust of each toward the other than troubles some other countries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. has been assisting Ukraine in conducting strikes on Russian energy sites for several months, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 12, citing unnamed Ukrainian and American officials. Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil facilities intensified significantly this summer, disrupting operations and worsening a nationwide fuel shortage. American support reportedly extends to helping plan the flight routes, timing, altitude and tactics of Ukrainian drones, allowing them to evade Russian air defense systems. Sources told FT that the U.S. is involved at every stage of operational planning, although Kyiv retains control over target selection, with Washington advising on target vulnerabilities. Ukrainian drones have struck at least 16 of Russia's 38 oil refineries since August 2025, according to the Financial Times, driving diesel exports to their lowest levels since 2020. Kyiv has urged Western partners to tighten sanctions on Russia's energy sector, arguing that cutting Moscow's oil revenues would further undermine its capacity to finance the war against Ukraine. In late September, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that U.S. President Donald Trump backed Ukraine's strikes on Russian energy facilities, as Moscow resumed attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and continued hitting civilian areas. Several media outlets reported in July that Trump asked Zelensky a month earlier whether Kyiv could strike Moscow or St. Petersburg if provided with long-range U.S. weapons. Kateryna Denisova is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent, covering Ukrainian domestic politics and social issues. Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. She was also a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany. The two leaders discussed air defense support and long-range strikes, as Russia ramps up its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. "Not only is this an attempted theft of a peaceful Ukrainian nuclear facility. A second vessel of the same class is expected to be delivered by the end of 2025, with crew training already underway, said Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa. A missile and 15 drones struck 10 different locations, according to the statement. Ukrainian troops have liberated the village of Mali Shcherbaky in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine's 24th Separate Assault Battalion "Aidar" announced on Oct. 12, releasing footage purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers in the settlement. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur breaks down renewed U.S. discussions about supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles — and Russia's reaction. In a renewed effort to disrupt Ukraine's energy grid ahead of winter, Russia carried out several large-scale missile and drone strikes on energy and gas facilities this week. Sources told the Financial Times that the U.S. is involved at every stage of operational planning, although Kyiv retains control over target selection, with Washington advising on target vulnerabilities.</p>

MOSCOW, October 12. /TASS/. Current authorities of Moldova makes a serious mistake by making Russia its antagonist for the sake of building up their relations with Europe, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told TASS, commenting on the new military strategy adopted by Chisinau this week, where Russia is called the threat.

"This is the continuation of rather confrontational line in respect of our country, the unfriendly line. From our point of view, current leaders of Moldova make a serious mistake," Peskov noted.

"They believe the line of building up relations with Europe implies full antagonization of Russia. One country has already made such a mistake. It did not bring any good to this one country," he stressed.

On October 8, the new military strategy of Moldova by 2035 was approved at the meeting of the government, according to which Russia is the main security threat for Moldova.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since it was last updated at the end of September, 2,485 additional Russian military personnel have been confirmed killed. The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, memorial community tree-plantings, regional media reports, statements from local authorities, among other sources. In August, Mediazona, in collaboration with independent Russian outlet Meduza, released a report estimating that an estimated 220,000 Russians have been killed in the country's war against Ukraine — although that number has grown since. Moscow and Kyiv rarely officially report their losses. Ukraine estimates that Russia's overall casualties during the full-scale war have surpassed 1 million. In a briefing to reporters on Aug. 12, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Russian losses are approximately three times greater than that of Ukraine, without specifying the total number of losses suffered. Despite the heavy losses, Russia has been able to make advances in Donetsk Oblast in Ukraine's east as it is able to offset its casualties through fresh contract soldiers. In turn, Kyiv faces increasingly serious manpower shortages, particularly among infantry units holding the front line. As of Oct. 11, Ukraine's General Staff estimates that Russia has lost 1,121,570 troops in Ukraine since the start of the war on Feb. 24, 2022. The numbers are largely in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies. Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent. The two leaders discussed air defense support and long-range strikes, as Russia ramps up its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. "Not only is this an attempted theft of a peaceful Ukrainian nuclear facility. A second vessel of the same class is expected to be delivered by the end of 2025, with crew training already underway, said Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa. Ukrainian forces downed 103 out of the 118 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. A missile and 15 drones struck 10 different locations, according to the statement. Ukrainian troops have liberated the village of Mali Shcherbaky in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine's 24th Separate Assault Battalion "Aidar" announced on Oct. 12, releasing footage purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers in the settlement. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur breaks down renewed U.S. discussions about supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles — and Russia's reaction. In a renewed effort to disrupt Ukraine's energy grid ahead of winter, Russia carried out several large-scale missile and drone strikes on energy and gas facilities this week. Sources told the Financial Times that the U.S. is involved at every stage of operational planning, although Kyiv retains control over target selection, with Washington advising on target vulnerabilities. The Atesh partisan group sabotaged railway infrastructure in Russia's Rostov Oblast, disrupting Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on Oct. 12. An estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Cuban fighters are actively participating in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported Oct. 5, citing an internal U.S. State Department cable obtained by the outlet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dozens of fighters were killed in overnight border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, both sides said on Sunday, in the most serious fighting between the neighbours since the Taliban came to power in Kabul. The Taliban said nine on its side were killed. Tensions have risen after Islamabad demanded the Taliban take action against militants who have stepped up attacks in Pakistan, saying they operate from havens in Afghanistan. The Taliban, which came to power in 2021, denies that Pakistani militants are present on its soil. Pakistan said it had killed more than 200 Afghan Taliban and allied fighters, while Afghanistan said that it had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers. Reuters was not able to independently verify the figures. On Thursday, Pakistan carried out airstrikes in Kabul and on a marketplace in eastern Afghanistan, according to Pakistani security officials and the Taliban, setting off retaliatory attacks by the Taliban. Pakistan said that it had responded with gun and artillery fire. Both nations claimed to have destroyed border posts of the other side. Pakistani security officials shared video footage, which they said showed Afghan posts being hit. A two-day internet blackout shows even the Taliban can't turn back time The exchanges were mostly over on Sunday morning, Pakistani security officials said. But in Pakistan's Kurram area, intermittent gunfire continued, according to local officials and residents. Kabul said on Sunday that it had halted attacks at the request of Qatar and Saudi Arabia. “There is no kind of threat in any part of Afghanistan's territory,” the Taliban administration's spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said Sunday. Mujahid said that fighting was ongoing in some areas. The Pakistani airstrikes coincided with a rare visit to India by a Taliban leader, Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, which resulted in an announcement by India on Friday to upgrade relations. India is Pakistan's longstanding adversary, with the trip causing concern in Islamabad.</p>
