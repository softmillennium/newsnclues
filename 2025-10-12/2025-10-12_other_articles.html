Te Kunenga ki Pūrehuroa – Massey University provides funding as a member of The Conversation AU. A lot of research has been dedicated to understanding what makes people believe in conspiracies – and how they might be able to climb out of the rabbit hole again. But some people believe conspiracy theories that are contrary to evidence. Recent research found 8.9% of New Zealand participants and 10.1% of Australian participants agreed with the (false) claim fluoride is being intentionally added to the water supply by the government to make people less intelligent and easier to control". One prominent theory is that conspiracy beliefs are linked to psychological distress such as anxiety and depression. Our new research explores the causal relationship – whether psychological distress actually makes people more likely to believe in conspiracy theories. We found very limited evidence for a link between elevated distress and conspiracy beliefs. The existential threat model of conspiracy theories suggests experiences of psychological distress can make people more likely to develop conspiracy beliefs because they search for explanations for distressing events. The model also suggests this belief is exacerbated when a despised outgroup (political elites, for example) becomes salient as people try to make sense of their experience. While substantial evidence for a correlation between psychological distress and belief in conspiracy theories has been established, correlation does not imply a causal link. Some analyses of longitudinal data haven't found evidence to support the hypothesis. We set out to do this using a longitudinal survey. Our sample consisted of 995 participants with representatives groups from New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom. These boiled down to the ideas that increased distress of different types (anxiety, depression, stress) will subsequently increase belief in conspiracy theories and that such beliefs will subsequently increase distress. We found very limited evidence for elevated distress subsequently increasing belief in conspiracy theories. We also found no evidence to support the converse – that belief in conspiracy theories increases distress. Our findings suggest beliefs in conspiracy theories may mostly reflect a relatively stable worldview rather than being driven by temporary changes in distress. We also found no evidence that conspiracy beliefs cause short-term distress. This challenges the common assumption that beliefs in conspiracy theories inherently cause harm to one's mental health, particularly stress, anxiety and depression. That said, conspiracy beliefs could still cause harm in other ways – such as by contributing to the flow of misinformation. It appears distress may not have a key role in making people “spiral” down the rabbit hole. Interventions that foster an analytical mindset or include critical thinking skills may be more useful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ed and Lorraine Warren's grandson thinks people are being flippant with some of his grandparents' most notorious artifacts. There, hosts Maria Elizabeth Darnell and David Clair-Bennett asked about his reaction to comedian Matt Rife revealing he “officially purchased” the Warren home and museum, which included the famed paranormal investigators' “entire haunted collection" along with the infamous Annabelle doll. "I'd never even heard of him until he bought it. I didn't know who he was," McKinnell began. The 61-year-old noted that he "was far more concerned" that his "mother's husband," Tony Spera, was "allowing" paranormal objects, such as the doll, "out on tour." Together, Judy and Tony run the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), which was founded by the Warrens, and often hold paranormal conventions. McKinnell called Tony "an entertainer," adding that a character playing his stepfather is going to be in the next Conjuring movie. "But then he started wanting to bring this thing on tour, and that to me was so dangerous, such a betrayal of everything my grandparents spent their lives doing." McKinnell condemned what he saw as attempts to commodify the Warrens' legacy, pointing out that some people getting involved in the paranormal space might not understand what they're getting into. The Conjuring films turned the Warrens' home and basement museum, called the Warrens' Occult Museum, into a tourist attraction, but given its location in a residential neighborhood, it was closed for good in 2019. "It was always by special invitation, one or two people, very small groups with specific instructions — don't touch anything, don't treat anything with disrespect, do not try to communicate with anything," he said of his grandparents' home. They're trying to communicate with these things," McKinnell claimed. To me, that place is the Chernobyl of the paranormal and it bothers me to no end what can happen." On Aug. 1, Rife announced on TikTok that, along with his friend, YouTube creator Elton Castee, he had “officially purchased” the Warren Occult Museum. “I know a lot of you guys don't know [what] any of this means whatsoever, but if you follow ghost stuff, this is about as big as it gets.” But they don't have permanent ownership, he clarified. A rep for Rife confirmed the purchase as “legit” in a statement to PEOPLE in early August, while reps for the museum and Tony did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK – Nicholas Sparks is telling me a ghost story. It's not the conversation I thought I'd have with the bestselling author of romantic stories that make you swoon, not scared. But it's quiet enough to hear a pin drop in USA TODAY's New York studios as he relays the tale, elements of which he used in “Remain,” his new novel and upcoming movie adaptation developed with filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan. “Remain” is a supernatural love story set on Cape Cod, following New York architect Tate Donovan (Jake Gyllenhaal will portray in the movie), who hopes to make a fresh start after a psychiatric facility stay. He's saddled with grief after losing his sister, who told him on her deathbed she could see spirits “still tethered to the living world.” That, plus meeting a beautiful woman (Phoebe Dynevor) at the bed and breakfast he's living at, challenges everything he thought he knew. Mills, who is Native American and has a substantial Indigenous artifacts collection in his home, had recently been gifted an eagle bone whistle, Sparks says. It wasn't too long before Sparks started noticing fluttering light from the corner of his eye. Then, at night, his wife woke up to the sound of drums. “They're like, ‘Oh, you mean George?” Sparks says. Eventually they realized all these things came with the arrival of this whistle.” But even outside of his own experiences, Sparks has been a longtime scare junky. He loves Stephen King and his dad was a “big horror movie nut.” Working with Shyamalan was an opportunity to lean into that. It isn't Sparks' first time working on a manuscript and screenplay simultaneously – he had to write the screenplay for “The Last Song” before the novel because of Miley Cyrus' schedule, he says. What was different with “Remain” was that Shyamalan approached him with the original idea and the pair fleshed it out together. “Jake is a terrific, professional actor,” Sparks says. He takes good direction from (Shyamalan), and at the same time brings his own element in, and it is really a lot of fun to watch it work.” Having sold over 130 million copies worldwide, Sparks is known for so many beloved stories – “The Notebook,” “Dear John,” “A Walk to Remember” – that “Nicholas Sparks” has nearly become a subgenre of romance literature itself. Over the decades, each love story still feels meaningful. But Sparks doesn't necessarily agree with the sentiment that asking an author to pick a favorite book is like asking them to pick a favorite kid: "They're like irritating kids. You gave me a lot of heck when I was working on you," Sparks says, faking a conversation with his bestsellers. The movie adaptations also take on a life of their own. “The Notebook” musical is now touring after months of making Broadway goers weep into show-branded tissues in New York. I want to write where the good stuff comes from. And the beautiful part about that genre is, because it's an emotion that everyone experiences in some way in their lives, you're allowed to add elements of other genres into it to make it original.” Clare Mulroy is USA TODAY's Books Reporter, where she covers buzzy releases, chats with authors and dives into the culture of reading.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Self-proclaimed psychic Uri Geller has warned US President Donald Trump ahead of his trip to the Middle East, suggesting that his own security personnel could pose a danger. The Israeli-British illusionist referenced the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who, Geller said, was killed by "one of his own" during a parade. The attack was reportedly carried out by a group of Egyptian soldiers led by Lieutenant Khalid Al-Islambuli, affiliated with the terrorist group Egyptian Islamic Jihad. "Listen to me, Donald Trump," he wrote on X, "Do NOT go to Sharm el-Sheikh, I have a TERRIBLE feeling there might be an attempt on your life! This is a GOLDEN opportunity for Islamic terrorists - you are the biggest prize in the WORLD for them! Remember Sadat was killed by one of his own security forces. Do not move ANYWHERE without a ring of steel." Listen to me @realDonaldTrump - do NOT go to Sharm el-Sheikh, I have a TERRIBLE feeling there might be an attempt on your life! In a video, Geller said, "I'm just very concerned. Very concerned...I say, don't go there. Don't let anyone close to you, and be careful. Be very careful, especially in Sharam and Shek." Uri Geller's credibility as a psychic has long been questioned, and many of his previous predictions have failed to materialise. During his 1973 appearance on The Tonight Show, host Johnny Carson, a former magician, provided untouched props, and Geller failed to demonstrate any psychic powers, as per The NYT. Famous for allegedly bending spoons with his mind, Geller's feats have been repeatedly explained by magicians and sceptics as sleight of hand. He has described himself as a "mystifier" and "showman." He has also incorrectly predicted football match outcomes and claimed in 2021 he could free the Ever Given from the Suez Canal, which was ultimately dislodged by tugboats. Donald Trump will visit the Middle East starting with a brief stop in Israel on Monday, October 13. During his four-hour stay, he will address the Knesset and meet families of Israeli hostages recently released under a ceasefire agreement.</p>

Jesse Plemons has revealed how he researched the world of conspiracy theories for his role as Teddy in Bugonia. 

Speaking on the red carpet at the London Film Festival on Friday (10 October), the actor, who plays a conspiracist beekeeper who kidnaps Emma Stone's character as he believes she is an alien trying to take down the world, said it doesn't take “too much digging” and that there is a “lot right at your fingertips”.

He also shared that one of his best friends is an “alien aficionado who knows every theory out there”, so they became his “guide”.

Plemons said his research helped his mind work in a “completely different way” and allowed him to view the characters in the film in a more sympathetic light. “The reality is that people are lured into these places,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 Women's Ironman World Championship turned from a test of endurance into a battle of attrition that ultimately went to rookie Solveig Løvseth of Norway – competing for the first time in Kailua-Kona and ending up the last woman standing at the end of a brutal day, which claimed more than one prominent victim. Løvseth captured the title in her first-ever attempt, defeating Kat Matthews of Great Britain by just 35 seconds in the third-closest world championship finish in the sport's history – men or women. “It still feels weird,” Løvseth said during the post-race press conference, noting that she hadn't stopped smiling since crossing the finish line roughly three hours before. That was because two competitors who were swimming, cycling and running ahead of her for most of the day succumbed to the rigorous conditions on Hawai‘i Island and failed to complete the full course. However, an unintentional littering infraction cost her a one-minute penalty, during which American Taylor Knibb grabbed the advantage. But signs of potential overexertion began to show roughly halfway through the run, as Charles-Barclay took to walking through multiple aid stations and appeared unstable on her feet. At that point, Knibb had retaken first place and built a lead of over two minutes. But with approximately two miles to go, she also slowed down, eventually stopped and took a seat on the asphalt — her day over, as she was unable to continue. And obviously, it's heartbreaking to see someone collapse that way,” Løvseth said. “When I also saw Taylor stop running in front of me, I was just like, ‘What is going on now? Is it me that just, like, has some powers now? “It was like not the way I wanted to overtake people,” she continued. But Løvseth's advantage wasn't safe, despite how long she spent running alone on the marathon course — no one close on her heels and the island claiming the two competitors in front of her one by one. “It was maybe at sort of six or seven [kilometers], [my race adviser] was like, ‘You're gonna finish about 90 seconds behind Solveig, if you could try a bit harder,'” Matthews said during the press conference to a chorus of laughs. And she found an even stronger pace as the finish line approached, and victory appeared potentially within reach. “The last two-kilometer pace probably suggested I had more to give,” Matthews said, “but I definitely feel that was my best triathlon performance I could give today.” Løvseth admitted after the race that if there were but a few more kilometers to run, Matthews likely would have caught her. Instead, Matthews finished in second place at an Ironman World Championship for the third time in her storied career. Given how close Matthews came to catching Løvseth, and how the elements brought down Charles-Barclay and Knibb in front of the eventual winner, the 2025 Women's Ironman World Champion could sum up the day with only one word: “supernatural.”</p>
