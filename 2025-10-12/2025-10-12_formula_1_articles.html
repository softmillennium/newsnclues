                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ella Lloyd reflects on her season so far in F1 Academy While Formula 1 drivers are celebrated for their talents on track, many have surprising skills away from the cockpit. There is no doubt that the current crop of Formula 1 drivers are bursting with talent on track, but did you know the world's best racers have plenty of off track tricks up their sleeves too? From concert pianos to DJ decks, judo mats to magic tricks, and even a host of musicians, the 2025 grid hides a wealth of unexpected skills that fans might not ever see. In an interview with Talking Bull (Red Bull Racing's official podcast), Tsunoda was proud to reveal some hidden lore – that he has a noticeably sharp sense of smell – something his team often teases him about. It's easy to see how that ties into his passion for cooking, where he relies on aroma as an element of taste. Maybe it's that sharp nose that makes him such a good cook – or perhaps he just likes knowing what everyone's having for lunch. It's no secret that seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton is a man with many talents. But music has always held a special place in his life. The Brit has spent years exploring singing, songwriting, and production, even contributing uncredited vocals to Christina Aguilera's track “Pipe” under the alias XNDA. Timing, emotion, and flow matter just as much in a song as they do on the track, making it easy to see why he's drawn to both worlds. With his father being a quantum physicist, Isack Hadjar has admitted in interviews he might have followed a similar path if racing hadn't taken off – even saying he “would have ended up studying physics or engineering” instead. Alongside this, the French-Algerian driver developed the sense of calm and physical focus needed for driving that was shaped by years of judo training. Together, they make him one of the most talented rookies on the grid, having already achieved his first podium in Zandvoort this year. Carlos Sainz has always been serious about a variety of sports, but he has a niche skill away from the sporting arena – predicting the weather... During a media activity with ex-McLaren team mate Lando Norris, the Spaniard claimed he has been known as the ‘Shepherd' due to his ability to predict weather changes. This unusual skill could likely be attributed to his extensive outdoor activities such as racing, cycling, and plenty of golf. And while it may be a light-hearted claim, you can imagine how that intuition might just come in handy on a race weekend. Liam Lawson has a deep connection with music that goes beyond casual listening or having assembled the perfect race weekend playlist. The Kiwi plays guitar, sings, and has even been known to cover acoustic hits in the studio, having shared clips online well before he reached F1. In interviews, Lawson has revealed that music is a way to focus and recharge, a hobby that balances the intensity of racing. The two-time World Champion has long enjoyed performing card tricks and sleight-of-hand illusions, where he's often kept teammates and crew entertained in the paddock. He's been filmed amazing people with tricks during his stint in endurance racing, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans, where even drivers were gobsmacked by some of his tricks. However, we'd argue that it's not just the cards, as we're sure there have been countless times during his 24 years in F1 where his competitors were left thinking El Nano had a little magic in him. Lando has made plenty of appearances behind the decks of Zedd and Martin Garrix at festivals and performances, perhaps picking up a few skills from the pro DJ's themselves.</p>
