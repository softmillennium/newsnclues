Instead of turning to travel sites, we let AI take the lead. So, I thought, why not travel planning, too? ChatGPT has always been my top choice, but my partner wanted to see what Claude—the one she likes the most—would plan for our Italian holiday. We wanted to see which AI bot planned the best trip. But through this friendly competition, we learned just how differently my partner and I like to travel. Of course, there were overlaps, but they each produced different trips. ChatGPT, for example, came back with what felt like a movie script. Tunis started with a sunrise walk through Sidi Bou Saïd, pastries and mint tea in hand, followed by a whirlwind through the Medina and a dramatic half-day at the ruins of Carthage. Then, in Tozeur, it pulled the cinematic card with "Star Wars" filming sets in the desert, and camel rides across dunes at sunset. Hammamet, meanwhile, was framed as a finale of seaside lounging, alternating between couscous feasts and beach walks. It was ambitious, colorful, and a little chaotic — but also thrilling. In Tozeur, it skipped the desert dash altogether, focusing instead on the Medina and a relaxed afternoon by an oasis. It also added two important cultural pit stops we hadn't considered. Of course, we then needed to build our own itinerary, taking activities recommended by both lists. "The Star Wars" sets were out of reach, proof that no itinerary can control nature. Still, other parts of ChatGPT's plan delivered — like Sidi Bou Saïd, where whitewashed walls and cobalt-blue shutters glowed in the sun as we sipped mint tea above the sea. Claude's food tour in Tunis was a big highlight. Claude also surprised us with two inspired detours: the Great Mosque of Kairouan and El Jem amphitheater. Both were extraordinary stops, layered with history and stillness. As the trip unfolded, it became clear we were not just comparing AI bots. We were surprised to see our own travel personalities reflected back at us. ChatGPT's energy mirrored mine: scattershot but adventurous, willing to gamble on exhaustion for the sake of a memory. Claude's calm matched my partner: thoughtful, practical, deliberate. If we are scoring, ChatGPT delivered the better memories. What they gave us was a way of traveling that reflected us back at ourselves — two personalities and two rhythms woven into one trip.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors are looking beyond the prolonged U.S. government shutdown and remain optimistic about growth drivers like the artificial intelligence boom and expectations of further interest rate cuts. Ignoring the short-term noise, those looking for attractive investment opportunities can consider the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts, whose recommendations are based on a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals and growth catalysts. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. First on this week's list is Snowflake (SNOW), a cloud-native data platform. At the recently held Snowflake World Tour event in New York City, the company highlighted its product innovation and the vision for driving business transformation through data and artificial intelligence. After attending this customer conference, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated a buy rating on SNOW stock with a price forecast of $270. Based on his conversations with customers and partners at the event, the analyst noted that Snowflake's product innovation and velocity are accelerating. For instance, the top-rated analyst noted that a retailer using Snowpark ML for demand forecasting, and a travel company integrating Snowflake ML models into its customer experience pipeline, both believe that broader usage across their organizations will take a few more quarters. Another key takeaway was that Snowflake's unstructured data capabilities have strengthened, but there are still some gaps to address. Overall, Thill believes that while traction is building for Snowflake, the "AI Blizzard" still lies ahead. "SNOW remains one of our favorite data & AI stories and stands to benefit meaningfully as enterprise AI strategies mature and AI driven data volumes grow exponentially in the coming years," concluded Thill. 251 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Moving on to chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which recently made headlines after announcing a game-changing partnership with OpenAI. Under this deal, OpenAI will deploy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs over multiple years, starting with a 1-gigawatt rollout in the second half of 2026. The agreement also involves a warrant for up to 160 million shares (vesting tied to certain milestones), which, if fully exercised by OpenAI, will give it about a 10% stake in AMD. Following the news, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis upgraded AMD stock to buy from hold and boosted the price target to $300 from $170. Additionally, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on AMD stock with a price target of $232. While the chipmaker will still have to achieve some milestones, the 5-star analyst believes that this partnership is a solid confirmation of AMD's AI roadmap and a proof of robust AI demand in general. Interestingly, Curtis recently raised his estimates for AMD following positive server checks. The analyst stated he was incrementally positive on AMD after his recent Asia trip, with the expectation of 500 basis points per year share gains in server CPUs with the company's Venice platform. However, these recent checks hadn't helped Curtis grasp anything from the original device manufacturers (ODMs) in terms of AI ramps. "The announcement of OpenAI as a lead customer with the potential for $80-100B in revenue across 6GW of compute through 2030 materially changes that outlook," said Curtis. 68 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. IT infrastructure and personal computing solutions provider Dell Technologies (DELL) announced an increase in its long-term financial targets during its analyst meeting on Oct. 7. Following the event, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a buy rating on DELL stock and raised his price target to $170 from $160. Rakesh noted management's commentary about momentum in enterprise and sovereign AI, with strong demand signals over 12-18 months. Furthermore, Rakesh noted that Dell's fiscal 2026 AI server revenue estimate of $20 billion is in line with the Street's consensus of $20.6 billion and reflects over 100% growth from $9.8 billion in the previous year. The company expects a 20% to 25% CAGR through Fiscal 2030, implying AI server revenue of $46 billion. However, the analyst believes that this growth outlook could be conservative, as the company is involved in all at-scale AI cluster deployments and leads in T2 CSP (tier 2 cloud service providers) and enterprise AI deployments with more than 3,000 customers. 81 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Department stores may be falling out of favor with today's younger consumers, but there's a reason older shoppers keep coming back. Whether it's more generous return policies, promotional events or deep discounts, "if you can learn the benefits of what a store brings you, it creates a much greater experience," said Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor for market research firm Circana. For example, if a sales associate doesn't have an item you want in stock, often they'll get it and ship it to you at no cost, Cohen said — "that's a big perk." And yet, for younger shoppers, the mentality is "I don't want to shop where my mother shops," he said. To be sure, at Macy's and its subsidiary Bloomingdale's, for example, the majority of customers are above the age of 45, according to new Consumer Edge data. Baby boomers are also much more likely to say in-store shopping is their most common way of making purchases, compared with Generation Z, or those born between 1997 and 2012, according to a Capital One report from March. "The challenge for department stores is to break that paradigm." It's a trend he refers to as "the tiktokification of retail." But while shopping primarily online may seem quick and convenient, it does come with extra hassles. It can mean relying on a practice known as "bracketing," or ordering multiple products in different sizes or colors with the intention of keeping a few and returning the rest — adding more time and cost to each transaction. As online retailers try to keep those returns in check, most have rolled out stricter policies, including charging a return or restocking fee, according to a 2023 report from return management company Happy Returns. But even now, some department stores have held on to the more generous policies of yesteryear, with longer return windows or free shipping, and that has gone a long way when it comes to building brand loyalty. Although Bloomingdale's shortened its return window to 30 days from 90 days last year, shoppers appreciate the other perks, according to Nancy Quinn, a personal stylist at the flagship store in New York City. Quinn meets her clients, who are mostly women between the ages of 45 and 70, by appointment to help them find clothing for everyday or special occasions. At times, she has even hand-delivered an item — also as a complimentary service — if the customer is local and under a time constraint. At many high-end department stores, personal stylists work on commission and the assistance they provide is free for customers. Quinn's appointments book up especially quickly when Bloomingdale's runs promotional events, such as "friends and family," which is typically a 25% discount across many brands. Still, Quinn says younger customers are less likely to shop with her. Alternatively, "the women I am meeting are really ready to make an investment in themselves and their wardrobe." To be sure, U.S. department stores have been in a slump for years. Retailers like JCPenney and Macy's have struggled to compete against online retailers and smaller brick-and-mortar stores that can better adapt to changing consumer preferences. Last year, Macy's said it would close some of its namesake stores and open more Bloomingdale's locations. According to the company's quarterly report, Bloomingdale's performed better because of its focus on the luxury brands that appeal to higher-income shoppers. "Selective higher-end stores" are outpacing the competition, in part because "middle- and lower-income consumers have been disproportionately negatively impacted by the rising cost of necessities," said TD Cowen's Chen. In an interview last month, Macy's CEO Tony Spring told CNBC that the consumer remains resilient and continues to spend on new items and fashion, despite concerns about tariffs. The challenge for department stores is to bring shoppers in, even as managing inventory and pricing gets increasingly difficult, Chen said. "It is ironic because everybody does love stores and humans want connection." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Ron Podmore, 58, a retired teacher who decided to live out his retirement in Guatemala. He still owns property in Washington and spends about half the year there as he begins the Guatemala residency process. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. But because of the fact that I was not eligible for social security, I was only able to receive half of my pension. I knew that if I was going to pull the plug, so to speak, and retire early, there was a huge gap. There is no way in heck I wanted to be teaching up until I was 65 and then immediately go on social security. It worked out favorably for me over the last 20 or 25 years. Around 2013, I noticed an influx of migrant students coming into my classroom from Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador, and I got to know some of these kids. I was led to believe that Guatemala is this country with endemic poverty, crime, corruption, cartels — who on earth would want to go down there? And these kids really said, "You need to rethink that." Then I ended up going down there once or twice a year. In 2018, I purchased a small condominium in the working-class area of Guatemala City, knowing that if I needed to, I could migrate out of the United States and be able to live down there. My goal was to have it all paid off by the time I retired. I was making payments on it every month, and then I also expedited that by making extra payments on the principal, and I was able to pay it off within eight years. In order to do that, I took out a HELOC loan against the value of the house that I have in Federal Way, which is a suburb just south of Seattle. When you purchase property, in most places around the world, it's all cash. You cannot go to the bank of that country and ask for a loan. You have to take care of your financing with whatever bank you have in the United States or your home country. The property that I purchased down there is a two-bedroom, one-bath with underground parking, concierge services, security, et cetera, and that was for about $125,000. At the time, I was living in Washington State, and you have to factor in airplane tickets to get down there, and how much money you're going to spend on not only purchasing these items, but also having them delivered and being there and so forth. I started being down there full-time in August 2024. That's about a three- to five-year long process. I would be getting a visa that would allow me to live in Guatemala for extended periods of time — greater than six months. I have a private health insurance plan in Guatemala that runs me about $315 a month; no deductibles and no copay. And there is such a contrast for superior services: they have better bedside manners in Central America. You're not surrounded by a certified nursing assistant or an intake specialist or a finance and operations person determining how are you going to make these payments and everything. Glasses, optometry, and dental I am not insured on. So each time I went to get my teeth cleaned in the States, it was slightly over $200 for my portion of the bill. If you think about the concept of snowbirds, at least out here on the West Coast, we have a huge influx of people in their fifties who decide to retire early and they immediately relocate to Southern California, Southern Arizona, Southern New Mexico, in border towns all along the Texas border, so they can have immediate access — to drive to the border or walk across the border — to purchase their prescriptions, get their teeth done, get their X-rays done, or go into the local hospital. If there is an emergency, they're going to run over to that border before they dial 911 in the United States. I've just taken that concept one extra country over, which is the next country after Mexico, and that's Guatemala.</p>

AWS senior vice president of applied AI solutions Colleen Aubrey has spent over 20 years at Amazon, building its advertising business from the ground up. She's also a member of the company's elite S-Team. That "constant change" is the reason she's stayed at Amazon for as long as she has, and remains engaged in her work. For anyone questioning whether they're in the right role or ready for a new challenge, Aubrey said there are typically three boxes to check off. "Are you in a place which ticks those boxes? And if you aren't, then maybe it's worth looking at changing the mix, in order to get that," Aubrey said. "Because I think when you have those elements, then work is invigorating." Aubrey said that people generally need their leaders to help with the things only they can provide: resourcing, hard decisions, trade-offs, judgment calls, prioritization, advocacy, and big-picture thinking. Sometimes, people end up with a manager who isn't the right match, even if that person is trying their best. "You can choose to live through it and be dissatisfied. The right team includes people you're really learning from, she said. Amazon's infamous "two-pizza teams" describes the ideal team to promote innovation. The idea is that no team should be big enough that it would take more than two pizzas to feed them. The ideal size is somewhere around six to eight people, and the goal is for those teams to own something from end-to-end. The third question you should ask yourself is what stage of the business you want to work in, Aubrey said. "It's important to think through what is the type of product and business and problem that you like solving," Aubrey said. For example, Aubrey said she had a colleague who worked on the retail side, which can be a complicated and demanding area, but he loved finding improvements in cost optimization and in the supply chain. Personally, she said she loves "X-factor growth," or working on a part of the business ripe for exponential growth. "I like the blank sheet of paper," Aubrey said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warner Bros Discovery has rebuffed Paramount Skydance's initial takeover approach as too low, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday. Warner Bros rejected Paramount's offer of around $20 per share in recent weeks, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Paramount declined to comment on the report, while Warner Bros did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. Paramount, led by David Ellison, is exploring several paths in its bid for Warner Bros, including increasing its offer, appealing directly to shareholders or securing extra support from a financial partner, Bloomberg said. Paramount has been in talks with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management about backing its bid, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China on Sunday said "we are not afraid of" a trade war with the United States after President Donald Trump vowed to impose punishing new retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce accused the U.S. of a "textbook double standard" with Trump's promise on Friday to tack on additional 100% tariffs on those imports after China imposed new export controls on rare earths minerals. Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China," the ministry spokesperson said. "China's position on the trade war is consistent: we do not want it, but we are not afraid of it," they added. The spokesperson said that the United States "for a long time … has been overstretching the concept of national security, abusing export control, taking discriminatory actions against China, and imposing unilateral long-arm jurisdiction measures on various products, including semiconductor equipment and chips." The U.S. Commerce Control list covers more than 3,000 items, more than three times the approximately 900 items on China's Export Control List of Dual-use Items, the spokesperson said. China called its export controls on rare earth exports a "legitimate" measure under international law, pushing back against U.S. accusations of economic coercion. The Commerce Ministry said the controls, issued Thursday, were part of Beijing's effort to strengthen its export control system and "better safeguard world peace and regional stability" amid what it described as a turbulent global security environment. The measures, which now cover not only rare earth materials but also related intellectual property and technologies, were announced just weeks before a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. "These controls do not constitute export bans. Beijing's new curbs also require foreign entities to obtain a license to export products containing more than 0.1% of domestically-sourced rare earths, or manufactured using China's extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology. Shortly after Beijing tightened export controls on rare earths, the European Chamber of Commerce in China reported a backlog of export license applications awaiting approval, saying the new restrictions "add further complexity to the global supply chains of rare earth elements." In response to Beijing's move, Trump on Friday announced new tariffs of 100% on imports from China "over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying" beginning Nov. 1. Trump also said that the U.S., on that same date, would also impose export controls on "any and all critical software." Stock markets plunged after Trump said on Truth Social that "there is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive'" with its rare earths policy. China accounts for about 70% of the global supply of rare earths and has repeatedly used the critically needed minerals as a bargaining chip in trade discussions. Hours after tightening export controls on rare earths, Beijing also announced that it would start charging U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports from Oct. 14, mirroring a new U.S. fee on Chinese vessels arriving at U.S. ports, set to take effect the same day. China's Commerce Ministry defended its reciprocal decision as "necessary passive defensive actions." Senior U.S. and Chinese officials met for trade negotiations in Geneva in May — the first since Trump launched a global trade war. The most recent trade meetings in Madrid in September yielded a "basic framework consensus" on the divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok, ahead of a deadline to either sell off its U.S. business or shut down the social media app in the country. While China has been silent on future meetings, Trump had also said he would visit China early next year and that Xi would come to the U.S. at a later date. However, Trump on Friday threatened in a social media post to cancel his upcoming meeting with Xi after China's latest tightening of export curbs on rare earths. — CNBC's Dan Mangan, Anniek Bao and Evelyn Cheng contributed to this story.
