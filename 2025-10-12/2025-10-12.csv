            • The 20 hostages held in Gaza thought to be alive are expected to be released early Monday morning local time before being transferred to the Red Cross, an Israeli government spokesperson said today. Nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel will also be freed.
    


            • US President Donald Trump will depart for the Middle East today ahead of a speech at Israel's parliament on Monday and meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as the families of the hostages. Leaders from more than 20 countries will then join Trump in Egypt for a summit on Gaza's future.
    


• Aid trucks are expected to enter southern Gaza today, according to Egyptian state-affiliated media. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have returned home to find only ruins as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas enters a third day.
    


            Palestinian Authority Vice President Hussein Al-Sheikh said on Sunday he met former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to discuss their future vision for Gaza.
    


                    “I met today with Mr. Tony Blair to discuss the day after and ways to support President (Donald) Trump's efforts aimed at ending the war and establishing lasting peace in the region,” Al-Sheikh posted on X.






            In the meeting, Al-Sheikh and Blair affirmed their “readiness” to work with Trump and other parties to “solidify the ceasefire, allow the entry of humanitarian aid, release hostages and prisoners, and move toward recovery and reconstruction,” the post said.
    


            Blair, who led his country into the war in Iraq, has recently returned to the limelight given his prospective involvement in an authority tasked with the reconstruction of Gaza.
    


            The Palestinian Prisoners Media Office said Sunday that “complex obstacles” are currently preventing the announcement of the full list of prisoners to be released under the ceasefire agreement.
    


                    “Complex obstacles still prevent the official announcement of the lists of released prisoners as part of the exchange deal, including prisoners from Gaza,” the office said. “We also affirm that efforts are being made around the clock to overcome these obstacles and complete the necessary procedures,” the office said.
                





            All details related to the deal “will be announced as soon as the negotiations are concluded and the final lists up to the last name are approved,” the office added.
    


Remember: Under the ceasefire agreement, Israel must free 250 Palestinian prisoners who hold life sentences, as well as 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza detained after October 7, 2023.
    


            As Israel prepares for the arrival of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, the country's hospitals are also making sure they are well-equipped to handle any medical needs that may arise once they arrive home.
    


            Dr Eli Sprecher, the CEO of Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital, showed CNN's Wolf Blitzer around his medical center today and said that his staff were “all very much looking forward to that truly historical moment.”
    


            Some 24 hostages who were previously freed from Gaza have been treated at the hospital, Sprecher said. Medical teams are preparing for the latest hostage release based off their past experience.
    


            The first issue that will need to be dealt with is likely going to be malnutrition, which “can affect almost any organ in the body, any tissue in the body, the heart, the brain, the kidneys, et cetera,” Sprecher said.
    


            The hostages could also face orthopedic problems from being kept underground in tunnels for so long, as well as psychological difficulties from two years of captivity, he added.
    


            Dr Inbal Reuveni, the vice chair of the hospital's psychiatry department, said that the center is making sure that the hostages returning are given a “safe space” to reunite with their families in.
    


            Sprecher said that the hospital is trying to recreate a “home-like atmosphere” for those admitted tomorrow. Hospital rooms will have two beds in them so the hostages can sleep with a family member nearby and a playground has been set up for the hostages who have children, he said.
    


            US Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza will be released soon.
    


            Earlier, a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office, said hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees set to be released Monday will be driven into Gaza once the hostages held in the enclave cross back into Israel,
    


            “The President of the United States is planning to travel to the Middle East to greet the hostages,” Vance told NBC's “Meet the Press.”
    


            Asked if he considered the ceasefire agreement and the release of the remaining hostages to be the end of the war in Gaza, Vance said the administration is still going to have a lot of work to do to ensure it “stays ended.”
    


                    “The reason why we're at this moment … is because the president of the United States. He gave unusual authorities to people who had never been in diplomacy before, he actually broke the mold,” Vance said. “Instead of doing diplomacy the same old way that it had failed for the past 30 or 40 years. He gave Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner a remarkable amount of authority to go and get a peace deal done.”
                





            Vance said the US is not planning to put troops on the ground in Israel or Gaza to ensure the deal is followed through.
    


            “He is not planning to put boots on the ground in Gaza or Israel,” Vance said. “We have central command troops that are already there that are going to monitor this peace proposal.”
    


CNN's Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report. 



            As we reported earlier, US President Donald Trump will address Israel's Knesset after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as the families of the Israeli hostages.
    


            Israel's Knesset committee chair has said today “we're all eagerly waiting” to thank Trump during tomorrow's visit “for everything he's done,” according to a spokesperson.
    


                    “We're all eagerly waiting to thank the president for everything he's done, doing and will do for us. He is the best friend of the state of Israel, always standing by our side, also in the difficult moments, and tomorrow we shall all thank him,” Ofir Katz said.
                





            On Sunday, the Knesset committee also approved a “special session” to honor Trump, which will take place tomorrow, the spokesperson said.
    


Remember: Trump will then travel to Egypt, where he is due to co-chair a summit on Gaza alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
    


            The bodies of at least 117 Palestinians have been recovered in Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the enclave, with another seven people dying in the same time period.
    


            This means that at least 67,806 people have been killed in Gaza during the last two years of war, with 170,066 reported injuries, according to the health ministry.
    


            The current ceasefire has allowed the recovery of people previously buried under the debris of destroyed buildings and infrastructure throughout the Gaza Strip.
    


            A spokesperson for Gaza's Civil Defense told CNN yesterday that approximately 10,000 Palestinians are believed to have been buried under rubble across Gaza since October 7, 2023.
    


            We heard earlier from a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office on how they expect Monday's final exchange of hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners and detainees to take place.
    


            Here's a round-up from Shosh Bedrosian's news conference:
    


            Ruby Chen can only hope for a miracle.
    


            His 19-year-old son Itay Chen, a soldier with the Israel Defense Forces, was initially believed to have been taken hostage during the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel, but was later declared dead by the IDF.
    


            Despite this, his father speaks of sustaining hope in the absence of “physical evidence” as he grapples with the reality of losing his middle son, who he described as the “connector of the family.”
    


            “It's like a suspended situation,” he told CNN's Becky Anderson earlier today, while speaking from Netanya, Israel.
    


                    “The knowledge of the IDF that indeed he was killed, we do not have that physical evidence. That's missing. That leaves some sort of doubt that hopefully, even tomorrow, there might be some sort of surprise for us. A miracle.”
                





            When asked about Monday's anticipated release of the 48 remaining hostages – 20 of whom are thought to still be alive – Chen reported “a mixed bag of emotions,” noting uncertainty for the relatives of the 28 who are thought to be deceased or whose status is unknown.
    


                    “On one hand, excitement for those that will be able to hug their loved ones. Anticipation that finally this chapter of the people of Israel that began two years ago will finally come to an end,” he said.
                





            On the other hand, he added, there's “the anxiety that some of the 28 families will not be reunited with their loved ones and will be still stuck in this chapter.”
    


            As thousands of displaced Palestinians make their way back north to Gaza City, many are returning to scenes beyond their imagination.
    


            Eighty-year-old Jawad Mahmoud Ajjour told CNN that he had witnessed mass Palestinian displacement and war in 1956 and 1967, but that he had “never seen that level of destruction” until today.
    


            Another Gaza City resident, Um Abdullah, showed CNN video of the destroyed nursery that her sister helped to build – and then ran for 20 years.
    


            “She taught generations, and those who were taught here sent their kinds too to be taught here in the same nursery. Some grew up to become journalists, doctors; she raised many generations,” Um Abdullah said of her sister.
    


            The United Nations said in August that more than 90% of Gaza's schools have been either destroyed or severely damaged, with 518 out of 564 school buildings needing either full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again.
    


            Younis Ahmed Mahmoud, a resident of Gaza City's Al-Shati Camp, said he did not recognize his neighborhood.
    


                    “I got lost in the street… I struggled to reach my house… it looked like an earthquake hit the area,” he said.
                





            Hundreds of thousands of people left Gaza City since the Israeli military began its ground offensive in August that flattened vast swaths of the city.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) earlier this month estimated that around 900,000 of the city's 1 million residents had left, figures that CNN is unable to verify.
    


            The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said last week that over 200,000 people had remained in Gaza City.
    


            Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian now turns to the subject of the hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees set to be released tomorrow under the Gaza ceasefire agreement.
    


            She says they will be driven out of Israel once the hostages held in the enclave cross back into the country.
    


                    “The Palestinian prisoners will be released once Israel has confirmation that all of our hostages set to be released tomorrow are (across) the border into Israel,” she adds.
                





            The prisoners will likely already be on the buses that will take them out of Israel on Monday, awaiting confirmation of the hostage release. The buses will set off once the transfer has been verified, Bedrosian said.
    


                    “Once the confirmation comes through (that) they (the hostages) have crossed into Israeli territory, those buses will start and they (the Palestinian prisoners) will begin their journey,” Bedrosian adds.
                





            More now from Israel's Prime Minister's spokesperson, Shosh Bedrosian, who has just said if Hamas is unable to find the bodies of some of the hostages held in Gaza, an international committee will help locate them.
    


            Three Israeli sources told CNN earlier this week that Israel assesses the militant group may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.
    


            “An international body, which was agreed on in this (ceasefire) plan, will help locate the hostages if they are not found and released tomorrow,” Bedrosian adds.
    


                    “The Prime Minister (Benjamin Netanyahu) insists that we will act to locate all of these hostages as soon as possible, and we will do that as a sacred duty of communal responsibility,” she added. “All 48 of our hostages will be returning back to Israel, whether they are alive or deceased,” the spokesperson said.
                





            No Hamas propaganda will be displayed during the release of the hostages being held in Gaza tomorrow, Shosh Bedrosian now says.
    


            In previous hostage releases, Hamas has staged macabre ceremonies before transferring the people they kidnapped over to the Red Cross - both living and deceased.
    


            This time round, the 20 living hostages held in Gaza will be “released together at one time to the Red Cross and transported among six to eight vehicles without any sick displays by Hamas, the terror organization,” Bedrosian adds.
    


            The hostages who have been held in Gaza will be released early on Monday morning, a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office has just said.
    


            The 20 living hostages will all be released at the same time, Shosh Bedrosian added, and will be transferred to the custody of the Red Cross before eventually being driven to Israel.
    


            Iran will not be sending a delegation to the upcoming summit in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh despite receiving an invitation, the state-affiliated Tasnim news agency reported, citing an unnamed source.
    


            US President Donald Trump is arriving in the city on Monday to chair the event in celebration of the signing of the first phase of an agreement to end the war in Gaza.
    


            A regional diplomat familiar with the matter also told CNN that Iran had received a formal invitation to attend the summit.
    


            At least 20 countries are expected to attend the ceremony, the Egyptian Presidency said without clarifying which nations have been invited.
    


            Among the confirmed attendees are France, Britain, Jordan and Germany.
    


            Israel is waiting to receive the 48 remaining hostages held in Gaza, who are expected to be freed Monday morning, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they are “prepared and ready” for their imminent arrival home.
    


            US President Donald Trump is expected to address Israel's parliament on Monday during his visit to the country.
    


Here's the latest: 



            We can bring you some footage now from Gaza City, obtained by the Reuters news agency. It shows markets bustling as crowds gathered today in the streets to browse stalls and buy essential goods.
    


            One Palestinian man, Wissam Joudeh, said the busy markets were a sign “life is returning” to the embattled enclave, after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire came into effect on Friday.
    


            Another Palestinian resident, Ahmed Hamadeh, said safety and security had returned due to the ceasefire. “Despite the destruction and everything we went through, thank God once the truce was announced, life returned to normalcy,” he said.
    


            The ceasefire in Gaza agreed upon by Israel and Hamas has “given a spark of hope in the Holy Land,” Pope Leo XIV said today, speaking after a mass in St Peter's Square.
    


            Since his papacy began in May, the American pontiff has been robust in his criticism of Israel's war in Gaza, consistently voicing his concern for Palestinian civilians that faced Israeli bombardment.
    


            Today, Leo said that he encourages those involved in the conflict to “courageously continue on the path towards a just and lasting peace that respects the legitimate aspirations of the Israeli and Palestinian people.”
    


                    “Two years of conflict have left death and rubble everywhere, especially in the hearts of those who have brutally lost their children, parents, friends, everything,” he said.
                





            The pontiff also called for those in the region to “rediscover that the other is not an enemy, but a brother to look at, forgive, (and) offer the hope of reconciliation.”
    


            Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza is being prepared to receive hundreds of prisoners and detainees that Israel is set to release early next week, the Palestinian health ministry says.
    


                    “We are preparing Nasser Hospital to receive 1,900 detainees that the occupation will release tomorrow, in addition to receiving a large number of bodies,” the ministry's Director-General Dr. Munir Al-Bursh wrote on X.
                





            Most of the detainees due to be released are suffering from diseases and will require urgent medical attention, he said.
    


            Earlier this week, the Israeli justice ministry published the names of 250 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails and set for release as part of a ceasefire agreement that will first see Hamas free the remaining hostages it holds.
    


            Israel is also due to release around 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza, detained after the October 7 attacks.
    


            Al-Bursh also called on the international community to “open the crossings and bring in medical supplies and equipment” in his statement.
    


            As part of the ceasefire deal, Israel has agreed to the daily entry of 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza, operated by the UN and other donors.
    


            Israel is “prepared and ready for the immediate reception of all our hostages,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has just said.
    


            Netanyahu spoke with Hostage and Missing Persons Coordinator Gal Hirsch today.
    


            A total of 48 hostages are expected to be released as part of this week's ceasefire agreement.
    


            Of those captured on October 7, 2023, 20 are presumed alive and 25 are believed to be dead, with the status of two others uncertain.
    


            There is one additional hostage whose body was held in Gaza before the October 7 attacks. He is an IDF soldier who was killed in 2014.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has released an itinerary ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the country tomorrow.
    


            Their timings show the US president will meet with Netanyahu in his office at the Knesset at 10.15 a.m. local time (3.15 a.m. ET).
    


            Later that hour, at 10.45 a.m. (3.45 a.m. ET), also at the Knesset, Trump is due to meet with families of the hostages.
    


            Trump is then set to deliver a speech to the Knesset during a plenary session, at 11 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET). Netanyahu, the Speaker of the Knesset, and Israel's opposition leader are also expected to give speeches during this session, the Israeli statement said.
    


            Trump will depart Israel at 1 p.m. local time (6 a.m. ET), Netanyahu's office said.
    


            This itinerary largely aligns with Trump's official schedule of the visit, which was released overnight.
    


            Trump will then travel to Egypt, where he is due to co-chair a summit on Gaza alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. According to the US President's schedule, he is set to land in Egypt at 1.45 p.m. local time (6.45 a.m. ET).

Investors brace for another bout of trade war turmoil as Beijing says it will act if US president fails to back down

Beijing has told the US it will retaliate if Donald Trump fails to back down on his threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports as investors brace for another bout of trade war turmoil.

China's commerce ministry blamed Washington for raising trade tensions between the two countries after Trump announced on Friday that he would impose the additional tariffs on China's exports to the US, along with new controls on critical software, by 1 November.

“Wilful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,” a spokesperson for the commerce ministry said on Sunday, according to the state news agency Xinhua. “China's position on the trade war is consistent. We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it.

“If the United States insists on going the wrong way, China will surely take resolute measures to protect its legitimate rights and interests.”

The US president shocked the financial markets on Friday when he accused China of “very hostile” moves to restrict exports of rare-earth materials needed by US industry.

It prompted heavy falls on Wall Street, where about $2tn (£1.5tn) was wiped off the value of the US stocks.

China insisted on Sunday that its latest export controls on rare earths such as holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium were legitimate.

“China's export controls are not export bans,” said the commerce ministry spokesperson. “All applications of compliant export for civil use can get approval, so that relevant businesses have no need to worry.”

The measures were introduced after Washington added a number of Chinese firms to its export control list in a crackdown on the use of foreign affiliates to circumvent export curbs on chipmaking equipment and other goods and technology.

The UK's FTSE 100 share index fell almost 1% on Friday as Trump's threat sparked a late selloff. The futures market indicates there could be further losses in London and New York on Monday, although there could also be relief that Beijing has not yet retaliated.

Bitcoin, which had tumbled 8% after Trump's post on Truth Social, rose by 1.5% on Sunday after China refrained from retaliating.

Trump's tariff threat was “a rather unwelcome development for financial markets” as investors had “by and large moved on from the trade and tariff story”, said Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at the brokerage firm Pepperstone.

“Chiefly, the question that every man and his dog are attempting to answer is whether this is a credible threat, that the Trump admin might follow through on, or whether this is another example of the ‘escalate to de-escalate' strategy that Trump used so frequently earlier in the year.

“A strategy where outlandish and ridiculous tariff figures are threatened, in an attempt to focus minds, extract concessions from the other party, and ultimately come to agreement faster than otherwise might've been possible.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:kyivindependent.com","Over 135,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine identified by media investigation","https://kyivindependent.com/over-135-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine-identified-by-media-investigation/","Sun, 12 Oct 2025 03:16:09 GMT","

Russian independent media outlet Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC Russian service, has confirmed the identities of 135,100 Russian military personnel killed in Ukraine.

The publications' latest report covers the period of Feb. 24, 2022 to Oct. 9, 2025. Since it was last updated at the end of September, 2,485 additional Russian military personnel have been confirmed killed.

The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, memorial community tree-plantings, regional media reports, statements from local authorities, among other sources.

The reported death toll now includes 38,200 volunteers, 18,450 recruited prisoners, and 15,200 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. Over 5,800 officers have also been confirmed to have been killed.

In August, Mediazona, in collaboration with independent Russian outlet Meduza, released a report estimating that an estimated 220,000 Russians have been killed in the country's war against Ukraine — although that number has grown since.

The average age of the dead soldiers was 35.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the figures reported by the publications.

Moscow and Kyiv rarely officially report their losses. Ukraine estimates that Russia's overall casualties during the full-scale war have surpassed 1 million.

In a briefing to reporters on Aug. 12, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Russian losses are approximately three times greater than that of Ukraine, without specifying the total number of losses suffered.

Despite the heavy losses, Russia has been able to make advances in Donetsk Oblast in Ukraine's east as it is able to offset its casualties through fresh contract soldiers. In turn, Kyiv faces increasingly serious manpower shortages, particularly among infantry units holding the front line.

As of Oct. 11, Ukraine's General Staff estimates that Russia has lost 1,121,570 troops in Ukraine since the start of the war on Feb. 24, 2022. The numbers are largely in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies.

The outlet published the complete list of identified casualties for the first time in February, marking three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the publication, volunteers manually enter and verify each record to prevent duplicate entries in the database.

Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine's railway infrastructure as autumn sets in, resulting in increasing train delays and cancellations.

The two leaders discussed air defense support and long-range strikes, as Russia ramps up its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

""Not only is this an attempted theft of a peaceful Ukrainian nuclear facility. Unauthorized actions of Russia's (state nuclear energy corporation) Rosatom violate internationally recognized nuclear safety protocols, contradict Ukrainian license, and directly threaten a nuclear incident,"" Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said.

A second vessel of the same class is expected to be delivered by the end of 2025, with crew training already underway, said Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa.  

Ukrainian forces downed 103 out of the 118 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. A missile and 15 drones struck 10 different locations, according to the statement.

Ukrainian troops have liberated the village of Mali Shcherbaky in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine's 24th Separate Assault Battalion ""Aidar"" announced on Oct. 12, releasing footage purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers in the settlement.

In a renewed effort to disrupt Ukraine's energy grid ahead of winter, Russia carried out several large-scale missile and drone strikes on energy and gas facilities this week.

Sources told the Financial Times that the U.S. is involved at every stage of operational planning, although Kyiv retains control over target selection, with Washington advising on target vulnerabilities.

The number includes 1,240 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

The Atesh partisan group sabotaged railway infrastructure in Russia's Rostov Oblast, disrupting Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on Oct. 12.

Russian independent media outlet Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC Russian service, has confirmed the identities of 135,100 Russian military personnel killed in Ukraine.

An estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Cuban fighters are actively participating in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported Oct. 5, citing an internal U.S. State Department cable obtained by the outlet.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Beijing has threatened to take corresponding measures to safeguard its own rights and interests, after Donald Trump threatened 100% US tariffs over China's limits on rare earth exports.

China has accused Washington of ""double standards"" on Sunday after US President Donald Trump announced an additional 100% US tariffs on imports from the world's second largest economy.

""The relevant US statement is a typical example of 'double standards',"" a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. ""Should the US persist in its course, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,"" the statement read.

This comes in response to Trump threatening a new 100% tariff on Chinese goods and export controls on all critical software, starting November 1, in addition to existing 30% tariffs.

Trump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, said that he had learnt that China had taken an ""extraordinarily aggressive position on trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the world."" 

It came a day after Beijing introduced new export limits on rare earth minerals. China is the world's largest supplier of these materials, which are crucial for tech production.

The new US tariffs threaten to restart a trade war first launched earlier this year. Shortly after Trump took office both nations started exchanging exponentially high tariffs which were eventually paused after several rounds of negotiations. 

Beijing justified its position on restricting exports, saying China's measures are necessary given the military applications of medium and heavy rare earth metals amid the ""current turbulent global situation and frequent military conflicts.""

China has long used rare earths — the minerals essential for electronic, automotive and defense systems — as strategic leverage against the US. 

Beijing added that it had notified relevant countries and regions before the announcement of the measures. 

The Commerce Ministry's statement assured global tech companies and stakeholders that the export measures will have ""extremely limited impact"" on production and supply chains.

China said it is willing to strengthen dialogue and exchanges on export controls to safeguard supply chains further.

Speaking of its ties with the US, Beijing accused Washington of continuously adding new restrictions against China since the trade talks in Madrid. 

It said China's position on tariff wars has been consistent. 

""We do not want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight,"" the Ministry of Commerce said.

            President Donald Trump has spent a decade painting large swaths of the United States as a hellscape, dating back to his dark 2017 inaugural address and his demagogic 2016 campaign.
    


            But increasingly, he's upped the ante on trying to leverage that supposed hellscape. He's used it to float a crackdown on his political opponents and to justify deploying the military on US soil. The message is increasingly that things are so bad that you must give Trump more power to deal with it.
    


            There is a major problem with this, though. And that's that – as with so many of Trump's claims – he rests his case on a series of falsehoods and exaggerations. That doesn't mean there aren't real problems in our country, but they are not as Trump says they are.
    


            But Trump's moves to act on the picture he has painted has at least provided a valuable reality check.
    


            Repeatedly now, judges have said Trump's proclaimed hellscape isn't reality.
    


            The media has covered these claims skeptically. But it's increasingly judges being tasked with ferreting out the truth.
    


            This happened twice in the last week alone, as judges have ruled against Trump's deployments of the National Guard to Chicago and Oregon.
    


            In Chicago, Trump has compared the city to a warzone and suggested a war-like response. He at one point posted a meme parodying the Vietnam War movie “Apocalypse Now,” with the president is superimposed in front of a burning Chicago skyline as helicopters fly overhead.
    


            His administration has defended its deployment of troops by saying that local police can't handle the situation and that there is either “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States” – two circumstances in which federal law allows the president to federalize the National Guard.
    


            But US District Court Judge April Perry said Thursday that there was no such rebellion or danger of one. (In fact, she said the deployment itself could actually fuel “civil unrest.”) She said the protests at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility did not exceed about 200 attendees, and that there were about 100 state and local law enforcement officers there to handle it.
    


            She said the Department of Homeland Security's version of events was “simply unreliable” and suffered from a “lack of credibility.” She said the government's evidence was contradicted by local and state law enforcement.
    


            “What if (the president) is relying on invalid evidence?” she added at another point, according to WTTW-TV.
    


            Perhaps the bigger rebuke came in Oregon, where it came from a Trump-nominated judge, Karin Immergut. (Perry was nominated by Joe Biden.)
    


            Immergut in a lengthy ruling over the weekend noted Trump has cited a need to save “War ravaged Portland” from “Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.” Trump added as recently as Friday that Portland is “almost an insurrection.”
    


            The judge has made clear that's extremely far from the truth. Immergut acknowledged some significant instances of violence near an ICE facility over the summer. But she said it was well-contained by local authorities and that it had all but disappeared by the time of Trump's September 27 order, when the protests “typically involved twenty or fewer people.”
    


            “… The protests have been such a minor issue, that the normal nightlife in downtown Portland has required more police resources than the ICE facility,” she said.
    


            Immergut emphasized repeatedly that judges should generally defer to the president's characterization of events. But she suggested Trump's version was just that wrong.
    


            “But ‘a great level of deference' is not equivalent to ignoring the facts on the ground,” Immergut said, adding: “The President's determination was simply untethered to the facts.”
    


            These are the most recent examples of judges fact checking Trump's supposed hellscape. But they're not the only ones.
    


            The verdict was similar when US District Judge Charles Breyer ruled last month against Trump's use of the military in Los Angeles.
    


            Trump often claimed the city was on the verge of going up in flames. “Los Angeles was under siege until we got there,” he said at one point.
    


            Breyer said that simply wasn't true.
    


            “There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” the judge said in his opinion. “Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.”
    


            Breyer likened the level of violence to Black Lives Matter protests and “sometimes riotous” parties after the Dodgers or the Lakers have won championships.
    


            “The June 6 and 7 protests were far more similar to these events than they were to the 1894 Pullman Strike, which crippled interstate commerce across the western United States,” Breyer said, highlighting the 19th century instance in which the military was called in.
    


            Judges have also rejected Trump and the administration's frequent claims of an “invasion” of migrants.
    


            Trump has used such claims both on the campaign trail and in court to justify his use of the Alien Enemies Act (which requires an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” if used outside wartime) to rapidly deport migrants. In the latter case, Trump claimed we were essentially being invaded by Venezuela, via the gang Tren de Aragua.
    


            Even Republican-nominated judges have said this didn't add up.
    


            “A country's encouraging its residents and citizens to enter this country illegally is not the modern-day equivalent of sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt, or to otherwise harm the United States,” US appellate Judge Leslie Southwick, a George W. Bush nominee, wrote in an opinion last month. “There is no finding that this mass immigration was an armed, organized force or forces.”
    


            The finding was similar when Trump-nominated US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. ruled in May against Trump's use of the AEA.
    


            “As for the activities of the Venezuelan-directed TdA in the United States, and as described in the Proclamation,” Rodriguez wrote, “the Court concludes that they do not fall within the plain, ordinary meaning of ‘invasion' or ‘predatory incursion' for purposes of the AEA.”
    


            No invasion. No rebellion. Nothing the local police can't handle  And most of these decisions mentioned above have come from Republican-appointed judges.
    


            That's not to say nothing bad has happened in this country in recent months. The assassination attempts against Trump, the violence against Democratic leaders over the past year, and the assassination of Charlie Kirk last month show we have real problems. Crime is a major issue in many large cities, even if it's hardly at unusual levels (and in some cases is actually down, like in Chicago).
    


            But Trump has painted a much more ominous picture of historic and even organized violence that requires extraordinary, wartime-like responses – responses that happen to involve granting him huge amounts of power to address them.
    


            If nothing else, his efforts to actually use these claims to expand his power have forced judges to reckon with the veracity of what he's saying.
    


            The verdicts they've reached suggest Trump is declaring war on a bogeyman.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","‘My brother was murdered by greed': Inside Brazil's methanol poisoning crisis","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/12/americas/brazil-methanol-poisoning-latam-intl","Sun, 12 Oct 2025 13:00:52 GMT","


            When Marcelo Lombardi, 45, complained he was feeling sleepy on a Friday, his family didn't think much of it.
    


            Lombardi often put in long hours running his family's 17-year-old real estate business in São Paulo, Brazil, working alongside two of his older sisters. A well-known attorney, he was a beloved figure in Sacomã, the southeastern neighborhood where he had lived for more than 35 years.
    


            Fernanda Lombardi, one of his sisters, recalled their life being “perfect” until that day, September 26. “Earlier in the week, he came home with some groceries, which included a bottle of vodka,” she told CNN. “It was his favorite liquor.”
    


            On Saturday, Marcelo woke up blind. “He told his wife he couldn't see anything but a big bright light,” Fernanda said. Upon arriving at the hospital, no one could tell the family what was wrong with Marcelo.
    


            “It took them about five hours to tell us that my brother had been poisoned,” Fernanda said. “By then, all of his organs were shutting down. He looked me in the eye and said, ‘I'm not leaving this place.'” Marcelo died the following day.
    


            The family later learned from health officials that the sips of the vodka cocktail he had casually enjoyed at home days before were laced with an invisible killer – industrial methanol. The colorless liquid is now responsible for an ongoing health crisis that has triggered a nationwide panic affecting about 100 million people across six states in Brazil, according to health authorities.
    


            Methanol is a clear, odorless, highly flammable liquid found in antifreeze, varnish and fuel. Ingesting just a few milliliters can cause blindness or death.
    


            Federal authorities are investigating several fronts to determine how industrial methanol entered Brazil's consumer alcohol supply. In Brazil, methanol commerce is regulated by the government, restricted to industrial uses such as biodiesel production, solvents, and laboratory applications. Its sale is legal but strictly controlled, and every transaction must be registered.
    


            One main line of investigation is that methanol, cheaper than ethanol, may have been intentionally used by counterfeiters to cut liquor production costs. Federal police are examining whether the chemical used by clandestine factories was purchased from gas stations and later diverted to illicit alcohol production. At least one gas station in São Paulo has been identified as a common supplier in several cases. Investigators are also probing whether smuggled or diverted industrial methanol entered Brazil's black market and if it has been used for bottle washing or sterilization by underground distilleries, contaminating drinks later sold illegally.

            As a precaution, health and trade associations are urging consumers and bars to destroy or properly dispose of empty bottles to prevent counterfeiters from reusing them in the production of fake liquor.
    


            Federal investigators have uncovered a massive black-market supply chain flooding bars, venues and homes with counterfeit liquor. So far, authorities have seized hundreds of thousands of fake labels, more than 100,000 of them just in the city of São Paulo, making it hard to estimate how far these poisonous bottles have been distributed.
    


            Joint operations by the Civil Police and the Health Surveillance Agency have led to the closure of four clandestine factories and the arrest of 41 people, according to a statement by the government of São Paulo.
    


            Lombardi was the third documented fatality since the crisis was announced by authorities in September, with the first cases dating to late August.
    


            As of October 8, Brazil's Health Ministry had logged 259 suspected cases nationwide, and five confirmed deaths – as well as confirmed poisonings in São Paulo, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul. All of the deaths have so far occurred in São Paulo, the epicenter of the crisis. Hospitals are also reporting rapid-onset blindness, irreversible comas and organ failure within hours of ingestion.
    


            Eduardo Capitani, toxicologist and pulmonologist at the Center for Intoxication Control at the University of Campinas, one of the country's leading poison-control and research centers, was one of the first to alert the government that a health emergency was underway. Between early and late September, his team saw 10 suspected cases across São Paulo and neighboring cities – enough to trigger a nationwide alert. That alert prompted a joint news conference by the Justice and Health ministries, announcing a coordinated investigation into the origin of the contaminated batches.
    


            “We've seen spikes before, in 2023 and 2024, among unhoused people who drank fuel-grade ethanol,” Capitani said. “This time, victims were drinking cocktails at bars and parties. These are not isolated cases.”
    


            Capitani said Brazil's public health system reacted quickly, but the crisis exposed deep structural weaknesses: Few hospitals have labs capable of testing for methanol or its toxic byproduct, formic acid, and fewer stocked the antidotes needed to treat patients fast.
    


            For Fernanda Lombardi, racing to find an antidote in pharmacies brought a feeling she will never forget. “It could've saved my brother's life, but it wasn't available anywhere. We felt powerless.”
    


            “Ethanol is nature's antidote to methanol,” Capitani explained. “In adulterated drinks, people may be consuming both the poison and its antidote – but in unpredictable proportions.”
    


            Symptoms often mimic a hangover: headache, nausea, dizziness. Within 24 hours, patients may lose their vision and struggle to breathe. If the person is untreated, the methanol metabolizes into formic acid, which attacks the optic nerve and nervous system, leading to blindness, organ failure or death within 48 hours.
    


            Treatment requires intravenous administration of ethanol or fomepizole, a specific antidote that blocks methanol's toxic conversion. Yet ethanol is scarce in most Brazilian hospitals, and fomepizole – approved in the United States and Europe since the 1990s – reached Brazil only this week through the emergency importation of 2,500 doses.
    


            Mariângela Batista Galvão Simão, Brazil's secretary of health and environmental surveillance, oversaw the arrival of the first batch of fomepizole at São Paulo's Guarulhos International Airport. “We're working to keep our antidote reserve full,” she told CNN on Thursday from the airport, “but it's hard to predict how much we'll need.”

            “There's no national antidote policy,” Capitani warned. “Many hospitals didn't have 100 percent ethanol in sufficient quantities. Until it arrives, sometimes hours later, that time can cost a patient their vision or life.”
    


            Brazil's Ministry of Health addressed the issue in a statement to CNN:
    


            “The ministry has been working since February this year on developing the National Antidote Policy, which will strengthen surveillance, access to medicines, and the training of healthcare professionals.”
    


            When pure ethanol isn't available, doctors may temporarily administer vodka, one of the purest forms of commercial ethanol. “But now,” Capitani cautioned, “that's become a Russian roulette, because even vodka could be contaminated.”
    


            Themis Mizerkowski Torres, a rheumatologist and toxicologist leading efforts at São Paulo's Center for Intoxication Control, says the crisis is unprecedented.
    


            “I have been with the center since 2004, and I have never seen anything like it,” she told CNN.
    


            “The guidance is to stay away from any alcoholic beverage for now.” And in the home country of the famous caipirinha drink, made from cachaça, lime and sugar, that is no easy feat.
    


            Torres explained that wine and beer are safer bets due to their fermentation process and how they are manufactured. But as Health Minister Alexandre Padilha stressed in a recent news conference, “there's no such thing as completely safe drinking right now.”
    


            In São Paulo, bars and restaurants in wealthy districts such as Itaim Bibi, Pinheiros and Berrini report steep drops in customers and cancellations of reservations. Some have stopped selling vodka, whiskey and cachaça entirely.
    


            From São Paulo to Pernambuco, fear now overshadows Brazil's vibrant bar culture – a sobering reminder of how one contaminated bottle can devastate families and test the country's ability to contain a crisis.
    


            Fernanda Lombardi says her brother's death destroyed their family and community.
    


            “He was healthy, hard-working, happy,” she said. “He didn't even go out – he drank a little vodka at home. That's what we can't understand.”
    


            The family turned the bottle over to police, but toxicology results have yet to be released.
    


            “My brother was murdered by greed,” she said. “Someone thought about money and not a human life. We want justice, so no other family has to go through this.”
    


            At his funeral, hundreds of mourners came to pay respects.
    


            “Everyone had a story about how he helped them, and I had no idea,” Fernanda Lombardi said. “He did good quietly.”

Struggles by several top 10 teams in Week 7 of college football should send shockwaves through the latest AP Top 25 rankings, dropping at 2 p.m. ET.

No. 3 Oregon suffered its first loss of the season, delivered by No. 7 Indiana in a 30-20 road win.

No. 4 Ole Miss pulled out a 24-21 victory over Washington State in a game that shouldn't have been close.

No. 6 Oklahoma was outperformed by the Texas Longhorns, whose stint as an unranked team will likely be short-lived after a convincing 23-6 win.

So how will the top of the poll shake out?

Follow live updates from The Associated Press below for poll projections, game recaps, analysis and voter answers to fan questions, all in one place.

Future games holds significant value. 

For example, Ole Miss and Tennessee did not have convincing games this week. However, they will be heavily monitored next week because of their matchups against ranked opponents.

▶ Ask him a question about the Top 25 poll

No. 7 Indiana is poised to crack the top five after outscoring No. 3 Oregon 30-20 in Ducks' territory. 

Other Saturday highlights included unranked USC, Texas and Utah teams delivering big-time wins against ranked opponents.

The Trojans could return to the rankings after outplaying No. 15 Michigan, beating the Wolverines 31-13. Texas came out on top of the Red River Rivalry, beating No. 6 Oklahoma 23-6. Utah rounded out competition for the day with a dominant 42-10 win against No. 21 Arizona State.

No. 9 Texas Tech could see its highest ranking of the season after a 42-17 win against Kansas.

Alabama's opening season loss to FSU will weigh down its record. However, three straight Top 25 wins in SEC play has them as the frontrunner to win the conference. 

Their biggest strength right now is the defense coming up big late in games and the brilliance of QB TY Simpson as one of the best passers in the country.

Stock down: No. 3 Oregon is set to slip out of the top five after falling to No. 7 Indiana at home. The Ducks ranked in the top three for the past two weeks after beating Penn State. 

No. 4 Ole Miss could fall in the poll after unexpectedly struggling against Washington State. The Rebels pulled out a 24-21 win, but could see a slight drop off in the rankings after the uninspiring outing. 

No. 6 Oklahoma could drop out of the top 10 for the first time in weeks after losing to an unranked Texas team on Saturday.

Indiana is off to a 6-0 start and now has two wins against ranked teams after having zero in 2024. It's worth considering that this may be the best year in Indiana history. So moving them up was a given, seeing how the rest of their conference schedule holds up. 

For Oregon, the remaining schedule does include quality opponents like USC and Washington, but none are against teams that entered this weekend ranked inside the Top 25. 

Not to mention, the Ducks' best win is against Penn State, who just dropped back-to-back losses to conference opponents.

▶ Ask him a question about the Top 25 poll

Two top 10 teams lost on Saturday, paving the way for movement in today's poll.

No. 3 Oregon hopes to hang on to its top 10 status after a loss to No. 7 Indiana. And No. 6 Oklahoma has a substantial fall at stake after losing to Texas in a matchup that wasn't particularly close.

No. 5 Texas A&M, No. 8 Alabama and No. 9 Texas Tech each racked up a win Saturday and could benefit from Oklahoma and Oregon's losses.

College football writer and Top 25 voter Jerry Humphrey will answer a few questions before and after the rankings drop.






No organization has been ranking teams and naming a major college football national champion longer than The Associated Press, since 1936.

AP employees don't vote themselves, but they do choose the voters. AP Top 25 voters comprise around 60 writers and broadcasters who cover college football for AP members and other select outlets. The goal is to have every state with a Football Bowl Subdivision school represented by at least one voter.

Voting is a straight points system: A first-place vote is worth 25 points, a second-place vote is worth 24 points, down to 1 point for a 25th-place vote. 

Then it's just a summary of which teams are 1-25 based on the totals. Others receiving votes are also noted.

Voting is done online, and the tabulation is automated.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — The woman long blamed for her role in the fall of the Aztec empire in 1521 is getting a modern makeover.

The Spanish called her Marina, pre-Hispanic peoples knew her as Malintzin and later she was renamed Malinche. Her work as translator and interpreter for Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés made her a protagonist in a violent colonial period whose effects still reverberate through Latin America. Her story, told only by others, generated myths and legends.

Was she a traitor to her people? The conquistador's lover? A slave using her language skills to survive? Or someone with agency who influenced Cortés and shaped major events?

Five centuries later, the debate continues and Mexico's first woman leader, President Claudia Sheinbaum, is weighing in.

Beginning Sunday, Mexico will kick off cultural events dedicated to reclaiming the story of Malinche on the anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the Americas. 

“We have a working group of anthropologists, historians, and philosophers studying this important, much-maligned figure, and it is very important to vindicate her,” Sheinbaum said recently.




Born around 1500, Malinche learned Nahuatl and the now near-disappeared Oluteco, growing up south of the Gulf of Mexico. The Aztecs sold her as a slave to a Mayan people who later gave her and other women to the Spanish after being defeated in battle. By then, she could speak two more Mayan languages.

The Spanish baptized the women, providing religious cover for them to be raped. 

Malinche was “at their mercy as a victim,” said Camilla Townsend, a historian at Rutgers University and an expert on Malinche. But she easily learned Spanish and “she saved her own life really by choosing to translate.”

Soon she would find herself in front of Moctezuma, the Aztec leader, in the imposing capital Tenochtitlan. As a translator for Cortés, she bridged two radically different worldviews, relaying the desires of Cortés and possibly trying to influence negotiations.

Some historical documents say she saved lives but she was also placed in complicated situations. 

“She was forced to be an intermediary between the Spaniards and these other poor women who were going to be raped,” Townsend said.

Most academics today don't see her as a traitor, because the Aztecs were her enemies in a world of constant wars between different peoples that only centuries later were lumped together as “Indigenous” in a violent colonial system.

Still, viewing her objectively is impossible, according to Federico Navarrete, historian at Mexico's National Autonomous University, because the race and class conflicts left by the conquest persist. Yet, schools only teach a “nationalist” perspective, downplaying nuances such as the support of some Indigenous groups for the Spanish.

Yásnaya Aguilar, a Mixe linguist who has written about Malinche, described her as “a native woman who moved from being a slave to being respected and honored by society in her time.” In fact, the name Malinche was also used to refer to Cortés: they were considered one, but she was the voice.

The Spanish also respected Malinche. Townsend believes that Cortés agreed to give her in marriage to one of his main commanders – the only way for her to avoid returning to slavery – so that she would agree to stay on with him for the conquest of modern day Honduras.

She died around the age of 30, apparently in an epidemic. She had a son with Cortés and a daughter with her husband.

Malinche was largely forgotten until the early 19th century, when Mexico won its independence from Spain and Spain's allies became enemies.

She first appears as “a lascivious and scheming traitor” in a popular, anonymously published novel in 1826, so she became the perfect villain for the new country, according to Townsend. It was the Mexican governments that followed that imposed Spanish on Indigenous peoples.

Malinche's negative image was solidified by Nobel Prize in Literature winner Octavio Paz. In his emblematic work of Mexican identity “The Labyrinth of Solitude,” Paz described her as “a figure representing the Indian women who were fascinated, violated or seduced by the Spaniards” and for whom “the Mexican people have not forgiven her betrayal.”

Her name became a symbol of sympathy for the foreign and contempt for one's own. It carried an idealized romantic relationship with Cortés that historians consider uncalled for and that Aguilar characterized as “patriarchal and chauvinistic.”

It's a caricature that has extended far beyond Mexico's modern borders. “They call me Malinche too from the left for allying myself with white men … with whom we work against extractivist policies,” said Toribia Lero, an Indigenous Bolivian activist of the Sura de los Andes people.

Mexico's Indigenous peoples, however, maintained respect for the woman, naming volcanoes, peaks and ceremonial dances after her. In some rural towns, girls are registered soon after birth to represent Malinche in traditional dances, Aguilar wrote.

Since the 1970s, Malinche's negative image began to be questioned among Chicana feminists in the U.S. because they knew it was very hard to be a bridge between two peoples and they empathized with her, Townsend said. 

Now there is a growing body of academic literature attempting to contextualize her life. And the Mexican government is joining the effort.

Fox News correspondent Garrett Tenney has the latest on President Donald Trump's efforts to create a National Guard presence in Illinois on ‘America Reports.'

Tech billionaire Marc Benioff is shifting his tone toward President Donald Trump, saying he ""fully"" supports the president and is now urging him to deploy the National Guard to Benioff's home city of San Francisco.

""We don't have enough cops, so if [the National Guard] can be cops, I'm all for it,"" Benioff said in an interview with The New York Times.

""I fully support the president,"" he added. ""I think he's doing a great job.""

His comments come a week before his annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. He complained to the Times that he has to pay out of pocket for off-duty police officers to bolster security in the convention area every year.

""You'll see. When you walk through San Francisco next week, there will be cops on every corner,"" he promised. ""That's how it used to be.""

The friendly words for Trump are an about-face for the California billionaire, however, having spent recent years funneling tens of millions of dollars toward left-wing activist groups. Benioff's company, Salesforce, has also a championed transgender ideology.

Between 2022 and 2024 alone, Salesforce donated over $23 million to the left-wing Tides Foundation. Salesforce also created the ""Pledge 1%"" program, a model that encourages corporations to donate 1% of equity, product, profit, and employee time to charity.

Salesforce kicked the program over to Tides Foundation, which has been handling the Pledge 1% funds since at least 2019. Salesforce says at least 9,000 companies have joined the program since its inception.

Salesforce also donated $1.5 million to the liberal dark money group New Venture Fund. Reporting from the Washington Examiner says the organization has links to a Palestinian terrorist group.

Aside from funding, Benioff's company has used its own reach to push transgender activism, using its social media accounts to hail a transgender athlete and defend transgender people in the U.S. military.

Despite the left-wing resume, Benioff has been successful in getting closer to Trump's orbit since his election in 2024. Benioff sat across from Trump at the state dinner hosted by King Charles in the U.K. last month. According to the Times, he repeatedly told Trump ""how grateful I am for everything he's doing.""

The White House did not immediately respond when Fox News Digital reached out regarding any plans to deploy National Guard to San Francisco.

Trump himself floated the idea in August, however, telling reporters in the Oval Office that Democrats have ""destroyed"" the city.

""You look at what the Democrats have done to San Francisco — they've destroyed it. We can clean that up, too — we'll clean that one up, too.""

Adam Swart, CEO of Crowds on Demand, says the upcoming ""No Kings"" protest risks being exploited by agitators and interest groups ""making money off chaos,"" while organizers defend their nonviolent record and security plans.

The head of a national crowd-for-hire firm is warning that America's protest culture has become a target for exploitation — by paid agitators, profit-driven interest groups and even foreign actors seeking to fuel division.

Adam Swart, CEO of Crowds on Demand, told Fox News Digital that his company has witnessed firsthand how demonstrations can be co-opted by people ""making money off chaos"" rather than advancing genuine civic causes.

""My concern is that there are forces — some domestic, some maybe foreign — that actually want to pull America apart,"" Swart said. ""These aren't left or right actors. They're people making money off chaos.""

His remarks come as organizers prepare for the ""No Kings"" protest, a nationwide demonstration planned for Oct. 18 that is expected to denounce political elitism and government overreach.

Swart said his company was approached about the event but declined to participate, calling it ""a dud in the making"" — another example, he said, of political theater that risks being exploited rather than achieving real persuasion.

""It's the same people saying the same things they've said every time — and getting the same results,"" he said.

Organizers behind the ""No Kings"" movement pushed back on Swart's characterization, saying the event is expected to draw turnout ""comparable to or larger than"" the first nationwide demonstration, which they claim attracted about 5 million participants.

A spokesperson told Fox News Digital the protest ""has nothing to do with raising money or energizing voters,"" describing it instead as an effort to ""demonstrate and build the resistance to the authoritarian.""

The spokesperson said the movement is built around a commitment to nonviolence and employs extensive security and de-escalation training for volunteers.

""We're monitoring what's going on online in advance and being proactive against any identified threats,"" the spokesperson said, calling No Kings ""mindful, thoughtful, organized and centered on nonviolence.""

The spokesperson added that the first protest recorded ""very few incidents"" and described the movement as part of ""a proud American tradition"" of peaceful civic demonstrations.

While the movement has drawn support from some progressive groups, Swart said his concerns apply broadly — to any large-scale protest vulnerable to manipulation or infiltration.

Swart described what he calls a ""protest industry"" — an ecosystem of consultants, operatives and influencers who build brands and bankrolls from political outrage.

He said many movements, regardless of ideology, now operate less as grassroots expressions and more as ""performative activism"" built to attract funding, followers or online engagement.

""I've taken a pay cut to turn this into a company that advances common-sense causes,"" he said. ""I could make 10 times more if I said yes to everything. But I don't want to be part of the noise.""

Swart said Crowds on Demand now declines contracts that he views as divisive or volatile, choosing instead to support peaceful, purposeful demonstrations.

""I want to elevate productive expression — not mob theatrics,"" he said.

Swart cautioned that not all demonstrations are what they appear to be. In some cases, he said, interest groups or foreign entities can mirror legitimate advocacy networks — legally or otherwise — to obscure who is actually behind an event or campaign.

""I know how you'd structure a web of advocacy groups legally — and how someone could mirror that illegally,"" he said. ""I want to help the government figure out who's funding the division and shut it down.""

Swart said growing political polarization has created fertile ground for opportunists — both domestic and foreign — who thrive on outrage and confusion.

""Every time there's an incident, both sides start finger-pointing,"" he said. ""The real winners are the ones trying to divide us. They want Democrats and Republicans blaming each other instead of asking who's profiting from it.""

Swart said he's seen examples where the goal of protest activity was less about persuasion and more about generating viral conflict — an approach that, in his view, benefits those monetizing clicks, chaos and outrage.

His remarks echo recent U.S. intelligence warnings that foreign actors—particularly Russia, China and Iran—use disinformation to amplify divisive narratives in the U.S., and could try to spur unrest around major political events.

Swart also blamed major social-media platforms for monetizing outrage and accelerating polarization.

""They only make money when you're doom-scrolling,"" he said. ""If people liked each other, Facebook and X would be a tenth of their size.""

He said the problem cuts across ideological lines and is driven by the economics of engagement rather than politics.

""People try to label Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg politically, but both make money off division,"" Swart said. ""It's not about right or left — it's about engagement.""

Swart said the exploitation of division has become a national security concern, warning that agitators and influence networks may be working to destabilize the country for profit or geopolitical gain.

""This is one of the greatest national security threats that we face — America coming apart,"" he said. ""The sources of it are not right or left. The sources are far more sinister than that.""

Swart emphasized that his warnings aren't about any single protest or political movement but about a larger pattern — one where manipulation and misinformation can turn public expression into a tool for profit or chaos.

""The protest space has to be about purpose again,"" he said. ""If we don't figure that out, we're going to keep getting played by the people who thrive on conflict.""

Swart said he remains hopeful that awareness and transparency can help reduce the risks.

""Punch up, not down,"" he said. ""Let's stop finger-pointing and start coalition-building.""

President Donald Trump's family is cashing in on the presidential spotlight with less pushback than in the past.

During Trump's first administration, first daughter Ivanka, for example, was criticized for her brand endorsements, including a social media post about Goya beans. Ethics experts at the time complained that she, as a presidential adviser and federal employee, broke federal law.

Five years later, with no members of the first family part of the president's second administration, first granddaughter Kai Trump last month launched her own clothing line using photographs taken at the White House and first son Eric Trump this month is embarking on a book tour for his new memoir, “Under Siege: My Family's Fight to Save Our Nation,” with fewer or at least less vocal critics. 

FULL LIST OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT

Earlier this year, eldest first son Donald Trump Jr., also opened a private social club called the Executive Branch with membership fees reportedly $500,000, Eric's former Republican National Committee co-chair wife Lara, debuted a new television show on Fox News, and first lady Melania Trump created a memecoin. The first lady's documentary, Melania, for which Amazon MGM Studios paid $40 million, is being released on Jan. 30, too.

For Public Citizen government affairs lobbyist Craig Holman, the Trump family “cashing in” on the presidency “is a family affair on a scale never before seen in American political history,” as other experts underscore that it is not illegal.

“There have been occasional embarrassments to former presidents by a relative seeking financial gain from a family member serving as president, such as Hunter Biden receiving consulting fees from foreign governments and Billy Carter lending his family's reputation to sell a beer,” Holman told the Washington Examiner. “But nothing on the scale of the profiteering engineered by multiple family members of Donald Trump.”

Sometimes the profiteering benefits both Trump and the family member, including Eric Trump's book, which is out next Tuesday, according to Holman. Instead of following older sister Ivanka to the White House in 2017, Eric and Don Jr. have remained executives at the Trump Organization. Eric's portfolio incorporates Trump Hotels, Trump Golf, Trump Estates, and Trump Winery, in addition to the company's investments in cryptocurrency.

“The book features a foreword supposedly written by Donald Trump, and goes on to depict President Trump and various members of the Trump family in heroic perspectives,” Holman said. “The book has already become a bestseller on Amazon and will deliver Eric a very handsome profit.”

Sometimes the profiteering rewards the family member responsible for the sales, including Kai Trump's clothing line, Colman added. The 18-year-old golfer's profile has increased exponentially since her primetime appearance during last year's Republican National Convention.

“For monogrammed sweatshirts priced at $130 each, Kai's financial gain will also prove to be lucrative,” he said. “Early orders of the sweatshirt have already sold out because of high demand.”

Eric Trump spokeswoman Kimberly Benza dismissed ethics concerns regarding her boss, particularly with respect to his upcoming book.

“Unlike Hunter Biden, who cashed in on his father's position, selling influence and finger paintings, Eric Trump is a businessman, who has been in the private industry for 25 years, employing tens of thousands of people and has spent the last decade enduring relentless attacks from the radical left — attacks aimed at destroying his family, their business, and his father's legacy,” Benza told the Washington Examiner. There truly is no comparison.”

To that end, Hunter Biden wrote his own memoir in 2021 called Beautiful Things. His father, then-President Joe Biden, praised him for his “strength and courage to talk openly about his addiction so that others might see themselves in his journey and find hope.”

Another example from Hunter Biden, other than his amateur artwork being valued at $500,000, includes a report this week that he pursued a real estate deal in 2017 with a Chinese company for land around the U.S. Embassy in Romania predicated on relationships formed when his father was vice president.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN THE US: A TIMELINE OF KEY INCIDENTS 

The younger Biden, himself, has conceded he would not have had a $50,000-a-month seat on the board of Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings, which was central to Trump's first impeachment, if the elder Biden had not been vice president and leading Obama administration foreign policy in the region.

“I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden,” Hunter said in 2019. “There's literally nothing, as a young man or as a full grown adult that — my father in some way hasn't had influence over. It does not serve either one of us.”

A spokesperson for Kai Trump did not respond to the Washington Examiner's repeated requests for comment.

The New Yorker has estimated that the Trump family made $3.4 billion from the presidency between 2017 and August, including the $1 million membership fee for the president's Mar-a-Lago private resort in West Palm Beach, Florida, though about two-thirds of that amount is thought to be from cryptocurrency. 

Don Jr. and Eric Trump were criticized to an extent before the president's trip to the Middle East in May after they preceded his travel with their own to the region to promote the family's business interests, encompassing a $1 billion luxury hotel in the United Arab Emirates, a villa complex in Qatar, even a $2 billion investment from an Abu Dhabi firm into crypto exchange Binance that was facilitated by the Trump Organization's World Liberty Financial.

Claremont McKenna College politics professor John Pitney agreed with Public Citizen's Colman that “there is no real precedent for the scale and brazenness of the Trumps' profiteering,” citing Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, who Pitney told the Washington Examiner has “made a fortune from the Saudis.”

Kushner has been in the Middle East this week, despite not formally being part of the administration, to help negotiate the peace deal between Israel and Hamas, as well as to have meetings with the likes of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, alongside U.S. Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff, after multiple sit-downs with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Kushner last month struck a different deal with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and other stakeholders to take video-game maker Electronic Arts private through a $55 billion deal that is the largest leveraged buyout in history so far.

The Washington Examiner asked Trump this week about Kushner's role in the Israel-Hamas peace process. The president said, “Jared is a very smart guy,” especially after his experience during the first administration with the Abraham Accords. The Abraham Accords normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries.

“He's a very smart person, and he knows the region, knows the people, knows a lot of the players,” Trump continued. “We had a very smart group of people working this. We had a lot of different players, different countries, and very diverse countries, very different from each other.”

Earlier this month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned a reporter for asking how the administration decided it was “appropriate” for Kushner to become an emissary to “Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia — three countries that combined have given him more than $2.5 billion for his investment firm,” Affinity Partners.

“I think it's frankly despicable that you're trying to suggest that it's inappropriate for Jared Kushner, who is widely respected around the world and has great trust and relationships with these critical partners in these countries, to strike a 20-point comprehensive, detailed peace plan that no other administration would ever be able to achieve,” Leavitt said. “Jared is donating his energy and his time to our government, to the president of the United States, to secure world peace, and that is a very noble thing.”

For Pitney, the Claremont McKenna College professor, “the most unusual part” is Trump's participation, with the president's own memecoin providing foreign and domestic “influence-seekers” with an opportunity “to put vast sums into [his] own pocket.” 

Other examples include Trump's announcement last month that he would hold next year's Group of 20 leaders summit at his golf course in Miami, Florida, after the same proposal was postponed during his first administration because of ethics concerns and the COVID-19 pandemic – not to mention his own merchandise, from gold sneakers to bibles.

TRUMP BETS ON KUSHNER AND WITKOFF TO SEE THROUGH ISRAEL AND HAMAS PEACE DEAL

Regardless, Northeastern University politics professor Costas Panagopoulos reiterated that “while some may find capitalizing on these opportunities distasteful, it does not mean it is necessarily illegal or even unethical.”

“Of course, in some cases, some politicians or their associates cross the line and engage in corrupt practices, but that is not always the case,” Panagopoulos told the Washington Examiner.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A large number of federal workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were laid off, including some in error, as part of the Trump administration‘s response to the government shutdown, according to multiple reports.

The New York Times reported that the new workforce cuts, which hit multiple government agencies on Friday night, affected hundreds of CDC employees. Those included two leaders of the measles response team, members of the Epidemic Intelligence Service who respond to disease outbreaks, and staff at the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, considered the agency's flagship publication.

But at least some of those layoffs, which were decried by a former top CDC official under the administration as “devastating to Americans and to the global community,” have been sent in error.

ABC News reported on Saturday evening that a “coding error” led to CDC workers who are a part of the Ebola and measles response teams to mistakenly receive the reduction-in-force emails, citing one federal health official. The official said those employees would receive another notice rescinding their termination in a few days.

That error affected just four offices at the agency, with layoffs continuing across the government.

WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKER LAYOFFS HAVE BEGUN

Just ahead of the holiday weekend, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced the beginning of the layoffs, as the government shutdown entered its 10th day.

It is unclear how many total workers have been laid off so far, but an OMB spokesperson teased on Friday that the cuts would be “substantial.” President Donald Trump also said the layoffs will include “a lot of people,” as well as being “Democrat orientated.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Free speech is endangered; unbiased and trustworthy news is elusive. In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

It's not millennial cringe to wonder if you can enjoy the work of problematic artists.

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. It's based on value pluralism — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

My partner and I are having a disagreement about JK Rowling that we want you to weigh in on. For reference, we're a same-sex couple, and despite our different upbringing, we tend to have similar moral compasses and political feelings. 

I love the Harry Potter world — books, movies, broadway plays, video games, etc. He never did. We both agree that JK Rowling's transphobia is problematic and not something we tolerate. However, I still want to engage in the Harry Potter world, which I feel sends a positive message overall. 

To assuage my guilt, whenever I buy something Harry Potter-related that might make JK Rowling any money, I then donate a larger sum of money to the Human Rights Campaign. This is only in addition to what we typically give to the HRC. Is this acceptable? Is this hypocrisy? Am I an ethical Slytherin? Settle this for us.

Dear Guilty Gryffindor,

Ah, the classic “can we separate the art from the artist” question! I've encountered this dilemma before, and I'll tell you straight off the bat that I'm not the type to condemn you as a Slytherin just because you still want to engage with the works of JK Rowling.

I'm totally fine with reading books penned by problematic writers — even if their views have seeped into the books themselves — because I believe I'm capable of separating the wheat from the chaff in these works. And I think it insults readers' intelligence to assume that they're not capable of that.

In fact, so many of us have practically had to become experts at this sort of literary winnowing, because 99 percent of the books humanity has thrown at us contain that chaff. I'm a queer Jewish woman, and if I had to excise from my library every book whose writer was anti-LGBTQ, antisemitic, or misogynist, my shelves would be pretty much empty!

In the case of JK Rowling, both the writer and the books themselves present us with problems. We all know at this point how anti-trans the writer is and how much pain she's caused her fans. And she's not an author who lived centuries ago; she's active right now, and she still profits from Potter-related purchases (more on that soon). Plus, the books themselves have flaws, too. Remember when the Dursleys are mocked by the text for being overweight? Or when the goblins are portrayed as an antisemitic stereotype? Or when the werewolves are presented as a metaphor for HIV? Or when we're told that the house elves actually like being enslaved because their race makes them naturally subservient?

Still, you say that you feel the Harry Potter world sends a positive message overall, and you know what? I agree with you. The main moral message of the books is this: We shouldn't live in a supremacist society. We shouldn't be like Voldemort or like the Death Eaters, who believe “pure-blood” wizards and witches are inherently better than everyone else. We shouldn't discriminate against people who are Muggle-born (like Hermione) or who are poor (like Ron). We should recognize that everyone (even Snape, the Slythiest of Slytherins!) has the agency to choose who they want to become and ultimately do good.

This is the core message that made so many of us fall in love with the Harry Potter world as kids. It made us feel that it's okay to be different — that difference should be respected and even celebrated. Even though Rowling often undercut that open-hearted message with nonsense like “rightfully” enslaved house elves, most of us picked up the main moral message in spite of these flaws. And in that way, the books successfully achieved what good fiction is meant to achieve.

“In the war against moral obtuseness, the artist is our fellow fighter, frequently our guide,” writes the contemporary philosopher Martha Nussbaum. By exposing us to scene after scene of characters encountering moral conundrums, Nussbaum argues, good fiction trains our capacity for moral attention — the capacity to notice the morally salient features of a given situation so that we can respond appropriately.

The Harry Potter books successfully trained a generation of young readers to be exquisitely sensitive to discrimination and to reject it. And it's on precisely that basis that many of those young readers, now all grown up, reject Rowling's anti-trans views.

These readers can choose to reject her books, too. Some do, and that's totally alright. But some don't — and I think that's totally alright too.

In a 2020 episode of the popular podcast Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, co-hosts Casper ter Kuile and Vanessa Zoltan interviewed trans author Jackson Bird. They drew an analogy between reading Harry Potter and reading the Bible: Just as the Bible contains anti-gay statements that can make it painful reading for queer readers, and yet some of those readers still lovingly engage with the text, the same can be true for the Harry Potter books. As Bird said of such texts, “We continue to interrogate, but we still acknowledge and accept the ways in which they are useful for us, or healing.”

The “continue to interrogate” part is key here. Any fandom — whether it's centered on the Christian canon or the Harry Potter canon — is responsible for continuously revising how its canonical texts do and don't get to guide action. If you're going to continue to engage with the Bible, then you have to keep grappling with all the ways it's enabled harm, and you have to try to heal that harm. And if you're going to continue to engage with the Harry Potter world, then you have to continue to wrestle with its wrongs, too.

The good news is: That's doable! Religious communities have been proving that for ages. As early as 2000 years ago, Jewish theologians were inventing a genre called Midrash, which is basically ancient fanfiction; it reimagines problematic bits of the Bible in ways that make them more palatable or meaningful. And over the centuries, many Muslim and Christian theologians have been busy transforming their traditions, giving us everything from Islamic Modernism to Black liberation theology.

So, for you, what can interrogating the Potter canon look like in practice? I'd suggest connecting with other Potterheads so you can both enjoy and interrogate the content together. Whether that's a book club, a movie-watching marathon, a video game night with friends, or a Harry Potter and the Sacred Text episode that you listen to with your partner in the car, the point is to engage with the content and then critically discuss it.

The benefit of doing this in community is that it can actually generate social good. If you end up discussing the house elves, say, you might end up talking about how even the good guys in Rowling's books are way too content with maintaining the status quo rather than calling for systemic change (Dumbledore treats his enslaved house elves nicely, but he still enslaves house elves!). That could lead you into all sorts of discussions about how you are or aren't challenging the status quo in our Muggle world.

If you engage with Rowling's work this way, I think it's plausible that the positive social value you'll be generating will outweigh any negative social value you might create by continuing to be a Potterhead. And, crucially, I suspect you'll stop feeling guilty.

Right now, your strategy to ward off guilt is to focus on the financial aspect of all this — how your Potter-related purchases end up materially benefiting Rowling and, through her, the type of organizations she might support. On a dollar-for-dollar level, this is something you can “offset” by donating to the Human Rights Campaign. In fact, since Rowling is already a billionaire, buying a video game now is not appreciably moving the needle for her, while donating hundreds or thousands of dollars to the HRC could plausibly make a difference to that nonprofit. So this strategy is nothing to sneeze at.

But it's not enough. And we can tell it's not enough because you still feel guilty. You probably have some intuitive sense that you can't just buy moral absolution (Accio clear conscience!). On its own, offsetting feels cheap, and the reason it feels cheap is that it's not demanding that any transformative work take place — either for you personally or for society more broadly.

To reiterate a common critique of philanthropy: Just writing a check does not represent a commitment to a broader project of solidarity or justice. It's letting you throw a pittance at the problem without requiring you to participate, through your own hard work, in changing the status quo and creating systemic change.

Remember, shying away from systemic change is how Rowling deals with problems in her books. You can do better.

Maybe you've had this experience lately: You're riding high, feeling good about yet another record high in stocks, and then someone pops up on TV to kill the vibe. ""It's an AI bubble,"" they say. ""It's like 1999.""

This actually happened to me last week (before President Trump's new tariff threat sent stocks tumbling on Friday). I'd just read some convincing research arguing against a bubble, only to have my good mood ruined by a TV segment saying the opposite. Tired of the whiplash, I decided to plant my flag in the ""not a bubble"" camp. (Read the story here.)

Imagine my surprise when the most pushback I got came from my own boss, Steve Russolillo, BI's chief news editor and frequent author of this newsletter on Sundays.

Steve is worried that we are in an AI bubble — one that could get bigger and eventually pop more spectacularly than the dot-com boom and bust.

We decided to sit down and hash it out.

Valuations

Steve: Joe, I read your piece with great intrigue, but I must say the old-school thinking in me shudders when Wall Street firms start using non-traditional metrics to justify a rally — as both Goldman and Morgan Stanley did.

Conversely, a tried-and-true valuation indicator — the Shiller P/E ratio, which dates back to the 19th century — is at a frighteningly high level, above 40. It was higher during the dot-com bubble. Ignore the ratio at your peril: it accurately projected market tops in 1929 and 1999-2000, and also flashed red before the mid-2000s housing crash.

Joe: I agree the Shiller P/E is alarming! But I also think it's failing to account for a few key attributes of the companies leading the market. If you adjust valuation measures for profit growth, cash flow, and profit margins, parallels to the dot-com era weaken significantly.

And yes, Wall Street loves to create new metrics to paint the story they want to tell. But in this case, the adjustments paint a more accurate and modern picture of corporate health.

Company quality

Joe: The companies driving the AI revolution are just stronger. On average, they have better cash flow, operate more efficiently, and are more profitable. That's certainly the case for the absolute biggest names responsible for moving the market: Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.

Steve: There's no denying the dominance of the biggest companies. In fact, they're a little too dominant for my liking. The Mag 7 stocks make up more than one-third of the S&P 500. The concentration risk in the market is enormous — it's rare that so few companies make up such a large percentage of the overall index. Any stumble in even just one of these companies could drag the market down, and fast.

A circular economy

Steve: New deals in the AI space are announced almost daily nowadays. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being thrown around, with a growing chorus of investors and analysts wondering about the circular nature of the deals — and their sustainability. ""If anyone decides to pause and ask, 'What's our real economic return here?' it could be a big problem,"" Jim Chanos, the guy who shorted Enron, warned recently.

Joe: I must admit, OpenAI's position at the center of so many of these deals does make me a bit uneasy. Especially about companies like Oracle and CoreWeave, whose fates are now completely intertwined with it. But a recent Bank of America note put my mind at ease, forecasting that just 5% to 10% of spending by 2030 will be vendor-financed.

If you ask me, warnings of an AI bubble are becoming an unsustainable bubble of their own.

Steve: OK, this is getting too meta for me.

Where do you stand on the big AI bubble debate? We'd love to hear your thoughts. Please email jciolli@businessinsider.com and srussolillo@businessinsider.com.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ian Carter, a 33-year-old job seeker in Redmond, Washington, who previously worked as a technical program manager at Microsoft. It has been edited for length and clarity.

On May 13, I was getting lunch at a Panera Bread when I just happened to check my email. When I read it, it felt like a gut punch. I'd been laid off from my Microsoft job.

My mind started racing. Could I have done something different? Could I have been better? However, I eventually realized it was simply a business decision. I'd seen the company lay off a lot of people in recent years, and it felt like it didn't matter if you were a great worker or not — everybody was at risk.

When I was laid off, I was on medical leave for a personal health issue and had been planning to return to work in the coming days. I collected my last paycheck in mid-July and then received some severance pay, but I started applying for jobs almost immediately. My mindset was ""I can cry while I apply.""

I decided to share that I'd been laid off on LinkedIn, and the post received over 115,000 impressions. I began receiving messages from recruiters about opportunities, and I've landed interviews at companies that include Disney and Nintendo.

But it's now been five months since my layoff, and I'm still looking for a job. I've been drawing on my savings to pay the bills and renting my one-bedroom apartment on a month-to-month lease for about $2,700 — all while crossing my fingers that I land a role soon.

My lease ends the week of October 20, and if I don't have a job offer by then, I'm planning to move across the country to Florida to live with my family and save money until I find a job. Rent is expensive, but rent without income coming in is doubly expensive.

If I had to guess why I, along with many others at Microsoft and other Big Tech companies, have been laid off in recent years, I'd point to two factors: overhiring during the pandemic and massive investments in AI.

Whatever the reason, it's clear that finding a job in tech has become significantly more difficult. Before my layoff, I regularly heard from college students struggling to break into the industry. The market already seemed tougher than when I graduated — and now, I'm seeing that firsthand.

I'm in a spot where I have nearly four years of full-time experience — not quite a new grad, but not senior level, either. I think some companies are looking for one or the other, which has made my search harder. Others are seeking very specific skill sets, while mine can sometimes be viewed as more generalist.

As I've searched for work, I've been trying to develop my AI skills, as job postings suggest that companies are increasingly valuing this expertise. Working at Microsoft also gave me insight into the value of AI skills. During my last year, I didn't personally feel that my performance expectations had risen too much, but I did feel some pressure to find ways to incorporate AI into my work.

During my job search, I've tried to replicate the strategies that got me to this point in my career.

I dropped out of high school in 2009 for health-related reasons, but I eventually earned my GED and enrolled at a community college, where I earned my associate degree and then went on to attend Florida State University. During this period, I built my network on LinkedIn — I now have more than 8,700 followers — which helped me secure interviews and ultimately land an internship at Salesforce. A company recruiter reached out to me, which is how I learned about the role and landed an interview.

Having the internship on my résumé helped me land full-time interviews after graduation. I had a list of dream companies — including Microsoft, Amazon, and Netflix — and I applied to a program manager role at Microsoft without a referral. After an interview, I eventually received a job offer. In 2021, I graduated from Florida State with a bachelor's degree in computer science and began working remotely for Microsoft due to the pandemic. In 2022, I moved to Redmond, Washington — where the company is headquartered — and before I was laid off, I had a six-figure salary.

As I've searched for work — targeting program manager, project manager, and product management roles — I've tried to rely on my existing network and make new connections.

When I see a role that interests me, I reach out to the recruiter or someone with a similar job title at the company and ask what they think their company is looking for in a candidate. I then tailor my résumé accordingly.

Since I have a LinkedIn Premium account, I have more visibility into who views my profile. If they have an interesting job title, I'll send them a message. Most of the time, they respond because they recall visiting my page, which leads to a conversation.

When I connect with people, I usually ask for advice rather than a referral. But if someone offers to give me one, I gladly accept.

While these connections have helped me land some interviews, I'm still looking for a job offer.

Going forward, my plan is to continue doing what I'm doing — applying for jobs, networking as much as possible, and developing my AI skills. However, if my job search drags on, I might consider pursuing a graduate degree, such as an MBA or a degree related to AI.

In addition to networking for job opportunities, I've also reached out to others who've been laid off to discuss our shared experiences. Layoffs take a mental toll, and it's nice to talk to people who can relate.

I sometimes visit the private ""MSFT Survivors"" Facebook group, which includes people who've been laid off throughout the company's history. It's always interesting to read about what others are going through and their stories. It makes me feel like I'm not alone.

This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Ron Podmore, 58, a retired teacher who decided to live out his retirement in Guatemala. He still owns property in Washington and spends about half the year there as he begins the Guatemala residency process. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

I retired two years ago, in June 2023.

I was a high school teacher, and I decided to take early retirement after 32 years of teaching. But because of the fact that I was not eligible for social security, I was only able to receive half of my pension. I will get the other half about six years from now when I turn 65, or whenever I choose to also tap into my social security. It's kind of a mixed blessing, but it seems to be working for me.

I knew that if I was going to pull the plug, so to speak, and retire early, there was a huge gap. There is no way in heck I wanted to be teaching up until I was 65 and then immediately go on social security.

I have seen too many teachers where they're holding on until they turn 65, and then they're going to retire and go on social security, and six months later they're six feet under.

I was using the FIRE method. I spent probably the better part of the last 20 years investing each time I got a pay raise. It worked out favorably for me over the last 20 or 25 years.

Around 2013, I noticed an influx of migrant students coming into my classroom from Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador, and I got to know some of these kids.

I was led to believe that Guatemala is this country with endemic poverty, crime, corruption, cartels — who on earth would want to go down there? And these kids really said, ""You need to rethink that.""

They encouraged me to travel to Guatemala, and in 2013 or 2014, I took my first trip down there. Then I ended up going down there once or twice a year.

In 2018, I purchased a small condominium in the working-class area of Guatemala City, knowing that if I needed to, I could migrate out of the United States and be able to live down there.

So I had already purchased the property as an investment before I retired, and then I was able to make payments on it. My goal was to have it all paid off by the time I retired. And sure enough, I was able to pay it all off, so I have no mortgage on that unit.

I was making payments on it every month, and then I also expedited that by making extra payments on the principal, and I was able to pay it off within eight years. In order to do that, I took out a HELOC loan against the value of the house that I have in Federal Way, which is a suburb just south of Seattle. When you purchase property, in most places around the world, it's all cash. You cannot go to the bank of that country and ask for a loan. You have to take care of your financing with whatever bank you have in the United States or your home country.

The property that I purchased down there is a two-bedroom, one-bath with underground parking, concierge services, security, et cetera, and that was for about $125,000. The mortgage was for 10 years, just under $1,500.

There was no renting — it was vacant for years. It was just a matter of time for me to begin furnishing, purchasing things like the couches, and the chairs, and the dining room tables, and the beds, and stuff like that.

I had to do that little by little over the eight years. At the time, I was living in Washington State, and you have to factor in airplane tickets to get down there, and how much money you're going to spend on not only purchasing these items, but also having them delivered and being there and so forth. It took me about two or three years to build it all up.

I started being down there full-time in August 2024. I'm in the process of securing a temporary and a permanent residency card. That's about a three- to five-year long process.

I would be getting a visa that would allow me to live in Guatemala for extended periods of time — greater than six months.

Right now, as it is, I'm only allowed to stay in Guatemala up to six months at a time.

I have a private health insurance plan in Guatemala that runs me about $315 a month; no deductibles and no copay. That's a private hospital that also covers medicines, X-rays, MRIs, and hospital stays, and you do not get a bill at the end of any of that.

And there is such a contrast for superior services: they have better bedside manners in Central America. You're not surrounded by a certified nursing assistant or an intake specialist or a finance and operations person determining how are you going to make these payments and everything. You go into an office, the reception is right there, and the second person you see is the doctor.

Glasses, optometry, and dental I am not insured on. When I'm down there I get my teeth cleaned every six months, just like I do up here, and my teeth cleaning on average is about $65 per visit. To contrast that, when I was going to get my teeth cleaned at my local dentist up here in Washington, that would be close to $800 or $900. What the insurance carrier for dental is not covering of that is forced onto me. So each time I went to get my teeth cleaned in the States, it was slightly over $200 for my portion of the bill.

If you think about the concept of snowbirds, at least out here on the West Coast, we have a huge influx of people in their fifties who decide to retire early and they immediately relocate to Southern California, Southern Arizona, Southern New Mexico, in border towns all along the Texas border, so they can have immediate access — to drive to the border or walk across the border — to purchase their prescriptions, get their teeth done, get their X-rays done, or go into the local hospital.

If there is an emergency, they're going to run over to that border before they dial 911 in the United States.

I've just taken that concept one extra country over, which is the next country after Mexico, and that's Guatemala.

When my partner and I began planning a couple's trip to Tunisia, we decided to do something different. Instead of turning to travel sites, we let AI take the lead.

Recently, I've outsourced a lot of my life to ChatGPT — from work projects to personal errands. So, I thought, why not travel planning, too?

ChatGPT has always been my top choice, but my partner wanted to see what Claude—the one she likes the most—would plan for our Italian holiday.

We wanted to see which AI bot planned the best trip. But through this friendly competition, we learned just how differently my partner and I like to travel.

We didn't want chaos, so we set limits. We picked our timeline and the cities in advance: Tunis, Tozeur, and Hammamet.

Then we handed the itinerary-building over to the bots, with each AI designing one full day in each city.

Of course, there were overlaps, but they each produced different trips.

ChatGPT, for example, came back with what felt like a movie script. Tunis started with a sunrise walk through Sidi Bou Saïd, pastries and mint tea in hand, followed by a whirlwind through the Medina and a dramatic half-day at the ruins of Carthage. Then, in Tozeur, it pulled the cinematic card with ""Star Wars"" filming sets in the desert, and camel rides across dunes at sunset. Hammamet, meanwhile, was framed as a finale of seaside lounging, alternating between couscous feasts and beach walks. It was ambitious, colorful, and a little chaotic — but also thrilling.

Claude's version was slower and more contained. In Tunis, it recommended a guided food tour, before sending us to Carthage for a more paced, historical visit. In Tozeur, it skipped the desert dash altogether, focusing instead on the Medina and a relaxed afternoon by an oasis. It also added two important cultural pit stops we hadn't considered. Hammamet was stripped back to a cultural visit to the Kasbah and an early dinner overlooking the water. Less cinematic, more logical.

Of course, we then needed to build our own itinerary, taking activities recommended by both lists.

ChatGPT's ambitious Tozeur day nearly flattened us. The long drive was far from the breezy jaunt it implied, and when we finally got close, a sandstorm had blocked the highway. ""The Star Wars"" sets were out of reach, proof that no itinerary can control nature.

Still, other parts of ChatGPT's plan delivered — like Sidi Bou Saïd, where whitewashed walls and cobalt-blue shutters glowed in the sun as we sipped mint tea above the sea. It felt like stepping into a painting.

Claude's food tour in Tunis was a big highlight. We enjoyed sesame-coated pastries as we drifted through narrow streets, pointing toward stalls and corners we would never have found on our own.

Claude also surprised us with two inspired detours: the Great Mosque of Kairouan and El Jem amphitheater. Both were extraordinary stops, layered with history and stillness.

As the trip unfolded, it became clear we were not just comparing AI bots. We were surprised to see our own travel personalities reflected back at us.

ChatGPT's energy mirrored mine: scattershot but adventurous, willing to gamble on exhaustion for the sake of a memory. Claude's calm matched my partner: thoughtful, practical, deliberate.

If we are scoring, ChatGPT delivered the better memories. Claude delivered comfort and culture. But neither really won.

What they gave us was a way of traveling that reflected us back at ourselves — two personalities and two rhythms woven into one trip.

Tunisia was beautiful, bewildering, and slightly AI-engineered. It proved that the best journey is never about choosing one itinerary over the other but about learning how we move through the world together, even when the paths are different.

If you've got that nagging itch about changing roles, you may be onto something.

AWS senior vice president of applied AI solutions Colleen Aubrey has spent over 20 years at Amazon, building its advertising business from the ground up. She's also a member of the company's elite S-Team. 

She told Business Insider that throughout her career, she's faced numerous challenges — and as she puts it, ""pretty much every six months, something significant changes.""

""We have a new product idea; there's a new problem to go after; there's a new customer to get to understand,"" Aubrey said.

That ""constant change"" is the reason she's stayed at Amazon for as long as she has, and remains engaged in her work. For anyone questioning whether they're in the right role or ready for a new challenge, Aubrey said there are typically three boxes to check off.

""Are you in a place which ticks those boxes? And if you aren't, then maybe it's worth looking at changing the mix, in order to get that,"" Aubrey said. ""Because I think when you have those elements, then work is invigorating.""

Here's what you should consider, she said:

Aubrey told Business Insider that you should first ask yourself whether you're working for a leader with whom you have mutual respect.

""Are you working for a leader that you respect, that you're inspired by, that you're learning from, and vice versa?"" Aubrey said.

Aubrey said that people generally need their leaders to help with the things only they can provide: resourcing, hard decisions, trade-offs, judgment calls, prioritization, advocacy, and big-picture thinking.

Sometimes, people end up with a manager who isn't the right match, even if that person is trying their best. The executive said it can become challenging to work in a space where you feel ""disenchanted,"" and in that case, it may be time to move on to something new.

""You can choose to live through it and be dissatisfied. I think that's challenging,"" Aubrey said.

Aubrey said you should also ask yourself if you're working on the right team. The executive has worked on various teams throughout her roughly two decades at the retail giant. The right team includes people you're really learning from, she said.

""Are they challenging you, or is it a creative and innovative environment that works for you?"" Aubrey said.

Amazon's infamous ""two-pizza teams"" describes the ideal team to promote innovation. The idea is that no team should be big enough that it would take more than two pizzas to feed them. The ideal size is somewhere around six to eight people, and the goal is for those teams to own something from end-to-end.

The third question you should ask yourself is what stage of the business you want to work in, Aubrey said.

""It's important to think through what is the type of product and business and problem that you like solving,"" Aubrey said. ""Are you in a place that has that type of characteristics?""

For example, Aubrey said she had a colleague who worked on the retail side, which can be a complicated and demanding area, but he loved finding improvements in cost optimization and in the supply chain. Personally, she said she loves ""X-factor growth,"" or working on a part of the business ripe for exponential growth.

""I like the blank sheet of paper,"" Aubrey said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Baby boomers still love their department stores. Here's what they know that Gen Zers don't","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/12/department-store-perks-rival-some-online-retailers.html","Sun, 12 Oct 2025 11:30:01 GMT","



Department stores may be falling out of favor with today's younger consumers, but there's a reason older shoppers keep coming back.

Whether it's more generous return policies, promotional events or deep discounts, ""if you can learn the benefits of what a store brings you, it creates a much greater experience,"" said Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor for market research firm Circana.

For example, if a sales associate doesn't have an item you want in stock, often they'll get it and ship it to you at no cost, Cohen said — ""that's a big perk.""

And yet, for younger shoppers, the mentality is ""I don't want to shop where my mother shops,"" he said.

To be sure, at Macy's and its subsidiary Bloomingdale's, for example, the majority of customers are above the age of 45, according to new Consumer Edge data.

Baby boomers are also much more likely to say in-store shopping is their most common way of making purchases, compared with Generation Z, or those born between 1997 and 2012, according to a Capital One report from March.

""The younger generation grew up online,"" Cohen said. ""The challenge for department stores is to break that paradigm.""

Social media plays a big role in how younger consumers make purchases, added Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at TD Cowen. It's a trend he refers to as ""the tiktokification of retail.""

But while shopping primarily online may seem quick and convenient, it does come with extra hassles.

It can mean relying on a practice known as ""bracketing,"" or ordering multiple products in different sizes or colors with the intention of keeping a few and returning the rest — adding more time and cost to each transaction.

As online retailers try to keep those returns in check, most have rolled out stricter policies, including charging a return or restocking fee, according to a 2023 report from return management company Happy Returns.

But even now, some department stores have held on to the more generous policies of yesteryear, with longer return windows or free shipping, and that has gone a long way when it comes to building brand loyalty.

""There are some savings opportunities that you have when you shop in person that you probably wouldn't have online,"" said Edgar Dworsky, founder of ConsumerWorld.org.

Although Bloomingdale's shortened its return window to 30 days from 90 days last year, shoppers appreciate the other perks, according to Nancy Quinn, a personal stylist at the flagship store in New York City.

""The biggest thing that Bloomingdale's offers is customer service, that is really where we shine,"" Quinn said.

Quinn meets her clients, who are mostly women between the ages of 45 and 70, by appointment to help them find clothing for everyday or special occasions. She said she will often waive the shipping fee or send the purchases via messenger at no charge to locations in Manhattan. At times, she has even hand-delivered an item — also as a complimentary service — if the customer is local and under a time constraint.

""Those are things that we try to do to make sure people know how much we appreciate the business,"" Quinn said. At many high-end department stores, personal stylists work on commission and the assistance they provide is free for customers.

Quinn's appointments book up especially quickly when Bloomingdale's runs promotional events, such as ""friends and family,"" which is typically a 25% discount across many brands.

Still, Quinn says younger customers are less likely to shop with her.

""It's a generational thing,"" Quinn said. ""A lot of younger people are shopping online."" Alternatively, ""the women I am meeting are really ready to make an investment in themselves and their wardrobe.""

To be sure, U.S. department stores have been in a slump for years. Retailers like JCPenney and Macy's have struggled to compete against online retailers and smaller brick-and-mortar stores that can better adapt to changing consumer preferences.

""Small new brands that are emerging have just as much marketing power because the internet levels the playing field,"" said Circana's Cohen.

However, department stores aren't dead yet.

Last year, Macy's said it would close some of its namesake stores and open more Bloomingdale's locations. According to the company's quarterly report, Bloomingdale's performed better because of its focus on the luxury brands that appeal to higher-income shoppers.  

""Selective higher-end stores"" are outpacing the competition, in part because ""middle- and lower-income consumers have been disproportionately negatively impacted by the rising cost of necessities,"" said TD Cowen's Chen.

In an interview last month, Macy's CEO Tony Spring told CNBC that the consumer remains resilient and continues to spend on new items and fashion, despite concerns about tariffs.

The challenge for department stores is to bring shoppers in, even as managing inventory and pricing gets increasingly difficult, Chen said. ""It is ironic because everybody does love stores and humans want connection.""

In this article

Investors are looking beyond the prolonged U.S. government shutdown and remain optimistic about growth drivers like the artificial intelligence boom and expectations of further interest rate cuts.

Ignoring the short-term noise, those looking for attractive investment opportunities can consider the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts, whose recommendations are based on a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals and growth catalysts.

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

First on this week's list is Snowflake (SNOW), a cloud-native data platform. At the recently held Snowflake World Tour event in New York City, the company highlighted its product innovation and the vision for driving business transformation through data and artificial intelligence.

After attending this customer conference, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated a buy rating on SNOW stock with a price forecast of $270. Based on his conversations with customers and partners at the event, the analyst noted that Snowflake's product innovation and velocity are accelerating.

Thill highlighted that while traction for Snowflake's AI offerings is building, the inflection point is still ahead. For instance, the top-rated analyst noted that a retailer using Snowpark ML for demand forecasting, and a travel company integrating Snowflake ML models into its customer experience pipeline, both believe that broader usage across their organizations will take a few more quarters.

Another key takeaway was that Snowflake's unstructured data capabilities have strengthened, but there are still some gaps to address. Overall, Thill believes that while traction is building for Snowflake, the ""AI Blizzard"" still lies ahead.

""SNOW remains one of our favorite data & AI stories and stands to benefit meaningfully as enterprise AI strategies mature and AI driven data volumes grow exponentially in the coming years,"" concluded Thill. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a ""neutral"" rating on Snowflake stock with a price target of $255.

Thill ranks No. 251 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.1%. See Snowflake Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Moving on to chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which recently made headlines after announcing a game-changing partnership with OpenAI. Under this deal, OpenAI will deploy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs over multiple years, starting with a 1-gigawatt rollout in the second half of 2026. The agreement also involves a warrant for up to 160 million shares (vesting tied to certain milestones), which, if fully exercised by OpenAI, will give it about a 10% stake in AMD.

Following the news, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis upgraded AMD stock to buy from hold and boosted the price target to $300 from $170. Additionally, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on AMD stock with a price target of $232.

Curtis believes that AMD's deal with OpenAI clearly changed the AI narrative for the semiconductor company. While the chipmaker will still have to achieve some milestones, the 5-star analyst believes that this partnership is a solid confirmation of AMD's AI roadmap and a proof of robust AI demand in general.

Interestingly, Curtis recently raised his estimates for AMD following positive server checks. The analyst stated he was incrementally positive on AMD after his recent Asia trip, with the expectation of 500 basis points per year share gains in server CPUs with the company's Venice platform.

However, these recent checks hadn't helped Curtis grasp anything from the original device manufacturers (ODMs) in terms of AI ramps. ""The announcement of OpenAI as a lead customer with the potential for $80-100B in revenue across 6GW of compute through 2030 materially changes that outlook,"" said Curtis.

Curtis ranks No. 68 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.5%. See AMD ETF Exposure on TipRanks.

IT infrastructure and personal computing solutions provider Dell Technologies (DELL) announced an increase in its long-term financial targets during its analyst meeting on Oct. 7. The improved outlook is backed by demand from the ongoing AI wave.

Following the event, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a buy rating on DELL stock and raised his price target to $170 from $160. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a ""neutral"" rating on DELL stock with a price target of $135.

Rakesh noted management's commentary about momentum in enterprise and sovereign AI, with strong demand signals over 12-18 months. The top-rated analyst highlighted that the company raised its compound annual growth rate target for revenue for fiscal 2026 to 2030 to the range of 7% to 9%, with non-GAAP EPS expected to rise by 15% or more.

Furthermore, Rakesh noted that Dell's fiscal 2026 AI server revenue estimate of $20 billion is in line with the Street's consensus of $20.6 billion and reflects over 100% growth from $9.8 billion in the previous year. The company expects a 20% to 25% CAGR through Fiscal 2030, implying AI server revenue of $46 billion.

However, the analyst believes that this growth outlook could be conservative, as the company is involved in all at-scale AI cluster deployments and leads in T2 CSP (tier 2 cloud service providers) and enterprise AI deployments with more than 3,000 customers.

Rakesh ranks No. 81 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 24.3%. See Dell Technologies Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks.

In the second week of the U.S. government shutdown, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified some 1,300 employees they would be laid off — then rescinded hundreds of those notices within hours, a person familiar with the matter said.

The Trump administration is set to lay off entire offices and hundreds of CDC workers as part of mass job cuts during the federal shutdown, four sources told Reuters on Saturday.

A crowd-sourced list from CDC employees, reviewed by Reuters, suggested several units, including the entire Washington office, were targeted for termination. Two sources within the CDC and two at other health agencies confirmed the list's validity.

The White House and CDC did not respond to requests for comment. President Donald Trump on Friday blamed Democrats for the latest round of layoffs, which extend across the U.S. government, following through on his shutdown-related threats.

Around 400 CDC staff reported receiving notices indicating their entire units had been laid off, totaling an estimated 1,300 job losses, said one of the sources familiar with data on the layoffs.

But soon after, 90 staffers at units employing 700 total people confirmed their notices had been reversed by Saturday evening, said the person, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The cuts targeted only workers deemed ""non-essential"" by their units, said a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the Atlanta-based CDC.

""HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda,"" HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said in a statement.

Among the CDC workers initially cut were staff responsible for the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a critical vehicle for disseminating public health findings. That unit, along with employees at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and early-career epidemiologists involved in outbreak investigations, had their dismissals reversed, the person said.

CDC employees at units responsible for workplace safety, human resources, the CDC library and the Washington office have not reported indications of reversals.

Saturday's reversal is not the first time the CDC has changed course on job cuts. Earlier this year, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. oversaw the dismissal of 2,400 employees, only to rehire 942 of them months later.

He has repeatedly criticized the CDC, calling it ""the most corrupt government agency.""

Kennedy, who has long promoted vaccine misinformation, gutted the CDC's independent vaccine advisory panel and oversaw the ouster of its director a month into her tenure, as part of his wider efforts to remake the nation's vaccine policies.

Public health experts say his work as a public figure has contributed to declining immunization rates and exposed a growing number of youth to preventable diseases like measles.

China on Sunday said ""we are not afraid of"" a trade war with the United States after President Donald Trump vowed to impose punishing new retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports.

A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce accused the U.S. of a ""textbook double standard"" with Trump's promise on Friday to tack on additional 100% tariffs on those imports after China imposed new export controls on rare earths minerals.

That promise in a social media post by the president shook U.S. stock markets on Friday, erasing $2 trillion in equity values in a single day.

Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,"" the ministry spokesperson said.

""China's position on the trade war is consistent: we do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,"" they added.

The spokesperson said that the United States ""for a long time … has been overstretching the concept of national security, abusing export control, taking discriminatory actions against China, and imposing unilateral long-arm jurisdiction measures on various products, including semiconductor equipment and chips.""

The U.S. Commerce Control list covers more than 3,000 items, more than three times the approximately 900 items on China's Export Control List of Dual-use Items, the spokesperson said.

China called its export controls on rare earth exports a ""legitimate"" measure under international law, pushing back against U.S. accusations of economic coercion.

The Commerce Ministry said the controls, issued Thursday, were part of Beijing's effort to strengthen its export control system and ""better safeguard world peace and regional stability"" amid what it described as a turbulent global security environment.

The measures, which now cover not only rare earth materials but also related intellectual property and technologies, were announced just weeks before a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

""These controls do not constitute export bans. Applications that meet the requirements will be approved,"" the Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.

""China has fully assessed the potential impact of these measures on the supply chain and is confident that the impact will be very limited.""

Beijing's new curbs also require foreign entities to obtain a license to export products containing more than 0.1% of domestically-sourced rare earths, or manufactured using China's extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology. Applications for items that could be used in weapons or other military purposes will be denied.

Shortly after Beijing tightened export controls on rare earths, the European Chamber of Commerce in China reported a backlog of export license applications awaiting approval, saying the new restrictions ""add further complexity to the global supply chains of rare earth elements.""

In response to Beijing's move, Trump on Friday announced new tariffs of 100% on imports from China ""over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying"" beginning Nov. 1.

Trump also said that the U.S., on that same date, would also impose export controls on ""any and all critical software.""

Stock markets plunged after Trump said on Truth Social that ""there is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive'"" with its rare earths policy.

China accounts for about 70% of the global supply of rare earths and has repeatedly used the critically needed minerals as a bargaining chip in trade discussions.

Hours after tightening export controls on rare earths, Beijing also announced that it would start charging U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports from Oct. 14, mirroring a new U.S. fee on Chinese vessels arriving at U.S. ports, set to take effect the same day.

The U.S. accounts for only 0.1% of global shipbuilding, compared to 53.3% for China, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

China's Commerce Ministry defended its reciprocal decision as ""necessary passive defensive actions."" It added that the U.S. actions ""seriously undermined the atmosphere of the economic and trade talks between the two sides.""

Senior U.S. and Chinese officials met for trade negotiations in Geneva in May — the first since Trump launched a global trade war. A follow-up meeting in London in June led to a trade ""framework,"" while a third round of high-level talks took place a month later in Stockholm, where both sides signaled progress in negotiations.

The most recent trade meetings in Madrid in September yielded a ""basic framework consensus"" on the divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok, ahead of a deadline to either sell off its U.S. business or shut down the social media app in the country.

On Sept. 19, Trump and Xi spoke on the phone but did not finalize a deal on TikTok. After the call, Trump announced that he and Xi agreed to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum during the last week of October in Gyeongju, South Korea.

While China has been silent on future meetings, Trump had also said he would visit China early next year and that Xi would come to the U.S. at a later date.

However, Trump on Friday threatened in a social media post to cancel his upcoming meeting with Xi after China's latest tightening of export curbs on rare earths.

It's that time of the year when the CNBC International team gets to cross the Atlantic for a full week of coverage from Washington, D.C.

While we may be on American soil, Europe will take center stage as we speak to central bank governors and finance ministers from across the continent who are attending the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Annual Meetings.

Besides the many macro-economic demands, there are some homegrown challenges to confront.

So far, the second half of the year has been marked by political and economic divergence in Europe. At a time when the bloc should be united, given a raft of external pressures, nations are preoccupied with domestic issues.

France remains a flashpoint. As CNBC's Charlotte Reed reports from Paris, the unprecedented political uncertainty has rattled the French bond market.

In Washington, D.C., CNBC's Karen Tso will speak to Banque de France Governor and European Central Bank Board Member Francois Villeroy de Galhau about how the turmoil in the Elysée Palace is affecting monetary policy decisions.

Last week, he told RTL Radio, ""we're all fed up with this political mess"", warning it's eroding business and consumer sentiment, and could shave up to 0.2% off economic growth.

Germany, by contrast, is on firmer footing. Goldman Sachs forecasts the economy will outperform in 2026 as Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government prioritizes fiscal ""speed and execution.""

Music to the ears of Bundesbank Chief Joachim Nagel, who will be speaking to CNBC during the IMF/World Bank meeting. 

However, he has urged caution, warning in a New York Times interview that Europe cannot afford complacency over trade tariffs, Chinese competition or central bank independence.

Meanwhile, the sun continues to shine on the Spanish economy, as the nation receives a double thumbs-up from the ratings agencies, with both Moody's and Fitch joining S&P Global in upgrading its credit rating.

This week, CNBC will speak to Finance Minister Carlos Cuerpo, who used strong economic momentum, relative to its European neighbors, to push for reforms to the bloc's financial markets.

Tuesday: German inflation data, U.K. unemployment data, Ericsson earnings

Warner Bros Discovery has rebuffed Paramount Skydance's initial takeover approach as too low, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday.

Warner Bros rejected Paramount's offer of around $20 per share in recent weeks, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Paramount declined to comment on the report, while Warner Bros did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

Paramount, led by David Ellison, is exploring several paths in its bid for Warner Bros, including increasing its offer, appealing directly to shareholders or securing extra support from a financial partner, Bloomberg said.

Paramount has been in talks with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management about backing its bid, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.

Ellison took over Paramount in August after completing an $8 billion merger with his film production company Skydance Media.

Gift cards have long been the go-to for last-minute holiday shoppers — easy to buy, easy to wrap, and usually appreciated. But many of those cards end up forgotten in drawers, unspent or lost to expiration dates. A new kind of gift card aims to change that by turning gifting into an investment opportunity: Bitcoin.

Fold (NASDAQ:FLD), a fintech company founded to make Bitcoin more accessible to everyday consumers, recently launched what it calls the first-ever Bitcoin gift card. The cards are being rolled out to major retailers nationwide through a partnership with Blackhawk Network, one of the largest gift card distributors in the U.S.

""Fold was founded with the idea that Bitcoin could be an incredible tool for savings for everyday people, specifically for millennials who are finding it increasingly hard to build savings,"" Fold CEO Will Reeves told Benzinga. ""And Bitcoin has been the best performing asset of the last decade.""

Fold started by letting users earn Bitcoin instead of traditional cash-back or airline miles rewards. Since its founding, Reeves says customers have earned over $90 million in Bitcoin rewards, compared to less than $20 million had they opted for cash back.

The Bitcoin gift card functions like a traditional one, but with digital potential. Shoppers can buy the card online or off a retail shelf for a set dollar amount. The recipient redeems it by downloading the Fold app, where the Bitcoin value is instantly credited to their account.

Reeves explained that the process eliminates many of the hurdles typically involved in gifting crypto. ""It doesn't require them to already have a Bitcoin wallet or to really understand Bitcoin,"" he said.

Once redeemed, recipients can save, spend, or even cash out their Bitcoin through Fold's app.

""You can send it to someone else, you can turn it into physical cash at an ATM, you can use it to spend on a debit card, and earn more Bitcoin rewards,"" Reeves told Benzinga. ""So it creates a great and very flexible environment for people to receive Bitcoin.""

For many, volatility remains a concern when it comes to Bitcoin. Reeves acknowledged that while price swings are part of the asset's nature, gifting offers a safe entry point.

""This is not you putting up your own hard-earned money or hard-earned savings,"" he said, adding that some may be nervous because of a temporary downturn. ""This is a way for you to get some [Bitcoin], that's not from you putting up any capital. It's a risk-free way to start getting used to the asset and start to see it over a longer period of time.""

Reeves told Benzinga the card could broaden Bitcoin's reach beyond the tech-savvy crowd. ""Bitcoin has been very heavily male-dominated in terms of who is adopting it,"" he said. ""And that's typically because investing and trading is an activity that — when you look at the demographics — skews very male.""

He added that he believes Fold — and particularly this Bitcoin gift card — will speak to broader demographics because it makes crypto so much more accessible. It's not just for ""crypto bro culture"" anymore, but for those managing household finances and trying to make smart financial decisions, ""giving more financial foundation for your family.""

Reeves is optimistic about where this gift card could lead. ""We see Bitcoin is very close to all-time highs, and we expect that to continue over the next few years,"" he said. ""It really situates this to usurp not only all gift cards but to become the number one gift in America, overall.""

Written by Ananda Banerjee

Edited by Mohammad Shahid

While most of the market is still recovering from the steep tariff-driven crash, a few altcoins that beat the crypto market crash have already turned heads with 24-hour gains, even going as high as 100%. These tokens managed to rebound faster than others, showing strong on-chain activity and retail demand even as larger assets lag behind. 

This article discusses those three crash-beating altcoins and how their price charts are shaping up amid the broader market weakness. 

Radiant Capital — a DeFi lending platform built to bridge liquidity across chains — has emerged as one of the few altcoins to beat the crypto market crash. 

RDNT rallied nearly 100% in the past 24 hours, rebounding to around $0.029. The move is powered by an interesting split between retail excitement and cautious large-holder interest.

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures how much institutional or large-wallet money is flowing in or out of a token, remains just below zero. 

However, it has started curling upward, suggesting that big players are slowly returning — but still trading carefully. For CMF to confirm full institutional conviction, it needs to cross decisively above the zero line.

In contrast, the Money Flow Index (MFI), which tracks trading volume and retail inflows, has surged to an overheated 94.68, reflecting intense retail buying. 

This shows smaller investors are aggressively chasing every rise and dip, driving short-term euphoria around Radiant.

Technically, while RDNT's 100% surge looks impressive, the chart flashes an early warning. 

Between April 25 and October 11, the price made a higher high, but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) made a lower high — a bearish divergence that often signals a possible correction rather than a full trend reversal.

At the same time, the RDNT price has just broken out of a descending channel, a bearish structure it had traded in for months. The breakout is promising, but it's not yet a confirmed bullish reversal.

For the move to sustain, Radiant must hold above $0.029 and close a daily candle above $0.034 even. Failure to do so could invite selling pressure back toward $0.020 or lower.

Morpho has quietly become another DeFi token, beating the crypto market crash, showing that decentralized lending projects may be leading the recovery. 

While most altcoins remain deep in red, MORPHO is down only 10% over the past week and up 4.2% in the past 24 hours, hinting that DeFi resilience might be returning to the market.

Over the past 24 hours, Morpho whales increased their holdings by 5.34%, taking their total stash to 4.6 million MORPHO tokens. At the current price of $1.68, that translates to a stash worth nearly $8 million.

This accumulation came even as exchange balances rose 2.66%, showing that selling is continuing across cohorts, primarily by retail and smart money. 

MORPHO's price chart also paints an interesting story. Before the crash, the token was trading inside a rising wedge, a structure often seen before short-term corrections. 

The crash broke this wedge to the downside, but the current bounce has pushed the MORPHO price back above the lower trendline, showing early signs of stabilization.

The Bull Bear Power (BBP) indicator — which tracks the strength balance between buyers and sellers — supports that view. The bearish bars have shrunk sharply since October 10, suggesting that selling pressure is fading and that bulls might be regaining control.

At press time, MORPHO trades around $1.69. For the recovery to continue, the price must hold above $1.61 and push through $1.91 to retest higher resistance levels at $2.47 and $2.85. If $1.61 fails, short-term support lies at $1.55 and $1.44.

Despite market-wide volatility, Morpho's steady whale accumulation and fading bearish power suggest that it could remain one of the few DeFi altcoins outperforming during the crypto market crash, provided large money keeps backing the rebound.

Succinct's PROVE token, which powers its zero-knowledge proof (ZK-proof) infrastructure network, has emerged as one of the altcoins beating the crypto crash. 

Over the past 24 hours, PROVE is up nearly 19%, signaling renewed confidence in infrastructure-based DeFi projects even as most of the market struggles to recover.

On-chain data paints a clear picture of who's driving the move. Whale holdings fell 22.38%, dropping to just over 1,171 tokens, while exchange balances rose 6.27% to 38.25 million tokens. This suggests large holders are taking profits.

The Money Flow Index (MFI) — which tracks money entering or leaving the asset — currently stands near 73.22, moving toward overbought levels. This means buyers remain active, but the momentum is largely retail-driven, and may need fresh whale inflows to stay strong.

Technically, PROVE continues to respect a falling wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart, a structure that often hints at a trend reversal once confirmed. 

Between September 26 and October 10, the price made a lower low while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) formed a higher low, showing bullish divergence and fading selling momentum.

At press time, PROVE trades near $0.74. A 4-hour candle close above $0.85 could open the path toward $0.94 and $0.98, marking a potential 25% to 30% upside from current levels. However, a drop below $0.72 could push the price toward $0.67, where the next key support lies.

For now, retail enthusiasm continues to drive PROVE's recovery, but whale re-entry will decide whether it can extend its lead among the altcoins already beating the crypto crash.

While these DeFi names impressed during the recovery, Zcash (ZEC) deserves an honorary mention for completely defying the crypto market crash. The privacy-focused token is up more than 74% this week and nearly 10% in the past 24 hours, trading close to $290.

Both retail and institutional money continue flowing into ZEC, keeping the rally alive even as most other altcoins struggle to recover. For more insights, read our full Zcash analysis here.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Blockchain-Based Distributed Storage for Motion Data","https://bioengineer.org/blockchain-based-distributed-storage-for-motion-data/","Sun, 12 Oct 2025 00:39:13 GMT","



In recent years, the intersection of sports data management and advanced technology has garnered significant attention, particularly concerning how data is stored and managed. As the volume of sports-related information has skyrocketed—from player statistics to biometric data—traditional centralized database systems have struggled to keep pace. A groundbreaking study conducted by Wang and Zhao presents a novel approach to this challenge by leveraging blockchain technology to create a distributed storage system specifically designed for sports data. The implications of their research could redefine how sports organizations handle data, ensuring enhanced security, integrity, and efficiency.

Blockchain technology is lauded for its decentralized nature, which mitigates the risks associated with a single point of failure—a common vulnerability in centralized systems. This characteristic alone offers a compelling reason to explore blockchain's application in the vast realm of sports data. In their work, Wang and Zhao expound on how a blockchain-based distributed storage system can provide a safer and more reliable environment for storing sensitive athletic information. The use of cryptographic techniques ensures data integrity and protection against unauthorized access, crucial factors in an era where data breaches are rampant.

A central finding from the researchers' experiments is the stark contrast in storage space utilization between blockchain systems and traditional databases. Traditional systems often suffer from inefficiencies that lead to wasted storage—particularly when data is replicated across multiple servers for fault tolerance. In contrast, a well-implemented blockchain can drastically reduce redundancy by allowing data to be stored in a distributed manner. Each participant in the network contributes a portion of the storage capacity, thereby maximizing resource utilization while maintaining the integrity and reliability of the data.

The query response time is another critical metric for any data storage system, especially in the fast-paced world of sports where decisions often depend on real-time analysis. The study demonstrates that despite the inherent complexities of blockchain—such as the need for consensus among nodes—a well-structured system can still deliver competitive query performance. By developing specialized algorithms tailored to the unique demands of sports data, Wang and Zhao have shown that blockchain can provide efficient data retrieval without compromising on the fundamental benefits of decentralization.

Privacy protection is a crucial component when dealing with sensitive sports data, such as player health and performance metrics. Conventional databases often rely on methods that, while effective, can fall short under high-security demands. Blockchain's inherent transparency and immutability can serve as formidable features that enhance privacy protections through the use of permissioned networks. By controlling who has access to what data, sports organizations can uphold privacy laws while still gaining insights from the data they possess.

While the advantages of a blockchain-based storage system are compelling, Wang and Zhao acknowledge certain limitations that must be addressed. One notable challenge is write latency, which can be significantly higher in blockchain systems compared to traditional databases. The process of writing new data involves various nodes reaching a consensus, which can slow down the overall performance. However, the researchers argue that with ongoing developments in blockchain technology and potential optimizations specifically designed for sports data applications, these limitations may soon be mitigated.

In terms of storage capacity, traditional centralized systems can often accommodate vast amounts of data thanks to powerful servers and storage arrays. On the other hand, blockchain's decentralized nature may introduce constraints related to scalability. Wang and Zhao explore methodologies for enhancing the storage capabilities of blockchain networks, indicating that hybrid systems—integrating both blockchain and conventional databases—could provide an optimal solution for sports organizations looking to harness the advantages of both approaches.

The implications of this research extend beyond just storage; they point to a future where data-sharing among organizations becomes seamless and secure. Imagine multiple sports franchises being able to share performance data in real-time, enabling comprehensive analytics without compromising on security or privacy. This vision becomes achievable through a blockchain-based system, facilitating a connected ecosystem of information that improves decision-making and enhances competitiveness.

Moreover, the added layer of data security that blockchain provides cannot be overstated. In a world where physical and digital assaults on data integrity are commonplace, the robust security protocols embedded within blockchain technology present an invaluable asset. This capability is particularly pertinent for organizations dealing with sensitive data related to athletes, as maintaining trustworthiness in data management is paramount.

As the world of sports continues to evolve, innovative approaches to data management will remain essential. Companies and organizations that adopt blockchain technology for their data storage needs may find themselves at the forefront of this transformation. Wang and Zhao's study is not only a testament to the potential of blockchain in sports but also an invitation for further exploration and innovation in this rapidly developing area.

The call to action for sports organizations is clear: to remain competitive, the adoption of advanced technologies such as blockchain must be on the horizon. As researchers continue to refine these systems and address the inherent challenges, the promise of blockchain technology in revolutionizing sports data management becomes increasingly tangible. It's an exciting frontier that can offer athletes, coaches, and teams unprecedented access to data-driven insights, ultimately enhancing performance and strategic planning.

In summary, the study by Wang and Zhao opens new avenues for research and application in the domain of sports data management. The insights gleaned from their findings could lead to transformative changes in how data is perceived and utilized within the sports industry. The journey towards a fully decentralized, secure, and efficient system for sports data is only beginning, with tremendous potential ahead for those ready to embrace these advancements.

Oops, something went wrong

After months of debate, Kenya's parliament has passed the country's first comprehensive crypto legislation. VASP will be key in driving adoption and creating a regulatory framework for crypto businesses in the country.

In Uganda, an initiative to launch the country's first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is going into effect. CBDC continues to lose momentum as stablecoins, like the USDC and USDT, take over

Meanwhile, approximately 650,000 crypto merchants in South Africa can now accept Bitcoin payments following the integration of the Lightning Network (LN). The LN scales the Bitcoin mainnet, enabling low-fee transactions. Presently, the Bitcoin Lightning Network has a capacity of over $471M worth of BTC.

Other than the Floki crypto funding of the WWFA in Malawi, let's look at stories making continental headlines this week:

The Kenyan parliament has passed the Virtual Asset Providers Bill (VASP), which is the country's first comprehensive crypto legislation. This bill creates a licensing and supervisory framework for crypto service providers in the country.

One of the most critical introductions is the multi-agency regulation of the crypto sector. Kenya's Central Bank and the Communications Authority of Kenya have a role rather than having a single regulator for the sector.

One notable requirement for service providers is having a physical office in the country and at least three natural persons on their board of directors. These measures ensure Kenya better complies with international requirements in AML/KYC.

Binance-linked lobby group, Virtual Assets Chamber of Commerce, played a role in changes to the bill.

Uganda has launched a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot programme.

This CBDC will entail a digital Ugandan shilling backed by treasury bonds and will run on a blockchain.

It will feature a $5.5Bn real-world asset tokenization project led by Global Settlement Network (GSN) and Diacente Group.

GSN co-founder Ryan Kirkley explained the initiative as follows:

“We're building infrastructure that goes beyond theory — a programmable economy grounded in real assets, regulatory collaboration, and mass accessibility,”

Some target assets for the new portfolio are food production, mining, renewable energy, and trade.

Uganda has a broad range of possible tokenized assets, and this project intends to leverage these possibilities.

However, it is still unclear whether the country's government will enact any regulatory changes to promote the success of this initiative.

South African merchant crypto acceptance has soared to 650,000 after Scan to Go integrated the Lightning Network for Bitcoin payments.

Presently, the Africa's economic powerhouse already boasts the best numbers on the continent in crypto payments, and this move raises that number even higher.

Due to its inherent architecture, Bitcoin has historically faced scalability problems. The Lightning Network came to improve payment efficiency and ensure Bitcoin could become more compatible with merchants' instant settlement needs.

The total number of merchants now accepting crypto payments is approximately 650,000. This increased rate is a strong representation of South African business. Crypto continues to achieve impressive integration into the real economy and will continue to grow if current trends hold.

The recent minting of 500 million USDC on Solana is a game changer. This is a huge moment for global crypto business banking and payroll solutions. It seems that this surge in liquidity is not just about enhancing the DeFi ecosystem, but also a potential turning point for how decentralized organizations manage their payroll. 

Cryptocurrency has changed the way we think about money and finance. It offers alternatives to conventional banking systems that are often cumbersome and slow. Among the sea of digital currencies, USD Coin (USDC) has emerged as a leading stablecoin, designed to mirror the value of the US dollar. The stability of USDC makes it a tempting option for businesses, especially when it comes to payroll and payments. With more organizations looking for effective and transparent payment solutions, USDC's influence in the crypto economy seems to be amplifying. 

Circle's recent minting of 500 million USDC on Solana can't be underestimated. This is a major liquidity event in the world of digital currencies. Some believe that this massive liquidity boost is going to add fuel to the DeFi ecosystem on Solana, driving up institutional adoption and user activity. In the past, large USDC mints have often led to surges in DeFi activity, indicating that we could see a considerable increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) across Solana-based DeFi platforms.

What does this actually mean? It looks like a strategic move by Circle to leverage Solana's capabilities for scaling dollar digital currency across high-performance blockchains. As demand for stablecoin-backed protocols rises, Solana could be in the right place at the right time to capitalize on this influx of USDC.

Using USDC for payroll in decentralized organizations has its perks. First off, it allows for crypto mass payouts, which means businesses can pay contractors and employees across borders without the delays of traditional banking. This is especially useful for remote teams and freelancers who want their payments in cryptocurrency. 

Another benefit is the stability that USDC provides. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that can fluctuate wildly, USDC maintains its value, making it a reliable option for payroll. Companies can fund payroll with USDC, ensuring that employees receive their wages in a stable currency. This could lead to higher employee satisfaction and simplified accounting.

Furthermore, the integration of USDC into payroll systems is in line with the growing trend of stablecoin adoption on freelancer platforms. Many contractors are now opting for cryptocurrency payments, which shows a shift towards accepting digital currencies in the workforce. 

But let's not forget that there are risks involved. One of the biggest concerns is regulatory compliance. Organizations need to navigate a complex web of local, national, and international regulations. In some places, cryptocurrency may not be recognized as legal tender for wages, which could lead to legal complications down the line. 

There's also the stablecoin peg risk. While USDC is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, extreme market conditions or issuer insolvency could lead to a temporary or even permanent depegging. This could result in losses for employees who are expecting a stable salary.

Security is another issue. Storing and transferring USDC means securely managing private keys and wallets. The irreversible nature of blockchain transactions adds another layer of risk, as hackers and human errors could lead to losses. Businesses have to be on top of their security game and educate their employees about these risks.

Despite the challenges, the acceptance of USDC and other stablecoins in the fintech sector indicates a shift towards more innovative payroll solutions. As fintech startups increasingly adopt stablecoin salaries, they can benefit from faster and more cost-effective payment processes. This is particularly useful for global and remote workforces, where traditional banking systems often don't cut it. 

Circle's minting not only enhances liquidity but also promotes a more inclusive financial environment, enabling startups to offer competitive compensation packages. As crypto banking continues to evolve, stablecoin salaries could become the norm, changing the future of payroll in the digital age.

In conclusion, the rise of USDC is undoubtedly transforming payroll and banking in the crypto era. Circle's minting on Solana has injected liquidity into the DeFi ecosystem and opened up new avenues for payroll in decentralized organizations. While challenges are present, the benefits of USDC for payroll are compelling, offering a stable and efficient solution. As stablecoin adoption grows, the future of crypto banking seems bright, with USDC leading the charge.

China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) says its new rare-earth export controls are lawful national-security steps — not blanket bans — and that licenses will be issued for eligible civilian trade, according to a spokesperson's Q&A posted on X Sunday morning local time.

Rare earths — a group of 17 elements used in permanent-magnet motors for electric vehicles (EVs) and wind turbines, defense electronics and other high-tech gear — occupy an outsized role in supply chains because China dominates the sector. 

Beijing accounts for roughly 70% of global production and about 90% of processing and refining; so licensing shifts can ripple downstream even when mining or final manufacturing happens elsewhere.

In remarks published only hours ago, the MOFCOM spokesperson framed the Oct. 9 action — taken with the General Administration of Customs — as part of a longer effort to “refine” China's export control system in line with domestic law and non-proliferation obligations. 

The spokesperson cited the military relevance of medium- and heavy rare earths and said partners were notified in advance through bilateral export-control dialogue mechanisms.

Implementation, the ministry said, will hinge on licensing rather than prohibition. 

Reviews will be conducted under law, licenses will be granted where applications qualify, and Beijing is “actively considering” facilitation measures — including potential general licenses and license exemptions — to promote legitimate trade. 

The spokesperson also said China had assessed the measures' effects ahead of time and expects the broader supply-chain impact to be “very limited.” The message to commercial users was explicit: compliant civilian exports “can get approval.”

MOFCOM also addressed President Donald Trump's comments from Oct. 10 on Truth Social about an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports (becoming effective Nov. 1, 2025) and prospective U.S. export controls on “critical software.” 

The spokesperson called the American position a “double standard,” pointing to the breadth of U.S. control lists and de minimis rules as examples of Washington's expansive approach. 

At the same time, the ministry emphasized process, saying China “does not want” a trade war but “is not afraid” of one, and urging a return to established consultation channels to manage differences on a reciprocal basis. The spokesperson said China would take “resolute measures” to protect its interests if the U.S. proceeds.

Separate comments criticized U.S. port fees due to take effect Oct. 14 on certain Chinese-linked vessels. 

MOFCOM described those fees as unilateral and inconsistent with WTO rules and bilateral agreements. China, the ministry said, will levy special port fees on U.S.-linked vessels under domestic regulations — characterizing the step as a defensive countermeasure aimed at safeguarding the rights of Chinese companies and maintaining fair competition in shipping.

As of Sunday, 9:15 a.m. UTC, according to CoinDesk Data, bitcoin traded around $111,271, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours and 10% from Thursday's Oct. 9 intraday high of $123,641. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index read 24 — ""Extreme Fear"" — versus ""Greed"" a week ago, underscoring fragile sentiment.

 An investigation has tied the Hyperliquid whale controlling over 100,000 BTC to Garrett Jin, the ex-BitForex CEO whose exchange collapsed amid fraud probes. 

An onchain investigation by crypto researcher Eye has linked the mysterious Hyperliquid whale, who controls over 100,000 BTC, to Garrett Jin, the former CEO of BitForex, a now-defunct exchange embroiled in a fraud scandal.

In a Saturday post on X, the onchain sleuth noted that the whale's main wallet, ereignis.eth, was connected to another ENS name, garrettjin.eth, which directly leads to Jin's verified X (Twitter) account, @GarrettBullish.

“The ENS name ereignis.eth (“event” in German) confirms his link to this wallet, identifying him as the actor behind the large-scale operations on Hyperliquid/Hyperunit,” Eye wrote on X. 

The wallet activity also matched Jin's known business dealings, including transfers to staking contracts and addresses funded by exchanges he had past ties with, such as Huobi (HTX).

Further, the whale's wallet received and sent funds that traced back to BitForex-related addresses and to Binance deposits used to open massive trades, including a $735 million Bitcoin (BTC) short.

Jin led BitForex from 2017 to 2020. The exchange was later accused of falsifying trading volumes and flagged by Japan's Financial Services Agency for operating without registration. 

In 2024, BitForex lost $57 million from its hot wallets, froze withdrawals and ultimately shut down after its team was detained in China. Hong Kong's SFC later issued a warning for suspected fraud, and users claimed millions in unrecovered funds.

Following BitForex's collapse, Jin founded several ventures, including WaveLabs VC (2020), TanglePay (2021), IotaBee (2022) and GroupFi (2023). Most of these projects have since become inactive. 

In 2024, he launched XHash.com, a platform for institutional Ethereum staking, which investigators allege may have been used to onboard questionable funds. After the allegations surfaced, Jin reportedly removed XHash from his social media bio, though it remains visible on his Telegram account.

Crypto analyst Quinten François expressed skepticism over the claims linking the Hyperliquid whale to the former BitForex CEO, arguing that the evidence may be too convenient. 

“Why would you have an .eth name leading to your X handle in a wallet that directly connects to market manipulation wallets and wallets for other crime?” he wrote on X, adding that such a setup “sounds way too simple to be true.”

$83 billion has just been sitting there underground this whole time.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A deposit of gold ore recently discovered in China isn't just giant. It's supergiant. So much so, in fact, that Chinese experts claim it could be the largest deposit of any precious metal—not just gold ore—in existence today. 

How big is the “supergiant” deposit located under the Wangu gold field in the Hunan province? Experts estimate it at 1,100 tons. 

According to Chinese state media, a team of geologists detected over 40 gold veins of roughly 330 tons of gold ore dipping 6,600 feet deep under Pingjiang County's Wangu gold field. But 3D modeling blows that number out of the water, showing there could be as much as 1,100 tons as deep as 9,800 feet. If the models are accurate, the deposit in its entirely could be worth roughly $83 billion. 

Adding some more heft to the already weighty (literally) find was the report that the new discovery features 138 grams of gold per metric ton of ore, a valuable rate not often found in gold mining. “Many drilled rock cores showed visible gold,” said Chen Rulin, an ore-prospecting expert at China's Hunan Province's Geological Bureau, according to Chinese state media. 

If the 1,100-ton figure holds up, that makes this new find the largest gold mine in the world, even outpacing South Africa's South Deep gold mine with its 1,025 tons of gold, according to Mining Technology. Mines in Indonesia, Russia, New Guinea, and Chile round out the top-five gold mines in the world. The Carlin Trend and Cortez gold mines, both in Nevada, are ranked sixth and 10th worldwide. 

Historically, the world has mined 233,000 tons of gold, all of it still around in some form, and two-thirds of that mining has occurred since 1950. 

Already the world's top gold producer with about 10 percent of global production, China is heavily dependent on the metal, using about three times more gold than it mines annually. A rate that high requires the country to purchase so much gold from other countries that it's also the world's top importer of the valuable metal. This new discovery has put the world's gold markets on notice, enough so that the price of gold rose to $2,700 per ounce, according to CCN.com. 

And the gold news may not stop there. According to Liu Yongjun, vice head of the bureau, additional gold ore was found when drilling around the site's peripheral areas.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease is currently the most widespread liver disorder globally, affecting roughly one in three adults. It occurs when excess fat builds up inside liver cells, leading to serious liver damage and a higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease.

Researchers at the University of Barcelona have now found a promising approach that could change how this condition is treated. Their study, published in Pharmacological Research, reports that two existing drugs, pemafibrate and telmisartan, significantly reduced fat buildup in animal models of metabolic liver disease. The findings also suggest that using these medications together could ease liver damage while lowering related heart and blood vessel complications. Because available treatments for this disease remain very limited, the results point to a potentially safer and more effective therapeutic option.

The research was led by Marta Alegret, a professor at the University of Barcelona's Faculty of Pharmacy and Food Sciences, and a member of the Institute of Biomedicine of the UB (IBUB) and the CIBER Area for Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBEROBN). The work was conducted in collaboration with scientists from the Santa Creu i Sant Pau Hospital Research Institute, the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, the CIBER Area for Cardiovascular Diseases (CIBERCV), and Uppsala University (Sweden).

​​​​​​​Drug repurposing, a promising and cost-effective strategy

To date, most new experimental compounds developed for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) -- formerly known as fatty liver disease -- have failed during clinical trials, often because of safety concerns. This has turned attention toward drug repurposing, a strategy that explores new uses for medications already proven to be safe in humans. Such an approach is not only faster and more affordable but also particularly valuable for treating the early, often symptom-free stages of MASLD.

""We have focused on these phases with the aim of preventing the disease from progressing to more severe stages. But for a drug to be used in these early stages, it must have a good safety profile in humans,"" explains Marta Alegret. ""That is why we have studied drugs already on the market for other pathologies, which have been shown to be very safe and could have a potential benefit in the treatment of MASLD,"" she adds.

In this study, the team evaluated the potential of two approved medications, given separately and together: a lipid-lowering agent (pemafibrate) and an antihypertensive drug (telmisartan). The first is marketed only in Japan, while the second is widely used for high blood pressure. Both are prescribed to reduce cardiovascular risk. ""Mortality from cardiovascular causes is significant in patients with MASLD, and often these patients also have these two risk factors together,"" Alegret stresses.

Zebrafish larvae, an alternative model for studying the disease

To confirm the efficacy of the drugs and explore their mechanism of action, the researchers have applied them to a rat model of the disease and, subsequently, to a zebrafish larval model. ""In recent years, zebrafish have emerged as an interesting alternative model that facilitates the study of the pathophysiology of MASLD and the evaluation of treatments. These are simpler and cheaper models that allow results to be obtained more quickly and which, although they are not identical to humans, have a carbohydrate/lipid metabolism and liver physiology similar to those of mammals,"" says the UB professor.

The results show that the combination of the two drugs reverses the fat accumulation in the liver induced by a diet high in fat and fructose. In addition, in the rat model, the combined administration of half a dose of pemafibrate and half a dose of telmisartan was found to be as effective as a full dose of either drug in reducing fat accumulation. ""Combination therapy with drugs acting on different pathogenic pathways may be a better strategy than monotherapy, thanks to possible synergistic effects and reduced toxicity related to the use of lower doses of each drug,"" Alegret points out.

The combination of these two drugs would be beneficial not only for liver disease, but also because ""it lowers blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and all this would result in a lower cardiovascular risk,"" she stresses.

​​​​​​​Different lipid-lowering mechanisms The study also found that each drug works by different mechanisms and describes, for the first time, the key role of the PCK1 protein in telmisartan-derived hepatic lipid lowering. ""Telmisartan is a drug that has been used in other models of MASLD, but mostly in more advanced stages of the disease, and its beneficial effects have been attributed mainly to anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. But in the early stages of the disease there is no inflammation or fibrosis yet, only lipid accumulation,"" explains the researcher.

Researchers have now found that the amount of PCK1 protein in the livers of MASLD animals was reduced and that treatment with telmisartan restored its levels to normal. ""This increase in PCK1 diverts the flux of metabolites from lipid synthesis to glucose synthesis. This increase in glucose production could be negative if the glucose were exported and accumulated in the blood, as it could lead to diabetes, but we have noticed that this is not the case,"" says the UB professor.

Still far from clinical application

Despite these promising results, the researchers point out that, as this is a study using animal models, they are still far from patients. ""In order to be translated into a treatment for MASLD patients, clinical studies would be needed to show that the benefits observed in animal models also occur in humans,"" says Alegret. ​​​​​​​ In any case, the results raise new questions, such as whether the drugs will be equally effective in more advanced stages of the disease, when fibrosis is present. The research team is therefore already working on new studies in animal models of diet-induced liver fibrosis. ""In addition, we will develop a dual model involving liver fibrosis and cardiovascular disease to see if the beneficial action is observed not only in the liver, but also in the reduction of atherosclerosis,"" he concludes.

Top Website Builders

Squarespace (Yearly)

Hostinger (Yearly)

Wix (Yearly)

Strikingly (Free)

Publishing a website is still more complicated than it has any right to be, but the best website builders streamline the process. Instead of juggling a bunch of files on a server and learning the ins and outs of networking, website builders do exactly what's written on the tin. Piece by piece, using a drag-and-drop interface, you can design your website the way you want with immediate feedback, rather than spending time buried in code and hoping it comes out on the other end.

There are dozens of website builders, and most of them range from decent to straight-up bad. Any web host with a bit of ambition has a website builder floating around, even if it's slow, clunky, and lacking features. I focused on finding the best tools for building your website that go beyond just an add-on, and these are my favorites. If you're after something simpler than a full-blown website, check out our list of the Best Portfolio Websites.

Squarespace

Squarespace (Yearly)

You've heard of Squarespace over and over again, I'm sure, and that's not an accident. It's an inviting website builder that made a name for itself with bold, striking templates. Beneath the veneer of attractive, but seemingly simple, websites, you'll find one of the most capable website builders on the market. That balance of power and usability is what sets Squarespace apart.

It feels like a creative tool. Where other website builders lag and stutter to get a new element on your page, Squarespace feels fluid. Your dashboard gives you quick access to edit your site, and around every corner, Squarespace feels designed so you never have to look up a tutorial. I started a simple photography website, and within an hour, I had a custom course page set up, an appointment schedule with automated confirmation emails, and services (with pricing and the ability to accept payments) configured.

Squarespace isn't cheap, but it also doesn't meddle in restrictive, low-cost plans. Even on the Basic plan, you have access to ecommerce tools and space for multiple contributors.

Squarespace Pricing and Plans

Hostinger

Hostinger (Yearly)

Hostinger is better known as a web hosting provider, but it has a surprisingly robust website builder that you can use on its own or for free as part of a hosting package. You don't get the same world-class template design and dense feature-set of a more expensive builder like Squarespace, but that's OK. Hostinger's website builder will run you just a few bucks a month, and based on my testing, it feels heavily angled toward newcomers.

You sacrifice some power for convenience, but there's an awful lot you can accomplish with Hostinger. Integrations with PayPal, Stripe, and Square allow you to quickly set up e-commerce. Add-ons with WhatsApp give you live chat capabilities, and Printful support means you can sell print-on-demand merchandise. And, if you outgrow the website builder, Hostinger allows you to export your website's content to WordPress.

Where Hostinger wins for me is through its AI tools. Just about every website builder these days has AI integrated in some way, but it's around every corner at Hostinger. You need to pay extra for some of these AI features—the logo generator, for example, requires credits—but they give you a great starting point for mocking up the look, feel, and tone of your website.

Hostinger Pricing and Plans

Strikingly

Wix (Yearly)

Wix is undoubtedly the biggest competitor to Squarespace, and I had a hard time putting one above the other. Ultimately, Wix ended up in the backseat due to higher prices and a slightly less intuitive interface. That's partly because of how powerful Wix is. Rather than corral you in an elegant (if restrictive) website-building workflow, Wix gives you a ton of options.

First, templates. You get a few hundred elsewhere, but Wix offers over 2,000 templates. At the time of writing, there are 223 pages of them on Wix's website. They aren't all winners, but I was able to mock up a quick photography portfolio website within a few minutes by browsing the templates and uploading a few photos.

The other area Wix nails is plugins. Squarespace and Hostinger have plug-ins, but Wix has hundreds of them. It reminds me of the flexibility and accessibility of WordPress as a platform. Even without any technical knowledge of the backend of a website, you can pick and choose plug-ins as you need rather than jerry-rigging a half-baked solution.

You get what you pay for, and Wix is proof of that. It's robust and incredibly powerful, but even the most inexpensive plan will run you $17 per month, and it doesn't include any e-commerce features. Thankfully, Wix lets you design and publish a website for free if you want to try out the service, though with some strict limitations.

Wix Pricing and Plans

Strikingly

Shop at
        

Strikingly (Free)

Strikingly (Pro, Yearly)

Strikingly doesn't come close to the other website builders on this list, at least when you're paying for a subscription. But if you're looking for a no-frills website builder that allows you to publish a website for free, Strikingly is the way to go. It not only has a solid free plan available, but it's also transparent about the limitations of that plan.

You get 500 MB of storage, 5 GB of bandwidth per month, and a Strikingly branded domain on the free plan. You can even leverage the e-commerce features of paid plans with a single product, though with 5 percent transaction fees. What I appreciate most about the free plan is the AI website builder. I was able to get up and running with my portfolio website by answering a few questions. Strikingly generated a full website with placeholder copy and images, all without spending a dime (if you like that sort of thing).

You can upgrade to a paid plan to unlock more storage and bandwidth, as well as support for a custom domain, but it isn't worth it for most people. You'll pay around the same price as Squarespace or Wix unless you commit to buying five years upfront, and Strikingly doesn't offer the same broad range of design tools, nor plugins, that Wix and Squarespace offer.

Strikingly Pricing and Plans

Weebly: Weebly has been a popular website builder for years due to its generous free plan. However, Weebly was purchased by payment processor Square in 2018, and although Square says Weebly is continuing to receive support, it urges users to use Square Online—an e-commerce-focused website builder—instead. Square says it will continue to support Weebly, and I was still able to create an account, design a website, and publish it. But it's probably not the best choice given the rocky ground Weebly is standing on when it comes to future support.

Canva: I love Canva's design tools, and using them to throw together a website is a treat. You can design a website for free and publish it with a Canva-branded domain, as well as bring your own if you're a paid subscriber. With over 3,500 templates available, you can quite literally set up a website within a few minutes. You trade a lot of power for that convenience, though. Canva is extremely limited, with little in the way of plugins and no e-commerce features to speak of. It's a great tool if you need to throw together a website for a specific purpose—say, a wedding or landing page—but it doesn't have legs beyond that.

What's the Easiest Website Builder?

The easiest website builder I've tested is Squarespace due to its high-quality templates. It's hard to go wrong with the templates available, and customizing them to fit your needs is a breeze. However, if you just need a simple website and don't need features like ecommerce support, Canva provides a simple drag-and-drop website builder that almost anyone can use.

What's the Best WordPress Website Builder?

Our favorite WordPress website builder is Hostinger due to its low prices and robust, built-in website builder. Several other web hosting services provide WordPress builders, however, including Bluehost and Dreamhost.

What Website Builder Has AI Features?

Several website builders that include AI features, including Squarespace, Hostinger, and Wix. You can use AI to quickly mock up text for your website, and even fill out full product copy in the case of Wix. It's always important to double-check the generated content, though. As powerful as AI website builders are, they can still hallucinate.

Other AI website builders focus solely on AI-generated content, including Bolt and Relume. Although these tools are impressive, a traditional drag-and-drop builder is still the way to go, at least right now.

There's no one-size-fits-all mold for a website builder. Because of that, I kept away from forcing any website builder I tested into a particular lane; instead, I focused on ensuring the website builder empowered you to do what you want to do with your website. That means a lot of options, but it also means organizing those options in an accessible way.

For testing, I put together a website with a photography portfolio—a hobby of mine in my free time —leveraging upload and layout features, as well as form capture and appointment booking, where available. I don't have a background in website design, so each website builder needed to empower me to build a website with their tools. If I need to touch a line of code, that's a dealbreaker.

Outside of doing its core function, there were a few other areas I focused on:

There's a lot of crosstalk between website builders and web hosting services, and it's important to separate the two. Web hosting is part of a website builder, but a website builder isn't always part of web hosting.

A web host stores all the data for your website on a server and allows others to connect and load that data, displaying your website. It doesn't matter how your website was designed or what purpose it serves. If you have the right know-how, you can throw together the necessary files to display a website and host it from your own PC or server, in fact.

A website builder gives you the tools to put those files together without any coding or web design background. You start with a template, and you design your website with a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interface. Once your website is designed, you publish it, and it's hosted on your website builder's servers.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

If you want to solve a tricky problem, it often helps to get organized. You might, for example, break the problem into pieces and tackle the easiest pieces first. But this kind of sorting has a cost. You may end up spending too much time putting the pieces in order.

This dilemma is especially relevant to one of the most iconic problems in computer science: finding the shortest path from a specific starting point in a network to every other point. It's like a souped-up version of a problem you need to solve each time you move: learning the best route from your new home to work, the gym, and the supermarket.

“Shortest paths is a beautiful problem that anyone in the world can relate to,” said Mikkel Thorup, a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen.

Intuitively, it should be easiest to find the shortest path to nearby destinations. So if you want to design the fastest possible algorithm for the shortest-paths problem, it seems reasonable to start by finding the closest point, then the next-closest, and so on. But to do that, you need to repeatedly figure out which point is closest. You'll sort the points by distance as you go. There's a fundamental speed limit for any algorithm that follows this approach: You can't go any faster than the time it takes to sort.

Forty years ago, researchers designing shortest-paths algorithms ran up against this “sorting barrier.” Now, a team of researchers has devised a new algorithm that breaks it. It doesn't sort, and it runs faster than any algorithm that does.

“The authors were audacious in thinking they could break this barrier,” said Robert Tarjan, a computer scientist at Princeton University. “It's an amazing result.”

To analyze the shortest-paths problem mathematically, researchers use the language of graphs—networks of points, or nodes, connected by lines. Each link between nodes is labeled with a number called its weight, which can represent the length of that segment or the time needed to traverse it. There are usually many routes between any two nodes, and the shortest is the one whose weights add up to the smallest number. Given a graph and a specific “source” node, an algorithm's goal is to find the shortest path to every other node.

The most famous shortest-paths algorithm, devised by the pioneering computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956, starts at the source and works outward step by step. It's an effective approach, because knowing the shortest path to nearby nodes can help you find the shortest paths to more distant ones. But because the end result is a sorted list of shortest paths, the sorting barrier sets a fundamental limit on how fast the algorithm can run.

In 1984, Tarjan and another researcher improved Dijkstra's original algorithm so that it hit this speed limit. Any further improvement would have to come from an algorithm that avoids sorting.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Thorup and other researchers devised algorithms that broke the sorting barrier, but they needed to make certain assumptions about weights. Nobody knew how to extend their techniques to arbitrary weights. It seemed they'd hit the end of the road.

“The research stopped for a very long time,” said Ran Duan, a computer scientist at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “Many people believed that there's no better way.”

Duan wasn't one of them. He'd long dreamed of building a shortest-paths algorithm that could break through the sorting barrier on all graphs. Last fall, he finally succeeded.

Duan's interest in the sorting barrier dates back nearly 20 years to his time in graduate school at the University of Michigan, where his adviser was one of the researchers who worked out how to break the barrier in specific cases. But it wasn't until 2021 that Duan devised a more promising approach.

The key was to focus on where the algorithm goes next at each step. Dijkstra's algorithm takes the region that it has already explored in previous steps. It decides where to go next by scanning this region's “frontier”—that is, all the nodes connected to its boundary. This doesn't take much time at first, but it gets slower as the algorithm progresses.

Edsger Dijkstra devised a classic algorithm that finds the shortest path from a specific point in a network to every other point.

Duan instead envisioned grouping neighboring nodes on the frontier into clusters. He would then only consider one node from each cluster. With fewer nodes to sift through, the search could be faster at each step. The algorithm also might end up going somewhere other than the closest node, so the sorting barrier wouldn't apply. But ensuring that this clustering-based approach actually made the algorithm faster rather than slower would be a challenge.

Duan fleshed out this basic idea over the following year, and by fall 2022 he was optimistic that he could surmount the technical hurdles. He roped in three graduate students to help work out the details, and a few months later they arrived at a partial solution—an algorithm that broke the sorting barrier for any weights, but only on so-called undirected graphs.

In undirected graphs, every link can be traversed in both directions. Computer scientists are usually more interested in the broader class of graphs that feature one-way paths, but these “directed” graphs are often trickier to navigate.

“There could be a case that A can reach B very easily, but B cannot reach A very easily,” said Xiao Mao, a computer science graduate student at Stanford University. “That's going to give you a lot of trouble.”

In the summer of 2023, Mao heard Duan give a talk about the undirected-graph algorithm at a conference in California. He struck up a conversation with Duan, whose work he'd long admired.

“I met him for the first time in real life,” Mao recalled. “It was very exciting.”

After the conference, Mao began thinking about the problem in his spare time. Meanwhile, Duan and his colleagues were exploring new approaches that could work on directed graphs. They took inspiration from another venerable algorithm for the shortest-paths problem, called the Bellman-Ford algorithm, that doesn't produce a sorted list. At first glance, it seemed like an unwise strategy, since the Bellman-Ford algorithm is much slower than Dijkstra's.

“Whenever you do research, you try to take a promising path,” Thorup said. “I would almost call it anti-promising to take Bellman-Ford, because it looks completely like the stupidest thing you could possibly do.”

Duan's team avoided the slowness of the Bellman-Ford algorithm by running it for just a few steps at a time. This selective use of Bellman-Ford enabled their algorithm to scout ahead for the most valuable nodes to explore in later steps. These nodes are like intersections of major thoroughfares in a road network.

“You have to pass through [them] to get the shortest path to a lot of other stuff,” Thorup said.

In March 2024, Mao thought of another promising approach. Some key steps in the team's original approach had used randomness. Randomized algorithms can efficiently solve many problems, but researchers still prefer nonrandom approaches. Mao devised a new way to solve the shortest-paths problem without randomness. He joined the team, and they worked together over the following months via group chats and video calls to merge their ideas. Finally, in the fall, Duan realized they could adapt a technique from an algorithm he'd devised in 2018 that broke the sorting barrier for a different graph problem. That technique was the last piece they needed for an algorithm that ran faster than Dijkstra's on both directed and undirected graphs.

The finished algorithm slices the graph into layers, moving outward from the source like Dijkstra's. But rather than deal with the whole frontier at each step, it uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to pinpoint influential nodes, moves forward from these nodes to find the shortest paths to others, and later comes back to other frontier nodes. It doesn't always find the nodes within each layer in order of increasing distance, so the sorting barrier doesn't apply. And if you chop up the graph in the right way, it runs slightly faster than the best version of Dijkstra's algorithm. It's considerably more intricate, relying on many pieces that need to fit together just right. But curiously, none of the pieces use fancy mathematics.

“This thing might as well have been discovered 50 years ago, but it wasn't,” Thorup said. “That makes it that much more impressive.”

Duan and his team plan to explore whether the algorithm can be streamlined to make it even faster. With the sorting barrier vanquished, the new algorithm's runtime isn't close to any fundamental limit that computer scientists know of.

“Being an optimist, I would not be surprised if you could take it down even further,” Tarjan said. “I certainly don't think this is the last step in the process.”

There was a time when AMD was the scrappy underdog of the semiconductor world. Twenty years ago, few would have imagined that the company would shape the future of global AI infrastructure alongside one of the most powerful players in the field of artificial intelligence.

Yet, that is exactly what AMD has achieved with its new multi-year partnership with OpenAI. This deal marks both a technological milestone and a strategic pivot for the entire data center industry.

The headline is staggering, and I'm not being hyperbolic. OpenAI will deploy up to six gigawatts' worth of AMD Instinct GPUs, starting with one gigawatt of MI450 accelerators in the second half of 2026. In raw scale and ambition, this is a defining moment for AMD.

As Forrest Norrod, AMD's EVP and GM of data center solutions, put it during the company's briefing, “This deal is hugely transformative, not just for AMD, but also for the dynamics of the industry writ large. It is a strong endorsement of AMD's technology and its suitability for deployment at the largest scale for the most important models.”

That single quote captures the shift underway. AMD is no longer just competing. It's co-authoring the blueprint for how the next generation of AI infrastructure will be built.

The deal goes far beyond a conventional supplier agreement. It's structured as a deep strategic partnership, complete with a performance-based warrant for OpenAI to acquire up to 160 million AMD shares (nearly 10% of the company) tied to deployment milestones and stock price thresholds that peak at $600 per share. This structure aligns both companies on execution and success, creating what Norrod described as a “positive virtuous cycle” of deployment, adoption, and value creation.

One of the most telling details isn't in the number of GPUs, but in how AMD and OpenAI are defining scale. Rather than counting chips or flops, they're talking gigawatts, an energy-centric metric that reflects how hyperscale operators now plan infrastructure. As Norrod explained, “Our customers and the folks building data centers are now having to think about infrastructure in one-gigawatt tranches.”

This shift from compute metrics to power metrics hints at something more profound. AI infrastructure is becoming as much about power engineering, thermal efficiency, and systems integration as it is about silicon performance.

AMD is leaning into that reality with Helios, a rack-scale solution that integrates GPUs, CPUs, networking, and telemetry into a single, compact design. Helios embodies a holistic approach to AI data centers — one that views hardware not as standalone products but as integral elements of a massive, coordinated system.

This holistic strategy makes AMD's acquisition of ZT Systems, which occurred earlier this year, especially crucial. That move, which seemed peripheral at the time, now looks prescient. ZT's expertise in large-scale system design underpins Helios, enabling AMD to deliver vertically integrated solutions — not just components. The data center of the future will not be built chip by chip. It will be delivered as engineered pods, optimized for power, performance, and scalability from day one.

This deal is also a story about credibility. AMD's relationship with OpenAI didn't materialize overnight. It began with the MI300, when OpenAI first ran GPT workloads on AMD hardware within Microsoft's data centers. Over the last 18 months, that relationship deepened, particularly through work on Triton, OpenAI's compiler for GPU kernels. AMD became a first-class backend for Triton, aligning its roadmap with OpenAI's needs and shaping the MI450's design around real-world feedback.

That patient, iterative engagement ultimately paid off. As Norrod noted, OpenAI's commitment “didn't come from a casual date. It came from working with OpenAI for several years, having them gradually build up confidence in our capabilities.” This announcement is more than a supply agreement. It's validation that AMD now belongs in the highest tier of AI infrastructure providers.

The impact of this partnership will ripple beyond AMD and OpenAI. It signals that the AI infrastructure market is no longer a one-horse race dominated by Nvidia. The emergence of credible alternatives at hyperscale levels will accelerate competition, diversify ecosystems, and spur innovation across the stack, from compilers and frameworks to networking and power delivery.

It may also change how data centers are financed and deployed. A six-gigawatt agreement implies multi-billion-dollar investments in power, cooling, and real estate. As deployments are framed in gigawatt terms, expect data center design to become more modular, with pre-engineered, rack-scale solutions like Helios forming the basic unit of deployment. That could shorten time-to-market for AI infrastructure and make global expansion more predictable and capital-efficient.

Ultimately, this deal is about more than hardware. It is about AMD claiming a seat at the table of the most consequential technology shift of our time. Two decades ago, the idea of AMD supplying the backbone for one of the world's most advanced AI platforms would have seemed fanciful. Today, it is a reality.

The deal reflects a company that has transformed itself from a perennial challenger to a strategic partner trusted to help power the future of artificial intelligence. It hints at an industry in transition, where power, scale, and integration are redefining what it means to be a leader.

The big players of AI infrastructure now include AMD — and that changes everything.

No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.5 trillion market cap company. 

The world's leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. 

Nvidia has participated in 50 venture capital deals so far in 2025, already surpassing the 48 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 21 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.)  

Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.”  

Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. 

This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. 

OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker's investment was dwarfed by OpenAI's other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI's $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the chipmaker announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in the company over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. 

xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk's xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI's planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. 

Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model developer raised €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September.   

Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia led a $2 billion funding round for Reflection AI, a one-year-old startup, valuing the company at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a US-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open-source large language model offers a less-expensive alternative to closed-source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. 

Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati's Thinking Machines Lab's $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. 

Inflection: One of Nvidia's first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection's $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection's founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. 

Nscale: After the startup's $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale's $433 million SAFE funding in October. That's a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Akorn Energy, is building data centers in the UK and Norway for OpenAI's Stargate project. 

Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an dditional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in the Figure AI's Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. 

Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale, and hired away the company's co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. 

Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup's  $863 million funding round in August 2025. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. 

Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in November 2024, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. 

Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise large language model provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. 

Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company's July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup's subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company's valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. 

Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. 

Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda's business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia's GPUs. 

CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That's when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder. 

Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023.  

Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received A$330 million (approximately $215 million USD) in funding at a A$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion USD) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient ‘AI factory' in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining. 

Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. 

Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in the $203 million funding round for the self-driving startup focused on delivery. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021. 

Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. 

Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. 

Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. 

Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. 

Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ's Series E round to $450 million and the company's valuation to $5.75 billion. 

Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. 

Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. 

Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway's $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023.  

Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. 

Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica's $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn't participate in the round. 

Reka AI: In July, an AI research lab Reka, raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup's valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg.

""Steer by wire"" means there is nothing but copper signal wires between your steering wheel and the front wheels. Your steering wheel is essentially a video game controller.This has nothing to do with the car's mode of propulsion though, and both EVs and ICE cars can have steer by wire controls. So far, it's only the cybertruck that has this paradigm, all other EV's all have normal power steering.For normal power steering systems there are two types: hydraulic and electric. Both types have a solid steel shaft between your steering wheel and the front wheels. You can remove the engine/motor completely, and you'll still be able to steer the car. The hydraulic or electric motor merely helps you turn the wheel, nothing more. Hydraulic is being phased out for electric in both EVs and ICE vehicles.

The Infinity Q50, QX50, QX55 and QX60 (with backup that connects upon electric failure).Without backup, but triple redundancy, can be found in the Tesla Cybertruck. But I'd take that redundancy with a grain of salt as they don't have the best track record telling you the truth.That said, I really with companies would go back to the good old hydraulic steering. I don't need self-parking. But self-parking needs at least electric steering (with our without steering column).

That is one of the most critical aspects of a vehicle.Assuming that one of the most critical times you might need a vehicle is fleeing oppression, having a remote switch off as a possible vector to impede your escape is an existential threat and basically makes one of the core reasons to have a vehicle moot.My assumption is that most people are not thinking about their vehicle as one of the most critical tools for freedom.Having traveled the world and lived in war zones, vehicles are life savers and it's insane to me that anyone would allow a possibility for someone else, specifically corporations and governments with major power levers, to even have the ability to stop that remotely.

reply

Even if the owner gave permission to install the update, I would strongly wager that they did not give concurrent permission for the update to change the behavior of the vehicle.Of course, I sincerely doubt the EULA offers any way to separate those permissions; you are all in, or you are all out. Assuming that you even have an option to opt out.And that's exactly why these cars can never be trusted under any circumstances, ever.

Most people have a variety of things they are looking for in a car they want to purchase, and other factors are more important to them than this one, which they figure probably won't happen anyway. There may be few options that aren't updateable over the air, and those options don't meet their other criteria -- if they even get that deep into considering it, which they probably don't, they just aren't really thinking about it. But even if they did. you don't have the option of buying your perfect fantasy car.

There is huge demand for cars without most of this nonsense, yet I don't see that demand being met.I doubt anyone wants a car whose infotainment system can be improperly updated to cause catastrophic power and engine failure while driving, if given this information and a choice to avoid it.

I've had some pretty nasty brickings of devices, like overwriting the bootloader, that I've been able to recover from by getting it into some barely documented system on chip mode with a special cable, booting a new bootloader into RAM via the cable, and reflashing that way. One could go to the extreme and say any flash storage chip where all software bits are directly writable by a factory tool is technically unbrickable. But the customers won't see it that way.

Being strict about the word ""bricked"" and limiting it to the truly unrecoverable situations just makes it nigh-on useless.Very few things can make a modern system truly unrecoverable if one is willing to pour unreasonable resources into them. It's incredibly common to be in a situation where a system is unrecoverable by you though. There's no practical difference between these two except that one depends on the surrounding context.

Manufacturers should feel free to offer updates. If the user feels the tradeoffs make sense, then they should be free to accept updates. But this business where the manufacturer thinks they are somehow entitled to mess around with a product you've already purchased from them has got to end. It's not their product anymore, it's yours.

Even better, a ""right to modify everything you own, in any way you like"". Don't you like the micro-controller installed by the manufacturer? Buy another one, with the correct firmware programmed from scratch, and swap it off.We are already well into a new era of software, in which software can be programmed by itself, especially Rust. What is missing is money transactions for software companies and their employees located everywhere in the world.""Devices with no surprises"". Retail shops in conjuction with electronics engineers put new controllers in everything and re-sell it. Open source software, auditable by anyone and modified at will.Programs for every car, every refrigerator etc cannot be programmed by a company located in one place, not even 10 places. It has to be a truly global company.In other words, I want your device, I don't want your closed source software.

I live in a city so I don't need a car, but if I had to buy one, ""it should not have a network interface"" would be my most important requirement. ""It should not have a video display"" would be a secondary one. If I had to buy a car with a network interface, I would do my best to neutralize it to make sure it stays 100% offline.

reply

Whereas the problem is that cars have had computers for a long time (eg ECU, ABS, entertainment), then those started getting connected together locally via CAN, then finally they added an Internet connection for surveillance and control. So the centralizing proprietary software tentacles go deep into the car in a way that's not easy to remove or replace.There is the black box approach of disabling network interfaces, but I could even see that going away - cannot contact network -> car cannot be sure that warranty recalls have been done in a timely fashion -> disable itself after a month until you ""take it to a dealer"" (or reconnect the cell backhaul).

My suspicion is that this was either a CAN saturation issue (ie - infotainment started sending a high priority message which could reach powertrain CAN) or a state management issue (ie - infotainment sent a “put modules to sleep” or “wake modules” message which was not handled correctly and caused one or more modules to transition to an invalid state for driving).

The fact that this possible proves the point: OTA updates are dangerous and should be banned.

Fall means cooler weather and leaves turning and pumpkins and all that fun stuff. It also means mud, those leaves stuck to shoes or your dog's paws, Halloween and Thanksgiving foot traffic, and generally a more challenging time keeping your floors and carpets clean. If there was ever a time to upgrade your floor cleaning game, it's now, and Dreame's superstar robot vacuum and mop combo, the X50 Ultra (Complete), is 29% off at Amazon. Plus, you can save an extra 5% at Amazon with the code DMGMPD5OFF for an even better deal.

Dreame's awesome Prime Day sale is still in effect, with enormous price breaks on their finest cleaning machines for your floors and your air. Between the hot deals on the Dreame L50 Ultra and the X50 Ultra (Complete), there's a programmable, self-cleaning, highly intelligent robot floor machine ready to tackle all of the mess, dirt, pet hair, and more, while taking the lion's share of the work away from you once and for all.

See X50 Ultra at Amazon

See L50 Ultra at Amazon

One of the new tech features that dropped jaws at CES 2025 was Dreame's ProLeap System, which gives the X50 Ultra (Complete) the ability to actually scale steps and thresholds up to 2.36 inches in height. If you know the sound of a robot vacuum that's hung up on a threshold between rooms, you know it means you need to get up and give it an assist. The Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete) eliminates that frustrating situation, and also eliminates previously unreachable dirt that hides in corners with its MopExtend RoboSwing tech that reaches over an inch and a half into those elusive spots.

Dirty corners and threshold obstacles aren't the only common robot vacuum shortcomings solved by the Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete). The innovative HyperStream Detangling Duo Brush eradicates those hair tangles that bring the rollers of lesser robot vacs to a complete standstill. It allows the X50 Ultra (Complete) to pick up a full 100% of large particles and hair, with no tangles snarling the rollers. VersaLift Navigation with advanced LiDAR and AI continuously map its path in real time to avoid obstacles, and even determining which pieces of furniture it can successfully go under for optimal cleaning without getting stuck or, worse, lost.

The Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete) is better at taking care of itself than any robot floor cleaner we've seen, whether it's self-emptying dirt in its Intelligent PowerDock, or using the AceClean DryBoard system that hits the mop pads with 20 streams of hot, cleansing water, and then dries them with hot air to prevent those bad, damp smells. The mop is clean and ready to go again without any work on your part. The X50 Ultra (Complete) also toggles seamlessly between hard floors and carpets, with five tailored modes that protect your carpets from the mop, boost the suction for thicker carpets, and more.

The Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete) is well-named. It gets your hard floors and carpets ultra clean, does a complete job including hard-to-reach corners and beneath some furniture items, and completely takes the drudgery of vacuuming and even more taxing mopping jobs out of your hands — which sounds like a dream scenario to us, but it's very real. The 29% off deal at Amazon wipes $500 from the price of the Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete), making it a $1,200 investment in years of effortlessly clean floors and hundreds of hours back that you previously spent cleaning. Don't forget to use the code DMGMPD5OFF at Amazon to snag an extra 5%.

Finding bugs can make you a millionaire.

Apple announced at Hexacon 2025, the top global offensive security conference, that it will double its highest security bounty to $2 million. This makes Cupertino the most generous company that offers an award for unearthing vulnerabilities, and it's even offering top-up bonuses that can see security experts earning more than $5 million for uncovering exploits. According to Apple's Security Research blog, it has already awarded over $35 million to more than 800 security researchers since 2020, bringing the average award to $43,750. It even claimed that multiple individuals have received $500,000 in rewards.

The top $2-million award is reserved for those who discover sophisticated exploit chains similar to what mercenary spyware attacks exploit. Beyond that, there's also a bonus system for those who can break Apple's Lockdown Mode secure environment and vulnerabilities in its beta software, bringing the potential payout to over $5 million. There are also smaller awards, like $1 million for those who can crack broad iCloud security and those who can create a wireless proximity attack using radio, up to $300,000 to anyone who develops a one-click WebKit sandbox escape mechanism, and $100,000 to those who can bypass Gatekeeper on macOS.

 




This isn't the only bug bounty program anyone can participate in. AMD announced its own program last year, with a payout of up to $30,000, while Intel offers a maximum of $100,000. Microsoft's maximum award at the moment is $250,000, and it has even lowered its age limit to 13 because of this high school junior who filed over 20 security vulnerability reports last summer. Meta launched a bug bounty program in 2011 and now offers a maximum bug bounty of $300,000 (with $25,000,000 awarded to date). And last, but not least, Google began its Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) in 2010. The search giant's rewards vary from a few hundred dollars to a million dollars for the most serious vulnerabilities on its Titan M security chip. The company paid $11.8 million in 2024 to 660 researchers, bringing the average award to $17,800 per head.

These awards can make finding bugs a lucrative field, especially for talented security researchers. And while it might seem like an expensive proposition for companies, it's far cheaper for them to pay out these bounties instead of having a bad actor discover it and disseminate it under their noses, resulting in reputational and financial damages for the corporation. Moreover, software mistakes can potentially cost lives, as state actors and other third parties are increasingly using sophisticated means to target specific personalities.

Researchers at Fudan University have created a working memory chip just a few atoms thick.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


For the first time, scientists have successfully built a fully functional memory chip using two-dimensional materials and integrated it directly onto a conventional silicon die — a milestone that could change how future semiconductors are made. The research, led by Chunsen Liu and colleagues at Fudan University in Shanghai, was published on October 9 in the journal Nature.

The research may mark a turning point for 2D electronics, which have long promised atomic-scale performance and efficiency but struggled to move beyond lab demonstrations. Using a process the team calls ATOM2CHIP, the researchers grew a layer of molybdenum disulfide just a few atoms thick directly on top of a conventional 0.13-micrometer CMOS silicon chip. The result is a hybrid chip that combines a 2D NOR flash memory array with a standard CMOS controller, effectively bridging the gap between experimental nanomaterials and industry-standard fabrication.

The Fudan team reports a 94.34% yield from full-chip testing — a figure that rivals commercial silicon production — and operational speeds up to five megahertz. Each bit consumes just 0.644 picojoules, far below the energy draw of today's silicon flash cells. The memory demonstrated fast 20-nanosecond programming and erasing, ten-year data retention, and endurance of over 100,000 write cycles.

 




To achieve this, the researchers had to overcome the challenge of surface roughness. Silicon chips, even after polishing, have uneven terrain at the nanometer scale that can tear or stress atomic-thin layers. The ATOM2CHIP method introduced a conformal adhesion process that allows the 2D material to “flow” over the contours of the underlying circuits without breaking, while a 2D-friendly packaging system guards against heat and electrostatic damage.

Equally crucial was the team's “cross-platform system design,” a custom interface ensuring the 2D layer could communicate seamlessly with the CMOS control logic. This design enables instruction-driven operations, 32-bit parallelism, and random access, or, in other words, a full-featured memory chip.

In their paper, the authors describe the result as “an important milestone in extending the superiority of 2D electronics to real-world applications.” The implications go well beyond flash storage. If scaled, such hybrid architectures could drastically reduce power use and increase density in next-generation processors and AI processors, effectively continuing Moore's Law at the atomic limit. While mass production is still years away, this is the closest 2D materials have come to commercial relevance.

Do you have trouble falling asleep, or waking frequently during the night? It could be because of how your brain is wired, and may be affecting your mental and physical health, according to new research.

A study conducted by researchers in Canada and Singapore, using patient-reported sleep, health and lifestyle factors, as well as brain imaging, has identified five distinct sleep profiles.

The research, published in PLOS Biology, found that each of the profiles showed unique patterns of brain network organization, and was linked to different mental and physical health traits.

Valeria Kebets, PhD, co-first author of this study, who is currently manager of machine learning projects at the Applied AI Institute, Concordia University in Montreal, Canada, told Medical News Today that:

“The most important finding of our study is that sleep is multi-dimensional, and some of the profiles show that specific aspects of sleep are related to mental health or cognitive performance in a distinct way.”

The researchers analyzed data from 770 healthy adults aged between 22 and 36 years of age from the WU-Minn Human Connectome Project (HCP), a study investigating the relationship between human brain circuits and behavior. 

All participants filled in questionnaires about their lifestyle, mental and physical health, personality and objective measures of physical health and cognition. They also completed sleep health questionnaires to define different dimensions of sleep, including duration, satisfaction and disturbances.

In addition to the self-reported questionnaires, participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to identify neural signatures of their sleep profiles.

The researchers outlined their objective, saying that: “[I]n this study, we sought to take a multidimensional data-driven approach to identify sleep-biopsychosocial profiles that simultaneously relate self-reported sleep patterns to biopsychosocial factors of health, cognition, and lifestyle in the [healthcare professional] cohort of healthy young adults. We further explored patterns of brain network organization associated with each profile to better understand their neurobiological underpinnings.”

The researchers identified 5 profiles related to 118 biopsychosocial measures — spanning cognitive performance, physical and mental health, personality traits, affects, substance use, and demographics — as follows:

Kebets outlined the potential clinical significance of their findings, saying that: 

“The five profiles were found in a sample of healthy young adults that didn't have a psychiatric diagnosis or disabilities, suggesting that they could be used as a marker for the development of future issues, and they can guide tailored interventions.”

Each profile was associated with a unique brain-network organization, having distinct patterns of network connectivity within the brain.

However, the researchers emphasize that further research is needed to clarify the relationships between the sleep profiles and brain network connectivity.

“We found some patterns of brain connectivity that were specific to each profile, but overall we observed dysfunctional connectivity patterns in the brain networks that are responsible for motor and visual functions,” Kebets told us.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise that getting enough quality sleep is essential for health and wellbeing. People aged 18 and over should aim for at least 7 hours of sleep a night. 

But how can you ensure that you get enough quality sleep?

Experts suggest the following may help:

“General advice would be to keep good sleep habits — e.g., limit using your phone in the hour before going to sleep, limit alcohol/drug use, and have a regular bed time. Regularity is really key,” Kebets also told us.

“Sleep is central to your daily functioning — your mental health, your ability to think properly and memorize things, your mood and behavior. Don't hesitate to talk about your sleep complaints (short sleep duration, sleep awakenings, long sleep latency, etc.) to your [family doctor] to have appropriate advice on the intervention that could help your specific issue.”

— Valeria Kebets, PhD

The United States Under-20 men's national team has reached a familiar stage at the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup, with Sunday's quarterfinal against Morocco serving as a border of sorts.

On the men's side, the U.S. U20s have made it to the quarterfinal of the U-20 World Cup (which is held once every two years) nine separate times but taking the next step has been immensely difficult. Only once, in 1989, has the U.S. advanced to the semifinals, and each of the team's last five U-20 World Cup trips have ended in a heartbreaking quarterfinal defeat.

However, this year's team may be equipped to go further. While the U.S. has topped its group on several previous occasions, this may be the most experienced group of young pros that U.S. Soccer has been able to send to the tournament. Wins over traditional powers like France and Italy have underlined what this young group is capable of, with the USYNT posting 3-0 wins over both of those nations while in Chile (which is hosting the event).

Head coach Marko Mitrović is lead by Benjamin Cremaschi, a former teammate of Lionel Messi's at Inter Miami who is currently on loan with Parma in the Italian top flight. Despite being a two-way midfielder, Cremaschi has stood out on the attacking side at the U-20 World Cup, and currently leads all players with five goals.

Here's what to know to watch the U.S. Under-20 national team take on Morocco in the quarterfinals of the Under-20 World Cup:

Weston McKennie can play a number of roles for USMNT John Dorton/ISI Photos/USSF

AUSTIN, Texas — Over nine years of professional soccer, Weston McKennie has played just about everywhere. He is, at heart, a midfielder; but he has been a right back and left back, a wingback and winger, a player who, in the words of former Juventus coach Thiago Motta, “can do everything.” Even in his natural habitat, the middle of the park, he has been a No 6, 8, 10, and every fractional number in between.

Advertisement

His preferred role, though, revolves around a single word: “Freedom.”

“I'm the type of player that likes to get forward, and have the freedom to move around, and the trust and belief from the coach to be able to do that, to make runs in behind,” McKennie said Friday after he and the U.S. men's national team drew with Ecuador. “I like to be in the box. But I also like to defend and press.”

He liked the role USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino gave him Friday. McKennie, back with the national team for the first time since March, started as a central attacking midfielder, a position sometimes reserved for a clever playmaker. But he and Pochettino put their own spin on it.

Without the ball, he helped lead the U.S. press, in a 4-4-2 defensive shape.



With the ball, he started in the right pocket, between Ecuador's lines, with Malik Tillman in a similar position to the left, as the central two of the “4” in a 3-2-4-1 (sometimes described as a 3-2-5).



From that starting spot, though, McKennie ran or floated into just about every zone in the attacking half. He read the game well, and sometimes stayed in the pocket, either to give the U.S. structure in possession or to link an attack. On other occasions, he broke into a sprint, either diagonally across the field or more vertically, stretching the Ecuador defense.

In the 37th minute, for example, he drifted toward the ball, then saw Ecuadorian right back Alan Franco getting too attached to Malik Tillman, and darted into the space Franco had vacated.



In his preferred free role, this is one of McKennie's greatest strengths. He has both the speed to make these runs and the smarts to know when and where they're appropriate.

He has, in Pochettino's words, “the capacity, from a higher position, to interpret and to read the demands of the game”.

Advertisement

He's also unpredictable. He can stretch an opponent spatially but also mentally, and discombobulate a defense. He does this in a proactive and relentless way that other U.S. attacking midfielders, such as Tillman, don't.

Pochettino's problem is that McKennie is not a traditional attacking midfielder. When he gets on the ball in these dangerous areas, he's not a creative technician like Tillman and Christian Pulisic (and Gio Reyna).

And to get both Tillman and Pulisic on the field along with Tim Weah, Pochettino would probably have to either take McKennie off or rein him in.

Pulisic, of course, will be on the field when healthy. Weah (or another right wingback) will probably be too. And Tillman has gradually risen into similar territory, in part because he does things on the ball that McKennie does far less often.

When McKennie gets the ball in tight spaces at the edge of the penalty box, he's sometimes indecisive; he's OK, but doesn't turn and unlock a defense frequently enough.



That's why he's better as more of a “free 8”, starting from a slightly deeper position and running into dangerous areas, rather than receiving the ball in dangerous areas on the half-turn. This is what he was for the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup, when he bossed England with his running and ball-carrying. Four days later, against Iran, he picked up his head 40 yards from goal, and clipped a lofted diagonal pass to Sergiño Dest, who nodded it to Pulisic for the game's lone goal.

In other words, he also has “the capacity to help in the buildup, dropping, but also arriving and scoring goals,” Pochettino said Friday.

He used to do all of that for the U.S. in a 4-3-3 — and he could do it because he had two other athletic midfielders, Yunus Musah and Tyler Adams, supporting him. The main deficiency of the “MMA” midfield, though, was its lack of a playmaking No. 10 — its lack of a Malik Tillman.

And so, the dilemma: If McKennie is high, in place of Tillman, next to Pulisic, is there enough creativity? Enough service for Folarin Balogun? A player who can combine with Balogun like Tillman did in the 8th minute on Friday and later on?

On the other hand, if Tillman is in and McKennie is deeper, presumably next to Adams, does McKennie have the necessary freedom?

“What I want to provide him is the freedom,” Pochettino said Friday. “He's a player that needs freedom.”

If he and Tillman and Pulisic have it though, Adams would be vulnerable or limited — and the USMNT's balance, between attacking freedom and defensive rigidity, would be off.

Adams can cover a ton of ground from his defensive midfield position, but he can't be everywhere. He'd also have to restrain himself and suppress one of his elite skills, his ability to charge at opposing midfielders and win the ball high up the field — the type of thing he does regularly at Bournemouth because he plays within a structure, with another defensive midfielder next to him.

The other alternative, of course, would be not to start McKennie. But McKennie is one of the USMNT's three most accomplished players. He has experience on big stages and a track record of rising to big occasions. He is valuable in both penalty areas on set pieces. He has slimmed down and seemingly won back his place at Juventus. Surely, he is part of the national team's best 11.

So, there is no simple answer.

There are multiple good answers, but no easy one.

“It makes it hard for the coach to make a decision about who's going to play in that role,” McKennie said of Pochettino's many options in the advanced position.

“Also, you can look at it as an advantage, because depending on what team you play, you have different players with attributes that can add something different to the game. And even if you start with some players, and other players come into the game, it adds something different. So, I think it's a good problem to have.”

The United States Men's National Team is on a bit of a roll. It beat Japan 2-0 in stunning fashion while debuting a new three-defender system and then drew 1-1 with Ecuador, one of South America's finest teams, without some of its best players. Coach Mauricio Pochettino was right: changing the team's structure and attitude took time, but the results have certainly been worth the effort.

While plenty of USMNT regulars have contributed to the team's newfound run of form, it's a trio of France-based athletes—striker Folarin Balogun, utility man Tim Weah and midfielder Tanner Tessmann—who have really shined in the USMNT spotlight. They're thriving in France's increasingly competitive Ligue 1 and proving that excellent development opportunities can be found outside of Europe's traditional powerhouse leagues.

Monaco may be its own country, but its star-studded soccer team plies its trade in France's Ligue 1 all the same.

“A part of me wanting to play for Monaco is the prestige of the club, what they've been able to do in Europe, what they've been able to do against huge opponents,"" Balogun said, via The Guardian. 

He and his teammates added to that prestige this season in the Champions League when they held Manchester City to a shock 2-2 draw.

When Weah showed up to Marseille's training ground after joining the club on loan this summer, it was more of a return than an arrival. Weah passed through the city early in his childhood when his father, legendary Liberian striker George Weah, signed for Marseille during its 2000-2001 season. Tim's return to the seaside city was a full circle moment for the Weah men—so much so that Tim announced his return by recreating one of his father's magazine covers to honor his family's Marseille legacy.

A post shared by Timothy Weah (@timothyweah)

""When I got the call from Marseille, my dad was the first one [I called],"" Weah said, via CBS Sports Golazo. ""He said he loved it there, he said it's something special playing for this club.""

Marseille has looked good on Weah: he's had a brilliant season in 2024-25, pushing the team to a Ligue 1 title challenge and becoming the first American to score against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in the Champions League. Coach Roberto de Zerbi has pushed Weah into a more attacking role than he's played previously, and the USMNT has taken notice. Instead of using him as a traditional full back like it did earlier this year, the USMNT played Weah as a free-roaming, attack-driven wingback in it game against Ecuador. It worked, as Weah had one of his most productive nights in American colors in years.

Tessmann started his career in the States, but he's found his footing in France with Lyon. His time there has been anything but straightforward, though: the club, once one of Europe's best, fell into financial disrepair and faced forced relegation before the season began. Tessmann and his teammates have had to work against the backdrop of that existential threat, and they've done just fine: Lyon, against all odds, is tied for second in Ligue 1, level on points with Marseille and just one point behind league leader (and defending European champion) PSG. 

""We had a big situation this summer,"" Tessmann said, via U.S. Soccer. ""Luckily the club did a good job of fighting back to keep us in Ligue 1.

""We have a really hungry team that wants to show what it's like to play for a big club and to play in big competitions. We want to bring Lyon back to the Champions League. That's the goal.""

Tessmann is a unique midfielder. At 6'2"", he's bigger and stronger than most of his peers in the center of the park. When the USMNT makes the tactical choice to play with fewer midfielders, it's Tessmann and his grittiness that make the system work. He helps the team out-think and out-fight the opposition in the middle third.

The USMNT will return to action on Tuesday, Oct. 14 against Australia in Commerce City, C.O.

Chelsea owner Todd Boehly has made it his mission to bring some of the top young players to his clubs since investing, and now one of the top talents in the United States is reportedly on their radar.

The Blues have spent big money on bringing in wonderkids to both Chelsea and Strasbourg, and Chelsea are finally starting to reap the rewards of this strategy.

Estevao Willian is the most high-profile addition the club have made so far, and he announced himself to the Stamford Bridge faithful with a dramatic winning goal against Liverpool.

Despite a plethora of talent already on their books, they are continuing to analyse around the world for top players they can bring in to either BlueCo club.

One of those who is standing out right now is Seattle Sounders star Obed Vargas, who was recently voted as number one on the MLS' list of 22 under 22.

The Mexican has been a regular in the high-flying side for a number of years now, and the Chelsea owners have registered interest in a deal.

According to The Telegraph, he is on the radar of BlueCo, who own both of Chelsea and Strasbourg.

The Ligue 1 side are very much being used as a feeder club for the Blues at the moment, with a number of their top performers set for long careers in West London.

Kendry Paez, Mike Penders, Mamadou Sarr and Emanuel Emegha are all currently owned by the Blues, however will remain with Strasbourg for this season at least.

Seattle Sounders didn't make it out of the group stage at the Club World Cup, however there was time for Vargas to make his mark.

He left the tournament as one of the most promising young players, who has gained the attention of a number of clubs around Europe as a result.

Vargas impressed against both Atletico Madrid and PSG, with the latter being decimated by the Blues in the final of the competition.

BlueCo have already signed Julio Enciso, who has a chance of making it at Stamford Bridge, and the same could be on the cards for Vargas if he does move to Strasbourg.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

Inter Milan striker Francesco Pio Esposito has been named as the “MVP” for Italy in yesterday's World Cup qualifying win over Estonia.

Today's print edition of Milan-based newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, via FCInterNews, highlight the 20-year-old's sparkling display. The newspaper also praises Nerazzurri duo Nicolo Barella and Federico Dimarco.

Italy secured a hugely important victory over Estonia yesterday.

At risk of missing out on a third consecutive World Cup, the EURO 2020 winners needed to take three points.

Italy got off to just the right start. Fiorentina striker Moise Kean put the Azzurri ahead in the fourth minute. This courtesy of an assist from Inter wingback Federico Dimarco.

Then, Mateo Retegui doubled Italy's advantage a few minutes before halftime.

Italy conceded a second half goal that introduced some major doubts. However, Inter striker Francesco Pio Esposito came off the bench and scored his first ever goal for the national team to wrap up the victory.

In the view of the Gazzetta dello Sport, Pio Esposito was Italy's outstanding performer.

The 20-year-old's performance was more than just his vital goal.

Pio Esposito gave the Azzurri a boost with his energy and physicality as soon as he stepped out onto the pitch.

However, Pio Esposito is not the only Inter player to receive praise from the Gazzetta.

The newspaper also highlight the performance of Nerazzurri midfielder Nicolo Barella. The 28-year-old was in firm control of the central battle.

Furthermore, with Dimarco's assist, the Gazzetta also name the 27-year-old as one of Italy's top performers on the night.

Inter Milan wingback Federico Dimarco and striker Francesco Pio Esposito were among the stars in Italy's win over Estonia.

This is the view in today's print edition of Turin-based newspaper Tuttosport, via FCInterNews. They also argue that Nerazzurri duo Nicolo Barella and Alessandro Bastoni were also solid.

Italy got a hugely significant win over Estonia yesterday evening.

The Azzurri have been at risk of missing out on a third straight World Cup. They had already failed to qualify for the 2018 and 2022 editions of the tournament, and did not get their qualification off to the best of starts this time around.

However, Italy secured a convincing 3-1 win over Estonia in a World Cup qualifying victory yesterday.

In the view of Tuttosport, two of Italy's top performers were Inter wingback Federico Dimarco and striker Francesco Pio Esposito.

Wingback Dimarco started the match. He assisted Moise Kean's opening goal within the first few minutes.

Overall, Dimarco had a strong match, Tuttosport argue, continuing his bright start to the season with Inter.

Meanwhile, Francesco Pio Esposito came on as a substitute for Kean after the Fiorentina striker suffered an injury.

In the view of Tuttosport, Pio Esposito's display was outstanding. Then, the 20-year-old Nerazzurri striker capped it off with the third goal of the match in the second half.

In the view of Tuttosport, meanwhile, Inter midfielder Nicolo Barella and defender Alessandro Bastoni enjoyed solid matches.

The Netherlands will aim to place one foot in the 2026 World Cup's list of qualified teams as it seeks a fifth qualifying win at home to Finland on Sunday.

The Netherlands will bring the curtain down on its international break when it hosts Finland on Sunday hoping to extend its three-point lead at the top of UEFA Group G. De Oranje already sits clear at the head of its pool, but Finland can cause a stir in Amsterdam as it sits third in the pecking order and just three points off the peak.

Ronald Koeman's hosts will feel upbeat about their chances of a third straight qualifying win given they beat Finland 2-0 in Helsinki four months ago. That marked a fifth straight defeat to the Dutch in their head-to-head, and it's now been 75 years since Finland's only win over the Netherlands to date.

Memphis Depay's injury-time finish in Thursday's 4-0 win over Malta took him two goals clear of Robin van Persie as the Netherlands' all-time top scorer, with 52 goals to his name. The Corinthians attacker doesn't appear to have lost his sheen since moving to Brazil and will be out for blood after scoring in the win over Finland earlier this year, with five goals to his name in qualifying thus far.

Tuchel is 'fully expected' to see through his contract to after the 2026 World Cup, while the German was 'unimpressed' with the Red Devils' hiring process when he was previously contacted as a potential replacement for Erik ten Hag.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Barcelona are believed to be delighted with Marcus Rashford's progress and are considering sealing a permanent transfer for the Englishman next summer, following an impressive start to life in Catalunya. Rashford joined on an initial loan deal from Manchester United in August, with Barca bosses said to be wary that the deal seemed ""too good to be true"".

Valentin Vacherot and Arthur Rinderknech's remarkable respective runs at the Rolex Shanghai Masters came to a fairytale close on Sunday, when Vacherot rallied to defeat his cousin and former college teammate 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 and capture his maiden tour-level title. In doing so, the Monegasque World No. 204 became the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 champion in history (since 1990).

“It is unreal what just happened. I have no idea what is happening right now. I am not even dreaming, it is just crazy,” Vacherot said. “I am just so happy with my performances the past two weeks. I just want to thank everyone who has helped with my career since the beginning. There has to be one loser but I think there is two winners today, one family that won. And I think for the sport of tennis, the story is unreal.""

Competing in front of a packed Stadium Court at one of the biggest events on the ATP Tour, the setting for the final could not have been further removed from the pair's Texas A&M University days, where they played side by side in 2018.

Fast forward seven years and their paths have diverged. Rinderknech arrived in Shanghai with a career-high of No. 42 in the PIF ATP Rankings, with his best result a final run at the ATP 250 in Adelaide in 2022. He had never progressed beyond the third round at a Masters 1000 event until this week.

Vacherot's rise, however, proved even more improbable. The 26-year-old entered the tournament with just one tour-level win to his name, earned earlier this year in Monte-Carlo. He became the lowest-ranked finalist in Masters 1000 history (since 1990), and over the course of two unforgettable weeks, rewrote the trajectory of his career.

After battling through qualifying, the 26-year-old notched wins against Laslo Djere, Alexander Bublik, Tomas Machac, and Tallon Griekspoor to become the first player representing Monaco to reach a Masters 1000 quarter-final. He then stunned Holger Rune and four-time Shanghai champion Novak Djokovic to reach the title match.

In a compelling final, Vacherot once again showcased his resilience. He rallied from a set down for the sixth time this tournament, including qualifying, to become the first player representing Monaco to win a tour-level title in the Open Era. He is also just the third qualifier to win a Masters 1000 crown, joining Roberto Carretero (Hamburg 1996) and Albert Portas (Hamburg 2001).

“I feel when I am down, I have no choice and need to bring my A-game,"" Vacherot said on his impressive record of coming from behind. ""In the first set I didn't do that and he was playing better than me. I took my first chance to break in the second set and from that the crowd got more involved and we put on more of a show in the second part of the match.”

From alternate to MASTERS 1000 CHAMPION 🏆

World No. 204 Valentin Vacherot defeats cousin Arthur Rinderknech 4-6 6-3 6-3 to claim the crown in Shanghai.@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/SPr3iupUQR

The Monegasque is the eighth first-time champion on Tour this season and just the fifth man in ATP Masters 1000 history to claim his maiden tour-level title at this level, following Jakub Mensik, who achieved the feat earlier this year in Miami.

Vacherot leaves Shanghai up 164 spots to No. 40 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is set to crack the Top 100 and Top 50 for the first time on Monday. He also takes $1,124,380 in prize money with him, having earned $594,077 for his whole career before this fortnight.

“I was just trying to beat the guy on the other side of the net,” Vacherot said on the dynamics of facing Rinderknech. “[I tried] to put on the side that it is my cousin and the guy I have been training with and growing up with. It was very tough and he did a better job than me in the first set, coping with the pressure. But I just found a way to turn it around.”



Throughout the fortnight, Rinderknech and Vacherot supported each other from the sidelines, cheering one another on and sharing words of encouragement both in person and through their family group chat.

Vacherot had a front-row seat for Rinderknech's standout run, which included wins against Top 20 opponents Alexander Zverev, Jiri Lehecka, Felix Auger-Aliassime, and Daniil Medvedev. On Sunday, he experienced first-hand just how tough his cousin can be to beat.

Rinderknech struck 12 winners and committed just two unforced errors in an impressive opening-set display. The 30-year-old took the ball early to rush Vacherot and gained the decisive break of the first set in the third game to lead in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash.

Vacherot responded in the second set. The 26-year-old kept Rinderknech deep behind the baseline, gaining the first strike in the exchanges to dictate the tempo. From 3-3 in the second set, Vacherot broke Rinderknech in consecutive games to lead by a break in the third set. From there, he continued to play aggressively, taking large cuts at the ball to dominate. He won 92 per cent of his first-serve points in the decider, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and hit just one unforced error in the third set to capture the biggest win of his life after two hours and 11 minutes.

Rinderknech is up 26 places to No. 28 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will rise to a career high on Monday. The 30-year-old recorded his 100th tour-level win in the semi-finals to become the ninth French Masters 1000 finalist in series history.

Did You Know?
Rinderknech's meeting with Vacherot was just the third all-unseeded Masters 1000 final in series history.

Valentin Vacherot became the eighth first-time winner on the ATP Tour this season at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, where he became just the fifth player to capture their first title at an ATP Masters 1000 event.

Vacherot upset Holger Rune and Novak Djokovic en route to the final, before he beat cousin Arthur Rinderknech in the final. The 26-year-old is the first player from Monaco to win an ATP Tour singles title.

ATPTour.com caught up with Vacherot to discuss the significance of his trophy run, journey to this point and much more…

What does it mean to you to win your first ATP Tour title?
I thought my first title could be an ATP 250. But to do it at a Masters 1000 here in Shanghai, my first time in China, first time in Shanghai. I think this country will have the biggest place in my heart. It means the world to me.

Could you take a moment to acknowledge some of the key figures in your life and career who have helped you to reach this milestone?

A lot of people. Firstly my parents. I play tennis thanks to them. When I was just out of the hospital, when I was just a few days old, they would put me on the side of the court and play. My brother and coach Benjamin, who has been taking care of me since I got out of college in 2021. Ballert, Benjamin's dad, not my dad. He taught me how to play tennis from 10 to 18. The guys from the Monegasque tennis federation.

I want to thank Arthur too. He was at Texas A&M and I didn't think about going to another school, I just trusted him to join him there and get better. As you saw, we have got much, much better. Standing here today with him was surreal.

This is a milestone moment in your career. How will you celebrate this victory?

I have no idea. I can't wait to go back home. This is going to be an amazing moment for everyone. To see my friends and my families and my parents, I will see them as soon as a I can. The season is not over, I still have some work to do. Once everything is finished, I will celebrate with my friends.

Playing your cousin in the final, the first time you played each other since a Futures in 2018... How strange is it to compare that 2018 match to the experience you shared together today?

He was starting his career in 2018, one of his first ITF tournaments after finishing college. I was still in college. I was just wanting to train and went to a few ITFs and ended up playing him in the quarter-finals at one. That was fun. Little did we know that the next time we would play would be here. I did wonder a little if I came back up in the ranking, when would be the first time we would play each other and our family would have a big laugh and a huge moment. To be in a final at a Masters 1000 final is amazing.



How would you describe yourself as a player, and how would you describe yourself off the court?

Off the court I am really calm, really down to earth. I am not someone you will hear much in the room. Not someone who speaks a lot. It is the little side of me that has helped me a lot on court this week in the big moments. On court I am pretty energetic, putting all my energy on the court, in training and matches.

What do you consider to be your biggest passion outside of tennis and can you tell us a little bit about that interest?

I really enjoy sitting on the couch and watching Netflix. Play video games and I am a huge sports fan. Watch football. Watch tennis if there are some of my favourite players are playing or my friends. Football or F1, big moments I am watching. I will go on the beach a bit, walk around with my girlfriend.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Inside Rinderknech & Vacherot's journey from college tennis to the Shanghai final","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/rinderknech-vacherot-shanghai-2025-college-feature","Sun, 12 Oct 2025 01:54:26 GMT","

In 2018 the Texas A&M University men's tennis team suffered a heartbreaking 4-3 loss in the semi-finals of the NCAA Championships to Wake Forest University. Arthur Rinderknech played No. 2 singles for A&M while his cousin, Valentin Vacherot, competed at No. 4 singles. Their matches were side by side on that difficult day, which marked the end of Rinderknech's accomplished college tennis career.

Head coach Steve Denton, the two-time Australian Open finalist, still remembers what Rinderknech said to him in the aftermath of that loss.

“When Arthur left to go out to try to go play [professionally], I remember him saying to me, ‘Steve, make sure that you take care of my cousin like you took care of me',"" Denton told ATPTour.com. “I said, ‘Absolutely, I'll do that'.” 

Denton has maintained his relationship with the cousins, who on Sunday will meet for ATP Masters 1000 glory in the final of the Rolex Shanghai Masters. They each defeated a former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings — Rinderknech ousted Daniil Medvedev and Vacherot beat Novak Djokovic — in the semi-finals.

“This is a dream come true for these two guys,” Denton said. “They've taken the road maybe not traveled as much, obviously, and unless you're a freak like a [Jannik] Sinner and [Carlos] Alcaraz, a lot of players have to go through all these things in order to get to where they are.”

The college coach has been waking up in the middle of the night to watch his former players playing in China. It has been a thrilling experience for Denton, who wanted to travel to Shanghai for the final. However, by the time the former Aggies reached the championship match, there were no flights that would arrive on time.

“I went to sleep last night and it was very improbable that Valentin Vacherot was going to beat Novak Djokovic,” Denton said. “Arthur has been playing really well, and he's very confident, but still, Medvedev is a former number one player in the world and for Arthur to be able to win that match and then get to play each other in the finals is just an amazing story.”

Denton traveled to France when Rinderknech was still a junior to watch three or four players and gauge his interest in them. After watching Arthur for two minutes, the former singles World No. 12 and doubles World No. 2 knew which player he wanted.

When Rinderknech first arrived on campus at Texas A&M, the Frenchman was unable to compete for a year because he was ineligible. The character he showed that year stuck with the longtime coach.

“He suffered watching the other guys play,” Denton said. “And I think that suffering that he went through really helped him in a lot of respects, molded him into being this selfless leader.”

It was all about the team for Rinderknech in an individual sport. Fast forward to Saturday when he lost the first set in the semi-finals against Medvedev. A career-best run was nearing an end against the 2019 Shanghai champion and in the moment, the 30-year-old was not fully focused on winning the match, but trying to help wear down Medvedev so he would be exhausted Sunday in the final against his cousin.

“That's the kind of kid he is. He's always been a team player for us,” Denton said. “He was a team player, and he kind of hung in there in that match thinking, ‘Well, if I can't win, maybe I can take Medvedev's legs away from him a little bit by staying out here and giving Val a better chance'. And they both think that way. They both have a lot of humility. They both are very team oriented and clearly even more so than that, they are family oriented.”

That is a big reason why Vacherot ended up playing at Texas A&M, even if Denton had no idea Rinderknech had a cousin — let alone such a good tennis player — early on. 

“After the first year and me having a good relationship with him and him loving it here, I think he thought, ‘Okay, this is a good spot for my cousin, I'm going to look out for him and I'm going to make sure he comes here',” Denton said. “And that's what happened.”

A post shared by ATP Tour (@atptour)

The pair overlapped for two seasons and helped take the programme to its greatest heights. Rinderknech was more confident and outgoing compared to Vacherot, who was “pretty reserved”. But both proved great leaders, just in their own style. It has been special to watch their dramatic breakthrough from afar.

“You tell young players and their families that you're going to take care of them and that you're going to help them to try to go play pro tennis,” Denton said. “And so by doing that, you have to continue to stay involved in their game. And I've been involved with their game from the beginning, and as long as they want me to help them, I'm happy to do it.” 

Although Denton will not be in Shanghai, he is eager to turn on the match in the early hours of Sunday morning in Texas to watch his Aggies battle in just the second ATP Masters 1000 final between former college tennis players in series history (since 1990). Mikael Pernfors (Georgia) beat Todd Martin (Northwestern) in the 1993 Canada final.

“There are lots of exciting stories about tennis, but this story, at this time, is I think as good as any this year,” Denton said. “And what I'm excited about is these two guys have basically told the rest of the world that college tennis is a definite pathway to the Tour.”

Daniil Medvedev has made six consecutive Nitto ATP Finals appearances. Will the 2020 champion make a big comeback to secure a seventh straight showing at the season finale?

Medvedev entered the Rolex Shanghai Masters in 20th place in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, nearly out of contention for a spot in Italy from 9-16 November. But the 29-year-old advanced to the semi-finals in Shanghai, climbing to 15th in the Live Race. 

PIF ATP Live Race To Turin (following Shanghai)





*Draper is not competing the rest of the season due to injury.


With 2,360 points, Medvedev now trails eighth-placed Lorenzo Musetti by 1,075 points. Although there is not a lot of time to surge into a qualifying spot, Medvedev has an opportunity. The former World No. 1 will try to make up ground this week at the Almaty Open — an ATP 250 event — where he is the second seed. Musetti is the top seed at the BNP Paribas Fortis European Open in Brussels.

Medvedev is also scheduled to compete in the ATP 500 in Vienna, where he won the title in 2022, and the Rolex Paris Masters, giving him a chance to earn 1,750 points in his next three tournaments.

Musetti and sixth-placed Ben Shelton are trying to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time. Ninth-placed Jack Draper was also trying to make his debut, but will not compete for the rest of the season due to injury.

Everyone else currently in a qualifying position has competed in the year-end championships before. Novak Djokovic is a record seven-time Nitto ATP Finals champion and Alexander Zverev has claimed glory at the event twice.

Tenth-placed Felix Auger-Aliassime put himself in position to make a qualification push by reaching the US Open semi-finals. The Canadian, currently 530 points behind Musetti, is the second seed in Stockholm. Eleventh-placed Casper Ruud (2,495 points) is the second seed at the BNP Paribas Nordic Open in Stockholm where 12th-placed Holger Rune (2,490 points) is the top seed.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have already qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals. Sinner is the defending champion, and Alcaraz will chase his first title at the tournament.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","‘I appreciate you': Gauff defeats friend, former doubles partner Pegula for Wuhan title","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4380604/i-appreciate-you-gauff-defeats-friend-former-doubles-partner-pegula-for-wuhan-title","Sun, 12 Oct 2025 13:59:05 GMT","

It was friends-turned-foes Sunday in Wuhan, as former doubles partners Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula faced off in a WTA final for the first time in their careers. In the end, it was Gauff getting the better of her fellow American, winning 6-4, 7-5 in 1 hour and 42 minutes to claim her third WTA 1000 title.

Two years after sharing the WTA 1000 doubles title in Miami, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula stood on stage side by side again Sunday, this time as singles finalists at the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open.

But unlike their shared triumph in 2023, only one could lift the winner's trophy on this occasion. In the end, it was Gauff defeating her fellow American and former doubles partner in straight sets, 6-4, 7-5, to claim the title in 1 hour and 42 minutes.

It was the first time the friends had met in a WTA final.

During the trophy presentation, Gauff thanked Pegula for her support early on in her career.

“When I came on tour, you were one of the first people to be nice to me and welcome me with open arms,” Gauff said. “That really went a long way, so I appreciate you. It's great to finally play in the final against you, and I hope for many more. So, congratulations and thank you.”

The win marked Gauff's 11th career WTA singles title and her second of 2025, following her French Open victory. Of those titles, two are Grand Slams and three are WTA 1000s. She also owns 10 doubles titles, including one Grand Slam and four WTA 1000s.

She became the first player in history to go 9-0 in hard-court finals. All three of her career finals' losses have come on clay.

Here's how she got it done:

Winners, winners: Gauff hit 24 winners, 11 more than Pegula and two more than her unforced errors count. But it wasn't just the volume, but the timing that made these winners count, as the 21-year-old consistently delivered in the biggest moments, starting with the very first point.

The match began with a 15-shot rally, one Gauff finished with a forehand winner down the line. It was the first of six straight points as she raced out to a 3-0, then 4-1 lead.

Pegula responded with three consecutive games to level the set at 4-all, but Gauff held firm. A cross-court backhand for Gauff, winner helped her survive a tense service game to go up 5-4, allowing her to break Pegula the following game to take the set

In the second set, Pegula surged ahead 3-0, putting Gauff on the defensive. Facing a potential 4-0 deficit, Gauff dug in. She came to the net to finish an eight-shot rally with a smash winner, then reeled off three straight games to tie the set at 3-3.

Down 5-4 with Pegula serving for the set, Gauff broke again. After winning the first point of the game, she outlasted Pegula in a 12-shot rally, finishing with a backhand down the line to seal the penultimate break.

Gauff would capture her fourth break of the set in the final game, closing the match with her fourth straight game -- and one final forehand winner.

No sets dropped: With her straight sets win in the final, Gauff became the first player to win the Wuhan Open without dropping a set since the tournament's inception in 2014. She also lost just 25 games en route to the title -- the fewest by any champion in tournament history.

Her run began with a second-round win over Moyuka Uchijima, dropping just one game in 51 minutes. She needed only an hour to get past Zhang Shuai in the third round, then lost three games to Laura Siegemund in the quarterfinals.

The competition stiffened in the semifinals against Jasmine Paolini, who had beaten Gauff three times in 2025 and was fresh off a dominant win over Iga Swiatek. But Gauff dismissed the Italian in short order to reach the final.

Pegula, meanwhile, entered the match having played eight consecutive three-setters, winning seven and holding match points in all eight.

Gauff knew she couldn't let it go the distance.

“You're the three-set queen,” she said to Pegula during the ceremony. “So, I was determined not to let you get there today, because it felt like the odds would be in your favor in the third set.”

What it means: Gauff leaves Wuhan with another title, as well as bragging rights over her friend -- even though she still trails Pegula 4-3 in their head-to-head.

By completing the sweep of China's two WTA 1000 tournaments, following her China Open title last year, Gauff becomes just the second player to win both events, joining Caroline Garcia, who accomplished the feat in 2017.

She remains No.3 in the PIF WTA Rankings, but widened the gap over her nearest competitor, Amanda Anisimova, to nearly 2,000 points. She also reclaimed the No. 3 spot in the Race, overtaking Anisimova.

Looking ahead, Gauff and Pegula will both have one more opportunity to capture a big title this season at the WTA Finals in Riyadh in November.

If Gauff wins, she'll not only defend her title from last year, but also end the season with at least one Grand Slam, one WTA 1000 singles title, one WTA 1000 doubles title and a win at the WTA Finals.

It was friends-turned-foes Sunday in Wuhan, as former doubles partners Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula faced off in a WTA final for the first time in their careers. In the end, it was Gauff getting the better of her fellow American, winning 6-4, 7-5 in 1 hour and 42 minutes to claim her third WTA 1000 title.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

After seven clean holds to start the second set, Vacherot made his move. Rinderknech saved the first break point he faced with an ace out wide, but after the Monegasque denied him a game point with a stella return, Vacherot produced the loudest winner of the night with a backhand down the line to turn the tide for 5-3. A hold at 15 sent the match into a decider.Rinderknech immediately fell behind 0-40, and on his third chance to strike, Vacherot curled a sublime backhand pass to seize the break. The 30-year-old avoided falling behind a double break in his next two service games, masterfully saving a combined seven break points.He couldn't make any dent on return, though, as Vacherot won his first 15 points at the line in the final set. At 3-5, Vacherot delivered a pair of blows to open 0-30 and secured the storybook ending on his second championship point with one final forehand winner. The two cousins shared a lengthy embrace, before Vacherot soaked up his winning moment.“Tried to be the guy on the other side of the net. Tried to put it on the side that it's my cousin, the guy that I've been training (and) growing up with. It was really tough,” Vacherot said.“He did a better job than me in the first set with cooperating with the pressure and everything, he played way better than me. Just found a way to turn that around and then make the match a little bit (about) myself at the end.”

Ella Lloyd reflects on her season so far in F1 Academy

After winning in Singapore, George Russell showcased once again that he is in superb form. So why has he yet to agree a deal to race with Mercedes? Lawrence Barretto explains...

George Russell is in the form of his life. The Briton won his second race of the season and fifth of his career with a sublime conversion of pole position last time out in Singapore and sits in fourth in the Drivers' Standings, only 99 points off the championship lead despite his Mercedes' deficiencies.

His boss Toto Wolff said his charge has been ""formidable"" this year. Despite this comment, and Russell's superb form, he has yet to agree a deal to race in 2026.

He is 99.99% certain to be on the grid next year – and it will 99.99% be with Mercedes alongside Kimi Antonelli in an unchanged line-up, but negotiations have stretched out.

Bette Midler, Francis Ford Coppola, Kate Hudson, Steve Martin, Jane Fonda, Octavia Spencer and more stars are sharing their condolences for the Oscar-winning actress who died on Saturday.


							By 

	Lexi Carson


Associate Editor


	Hollywood is mourning the loss of Diane Keaton.


	The Oscar-winning actress — known for her roles in Annie Hall, the Godfather trilogy, Father of the Bride, Something's Gotta Give and The First Wives Club — died on Saturday in California at the age of 79. Her cause of death is not yet available.




	Following the news of her death, many of her former co-stars, industry figures and stars took to social media to share tributes.


	Robert De Niro shared a statement with The Hollywood Reporter, which reads: “I am very sad to hear of Diane's passing. I was very fond of her and the news of her leaving us has taken me totally by surprise. I was not expecting her to leave us. She will be missed. May she rest in peace.”

					Diane Keaton, Oscar-Winning Star of 'Annie Hall,' Dies at 79		
			









	Bette Midler, who starred alongside Keaton and Goldie Hawn in 1996's The First Wives Club, took to Instagram to write: “The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!”


	Additionally, Hawn's daughter and actress Kate Hudson shared a clip of three women in the film with the caption, “We love you so much Diane.”


	Francis Ford Coppola, Keaton's director on The Godfather films, posted a tribute on Instagram. “Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful. From her earliest performances in Hair and throughout her amazing career, she was an extraordinary actor,” he wrote. “I saw her in the film Lovers and Other Strangers and knew I had to have her play Kay in The Godfather, (which she told me she based on my wife Ellie) and her wonderful work in Annie Hall while simultaneously setting a new fashion trend. Everything about Diane was creativity personified.”

	











	Steve Martin, whom she starred alongside in 1991's Father of the Bride, shared a clip of a 2021 interview she did with Martin Short for Interview magazine, in which Short asks Keaton, “Who's sexier, me or Steve Martin?,” and Keaton replies, “I mean, you're both idiots.” Martin captioned the post: “Don't know who first posted this, but it sums up our delightful relationship with Diane.”


	Keaton's Book Club co-star Candice Bergen said in a statement to THR, “This is a huge loss both personally and for all of us. Diane was a true artist — tremendously gifted and uniquely talented in so many disciplines yet also modest and wonderfully eccentric. I will miss her terribly.” Mary Steenburgen also shared a statement with THR, which read, “Diane was magic. There was no one, nor will there ever be, anyone like her. I loved her and felt blessed to be her friend. My love to her family. What a wonder she was!!!”


	Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Keaton's nephew in Marvin's Room (where she earned one of her four Oscar noms), posted a tribute on his Instagram Stories. “Diane Keaton was one of a kind. Brilliant, funny, and unapologetically herself,” he wrote alongside a photo of himself and Keaton. “A legend, an icon, and a truly kind human being. I had the honor of working with her at 18. She will be deeply missed.”

The Oscar-winning star of ‘Annie Hall,' ‘Manhattan,' all three ‘Godfather' movies, ‘Reds' and ‘The First Wives Club' was a one-of-a-kind screen presence.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	There's a very funny scene in Ron Howard's frothy 1984 interspecies rom-com, Splash, in which Daryl Hannah, playing a mermaid in Manhattan who swaps her tail for legs, skips out to buy suitable land attire. Given that she emerged from the sea naked, she throws together an outfit from the Tom Hanks character's closet.


	The “fish out of water” turns up on a Bloomingdale's womenswear floor in a men's black suit, white shirt, black leather derbies and what looks like a school tie. The ensemble instantly brings a horrified saleslady scurrying over: “Oh my God, darling, darling, darling! That outfit is to die from! What happened, you saw Annie Hall a hundred times? That look is over.”

					Diane Keaton, Oscar-Winning Star of 'Annie Hall,' Dies at 79		
			









	That was seven years after the release of Annie Hall and the imprint on fashion and popular culture of Diane Keaton's iconic looks as the title character remained an instantly identifiable reference.


	Even more than Marlene Dietrich had done in white tie and tuxedo ensembles in the 1930s, Keaton in Annie Hall kickstarted a wave of genderless dressing with her men's shirts and wide ties, slouchy trousers and oversized jackets, button-up vests and fedoras.


	What made the layered wardrobe trend resonate — and continue to be seen on stylish women today — was how effortlessly cool it looked on Keaton. Her outfits were eccentric but unfussy, tomboyish but distinctly feminine. They made her character appear confident, even at her most insecure. And while the costumes mostly came from shopping expeditions to Ralph Lauren and other menswear emporiums, they were 100 percent reflective of Keaton's personal style off-camera.

	











	The misconception that comedy is easy — and that Keaton was essentially playing a version of herself — caused some quiet ripples of discontent when she beat out competition that included Anne Bancroft, Jane Fonda and Shirley MacLaine in dramatic roles to take home the best actress Oscar in 1977.


	But Keaton's justly honored performance in Annie Hall endures for reasons that go far beyond the synthesis of her on- and offscreen personas. She essentially reinvented the classic screwball heroine for a more socially evolved age. Annie might have come off to a casual observer as a kooky ditz, but she was clever, witty, talented, a sponge for knowledge and, eventually, an assertive voice for her own independence.


	She emerged with a wave of actresses in the 1970s and early ‘80s that defied traditional standards of silver-screen glamour by being utterly natural, among them Karen Allen, Brooke Adams, JoBeth Williams, Jill Clayburgh and Margot Kidder. And yet Keaton was very much an original, never part of any pack.


	The announcement of her unexpected death at 79, less than a month after Robert Redford's passing, represents another stinging loss to the pantheon of New Hollywood in the decades before the major studios largely stepped away from making movies for grownups.


	Irrespective of your views on the now-controversial figure of Woody Allen, the films he made with Keaton, both during and after their romantic involvement, remain among her most outstanding screen work — Annie Hall and Manhattan in particular.

	











	That's at least partly because while Keaton's characters might have been amused by the brainy verbosity and self-effacing neuroses of Allen's alter egos, she was never intimidated or outmatched by them. She challenged her writer-director and co-star in ways that few other women in his movies ever have.


	Keaton's innate radiance and verve made her born to play comedy, but she was no less gifted a dramatic actor. The women in Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather trilogy are generally submissive. But Keaton made Kay Adams-Corleone — an initially naïve outsider, favoring love over clarity as she agrees to marry Al Pacino's Michael Corleone — the moral tether to the outside world, beyond the vicious criminal enterprises of the Mafia dynasty. She stands up to Michael and walks away, as few others get to do.


	The same year Annie Hall was released, Keaton took on a risky role for a rising-star actress in Looking for Mr. Goodbar. In a fearless performance, she played Theresa Dunn, a dedicated schoolteacher whose repressive Catholic upbringing and history of childhood illness become fuel for her defiant sexuality. After feeling used and disrespected in her first experiences with men, Theresa throws herself into an increasingly dark spiral of sleazy pickup bars and hookups with strangers, ultimately with fatal results.


	With a lesser interpreter, the movie might have been just a sensationalistic shocker, but Keaton brought integrity and emotional candor to Theresa's messy search to define herself. That made it a rare example for its time of a character study that explored a modern woman's erotic desires without shame.

	











	Keaton was tough, impassioned and ultimately heartbreaking as feminist journalist and Russian Revolution sympathizer Louise Bryant, starring opposite writer-director (and offscreen partner at the time) Warren Beatty as Bohemian communist activist John Reed in his 1981 historical epic, Reds.


	But her crowning dramatic achievement came arguably the following year in Alan Parker's raw, unflinching depiction of marital breakdown Shoot the Moon, starring opposite Albert Finney. In an ecstatic New Yorker review, Pauline Kael described their characters as torn from inside the writer, director and the two stars. Faith Dunlop was a role that allowed Keaton to embrace both depression and steadfast self-possession, refusing to endure more pain from the man she married, even at the cost of great distress to their children.


	“Diane Keaton acts on a different plane from her previous film roles,” wrote Kael. “She brings the character a full measure of dread and awareness, and does it in a special, intuitive way that's right for screen acting. Nothing looks rehearsed, yet it's all fully created.”


	Aside from Paolo Sorrentino, who gave Keaton red meat to chew on as the formidable American nun and spiritual consigliere in the HBO series The Young Pope, it's disappointing that in the later years of her six-decade career, directors mostly stopped challenging Keaton.


	More often they leaned on her signature quirks and mannerisms, at times pushing her to the point of self-caricature. But Keaton could shine even in humdrum material and there are gems among the many cute comedies she could do with her hands tied behind her back.

	











	One such keeper is The First Wives Club, an effervescent feminist revenge comedy in which Keaton, Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler play women pushed aside for younger models who turn the tables on their philandering husbands. Another is the role that landed Keaton her fourth Oscar nomination, in Nancy Meyers' advanced-age romantic comedy, Something's Gotta Give. She stars as a whip-smart playwright who's much more than a foil to Jack Nicholson's smug playboy, who prides himself on dating only women under 30.


	With her sheer, undiminished magnetism alone, Keaton remained a feisty rebuke to that kind of ageism in Hollywood. Her vitality was unextinguishable. We are fortunate to have shared so much of her life.

This looks awesome

Who cares we want a real movie sequel not a re-make again and actually the next one would be part 10 because part 5 was just a copycat killer Freddy vs Jason wasn't a real Friday sequel the re-make either.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Amy Poehler jolts Saturday Night Live with her trademark energy","https://www.avclub.com/saturday-night-live-recap-season-51-episode-2","Sun, 12 Oct 2025 07:50:00 GMT","

Back in the early-to-mid 2000s, when I was first living in New York City, some friends maintained a standard weekly attendance at the free late Sunday night ASSSSCAT show at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in Chelsea. Because Amy Poehler was one of UCB's founders and the group was beginning to serve as a major feeder for Saturday Night Live, there would often be a bunch of SNL performers and writers there, doing a free show for the sheer love of comedy. Though we also enjoyed our weekly SNL viewing, it was also sometimes frustrating to see hit-and-miss sketches on Saturday night and then watch some of the same people improvise funnier material the very next evening.

Some of it was the excitement of seeing a live show and freedom from network standards, of course, both of which gave ASSSSCAT an unfair advantage. But it was still a little surprising to see how little of that spontaneously generated material became something more polished on SNL. Once in a while—maybe once or twice a season—a joke or idea we recognized from ASSSSCAT would make its way to network, but even when the performers would come up with something pretty traditional, it often stayed in the basement next to the Gristedes. Maybe the energy eventually flowed up to SNL anyway in less tangible ways; initially in a mild post-Will Ferrell slump, the show built itself back as Poehler in particular emerged as a veteran anchoring the show, with Will Forte, Bill Hader, and others coming into prominence alongside her as the decade pressed on. (For the record, because when else will I have the chance to write this down, frequent SNL-to-ASSSSCAT attendees of the era alongside Poehler were Tina Fey, Seth Meyers, Horatio Sanz, Rachel Dratch, and Jason Sudeikis.) You can see why this all was on my mind during this week's Amy Poehler-hosted episode of Season 51, coming off a classic boy-was-that-it season premiere.

For all of Poehler's success on SNL—one of the best to ever do it, I'd say—she hasn't been a huge presence as a host. She did it once in 2010, then a second time a decade ago with co-star and pal Tina Fey; cameos have been more her speed, compared to Fey's recurring roles and many hosting gigs. But her all-timer status made her a perfect choice for the show's actual 50th anniversary, even if the episode mentioned that to-the-date occasion only in passing, during a short-and-sweet monologue. (I'm sure some diehards would wish for one of the original cast members to host or cameo for the occasion, but that's vanishingly unlikely for so many reasons.) And I bring up her UCB history specifically because a lot of tonight's sketches played almost shockingly like UCB material, for better and worse.

For worse, there's something like “The Rudesons,” which barely got by on strength of performance, and maybe the mildly nostalgic buzz of it also seeming like something that could have aired in 1993 with a few language tweaks and probably a 40% increase in runtime. Still, the game of the sketch did feel like something that could have been good for a few laughs during an improv show. For better, there's the one-upping energy of the sketch about the “work birth,” which kept heightening the joke at a steady clip until Bowen Yang was emerging fully suited from his mother's birth canal. For best, there was the ad with the law firms competing over their combined years of legal experience. The latter was especially improv-coded; I could practically see the tapping-in process someone would use to instantly recruit a batch of lawyer clones from the bare-stage ensemble. Poehler was just one small part of that sketch, but the way she busted through the wall with muscular insanity felt key to the spirit of the whole thing.



Poehler's energy doesn't mean that the whole episode was a nonstop blast equivalent to watching the fastest comic minds in the business having fun on the fly. In fact, some of these sketches skewed corny; maybe it's arguable that a perimenopausal woman acting out like a surly teenager would use the signifiers of rebellion she remembers from a bygone era, but it read a little generic in the actual sketch. On the other hand, there's something weirdly poignant about seeing Poehler apply the brattiness she so often embodied during her time on the show (when she played all manner of teenagers and teenagers-at-heart) to something that's presumably a bit closer to her current lived experiences. Poehler, with an assist from Tina Fey, even managed to jolt some retro life into the wheezy political cold open, simply by playing Pam Bondi as a mean, sneering idiot—with some additional productive one-upmanship through Fey playing Kristi Noem as, well, moreso. It's a small thing (especially when SNL can't find more than the mildest satirical angle on any but the most self-caricatured sitting senators), but it beats Trump Interrupts Again.

It's not as if the cast was suddenly pared down for Poehler, and it's certainly not as if parts were distributed equally. How can they be, dividing into seventeenths? Poehler just had a way of commanding “her” sketches without taking up so much space, the way a bigger star (or a host less experienced in sketch comedy) often has to. As a result, silly, fast-paced sketches felt roomy enough to accommodate multiple players. Sometimes when SNL brings back an old cast member, it has the obligatory, bogged-down feel of a greatest-hits set. Poehler, reprising zero recurring characters besides her ever-game self, pushed forward.

Besides the experienced law offices of Billson & Lieberman, Poehler as the fast psychic with the “hard out at 7” was as punchy as its silly premise, with her blunt and supposedly clairvoyant Miss Lycus running through who's dead, who's merely drowned, and who has undiagnosed diabetes.


Honestly, in retrospect “The Rudesons” was probably the worst sketch of the night, which isn't too shabby. Sarah Sherman and Andrew Dismukes both did some strong pratfalls. And it was fun to imagine who would have done this sketch in 1993, when it would have been equally middling, possibly slightly worse. (Phil Hartman, Julia Sweeney, and Rob Schneider as the family, sans the second woman; Melanie Hutsell and Mike Myers as the couple.)


The episode was pretty even-handed and, as such, hard to call for anyone in particular, but isn't it nice to see James Austin Johnson's non-makeup face in multiple sketches?

Sabrina Carpenter pulling a double, and I fear the Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga, and Charli XCX episodes may have created undue expectations about how good this is supposed to be. I'm not immune, either. I'm fully assuming her episode will be really good! High hopes are the enemy!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Despite the drama, Disney+ renews X-Men '97 for a third season","https://www.avclub.com/x-men-97-renewed-season-3","Sun, 12 Oct 2025 00:14:00 GMT","

Things have not been entirely smooth for Disney+'s animated revival project X-Men '97 over the last few years. Sure, the reviews of the show's first season were great, praising how the series managed to revive the tone and feel of the original Fox Saturday morning X-Men cartoon with updated sensibilities (and a mean streak for actual drama). But the behind-the-scenes story has been a huge mess, after Disney parted ways with creator Beau DeMayo right before the show began airing, beginning a Cold War that eventual broke into actual fighting as DeMayo accused Disney of targeting and gaslighting him for being gay, and Disney accused him of being the subject of complaints of “egregious” workplace behavior.

None of which has stopped the streamer from renewing the series for a second season—or, indeed, a third, which was announced at New York Comic-Con on Saturday. Accompanied by footage of season 2 (at least partially written by DeMayo, according to reports) the renewal announcement solidified earlier indications that a third season was in development, now in the hands of Matthew Chauncey, a writer on Marvel's What If…? There's a pretty big question of what this show even looks like without DeMayo, who's credited as a writer on each of the first season's episodes, and who frequently spoke online about how his personal experiences informed its depiction of mutant life—but Disney seems bound and determined to find out.

Per Variety, fans at the show's New York Comic-Con panel also got to see footage of the series in action in its second season; as hinted at with the end of the first, it'll apparently see the X-Men facing off against their old foe, the aggressively Darwinian Apocalypse. (That's in the “survival-of-the-fittest” sense, not just riding around on Beagles and looking at turtles.) They'll also struggle to get back to the present (which is to say, the late '90s), after getting tossed all over the place in time. X-Men '97‘s second season is expected to debut some time in the summer of 2026.

Sadly, Oscar-winning actress Diane Keaton passed away on October 11, 2025 at age 79, and although she was never married, nor was she in a relationship at the time of her death, she previously dated her co-star, Al Pacino. Here's everything we know about their relationship.

Keaton and Pacino met while filming the Oscar-winning epic gangster movie, “The Godfather.” Although the first movie in the trilogy came out in 1972, Keaton and Pacino didn't start dating until they filmed the second “Godfather” movie in 1974. However, Keaton was interested in Pacino from the beginning.

Keaton told The Telegraph in 2013, “I was really very taken with Al from the very beginning.” While it would take some years for Keaton and Pacino to officially get together, the relationship was worth the wait.

Keaton and Pacino had a great relationship, as she told People in 2017. As Keaton described their relationship, “I was mad for him. Charming, hilarious, a nonstop talker. There was an aspect of him that was like a lost orphan, like this kind of crazy idiot savant. And oh, gorgeous!”

According to Showbiz 411, Pacino talked about his relationship with Keaton in his 2024 memoir, “Sonny Boy.” In his book, Pacino admitted he wasn't great at making the first move when it came to women, but things with Keaton “were different.” According to Pacino, “we always had a connection. She understood my read on things, and it felt comforting to have someone who got me. So I went after her. We hung out together, and after a couple of months we decided to get together. We found a tempo and a temperature that was right.”

Although the relationship eventually ended, Pacino looked back on his years with Keaton fondly, writing, ““Being with Diane had a lot to do with my sense of peace and comfort. I had found that kind of comfort that makes you feel and think with the world. I enjoyed the ability to continue this experimental journey, free from the pressures of having to fulfill anyone's expectations but my own, if I wanted to.”

Unfortunately, not every relationship can make it to the altar. Keaton has never been married, but according to People, she did want to marry Pacino. Alas, Pacino didn't necessarily feel the same way. Keaton gave him an ultimatum, and it didn't go in her favor. She and Pacino ended their relationship for good. “I worked hard on that one. I went about it in not a perfect way,” she told People.

In addition to dating Pacino, Keaton and filmmaker Warren Beatty were romantically linked, as were her and Woody Allen, with whom she made the Oscar-winning film “Annie Hall.” According to the WGA, Allen used facts about both himself and Keaton in writing the film, including Keaton's given last name: Hall. The titular role won Keaton her first and only Oscar Award win for Best Actress.

Just weeks before her passing, Diane Keaton quietly listed her beloved Los Angeles home for sale — a place she had once called her “dream home.” The decision came as her health began to decline, marking a poignant final gesture from the Oscar-winning actress known for her authenticity, creativity, and timeless sense of style.

A post shared by Estate Media (@estatemediaofficial)

In March 2025, Keaton made a decision that surprised many: she listed her beloved Los Angeles home for sale, despite previously saying she planned to live there indefinitely. The move came during a period when her health had quietly begun to decline. Friends later shared that the decision reflected a sense of practicality and peace — a final act of letting go from the actress who had spent her life creating beauty in everything she touched.

The Brentwood estate, a five-bedroom, seven-bath residence, was listed for around $29 million. The home wasn't just another luxury property; it was the culmination of Keaton's lifelong passion for architecture, design, and restoration. Every wall, tile, and brick had her touch. Her choice to sell it shortly before her passing now feels like a meaningful chapter in her story — one that blended creativity, reflection, and grace.

Keaton purchased the home in 2017 and spent years transforming it into a warm, light-filled masterpiece. Inspired by her love of craftsmanship and her childhood fascination with brick homes, she designed it to feel timeless and grounded. She often said she admired the durability and character of brick — something that reflected her own spirit.

Her approach to design was hands-on and visionary. She didn't just decorate; she rebuilt. Every project she took on blended her artistic instincts with her sharp eye for storytelling. The home became a symbol of her creativity, serving as both sanctuary and expression.

Keaton even chronicled her design philosophy in her book “The House That Pinterest Built,” where she celebrated her love for curated spaces and bold, personal aesthetics. The Brentwood property perfectly embodied that vision — rustic yet refined, personal yet inviting. It was her dream home in every sense, filled with character and the comfort of a life well-lived.

As her health declined, Keaton began stepping back from public life. Those who lived nearby noticed her quiet absence from daily walks with her dog, Reggie, around the neighborhood. Listing her home seemed to mark a subtle farewell — a sign she was preparing for change with her usual sense of dignity and calm.

A post shared by Interiors Collective (@the_interiorscollective)

For a woman who built her legacy on authenticity, the sale wasn't about money or status. It was about simplicity and closure. In her final months, Keaton showed the same grace she carried throughout her career — whether starring in “Annie Hall,” “Father of the Bride,” or “Something's Gotta Give.” The decision to sell her dream home was more than a real estate move; it was a final act of reflection from a woman who always knew how to turn life into art.

8.6

Genre:

Electronic

Label:

Force Inc

Reviewed:

October 12, 2025

Wolfgang Voigt's vision is one of the most idiosyncratic in electronic music, and one of the most influential. The German producer spent his formative years listening to glam rock and taking psychedelics in Cologne's Königsforst before discovering acid house in his late 20s, swearing allegiance to the bass drum and flooding the rave scene with dozens of EPs as Mike Ink and other aliases. By the time he and a few like-minded pals opened the Delirium record store in 1993, which would eventually give rise to the Kompakt empire and shape the sound of techno in the 2000s, Voigt was a central figure in Cologne's small but thriving scene.

Sometime in the mid-'90s, though, a romantic sensibility crept into Voigt's work. He got deeper into sampling experiments with the Roland W-750. He started naming his tracks after songs by the Bee Gees and Roxy Music. Most crucially, he started formulating a tangle of connections that folded specifically European reference points like glam rock, German schlager and oompah music, and the work of composers like Berg, Wagner, and Schoenberg into an aesthetic singularity with some deep truth that Voigt seemed to hear echoing from nature itself.

You could spend hours poring over charts and graphs, drawing lines with a red pen between the disparate inputs that feed into Voigt's vision, but the output spoke clearly and directly to audiences on both sides of the aisle dividing rockers and ravers. [Las Vegas], Voigt's 1996 collab with Jörg Burger as Burger/Ink, was picked up by indie-rock heavyweight Matador for stateside distribution in 1998. GAS, Voigt's long-running ambient project based on string samples and heavy vinyl crackle, is one of a handful of acts someone just getting into ambient music is likely to discover.

Meanwhile, the “schaffel” beat that Kompakt producers like Jürgen Paape and Superpitcher were adopting—an adaptation of the 12/8 rhythm associated with glam rock filtered through the swing of German oompah bands—found its way into everything from P!nk's restaurant mishaps to Goldfrapp's lab-rat experiments, from one of Kanye's most unfortunately prescient songs to one of Adam Lambert's most conspicuous live-TV smooches. An excellent playlist from Matthew Perpetua tracks the long trail of footprints that glam rock stomped across techno, as filtered through the sound of Kompakt and its affiliates.

The Rosetta Stone uniting all these disparate threads is Life's a Gas, Wolfgang Voigt's debut full-length album, released in 1996 as Love Inc. Life's a Gas got some attention from a German rock press that was typically indifferent toward techno, yet it remains one of Voigt's lesser heard albums. For one thing, it's not available on streaming—likely due to its surfeit of samples, conspicuously lifted from the pop and rock music Voigt would've heard during his formative years as a music listener.

Voigt has complained in the past that critics read too much into his use of samples. “To me it's not about what's been sampled, but what comes out on the other side,” he said. But while that might apply with GAS' overwhelming drones, it's hard to make the same argument with Life's a Gas, whose cover, by Bianca Strauch, is plastered with the sleeves of classic albums from Miles Davis' electric awakening In a Silent Way to Roxy Music's exquisite swan song Avalon. The record literally wears its influences on its sleeve, perhaps inspiring professed Voigt acolyte Panda Bear to include a list of influences with his own sampledelic ode to youth, Person Pitch. It's like a shrine to the act of listening.

Standing astride Life's a Gas are two remixes of “Hot Love,” the epochal single T. Rex famously performed on Top of the Pops in February 1971, kicking off the glam-rock revolution. Voigt would've been nine or 10 at the time, the perfect age to have his mind blown by the mysteries of rock'n'roll, and the way the 12/8 shuffle of “Hot Love” carries through the Kompakt catalog suggests Voigt was not the only one in his group to have been bitten by the glam-rock bug during the genre's period of dominance in Europe. Just as that beat would show up in glam-era hits by everyone from Bowie to Queen to Suzi Quatro to Gary Glitter, so would it set the tone for the schaffel techno that'd become crucial to Kompakt's identity.

“Hot Love (Mike Mix),” the first of the two remixes, is like an attempt at burrowing into the feeling of being young and impressionable and having your bodily rhythm sync with that of a song in a way that makes you feel emboldened and enlarged. If the promise of an edit is to distend the best moment of a song for as long as a remixer or a DJ desires, this is one of the most poignant and personal examples of the form. It sounds the way you might remember “Hot Love” if you'd heard it a long time ago and spent the ensuing years trying to place that violently swung beat and those serpentine string embellishments. It's nearly hyperreal, boiling down Bolan's already potent distillation of badassery even further until all that's left is pure awe.

The second version of “Hot Love” is the GAS mix, which elevated an inconspicuous project of Voigt's to center stage. Here, the string filigrees of “Hot Love” become pitched-down gashes that threaten to swallow the mix like the black cloak of F.W. Murnau's Mephistopheles. It makes you look at the GAS project differently once you realize that the name comes not from the vaporous state of matter but from T. Rex's “Life's a Gas.” A lot of the essential elements of Bolan's sound carry over to Voigt's take on ambient music: magisterial fade-ins and fade-outs, gossamer strings, a steady bass drum, and, above all else, a sense of fearful symmetry.

Though Life's a Gas scans as a distinctly pop release, especially in contrast with Voigt's earlier acid 12""s, it has no songs per se, and only one complete phrase is sung during its runtime. That would be the title phrase, ripped directly from the T. Rex song of the same name and allowed to meander over a looped snippet of Roxy Music's “True to Life” for nearly 15 minutes. It's less accurate to say Life's a Gas ends with the title track than that it ends with a vast pocket of space through which the title track is allowed to wander. Voigt's treatment of the sample uncannily evokes the approach vaporwave producers would take 15 years later, stripping bits of ephemeral radio pop down to ghostly patinas and examining our relationships with the stray songs that rattle around in our memories.

Life's a Gas was released on vinyl and as an extended CD version. The vinyl record is more explicitly a dance album, featuring the TB-303 workout “T.R.I.B.U.T.E.” along with the three T. Rex remixes and three more traditional techno tracks. But the 72-minute extended version of the album sounds halfway like a rock long-player, and some of the CD exclusives are so louche they might be parodies of album-oriented rock.

“Where It's At” opens a dark and perfumed world of sexual intrigue, painted in purplish downtempo hues and laced with wordless coos and eerie backmasking effects. “Lady Democracy” teases a sample so beautiful it's almost orgasmic once allowed to play out in full. Would it surprise you if I told you it came from “You Don't Fool Me,” an MOR ballad posthumously Frankensteined from a Freddie Mercury vocal and allowed to pass for Queen on a posthumous 1995 album called Made in Heaven? Stripped of the zombie Mercury, the backing track regains some of its latent dignity.

“To some extent, you sample out of reverence,” Voigt said. “You find something great, you want to connect to it and preserve it, add something—or maybe take something little away that you do not like.” You can understand why Voigt was so taken with the Field, the Swedish producer whose taste in samples tended towards lite-rock filler by Lionel Richie and Coldplay, and whose 2007 debut From Here We Go Sublime would be one of Kompakt's biggest indie crossover successes. Or with DJ Koze, who started out in rap groups and approaches sampling with the gusto of a hip-hop crate digger.

The idea of a dance album sounding like soft rock was still novel in 1996, when electronic dance music's allegiance to rock history mostly manifested in labored parallels between the First and Second Summers of Love and their respective lovey-dovey drug cultures. It wouldn't be novel for much longer. At the same time Voigt was establishing himself as an album artist, a group of French producers were taking the best parts of their own favorite '70s rock and disco records and slathering them in filters, spurring a crossover revolution and clearing the way for electronic music to infiltrate the mainstream. These days a lot of dance music sounds like soft rock—you could say Daft Punk set the tone for streaming-era indica disco on an album that, ironically, celebrated the last time major pop albums sounded like labors of love and money.

Nearly half a century removed from the rock-vs.-disco wars, the tendency of dance music and rock to grow towards each other now seems like an inevitable quirk of evolution, from Norwegian space disco finding the middle ground between the extended song forms of dance music and the sprawl of jam bands, to Justice casting themselves as heavy-metal barbarians and making explicit the connection between big-room EDM shows and red-eyed ‘70s arena concerts. Yet few artists have brought those thrills together into one fluid vision quite like Wolfgang Voigt on Life's a Gas, an album that for 72 minutes sustains the feeling of hearing a great song, then strips the songs away until the feeling is all that's left.

The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola paid tribute to Diane Keaton Sunday following news of the legendary actress' death.


	“Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful,” the filmmaker wrote of the actress who portrayed Kay Adams in the Godfather saga.

A post shared by Francis Ford Coppola (@francisfordcoppola)


	“From her earliest performances in ‘Hair' and throughout her amazing career, she was an extraordinary actor. I saw her in the film ‘Lovers and Other Strangers' and knew I had to have her play Kay in The Godfather, (which she told me she based on my wife Ellie) and her wonderful work in ‘Annie Hall' while simultaneously setting a new fashion trend. Everything about Diane was creativity personified.”

	Jane Fonda, Steve Martin, Leonardo DiCaprio and Mandy Moore were among Keaton's Hollywood peers and co-stars to remember the Oscar-winning actress following news of her death Saturday at the age of 79, while Keaton's First Wives Club co-stars Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn also paid tribute. 

	











	“Some actors play emotions. Diane Keaton lived inside them,” the Academy — which awarded a Best Actress Oscar to Keaton for Annie Hall — wrote on social media. “Diane Keaton embodied the contradictions of being human: funny and fragile, bright and bruised, always achingly honest. For decades, she filled every frame with warmth, wit, and wonder. A Best Actress Oscar winner and four-time nominee, her presence shaped generations of storytelling. Her spirit will live forever on screen, and in the hearts of all who saw themselves in her.”

	Among the topics Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update took on were Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s latest unscientific comments and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem‘s odd attempt to blame Democrats for the government shutdown. 


	“Health secretary RFK Jr., seen here trying to cure cancer with his mind, said this week that men who were circumcised are more likely to be autistic,” co-anchor Colin Jost said of the proponent of vaccine misinformation, who has claimed that Tylenol is linked to autism. “—Which isn't surprising coming from a man who looks like he's made out of foreskin.”


	Jost then addressed how Noem is subjecting airline passengers in line at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints to a video of her insisting that the government shutdown, which is occurring under a GOP-controlled Senate, House and a Republican president, is actually all Democrats' fault.

	Jost then played a portion of the video—which turned out to be the first line of fictional serial killer Jigsaw's videotaped message to his tortured victims: “I want to play a game.”

	











	Weekend Update also addressed a recent development—of questionable legality—in the U.S. Treasury.


	That department, Michael Che announced, “is planning to release a silver dollar with President Trump's face on it. And then on the other side, he has Harriet Tubman in a head lock.”


	Tubman, the abolitionist and slave rescuer, would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said way back in 2016. But it's looking like that may not come about until at least 2030.

	











	Jost also called out Trump for proclaiming an end to Indigenous People's Day and labeling Christopher Columbus “original American hero.”

	“So while Trump is rounding up people with ICE, he is praising Columbus, a guy who literally brought boat loads of Hispanics to America,” Jost said.


	Weekend Update concluded with a joke off between Jost, Che, and former anchors Tina Fey, Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler, who was SNL‘s host Saturday.
