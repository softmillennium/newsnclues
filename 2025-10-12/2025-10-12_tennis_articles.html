                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the end, it was Gauff getting the better of her fellow American, winning 6-4, 7-5 in 1 hour and 42 minutes to claim her third WTA 1000 title. Two years after sharing the WTA 1000 doubles title in Miami, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula stood on stage side by side again Sunday, this time as singles finalists at the Dongfeng ¬∑ Voyah Wuhan Open. But unlike their shared triumph in 2023, only one could lift the winner's trophy on this occasion. ‚ÄúWhen I came on tour, you were one of the first people to be nice to me and welcome me with open arms,‚Äù Gauff said. ‚ÄúThat really went a long way, so I appreciate you. It's great to finally play in the final against you, and I hope for many more. She also owns 10 doubles titles, including one Grand Slam and four WTA 1000s. All three of her career finals' losses have come on clay. It was the first of six straight points as she raced out to a 3-0, then 4-1 lead. Pegula responded with three consecutive games to level the set at 4-all, but Gauff held firm. A cross-court backhand for Gauff, winner helped her survive a tense service game to go up 5-4, allowing her to break Pegula the following game to take the set Facing a potential 4-0 deficit, Gauff dug in. Down 5-4 with Pegula serving for the set, Gauff broke again. ü§©@CocoGauff beats Pegula 6-4, 7-5 to win the title üèÜ#WuhanOpen pic.twitter.com/TkLv8p9ru4 She also lost just 25 games en route to the title -- the fewest by any champion in tournament history. Her run began with a second-round win over Moyuka Uchijima, dropping just one game in 51 minutes. She needed only an hour to get past Zhang Shuai in the third round, then lost three games to Laura Siegemund in the quarterfinals. The competition stiffened in the semifinals against Jasmine Paolini, who had beaten Gauff three times in 2025 and was fresh off a dominant win over Iga Swiatek. Pegula, meanwhile, entered the match having played eight consecutive three-setters, winning seven and holding match points in all eight. Gauff knew she couldn't let it go the distance. ‚ÄúSo, I was determined not to let you get there today, because it felt like the odds would be in your favor in the third set.‚Äù What it means: Gauff leaves Wuhan with another title, as well as bragging rights over her friend -- even though she still trails Pegula 4-3 in their head-to-head. By completing the sweep of China's two WTA 1000 tournaments, following her China Open title last year, Gauff becomes just the second player to win both events, joining Caroline Garcia, who accomplished the feat in 2017. She remains No.3 in the PIF WTA Rankings, but widened the gap over her nearest competitor, Amanda Anisimova, to nearly 2,000 points. Looking ahead, Gauff and Pegula will both have one more opportunity to capture a big title this season at the WTA Finals in Riyadh in November. If Gauff wins, she'll not only defend her title from last year, but also end the season with at least one Grand Slam, one WTA 1000 singles title, one WTA 1000 doubles title and a win at the WTA Finals. In the end, it was Gauff getting the better of her fellow American, winning 6-4, 7-5 in 1 hour and 42 minutes to claim her third WTA 1000 title.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Valentin Vacherot and Arthur Rinderknech's remarkable respective runs at the Rolex Shanghai Masters came to a fairytale close on Sunday, when Vacherot rallied to defeat his cousin and former college teammate 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 and capture his maiden tour-level title. 204 became the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 champion in history (since 1990). I have no idea what is happening right now. I am not even dreaming, it is just crazy,‚Äù Vacherot said. ‚ÄúI am just so happy with my performances the past two weeks. I just want to thank everyone who has helped with my career since the beginning. There has to be one loser but I think there is two winners today, one family that won. Fast forward seven years and their paths have diverged. Rinderknech arrived in Shanghai with a career-high of No. He had never progressed beyond the third round at a Masters 1000 event until this week. The 26-year-old entered the tournament with just one tour-level win to his name, earned earlier this year in Monte-Carlo. After battling through qualifying, the 26-year-old notched wins against Laslo Djere, Alexander Bublik, Tomas Machac, and Tallon Griekspoor to become the first player representing Monaco to reach a Masters 1000 quarter-final. He then stunned Holger Rune and four-time Shanghai champion Novak Djokovic to reach the title match. In a compelling final, Vacherot once again showcased his resilience. He rallied from a set down for the sixth time this tournament, including qualifying, to become the first player representing Monaco to win a tour-level title in the Open Era. He is also just the third qualifier to win a Masters 1000 crown, joining Roberto Carretero (Hamburg 1996) and Albert Portas (Hamburg 2001). "In the first set I didn't do that and he was playing better than me. 204 Valentin Vacherot defeats cousin Arthur Rinderknech 4-6 6-3 6-3 to claim the crown in Shanghai. The Monegasque is the eighth first-time champion on Tour this season and just the fifth man in ATP Masters 1000 history to claim his maiden tour-level title at this level, following Jakub Mensik, who achieved the feat earlier this year in Miami. He also takes $1,124,380 in prize money with him, having earned $594,077 for his whole career before this fortnight. ‚Äú[I tried] to put on the side that it is my cousin and the guy I have been training with and growing up with. It was very tough and he did a better job than me in the first set, coping with the pressure. But I just found a way to turn it around.‚Äù Throughout the fortnight, Rinderknech and Vacherot supported each other from the sidelines, cheering one another on and sharing words of encouragement both in person and through their family group chat. Vacherot had a front-row seat for Rinderknech's standout run, which included wins against Top 20 opponents Alexander Zverev, Jiri Lehecka, Felix Auger-Aliassime, and Daniil Medvedev. On Sunday, he experienced first-hand just how tough his cousin can be to beat. Rinderknech struck 12 winners and committed just two unforced errors in an impressive opening-set display. He won 92 per cent of his first-serve points in the decider, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and hit just one unforced error in the third set to capture the biggest win of his life after two hours and 11 minutes. 28 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will rise to a career high on Monday. Rinderknech's meeting with Vacherot was just the third all-unseeded Masters 1000 final in series history.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2 singles for A&M while his cousin, Valentin Vacherot, competed at No. Their matches were side by side on that difficult day, which marked the end of Rinderknech's accomplished college tennis career. Head coach Steve Denton, the two-time Australian Open finalist, still remembers what Rinderknech said to him in the aftermath of that loss. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings ‚Äî Rinderknech ousted Daniil Medvedev and Vacherot beat Novak Djokovic ‚Äî in the semi-finals. ‚ÄúThis is a dream come true for these two guys,‚Äù Denton said. ‚ÄúThey've taken the road maybe not traveled as much, obviously, and unless you're a freak like a [Jannik] Sinner and [Carlos] Alcaraz, a lot of players have to go through all these things in order to get to where they are.‚Äù It has been a thrilling experience for Denton, who wanted to travel to Shanghai for the final. ‚ÄúI went to sleep last night and it was very improbable that Valentin Vacherot was going to beat Novak Djokovic,‚Äù Denton said. ‚ÄúArthur has been playing really well, and he's very confident, but still, Medvedev is a former number one player in the world and for Arthur to be able to win that match and then get to play each other in the finals is just an amazing story.‚Äù Denton traveled to France when Rinderknech was still a junior to watch three or four players and gauge his interest in them. After watching Arthur for two minutes, the former singles World No. When Rinderknech first arrived on campus at Texas A&M, the Frenchman was unable to compete for a year because he was ineligible. ‚ÄúHe suffered watching the other guys play,‚Äù Denton said. ‚ÄúAnd I think that suffering that he went through really helped him in a lot of respects, molded him into being this selfless leader.‚Äù You May Also Like: Cousins Rinderknech & Vacherot living 'undreamable dream': Who will win Shanghai final? It was all about the team for Rinderknech in an individual sport. ‚ÄúThat's the kind of kid he is. He's always been a team player for us,‚Äù Denton said. ‚ÄúHe was a team player, and he kind of hung in there in that match thinking, ‚ÄòWell, if I can't win, maybe I can take Medvedev's legs away from him a little bit by staying out here and giving Val a better chance'. They both are very team oriented and clearly even more so than that, they are family oriented.‚Äù ‚ÄúAfter the first year and me having a good relationship with him and him loving it here, I think he thought, ‚ÄòOkay, this is a good spot for my cousin, I'm going to look out for him and I'm going to make sure he comes here',‚Äù Denton said. A post shared by ATP Tour (@atptour) But both proved great leaders, just in their own style. It has been special to watch their dramatic breakthrough from afar. And I've been involved with their game from the beginning, and as long as they want me to help them, I'm happy to do it.‚Äù Mikael Pernfors (Georgia) beat Todd Martin (Northwestern) in the 1993 Canada final.
