                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The pop superstar's 12th album is already shattering multiple sales records. Good Morning America is teasing a big reveal involving Taylor Swift. ‚ÄúTOMORROW: We're keep it üíØ with an exclusive Taylor Swift announcement! The post includes a clip from Swift's ‚ÄúThe Fate of Ophelia‚Äù video, accompanied by a voiceover that says, ‚ÄúShe's at it again. And now tomorrow morning, GMA has a huge new exclusive announcement on Taylor. It was unclear at press time whether Swift herself will appear during Monday's episode of GMA. But the album already has more than 3.4 million in pure album sales (physical and digital purchases), marking the largest sales week for any album since Luminate began electronically tracking music data in 1991, when the modern era of weekly music tabulation began. The previous record for modern-era record for single-week sales of an album was held by Adele's 25, which moved 3.378 million copies in its opening week in November 2015. As for whether a The Life of a Showgirl tour is on the horizon, Swift recently shut down that speculation. ‚ÄúLike, when I think about doing it again ‚Ä¶,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúBecause I would want to do it really well again.‚Äù Swift's blockbuster Eras Tour ran from March 2023 through December 2024, spanning 149 shows across five continents. It ultimately became the highest-grossing tour of all time, earning over $2 billion and selling more than 10 million tickets, according to Billboard Boxscore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chappell Roan is facing criticism from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security following comments she made during a recent concert in Los Angeles. During the first of two performances at Brookside at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Friday (Oct. 11), the 27-year-old pop star paused her hit-filled set to reflect on her appreciation for her adopted hometown. ‚ÄúI'm not gonna be eloquent about this,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI loved L.A. more than ever than when I saw how the community came together in Altadena to help, same with the Palisades, I just realized that I'm so lucky to be able to live here and to play here, and the city has taken care of me, and it's my duty to take care of it back.‚Äù She then concluded her remarks with a pointed political statement. That's who we're getting off of our streets. Get a grip,‚Äù DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin told TMZ. Roan's comments come at a particularly tense moment for immigrant communities in the U.S., who have increasingly found themselves the target of aggressive ICE operations. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker recently described them as ‚Äúmilitary-style‚Äù raids. President Donald Trump has made mass deportations a central part of his second term.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two men were arrested on suspicion of murder in the death of Ian Watkins, the Lostprophets singer and convicted pedophile who was stabbed and killed in prison Saturday. The BBC reports that two men, aged 25 and 43, were arrested in connection to Watkins' death, and that a murder investigation is currently underway. Watkins was killed at the age of 48 on Saturday at West Yorkshire, England's HMP Wakefield prison, where the former singer was serving a 29-year sentence after pleading guilty to 13 charges, including the attempted rape of a fan's baby and making child pornography. Watkins was previously attacked at the jail in August 2023 by three other prisoners, an incident that left him with neck injuries which required hospital treatment. England's HMP Wakefield is considered one of the country's most notorious prisons, and dubbed the ‚ÄúMonster Mansion‚Äù as its residents include serial killers, murderers and pedophiles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ellen DeGeneres is remembering her longtime friend and favorite guest, Diane Keaton. The comedian and former talk show host shared an emotional Instagram tribute after news broke that the Oscar-winning actress had died at age 79 on October 11. ‚ÄúDiane Keaton was an icon, a hero of mine growing up,‚Äù DeGeneres wrote. Fans adored their chemistry, whether they were laughing about Keaton's love of wine or her offbeat stories from Hollywood. The pair developed a genuine friendship filled with laughter and respect. Viewers loved her carefree charm and ability to make DeGeneres laugh uncontrollably. Following Keaton's passing, clips of her interviews with DeGeneres resurfaced online, showing the actress dancing, joking, and making the audience roar with laughter. Fans filled social media with memories of her appearances, calling the duo's friendship ‚Äúpure joy‚Äù and ‚ÄúTV magic.‚Äù Many said watching Keaton's spontaneity on the show always ‚Äúmade their day.‚Äù As tributes continue to pour in from across Hollywood, DeGeneres's words capture the lasting impact Diane Keaton had not only as an actress but as a woman who radiated warmth, humor, and genuine authenticity. ‚ÄúDiane was truly one of a kind,‚Äù DeGeneres wrote. Her laughter, light, and fearless spirit continue to shine through the memories she created on screen, on stage, and in the hearts of everyone who loved her. Beloved actress Diane Keaton passed away on Saturday, October 11, at the age of 79. The Oscar winner, celebrated for her unforgettable performances in ‚ÄúAnnie Hall,‚Äù ‚ÄúSomething's Gotta Give,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Family Stone,‚Äù died unexpectedly, according to those close to her. ‚ÄúShe declined very suddenly, which was heartbreaking for everyone who loved her,‚Äù a friend told People. ‚ÄúIt was so unexpected, especially for someone with such strength and spirit.‚Äù ‚ÄúEven longtime friends weren't fully aware of what was happening,‚Äù the insider said. The five-bedroom, seven-bathroom property was an actual labor of love. Keaton, a lifelong architecture enthusiast, moved into the home in 2017 and spent eight years renovating it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Martin speaks with a mix of humor, warmth and livewire energy. Their work has dealt with, and often found the funny within, life's awkward or existential moments. ‚ÄúWith stand-up, it was such a huge turning point in my career when I started talking about real stuff ‚Äî my life and addiction and pain,‚Äù they say. It's really gratifying and validating to say the things that you're embarrassed about and then have other people say, ‚ÄòYeah, me too. Deadline talks to Martin in Toronto where they grew up, and it's a full circle moment. Years before, they were filming outside the movie premieres at the Toronto International Film Festival with a camcorder, or they were getting autographs from stars such as Liev Schreiber. ‚ÄúIt's really about adolescence and I associate Toronto with my teens. The viewers' entry point is through Abbie (Sydney Topliffe), whose parents send her to the school, and Leila (Alyvia Alyn Lind), her best friend who attempts to rescue her; as well as via Alex (Martin), a newly arrived cop, and his heavily pregnant wife, Laura (Sarah Gadon). The Abbie-Leila relationship is modeled on that of Martin and their childhood best friend, who was taken to a school for troubled teens. Martin describes Wayward as ‚Äúat heart a love letter to teen friendship.‚Äù The school's origins are cultish, an area that fascinates Martin. It also delved into Mae's past and their own teen years. If Feel Good was comedy with a powerful dramatic arc, Wayward turns that formula on its head and is largely a drama with some lighter moments along the way. ‚ÄúI was keen to properly build tension,‚Äù Martin says about that radical gear-shift. Given Martin has had a successful career as a stand-up comic and comedy writer, was it hard to reel in the laughs for Wayward?‚ÄúI feel like my inner clown is very close to the surface,‚Äù they say. Am I funny really, or is that just a way of interfacing with the world?' When pressed on their dream role, Martin says they want to be the next James Bond. In Feel Good, Martin's character tells their agent: ‚ÄúI've always wanted to be John Wick.‚Äù In Wayward, a pumped-up Martin plays cop Alex Dempsey, who cracks some heads and is seriously deep in the action. ‚ÄúI have perpetual imposter syndrome about acting, but I really fell in love with it making this show and getting to work with Toni Collette, Sarah Gadon and the cast. I gave myself license to really go for it. Martin was urged to dye their hair darker so that Alex could be taken more seriously. Martin pinpoints a crucial scene just over halfway through the season. That representation would have meant a lot to me when I was young. It's such a different thing to see: An eight-months pregnant woman who's fully clothed and this trans guy.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat that means is that, if you're not preaching, or making it such a linchpin of the show, you can actually be more subversive. Narratively, there is so much going on in this scene.‚Äù In the wrong hands, Evelyn could have been a pantomime baddie, but Collette delivers something more complex. ‚ÄúWhere it could have been a sort of mustache-twirling villain, I think you feel that Evelyn really believes in what she's doing and just lacks self-awareness and is some kind of narcissist.‚Äù Feel Good and Wayward are both produced by Objective Fiction. ‚ÄúIn Feel Good there was an adult processing their teens and then with SAP I was similarly driven by nostalgia and trying to make sense of it all,‚Äù says Martin. ‚ÄúI'm trying to make sense of how visceral those years were for me; all of those firsts are so intense. With Wayward, Martin is hopeful that audiences will reflect on their own adolescence. ‚ÄúI'd like people to think about their own teens. We should absolutely be listening to young people more. For Martin, it was important that the young cast of Wayward such as Topliffe, Lind and others felt empowered amongst seasoned performers such as Collette, Gadon and Patrick J. Adams. ‚ÄúWe were already editing the show when I watched [Netflix's U.K. drama] Adolescence. There is an episode with around 200 kids in that school, but if you give them that responsibility, or trust people with their characters and their intuition, then they really step up. It was important to me, that [the young cast] felt like they had ownership over the emotional worlds of their characters.‚Äù Post-Wayward, Martin has a stand-up tour in the offing and projects with Feel Good co-creator Joe Hampson in the works. Martin is also eyeing roles in work created by other writers. ‚ÄúI've never been in a movie and I'd love to act in someone else's thing and to play someone really different.‚Äù I'd also love to play a villain or do a kids' movie.‚Äù That might be called keeping your options open, but considering Martin has written comedy and now drama, releases music, writes books, co-hosts a popular podcast and has also started selling their artwork, these ambitions don't feel lofty.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Bette Midler, Francis Ford Coppola, Kate Hudson, Steve Martin, Jane Fonda, Octavia Spencer and more stars are sharing their condolences for the Oscar-winning actress who died on Saturday. Hollywood is mourning the loss of Diane Keaton. Following the news of her death, many of her former co-stars, industry figures and stars took to social media to share tributes. Robert De Niro shared a statement with The Hollywood Reporter, which reads: ‚ÄúI am very sad to hear of Diane's passing. Bette Midler, who starred alongside Keaton and Goldie Hawn in 1996's The First Wives Club, took to Instagram to write: ‚ÄúThe brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. Additionally, Hawn's daughter and actress Kate Hudson shared a clip of three women in the film with the caption, ‚ÄúWe love you so much Diane.‚Äù ‚ÄúWords can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. ‚ÄúI saw her in the film Lovers and Other Strangers and knew I had to have her play Kay in The Godfather, (which she told me she based on my wife Ellie) and her wonderful work in Annie Hall while simultaneously setting a new fashion trend. Steve Martin, whom she starred alongside in 1991's Father of the Bride, shared a clip of a 2021 interview she did with Martin Short for Interview magazine, in which Short asks Keaton, ‚ÄúWho's sexier, me or Steve Martin?,‚Äù and Keaton replies, ‚ÄúI mean, you're both idiots.‚Äù Martin captioned the post: ‚ÄúDon't know who first posted this, but it sums up our delightful relationship with Diane.‚Äù Keaton's Book Club co-star Candice Bergen said in a statement to THR, ‚ÄúThis is a huge loss both personally and for all of us. Diane was a true artist ‚Äî tremendously gifted and uniquely talented in so many disciplines yet also modest and wonderfully eccentric. I will miss her terribly.‚Äù Mary Steenburgen also shared a statement with THR, which read, ‚ÄúDiane was magic. Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Keaton's nephew in Marvin's Room (where she earned one of her four Oscar noms), posted a tribute on his Instagram Stories. I had the honor of working with her at 18. Below, see all of the tributes (so far) that stars have made. I was so honored to call Diane Keaton a friend. She was an amazingly kind and creative person who also just happened to be a Hollywood legend. She has been taken from us far too soon. She directed two videos of mine ‚Äì "Heaven Is A Place on Earth" and the video for "I Get Weak. Whether it's ANNIE HALL or SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE, we'll always remember when we fell in love with Diane Keaton. RIP to one of America's most graceful, elegant, and fiercely talented muses Diane Keaton who maintained a sense of self throughout her many roles that was a reminder to me as a young performer that the most interesting person you can mine are the many aspects of yourself. Reese Witherspoon emotionally pays tribute to Diane Keaton while on stage at her #ShineAway event in L.A. pic.twitter.com/MFwAFna3pU Diane Keaton has left us and I can't tell you how profoundly sad that makes me. She was a very special person and an incredibly gifted actor, who made each of her roles unforgettable. Her light will continue to shine through the art she leaves behind.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/pYr5cm3Ebu Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paramount+'s new Star Trek series, Starfleet Academy, has not been shy about leveraging its big-name talent, whether that means giving fans a good, hard look at ‚ÄúHolly Hunter, Space Principal,‚Äù or Paul Giamatti living out his dreams of being a cackling alien villain with tons of crap glued to his face. (To say nothing of franchise return guests like Tig Notaro, Mary Wiseman, and Robert Picardo.) (Not too long from when Starfleet Academy will be having its January 15, 2026 premiere.) But given that we've always thought of him as way more of a fantasy dork than a space nerd, it's still interesting to hear that he's going to be picking up work as the ‚Äúdigital dean‚Äù of the Academy, delivering announcements to the students. (Joking, in a video clip filmed from his Late Show desk, that it's all the fun of being on the show without having to spend four hours a day getting Giamatti'd up.) Long-time fans of Colbert's career will know that he used to hop in the voice booth pretty often, lending his sharp, Stentorian tones to cartoons like Harvey Birdman: Attorney At Law and The Venture Bros.. If you were on the fence about Starfleet Academy‚Äîwhich also got a non-Colbert trailer today, featuring what looks like a pretty enjoyably pulpy blend of teen angst, smooching, and grown-ups like Hunter and Giamatti hamming it up‚Äîthough, it's always possible that having Colbert delivering funny announcements in the background while all the drama's going on might be a deciding factor for you. (If nothing else, it's nice to know the guy can still book a gig, despite all.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In March 2025, Keaton made a decision that surprised many: she listed her beloved Los Angeles home for sale, despite previously saying she planned to live there indefinitely. The move came during a period when her health had quietly begun to decline. Friends later shared that the decision reflected a sense of practicality and peace ‚Äî a final act of letting go from the actress who had spent her life creating beauty in everything she touched. The Brentwood estate, a five-bedroom, seven-bath residence, was listed for around $29 million. The home wasn't just another luxury property; it was the culmination of Keaton's lifelong passion for architecture, design, and restoration. Every wall, tile, and brick had her touch. Keaton purchased the home in 2017 and spent years transforming it into a warm, light-filled masterpiece. Inspired by her love of craftsmanship and her childhood fascination with brick homes, she designed it to feel timeless and grounded. Her approach to design was hands-on and visionary. The home became a symbol of her creativity, serving as both sanctuary and expression. It was her dream home in every sense, filled with character and the comfort of a life well-lived. As her health declined, Keaton began stepping back from public life. Listing her home seemed to mark a subtle farewell ‚Äî a sign she was preparing for change with her usual sense of dignity and calm. For a woman who built her legacy on authenticity, the sale wasn't about money or status. In her final months, Keaton showed the same grace she carried throughout her career ‚Äî whether starring in ‚ÄúAnnie Hall,‚Äù ‚ÄúFather of the Bride,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSomething's Gotta Give.‚Äù The decision to sell her dream home was more than a real estate move; it was a final act of reflection from a woman who always knew how to turn life into art.
