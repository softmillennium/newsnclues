                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The pop superstar's 12th album is already shattering multiple sales records. Good Morning America is teasing a big reveal involving Taylor Swift. ‚ÄúTOMORROW: We're keep it üíØ with an exclusive Taylor Swift announcement! The post includes a clip from Swift's ‚ÄúThe Fate of Ophelia‚Äù video, accompanied by a voiceover that says, ‚ÄúShe's at it again. And now tomorrow morning, GMA has a huge new exclusive announcement on Taylor. It was unclear at press time whether Swift herself will appear during Monday's episode of GMA. But the album already has more than 3.4 million in pure album sales (physical and digital purchases), marking the largest sales week for any album since Luminate began electronically tracking music data in 1991, when the modern era of weekly music tabulation began. The previous record for modern-era record for single-week sales of an album was held by Adele's 25, which moved 3.378 million copies in its opening week in November 2015. As for whether a The Life of a Showgirl tour is on the horizon, Swift recently shut down that speculation. ‚ÄúLike, when I think about doing it again ‚Ä¶,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúBecause I would want to do it really well again.‚Äù Swift's blockbuster Eras Tour ran from March 2023 through December 2024, spanning 149 shows across five continents. It ultimately became the highest-grossing tour of all time, earning over $2 billion and selling more than 10 million tickets, according to Billboard Boxscore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vance struggled to defend the Trump administration's decisions when journalists asked him basic questions during a round of TV appearances, with one host getting so frustrated with Vance's word salad, he cut the interview short in the middle of one of the vice president's sentences. Did he keep that money or give it back?‚Äù Stephanopoulos asked Vance. I asked you whether Tom Homan accepted $50k as was heard on an audio tape recorded by the FBI in September 2024. Thank you for your time.VANCE: No, George, I sai‚ÄìSTEPHANOPOULOS: We'll be right back I did nothing illegal,‚Äù he said during a Fox News interview, but he did not explicitly deny accepting the cash. The Trump DOJ also concluded no criminal wrongdoing took place, but when Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee grilled Attorney General Pam Bondi about what happened to the cash, she refused to answer. Is it illegal to take a payment for doing services? I have never seen any evidence that he's engaged in criminal wrongdoing.‚Äù Vance went on to call the line of questioning a ‚Äúleft-wing rabbit hole.‚Äù After that comment, Stephanopoulos quickly ended the interview. I asked you whether Tom Homan accepted $50,000, as was heard on an audiotape recorded by the FBI in September 2024, and you did not answer the question. ‚ÄúNo, George, I said that I don't ‚Äî‚Äù Vance started to say, but the show cut away to a commercial break. Earlier in the interview, Stephanopoulos asked Vance whether he agreed with President Donald Trump‚Äòs assertion that Illinois Gov. And when you have a group of people where the police call off the safety for ICE officials, I've understood that, and I've read it today in numerous journals, that that's illegal,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúPresident Trump has said that he should be in jail. Do you think Governor Pritzker has committed a crime?‚Äù Stephanopoulos asked Vance. Vance tried to dodge the question by saying that Pritzker ‚Äúhas certainly failed to keep the people of Illinois safe.‚Äù (Meanwhile, violent crime in Chicago in recent months hit its lowest point in four decades.) ‚ÄúI asked if you agree with President Trump that Governor Pritzker has committed a crime,‚Äù Stephanopoulos responded.

Do you think he has committed a crime?VANCE: I think Pritzker has certainly failed to keep the people of Illinois safeS: It's a yes or no questionV: I certainly think he has violated his fundamental oath. ‚ÄúGeorge, you're going to keep on asking this question. Whether he's violated a crime, ultimately, I would leave to the courts. But I certainly think that he has violated his fundamental oath of office. Over on NBC's Meet the Press, Vance faced questions about recent layoffs of more than 1,000 federal employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including those who are leading the nation's response to measles and workers who would respond to an Ebola outbreak. Why are these firings necessary?‚Äù host Kirsten Welker asked the vice president. WELKER: During the 2019 shutdown when Trump was president, no federal workers were laid off.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When news hit that Bad Bunny would headline the 2026 Super Bowl Halftime, his fans rejoiced. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.‚Äù Conservative commentators immediately attacked the decision of Roc Nation, the NFL, and Apple Music and launched into a full meltdown on social media. They latched onto the fact that Bad Bunny would not be singing in English and grumbled about his political and immigration stances. (He has been outspoken about Puerto Rican independence and has called out Trump's immigration policies, saying in a recent interview that he decided not to tour in the U.S. because of fears that ICE would harass his Latino fanbase.) Meanwhile, Bad Bunny has commented little, save for an SNL monologue poking fun at the situation. I want to say that this country is nothing without the immigrants. This country is nothing without Mexicans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Venezuelans, Cubans.‚Äù Speaking to i-D, Bad Bunny said he would be skipping the U.S. during his DeB√ç TiRAR M√°S FOToS tour over concerns that large gatherings of Latinos in the U.S. could be magnets for the Trump administration's anti-immigration efforts. ‚ÄúThere was the issue of ‚Äî like, fucking ICE could be outside [my concert]. That same night, he went on X and seemed to reference his past comments about touring in the U.S. ‚ÄúAfter speaking with my team, I think I'll do just one show in the United States,‚Äù he wrote in Spanish. A big source of their displeasure seemed to be that Bad Bunny has no songs in English, making this the first Super Bowl Halftime that'll be in Spanish. No songs in English,‚Äù MAGA YouTuber Benny Johnson wrote on X. Nobel Peace Prize Goes to Mar√≠a Corina Machado, Despite Trump's Campaign Trump Is Using the Shutdown to Supercharge His War on Equity Donald Trump Calls Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Halftime Booking ‚ÄòRidiculous': ‚ÄòI Never Heard of Him' ‚ÄúSo know that is a very real situation under this administration, which is completely contrary to how it used to be.‚Äù Bad Bunny hosted SNL on Oct. 4 and took the opportunity to poke fun at the political reaction he received over his Super Bowl announcement. He joked that ‚Äúeveryone is happy‚Äù about his future gig, ‚Äúeven Fox News.‚Äù After, the show spliced together several right-wing hosts on the right-wing network combining to say, ‚ÄúBad Bunny. ‚ÄúI'm very excited to be doing the Super Bowl, and I know that people all around the world who love my music are also happy,‚Äù he said before continuing in Spanish. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Especially all the Latinos and Latinas in the whole world, and here in the United States, all the people who have worked to open doors, more than I have achieved, who have achieved everything, demonstrating that our way, our carrying of this country, no one can ever remove nor erase.‚Äù A few days after Bad Bunny's SNL appearance, Trump went on Newsmax's Greg Kelly Reports, where he was asked about the Puerto Rican star's Super Bowl Halftime Show. Trump took a few shots and emphasized that he doesn't know Bad Bunny. I don't know who he is,‚Äù Trump said. Meanwhile, other conservative commentators seemed to be watching Bad Bunny's every move. When video surfaced of him sitting down during ‚ÄúGod Bless America‚Äù at a Yankees game, they spiraled again. MAGA figure Tomi Lahren posted on X: ‚ÄúBad Bunny appears to stay seated during ‚ÄòGod Bless America' at Yankee Stadium‚Ä¶ Yeah, because he has a clear disdain for America.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chappell Roan is facing criticism from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security following comments she made during a recent concert in Los Angeles. During the first of two performances at Brookside at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Friday (Oct. 11), the 27-year-old pop star paused her hit-filled set to reflect on her appreciation for her adopted hometown. ‚ÄúI'm not gonna be eloquent about this,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI loved L.A. more than ever than when I saw how the community came together in Altadena to help, same with the Palisades, I just realized that I'm so lucky to be able to live here and to play here, and the city has taken care of me, and it's my duty to take care of it back.‚Äù She then concluded her remarks with a pointed political statement. That's who we're getting off of our streets. Get a grip,‚Äù DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin told TMZ. Roan's comments come at a particularly tense moment for immigrant communities in the U.S., who have increasingly found themselves the target of aggressive ICE operations. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker recently described them as ‚Äúmilitary-style‚Äù raids. President Donald Trump has made mass deportations a central part of his second term.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ellen DeGeneres is remembering her longtime friend and favorite guest, Diane Keaton. The comedian and former talk show host shared an emotional Instagram tribute after news broke that the Oscar-winning actress had died at age 79 on October 11. ‚ÄúDiane Keaton was an icon, a hero of mine growing up,‚Äù DeGeneres wrote. Fans adored their chemistry, whether they were laughing about Keaton's love of wine or her offbeat stories from Hollywood. The pair developed a genuine friendship filled with laughter and respect. Viewers loved her carefree charm and ability to make DeGeneres laugh uncontrollably. Following Keaton's passing, clips of her interviews with DeGeneres resurfaced online, showing the actress dancing, joking, and making the audience roar with laughter. Fans filled social media with memories of her appearances, calling the duo's friendship ‚Äúpure joy‚Äù and ‚ÄúTV magic.‚Äù Many said watching Keaton's spontaneity on the show always ‚Äúmade their day.‚Äù As tributes continue to pour in from across Hollywood, DeGeneres's words capture the lasting impact Diane Keaton had not only as an actress but as a woman who radiated warmth, humor, and genuine authenticity. ‚ÄúDiane was truly one of a kind,‚Äù DeGeneres wrote. Her laughter, light, and fearless spirit continue to shine through the memories she created on screen, on stage, and in the hearts of everyone who loved her. Beloved actress Diane Keaton passed away on Saturday, October 11, at the age of 79. The Oscar winner, celebrated for her unforgettable performances in ‚ÄúAnnie Hall,‚Äù ‚ÄúSomething's Gotta Give,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Family Stone,‚Äù died unexpectedly, according to those close to her. ‚ÄúShe declined very suddenly, which was heartbreaking for everyone who loved her,‚Äù a friend told People. ‚ÄúIt was so unexpected, especially for someone with such strength and spirit.‚Äù ‚ÄúEven longtime friends weren't fully aware of what was happening,‚Äù the insider said. The five-bedroom, seven-bathroom property was an actual labor of love. Keaton, a lifelong architecture enthusiast, moved into the home in 2017 and spent eight years renovating it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mia Farrow is remembering Diane Keaton with love and admiration, as the two women are forever linked through their shared history with filmmaker Woody Allen. The ‚ÄúRosemary's Baby‚Äù star shared a touching message for her longtime friend on Instagram following the news of Keaton's death at 79. A spokesperson for Keaton confirmed that the beloved actress breathed her last in California on Saturday, October 11, and requested privacy on behalf of her family. Keaton and acclaimed filmmaker Woody Allen were romantically involved in the 1970s and shared a deep creative bond that shaped both of their careers. The duo collaborated on several beloved films, including ‚ÄúLove and Death,‚Äù ‚ÄúSleeper,‚Äù ‚ÄúManhattan,‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlay It Again, Sam.‚Äù In 1977, Keaton won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Allen's ‚ÄúAnnie Hall.‚Äù She later dated fellow Hollywood legends Al Pacino and Warren Beatty but never married, often saying that independence suited her best. After news of Keaton's passing, Allen was reportedly heartbroken. A source told People that the 89-year-old director was ‚Äúextremely distraught and surprised and upset,‚Äù adding that her death made him reflect on his own mortality. ‚ÄúThey had remained friends, and he was surprised by the news. Farrow, who also worked closely with Allen throughout the 1980s, expressed her admiration for Keaton once more in her post, highlighting the mutual respect that remained between them. Despite their different paths, Farrow and Keaton shared an unspoken connection that is reflected in her tribute. Keaton's death has sparked an outpouring of tributes from across Hollywood. Goldie Hawn, her ‚ÄúFirst Wives Club‚Äù co-star, shared an emotional message on Instagram, writing, ‚ÄúDiane, we aren't ready to lose you. She brought authenticity, humor, and heart to roles in ‚ÄúThe Godfather,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnnie Hall,‚Äù ‚ÄúSomething's Gotta Give,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Family Stone.‚Äù Her final film, ‚ÄúSummer Camp,‚Äù released in 2024, marked the close of a remarkable journey. ‚ÄúShe was one of a kind,‚Äù Farrow's tribute reminded the world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Martin speaks with a mix of humor, warmth and livewire energy. Their work has dealt with, and often found the funny within, life's awkward or existential moments. ‚ÄúWith stand-up, it was such a huge turning point in my career when I started talking about real stuff ‚Äî my life and addiction and pain,‚Äù they say. It's really gratifying and validating to say the things that you're embarrassed about and then have other people say, ‚ÄòYeah, me too. Deadline talks to Martin in Toronto where they grew up, and it's a full circle moment. Years before, they were filming outside the movie premieres at the Toronto International Film Festival with a camcorder, or they were getting autographs from stars such as Liev Schreiber. ‚ÄúIt's really about adolescence and I associate Toronto with my teens. The viewers' entry point is through Abbie (Sydney Topliffe), whose parents send her to the school, and Leila (Alyvia Alyn Lind), her best friend who attempts to rescue her; as well as via Alex (Martin), a newly arrived cop, and his heavily pregnant wife, Laura (Sarah Gadon). The Abbie-Leila relationship is modeled on that of Martin and their childhood best friend, who was taken to a school for troubled teens. Martin describes Wayward as ‚Äúat heart a love letter to teen friendship.‚Äù The school's origins are cultish, an area that fascinates Martin. It also delved into Mae's past and their own teen years. If Feel Good was comedy with a powerful dramatic arc, Wayward turns that formula on its head and is largely a drama with some lighter moments along the way. ‚ÄúI was keen to properly build tension,‚Äù Martin says about that radical gear-shift. Given Martin has had a successful career as a stand-up comic and comedy writer, was it hard to reel in the laughs for Wayward?‚ÄúI feel like my inner clown is very close to the surface,‚Äù they say. Am I funny really, or is that just a way of interfacing with the world?' When pressed on their dream role, Martin says they want to be the next James Bond. In Feel Good, Martin's character tells their agent: ‚ÄúI've always wanted to be John Wick.‚Äù In Wayward, a pumped-up Martin plays cop Alex Dempsey, who cracks some heads and is seriously deep in the action. ‚ÄúI have perpetual imposter syndrome about acting, but I really fell in love with it making this show and getting to work with Toni Collette, Sarah Gadon and the cast. I gave myself license to really go for it. Martin was urged to dye their hair darker so that Alex could be taken more seriously. Martin pinpoints a crucial scene just over halfway through the season. That representation would have meant a lot to me when I was young. It's such a different thing to see: An eight-months pregnant woman who's fully clothed and this trans guy.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat that means is that, if you're not preaching, or making it such a linchpin of the show, you can actually be more subversive. Narratively, there is so much going on in this scene.‚Äù In the wrong hands, Evelyn could have been a pantomime baddie, but Collette delivers something more complex. ‚ÄúWhere it could have been a sort of mustache-twirling villain, I think you feel that Evelyn really believes in what she's doing and just lacks self-awareness and is some kind of narcissist.‚Äù Feel Good and Wayward are both produced by Objective Fiction. ‚ÄúIn Feel Good there was an adult processing their teens and then with SAP I was similarly driven by nostalgia and trying to make sense of it all,‚Äù says Martin. ‚ÄúI'm trying to make sense of how visceral those years were for me; all of those firsts are so intense. With Wayward, Martin is hopeful that audiences will reflect on their own adolescence. ‚ÄúI'd like people to think about their own teens. We should absolutely be listening to young people more. For Martin, it was important that the young cast of Wayward such as Topliffe, Lind and others felt empowered amongst seasoned performers such as Collette, Gadon and Patrick J. Adams. ‚ÄúWe were already editing the show when I watched [Netflix's U.K. drama] Adolescence. There is an episode with around 200 kids in that school, but if you give them that responsibility, or trust people with their characters and their intuition, then they really step up. It was important to me, that [the young cast] felt like they had ownership over the emotional worlds of their characters.‚Äù Post-Wayward, Martin has a stand-up tour in the offing and projects with Feel Good co-creator Joe Hampson in the works. Martin is also eyeing roles in work created by other writers. ‚ÄúI've never been in a movie and I'd love to act in someone else's thing and to play someone really different.‚Äù I'd also love to play a villain or do a kids' movie.‚Äù That might be called keeping your options open, but considering Martin has written comedy and now drama, releases music, writes books, co-hosts a popular podcast and has also started selling their artwork, these ambitions don't feel lofty.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paramount+'s new Star Trek series, Starfleet Academy, has not been shy about leveraging its big-name talent, whether that means giving fans a good, hard look at ‚ÄúHolly Hunter, Space Principal,‚Äù or Paul Giamatti living out his dreams of being a cackling alien villain with tons of crap glued to his face. (To say nothing of franchise return guests like Tig Notaro, Mary Wiseman, and Robert Picardo.) (Not too long from when Starfleet Academy will be having its January 15, 2026 premiere.) But given that we've always thought of him as way more of a fantasy dork than a space nerd, it's still interesting to hear that he's going to be picking up work as the ‚Äúdigital dean‚Äù of the Academy, delivering announcements to the students. (Joking, in a video clip filmed from his Late Show desk, that it's all the fun of being on the show without having to spend four hours a day getting Giamatti'd up.) Long-time fans of Colbert's career will know that he used to hop in the voice booth pretty often, lending his sharp, Stentorian tones to cartoons like Harvey Birdman: Attorney At Law and The Venture Bros.. If you were on the fence about Starfleet Academy‚Äîwhich also got a non-Colbert trailer today, featuring what looks like a pretty enjoyably pulpy blend of teen angst, smooching, and grown-ups like Hunter and Giamatti hamming it up‚Äîthough, it's always possible that having Colbert delivering funny announcements in the background while all the drama's going on might be a deciding factor for you.
