Hollywood is mourning the loss of Diane Keaton. Following the news of her death, many of her former co-stars, industry figures and stars took to social media to share tributes. Robert De Niro shared a statement with The Hollywood Reporter, which reads: “I am very sad to hear of Diane's passing. Bette Midler, who starred alongside Keaton and Goldie Hawn in 1996's The First Wives Club, took to Instagram to write: “The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. Additionally, Hawn's daughter and actress Kate Hudson shared a clip of three women in the film with the caption, “We love you so much Diane.” “Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. “I saw her in the film Lovers and Other Strangers and knew I had to have her play Kay in The Godfather, (which she told me she based on my wife Ellie) and her wonderful work in Annie Hall while simultaneously setting a new fashion trend. Steve Martin, whom she starred alongside in 1991's Father of the Bride, shared a clip of a 2021 interview she did with Martin Short for Interview magazine, in which Short asks Keaton, “Who's sexier, me or Steve Martin?,” and Keaton replies, “I mean, you're both idiots.” Martin captioned the post: “Don't know who first posted this, but it sums up our delightful relationship with Diane.” Keaton's Book Club co-star Candice Bergen said in a statement to THR, “This is a huge loss both personally and for all of us. Diane was a true artist — tremendously gifted and uniquely talented in so many disciplines yet also modest and wonderfully eccentric. I will miss her terribly.” Mary Steenburgen also shared a statement with THR, which read, “Diane was magic. Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Keaton's nephew in Marvin's Room (where she earned one of her four Oscar noms), posted a tribute on his Instagram Stories. I had the honor of working with her at 18. Below, see all of the tributes (so far) that stars have made. I was so honored to call Diane Keaton a friend. She was an amazingly kind and creative person who also just happened to be a Hollywood legend. She has been taken from us far too soon. She directed two videos of mine – "Heaven Is A Place on Earth" and the video for "I Get Weak. Whether it's ANNIE HALL or SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE, we'll always remember when we fell in love with Diane Keaton. RIP to one of America's most graceful, elegant, and fiercely talented muses Diane Keaton who maintained a sense of self throughout her many roles that was a reminder to me as a young performer that the most interesting person you can mine are the many aspects of yourself.

Kennedy Jr.'s latest unscientific comments and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem‘s odd attempt to blame Democrats for the government shutdown. “Health secretary RFK Jr., seen here trying to cure cancer with his mind, said this week that men who were circumcised are more likely to be autistic,” co-anchor Colin Jost said of the proponent of vaccine misinformation, who has claimed that Tylenol is linked to autism. “—Which isn't surprising coming from a man who looks like he's made out of foreskin.” Jost then addressed how Noem is subjecting airline passengers in line at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints to a video of her insisting that the government shutdown, which is occurring under a GOP-controlled Senate, House and a Republican president, is actually all Democrats' fault. That department, Michael Che announced, “is planning to release a silver dollar with President Trump's face on it. And then on the other side, he has Harriet Tubman in a head lock.” But it's looking like that may not come about until at least 2030. Jost also called out Trump for proclaiming an end to Indigenous People's Day and labeling Christopher Columbus “original American hero.” Steve Martin, Jane Fonda, Bette Midler, More Stars Pay Tribute to Diane Keaton 'SNL' Cold Open: Tina Fey, Amy Poehler Team Up as Drama Queens Kristi Noem, Pam Bondi</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Oscar-winning star of ‘Annie Hall,' ‘Manhattan,' all three ‘Godfather' movies, ‘Reds' and ‘The First Wives Club' was a one-of-a-kind screen presence. What happened, you saw Annie Hall a hundred times? Hollywood Pays Tribute to Diane Keaton: "We Lost a True Original" What made the layered wardrobe trend resonate — and continue to be seen on stylish women today — was how effortlessly cool it looked on Keaton. And while the costumes mostly came from shopping expeditions to Ralph Lauren and other menswear emporiums, they were 100 percent reflective of Keaton's personal style off-camera. The misconception that comedy is easy — and that Keaton was essentially playing a version of herself — caused some quiet ripples of discontent when she beat out competition that included Anne Bancroft, Jane Fonda and Shirley MacLaine in dramatic roles to take home the best actress Oscar in 1977. But Keaton's justly honored performance in Annie Hall endures for reasons that go far beyond the synthesis of her on- and offscreen personas. She essentially reinvented the classic screwball heroine for a more socially evolved age. She emerged with a wave of actresses in the 1970s and early ‘80s that defied traditional standards of silver-screen glamour by being utterly natural, among them Karen Allen, Brooke Adams, JoBeth Williams, Jill Clayburgh and Margot Kidder. And yet Keaton was very much an original, never part of any pack. Irrespective of your views on the now-controversial figure of Woody Allen, the films he made with Keaton, both during and after their romantic involvement, remain among her most outstanding screen work — Annie Hall and Manhattan in particular. That's at least partly because while Keaton's characters might have been amused by the brainy verbosity and self-effacing neuroses of Allen's alter egos, she was never intimidated or outmatched by them. Keaton's innate radiance and verve made her born to play comedy, but she was no less gifted a dramatic actor. The women in Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather trilogy are generally submissive. In a fearless performance, she played Theresa Dunn, a dedicated schoolteacher whose repressive Catholic upbringing and history of childhood illness become fuel for her defiant sexuality. With a lesser interpreter, the movie might have been just a sensationalistic shocker, but Keaton brought integrity and emotional candor to Theresa's messy search to define herself. Keaton was tough, impassioned and ultimately heartbreaking as feminist journalist and Russian Revolution sympathizer Louise Bryant, starring opposite writer-director (and offscreen partner at the time) Warren Beatty as Bohemian communist activist John Reed in his 1981 historical epic, Reds. But her crowning dramatic achievement came arguably the following year in Alan Parker's raw, unflinching depiction of marital breakdown Shoot the Moon, starring opposite Albert Finney. In an ecstatic New Yorker review, Pauline Kael described their characters as torn from inside the writer, director and the two stars. “Diane Keaton acts on a different plane from her previous film roles,” wrote Kael. “She brings the character a full measure of dread and awareness, and does it in a special, intuitive way that's right for screen acting. But Keaton could shine even in humdrum material and there are gems among the many cute comedies she could do with her hands tied behind her back. One such keeper is The First Wives Club, an effervescent feminist revenge comedy in which Keaton, Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler play women pushed aside for younger models who turn the tables on their philandering husbands. Another is the role that landed Keaton her fourth Oscar nomination, in Nancy Meyers' advanced-age romantic comedy, Something's Gotta Give. She stars as a whip-smart playwright who's much more than a foil to Jack Nicholson's smug playboy, who prides himself on dating only women under 30. With her sheer, undiminished magnetism alone, Keaton remained a feisty rebuke to that kind of ageism in Hollywood. We are fortunate to have shared so much of her life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In March 2025, Keaton made a decision that surprised many: she listed her beloved Los Angeles home for sale, despite previously saying she planned to live there indefinitely. The move came during a period when her health had quietly begun to decline. Friends later shared that the decision reflected a sense of practicality and peace — a final act of letting go from the actress who had spent her life creating beauty in everything she touched. The Brentwood estate, a five-bedroom, seven-bath residence, was listed for around $29 million. The home wasn't just another luxury property; it was the culmination of Keaton's lifelong passion for architecture, design, and restoration. Every wall, tile, and brick had her touch. Keaton purchased the home in 2017 and spent years transforming it into a warm, light-filled masterpiece. Inspired by her love of craftsmanship and her childhood fascination with brick homes, she designed it to feel timeless and grounded. Her approach to design was hands-on and visionary. The home became a symbol of her creativity, serving as both sanctuary and expression. It was her dream home in every sense, filled with character and the comfort of a life well-lived. As her health declined, Keaton began stepping back from public life. Listing her home seemed to mark a subtle farewell — a sign she was preparing for change with her usual sense of dignity and calm. For a woman who built her legacy on authenticity, the sale wasn't about money or status. In her final months, Keaton showed the same grace she carried throughout her career — whether starring in “Annie Hall,” “Father of the Bride,” or “Something's Gotta Give.” The decision to sell her dream home was more than a real estate move; it was a final act of reflection from a woman who always knew how to turn life into art.
