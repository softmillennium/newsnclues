            • The 20 hostages held in Gaza thought to be alive are expected to be released early Monday morning local time before being transferred to the Red Cross, an Israeli government spokesperson said today. Nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel will also be freed.
    


            • US President Donald Trump will depart for the Middle East today ahead of a speech at Israel's parliament on Monday and meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as the families of the hostages. Leaders from more than 20 countries will then join Trump in Egypt for a summit on Gaza's future.
    


• Aid trucks are expected to enter southern Gaza today, according to Egyptian state-affiliated media. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have returned home to find only ruins as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas enters a third day.
    


            Palestinian Authority Vice President Hussein Al-Sheikh said on Sunday he met former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to discuss their future vision for Gaza.
    


                    “I met today with Mr. Tony Blair to discuss the day after and ways to support President (Donald) Trump's efforts aimed at ending the war and establishing lasting peace in the region,” Al-Sheikh posted on X.






            In the meeting, Al-Sheikh and Blair affirmed their “readiness” to work with Trump and other parties to “solidify the ceasefire, allow the entry of humanitarian aid, release hostages and prisoners, and move toward recovery and reconstruction,” the post said.
    


            Blair, who led his country into the war in Iraq, has recently returned to the limelight given his prospective involvement in an authority tasked with the reconstruction of Gaza.
    


            The Palestinian Prisoners Media Office said Sunday that “complex obstacles” are currently preventing the announcement of the full list of prisoners to be released under the ceasefire agreement.
    


                    “Complex obstacles still prevent the official announcement of the lists of released prisoners as part of the exchange deal, including prisoners from Gaza,” the office said. “We also affirm that efforts are being made around the clock to overcome these obstacles and complete the necessary procedures,” the office said.
                





            All details related to the deal “will be announced as soon as the negotiations are concluded and the final lists up to the last name are approved,” the office added.
    


Remember: Under the ceasefire agreement, Israel must free 250 Palestinian prisoners who hold life sentences, as well as 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza detained after October 7, 2023.
    


            As Israel prepares for the arrival of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, the country's hospitals are also making sure they are well-equipped to handle any medical needs that may arise once they arrive home.
    


            Dr Eli Sprecher, the CEO of Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital, showed CNN's Wolf Blitzer around his medical center today and said that his staff were “all very much looking forward to that truly historical moment.”
    


            Some 24 hostages who were previously freed from Gaza have been treated at the hospital, Sprecher said. Medical teams are preparing for the latest hostage release based off their past experience.
    


            The first issue that will need to be dealt with is likely going to be malnutrition, which “can affect almost any organ in the body, any tissue in the body, the heart, the brain, the kidneys, et cetera,” Sprecher said.
    


            The hostages could also face orthopedic problems from being kept underground in tunnels for so long, as well as psychological difficulties from two years of captivity, he added.
    


            Dr Inbal Reuveni, the vice chair of the hospital's psychiatry department, said that the center is making sure that the hostages returning are given a “safe space” to reunite with their families in.
    


            Sprecher said that the hospital is trying to recreate a “home-like atmosphere” for those admitted tomorrow. Hospital rooms will have two beds in them so the hostages can sleep with a family member nearby and a playground has been set up for the hostages who have children, he said.
    


            US Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza will be released soon.
    


            Earlier, a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office, said hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees set to be released Monday will be driven into Gaza once the hostages held in the enclave cross back into Israel,
    


            “The President of the United States is planning to travel to the Middle East to greet the hostages,” Vance told NBC's “Meet the Press.”
    


            Asked if he considered the ceasefire agreement and the release of the remaining hostages to be the end of the war in Gaza, Vance said the administration is still going to have a lot of work to do to ensure it “stays ended.”
    


                    “The reason why we're at this moment … is because the president of the United States. He gave unusual authorities to people who had never been in diplomacy before, he actually broke the mold,” Vance said. “Instead of doing diplomacy the same old way that it had failed for the past 30 or 40 years. He gave Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner a remarkable amount of authority to go and get a peace deal done.”
                





            Vance said the US is not planning to put troops on the ground in Israel or Gaza to ensure the deal is followed through.
    


            “He is not planning to put boots on the ground in Gaza or Israel,” Vance said. “We have central command troops that are already there that are going to monitor this peace proposal.”
    


CNN's Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report. 



            As we reported earlier, US President Donald Trump will address Israel's Knesset after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as the families of the Israeli hostages.
    


            Israel's Knesset committee chair has said today “we're all eagerly waiting” to thank Trump during tomorrow's visit “for everything he's done,” according to a spokesperson.
    


                    “We're all eagerly waiting to thank the president for everything he's done, doing and will do for us. He is the best friend of the state of Israel, always standing by our side, also in the difficult moments, and tomorrow we shall all thank him,” Ofir Katz said.
                





            On Sunday, the Knesset committee also approved a “special session” to honor Trump, which will take place tomorrow, the spokesperson said.
    


Remember: Trump will then travel to Egypt, where he is due to co-chair a summit on Gaza alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
    


            The bodies of at least 117 Palestinians have been recovered in Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the enclave, with another seven people dying in the same time period.
    


            This means that at least 67,806 people have been killed in Gaza during the last two years of war, with 170,066 reported injuries, according to the health ministry.
    


            The current ceasefire has allowed the recovery of people previously buried under the debris of destroyed buildings and infrastructure throughout the Gaza Strip.
    


            A spokesperson for Gaza's Civil Defense told CNN yesterday that approximately 10,000 Palestinians are believed to have been buried under rubble across Gaza since October 7, 2023.
    


            We heard earlier from a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office on how they expect Monday's final exchange of hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners and detainees to take place.
    


            Here's a round-up from Shosh Bedrosian's news conference:
    


            Ruby Chen can only hope for a miracle.
    


            His 19-year-old son Itay Chen, a soldier with the Israel Defense Forces, was initially believed to have been taken hostage during the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel, but was later declared dead by the IDF.
    


            Despite this, his father speaks of sustaining hope in the absence of “physical evidence” as he grapples with the reality of losing his middle son, who he described as the “connector of the family.”
    


            “It's like a suspended situation,” he told CNN's Becky Anderson earlier today, while speaking from Netanya, Israel.
    


                    “The knowledge of the IDF that indeed he was killed, we do not have that physical evidence. That's missing. That leaves some sort of doubt that hopefully, even tomorrow, there might be some sort of surprise for us. A miracle.”
                





            When asked about Monday's anticipated release of the 48 remaining hostages – 20 of whom are thought to still be alive – Chen reported “a mixed bag of emotions,” noting uncertainty for the relatives of the 28 who are thought to be deceased or whose status is unknown.
    


                    “On one hand, excitement for those that will be able to hug their loved ones. Anticipation that finally this chapter of the people of Israel that began two years ago will finally come to an end,” he said.
                





            On the other hand, he added, there's “the anxiety that some of the 28 families will not be reunited with their loved ones and will be still stuck in this chapter.”
    


            As thousands of displaced Palestinians make their way back north to Gaza City, many are returning to scenes beyond their imagination.
    


            Eighty-year-old Jawad Mahmoud Ajjour told CNN that he had witnessed mass Palestinian displacement and war in 1956 and 1967, but that he had “never seen that level of destruction” until today.
    


            Another Gaza City resident, Um Abdullah, showed CNN video of the destroyed nursery that her sister helped to build – and then ran for 20 years.
    


            “She taught generations, and those who were taught here sent their kinds too to be taught here in the same nursery. Some grew up to become journalists, doctors; she raised many generations,” Um Abdullah said of her sister.
    


            The United Nations said in August that more than 90% of Gaza's schools have been either destroyed or severely damaged, with 518 out of 564 school buildings needing either full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again.
    


            Younis Ahmed Mahmoud, a resident of Gaza City's Al-Shati Camp, said he did not recognize his neighborhood.
    


                    “I got lost in the street… I struggled to reach my house… it looked like an earthquake hit the area,” he said.
                





            Hundreds of thousands of people left Gaza City since the Israeli military began its ground offensive in August that flattened vast swaths of the city.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) earlier this month estimated that around 900,000 of the city's 1 million residents had left, figures that CNN is unable to verify.
    


            The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said last week that over 200,000 people had remained in Gaza City.
    


            Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian now turns to the subject of the hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees set to be released tomorrow under the Gaza ceasefire agreement.
    


            She says they will be driven out of Israel once the hostages held in the enclave cross back into the country.
    


                    “The Palestinian prisoners will be released once Israel has confirmation that all of our hostages set to be released tomorrow are (across) the border into Israel,” she adds.
                





            The prisoners will likely already be on the buses that will take them out of Israel on Monday, awaiting confirmation of the hostage release. The buses will set off once the transfer has been verified, Bedrosian said.
    


                    “Once the confirmation comes through (that) they (the hostages) have crossed into Israeli territory, those buses will start and they (the Palestinian prisoners) will begin their journey,” Bedrosian adds.
                





            More now from Israel's Prime Minister's spokesperson, Shosh Bedrosian, who has just said if Hamas is unable to find the bodies of some of the hostages held in Gaza, an international committee will help locate them.
    


            Three Israeli sources told CNN earlier this week that Israel assesses the militant group may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.
    


            “An international body, which was agreed on in this (ceasefire) plan, will help locate the hostages if they are not found and released tomorrow,” Bedrosian adds.
    


                    “The Prime Minister (Benjamin Netanyahu) insists that we will act to locate all of these hostages as soon as possible, and we will do that as a sacred duty of communal responsibility,” she added. “All 48 of our hostages will be returning back to Israel, whether they are alive or deceased,” the spokesperson said.
                





            No Hamas propaganda will be displayed during the release of the hostages being held in Gaza tomorrow, Shosh Bedrosian now says.
    


            In previous hostage releases, Hamas has staged macabre ceremonies before transferring the people they kidnapped over to the Red Cross - both living and deceased.
    


            This time round, the 20 living hostages held in Gaza will be “released together at one time to the Red Cross and transported among six to eight vehicles without any sick displays by Hamas, the terror organization,” Bedrosian adds.
    


            The hostages who have been held in Gaza will be released early on Monday morning, a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office has just said.
    


            The 20 living hostages will all be released at the same time, Shosh Bedrosian added, and will be transferred to the custody of the Red Cross before eventually being driven to Israel.
    


            Iran will not be sending a delegation to the upcoming summit in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh despite receiving an invitation, the state-affiliated Tasnim news agency reported, citing an unnamed source.
    


            US President Donald Trump is arriving in the city on Monday to chair the event in celebration of the signing of the first phase of an agreement to end the war in Gaza.
    


            A regional diplomat familiar with the matter also told CNN that Iran had received a formal invitation to attend the summit.
    


            At least 20 countries are expected to attend the ceremony, the Egyptian Presidency said without clarifying which nations have been invited.
    


            Among the confirmed attendees are France, Britain, Jordan and Germany.
    


            Israel is waiting to receive the 48 remaining hostages held in Gaza, who are expected to be freed Monday morning, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they are “prepared and ready” for their imminent arrival home.
    


            US President Donald Trump is expected to address Israel's parliament on Monday during his visit to the country.
    


Here's the latest: 



            We can bring you some footage now from Gaza City, obtained by the Reuters news agency. It shows markets bustling as crowds gathered today in the streets to browse stalls and buy essential goods.
    


            One Palestinian man, Wissam Joudeh, said the busy markets were a sign “life is returning” to the embattled enclave, after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire came into effect on Friday.
    


            Another Palestinian resident, Ahmed Hamadeh, said safety and security had returned due to the ceasefire. “Despite the destruction and everything we went through, thank God once the truce was announced, life returned to normalcy,” he said.
    


            The ceasefire in Gaza agreed upon by Israel and Hamas has “given a spark of hope in the Holy Land,” Pope Leo XIV said today, speaking after a mass in St Peter's Square.
    


            Since his papacy began in May, the American pontiff has been robust in his criticism of Israel's war in Gaza, consistently voicing his concern for Palestinian civilians that faced Israeli bombardment.
    


            Today, Leo said that he encourages those involved in the conflict to “courageously continue on the path towards a just and lasting peace that respects the legitimate aspirations of the Israeli and Palestinian people.”
    


                    “Two years of conflict have left death and rubble everywhere, especially in the hearts of those who have brutally lost their children, parents, friends, everything,” he said.
                





            The pontiff also called for those in the region to “rediscover that the other is not an enemy, but a brother to look at, forgive, (and) offer the hope of reconciliation.”
    


            Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza is being prepared to receive hundreds of prisoners and detainees that Israel is set to release early next week, the Palestinian health ministry says.
    


                    “We are preparing Nasser Hospital to receive 1,900 detainees that the occupation will release tomorrow, in addition to receiving a large number of bodies,” the ministry's Director-General Dr. Munir Al-Bursh wrote on X.
                





            Most of the detainees due to be released are suffering from diseases and will require urgent medical attention, he said.
    


            Earlier this week, the Israeli justice ministry published the names of 250 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails and set for release as part of a ceasefire agreement that will first see Hamas free the remaining hostages it holds.
    


            Israel is also due to release around 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza, detained after the October 7 attacks.
    


            Al-Bursh also called on the international community to “open the crossings and bring in medical supplies and equipment” in his statement.
    


            As part of the ceasefire deal, Israel has agreed to the daily entry of 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza, operated by the UN and other donors.
    


            Israel is “prepared and ready for the immediate reception of all our hostages,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has just said.
    


            Netanyahu spoke with Hostage and Missing Persons Coordinator Gal Hirsch today.
    


            A total of 48 hostages are expected to be released as part of this week's ceasefire agreement.
    


            Of those captured on October 7, 2023, 20 are presumed alive and 25 are believed to be dead, with the status of two others uncertain.
    


            There is one additional hostage whose body was held in Gaza before the October 7 attacks. He is an IDF soldier who was killed in 2014.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has released an itinerary ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the country tomorrow.
    


            Their timings show the US president will meet with Netanyahu in his office at the Knesset at 10.15 a.m. local time (3.15 a.m. ET).
    


            Later that hour, at 10.45 a.m. (3.45 a.m. ET), also at the Knesset, Trump is due to meet with families of the hostages.
    


            Trump is then set to deliver a speech to the Knesset during a plenary session, at 11 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET). Netanyahu, the Speaker of the Knesset, and Israel's opposition leader are also expected to give speeches during this session, the Israeli statement said.
    


            Trump will depart Israel at 1 p.m. local time (6 a.m. ET), Netanyahu's office said.
    


            This itinerary largely aligns with Trump's official schedule of the visit, which was released overnight.
    


            Trump will then travel to Egypt, where he is due to co-chair a summit on Gaza alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. According to the US President's schedule, he is set to land in Egypt at 1.45 p.m. local time (6.45 a.m. ET).

Russian independent media outlet Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC Russian service, has confirmed the identities of 135,100 Russian military personnel killed in Ukraine.

The publications' latest report covers the period of Feb. 24, 2022 to Oct. 9, 2025. Since it was last updated at the end of September, 2,485 additional Russian military personnel have been confirmed killed.

The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, memorial community tree-plantings, regional media reports, statements from local authorities, among other sources.

The reported death toll now includes 38,200 volunteers, 18,450 recruited prisoners, and 15,200 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. Over 5,800 officers have also been confirmed to have been killed.

In August, Mediazona, in collaboration with independent Russian outlet Meduza, released a report estimating that an estimated 220,000 Russians have been killed in the country's war against Ukraine — although that number has grown since.

The average age of the dead soldiers was 35.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the figures reported by the publications.

Moscow and Kyiv rarely officially report their losses. Ukraine estimates that Russia's overall casualties during the full-scale war have surpassed 1 million.

In a briefing to reporters on Aug. 12, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Russian losses are approximately three times greater than that of Ukraine, without specifying the total number of losses suffered.

Despite the heavy losses, Russia has been able to make advances in Donetsk Oblast in Ukraine's east as it is able to offset its casualties through fresh contract soldiers. In turn, Kyiv faces increasingly serious manpower shortages, particularly among infantry units holding the front line.

As of Oct. 11, Ukraine's General Staff estimates that Russia has lost 1,121,570 troops in Ukraine since the start of the war on Feb. 24, 2022. The numbers are largely in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies.

The outlet published the complete list of identified casualties for the first time in February, marking three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the publication, volunteers manually enter and verify each record to prevent duplicate entries in the database.

Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine's railway infrastructure as autumn sets in, resulting in increasing train delays and cancellations.

The two leaders discussed air defense support and long-range strikes, as Russia ramps up its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

"Not only is this an attempted theft of a peaceful Ukrainian nuclear facility. Unauthorized actions of Russia's (state nuclear energy corporation) Rosatom violate internationally recognized nuclear safety protocols, contradict Ukrainian license, and directly threaten a nuclear incident," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said.

A second vessel of the same class is expected to be delivered by the end of 2025, with crew training already underway, said Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa.  

Ukrainian forces downed 103 out of the 118 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. A missile and 15 drones struck 10 different locations, according to the statement.

Ukrainian troops have liberated the village of Mali Shcherbaky in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine's 24th Separate Assault Battalion "Aidar" announced on Oct. 12, releasing footage purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers in the settlement.

 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur breaks down renewed U.S. discussions about supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles — and Russia's reaction.



In a renewed effort to disrupt Ukraine's energy grid ahead of winter, Russia carried out several large-scale missile and drone strikes on energy and gas facilities this week.

Sources told the Financial Times that the U.S. is involved at every stage of operational planning, although Kyiv retains control over target selection, with Washington advising on target vulnerabilities.

The number includes 1,240 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

The Atesh partisan group sabotaged railway infrastructure in Russia's Rostov Oblast, disrupting Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on Oct. 12.

Russian independent media outlet Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC Russian service, has confirmed the identities of 135,100 Russian military personnel killed in Ukraine.

An estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Cuban fighters are actively participating in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported Oct. 5, citing an internal U.S. State Department cable obtained by the outlet.

Fox News correspondent Garrett Tenney has the latest on President Donald Trump's efforts to create a National Guard presence in Illinois on ‘America Reports.'

Tech billionaire Marc Benioff is shifting his tone toward President Donald Trump, saying he "fully" supports the president and is now urging him to deploy the National Guard to Benioff's home city of San Francisco.

"We don't have enough cops, so if [the National Guard] can be cops, I'm all for it," Benioff said in an interview with The New York Times.

"I fully support the president," he added. "I think he's doing a great job."

His comments come a week before his annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. He complained to the Times that he has to pay out of pocket for off-duty police officers to bolster security in the convention area every year.

"You'll see. When you walk through San Francisco next week, there will be cops on every corner," he promised. "That's how it used to be."

The friendly words for Trump are an about-face for the California billionaire, however, having spent recent years funneling tens of millions of dollars toward left-wing activist groups. Benioff's company, Salesforce, has also a championed transgender ideology.

Between 2022 and 2024 alone, Salesforce donated over $23 million to the left-wing Tides Foundation. Salesforce also created the "Pledge 1%" program, a model that encourages corporations to donate 1% of equity, product, profit, and employee time to charity.

Salesforce kicked the program over to Tides Foundation, which has been handling the Pledge 1% funds since at least 2019. Salesforce says at least 9,000 companies have joined the program since its inception.

Salesforce also donated $1.5 million to the liberal dark money group New Venture Fund. Reporting from the Washington Examiner says the organization has links to a Palestinian terrorist group.

Aside from funding, Benioff's company has used its own reach to push transgender activism, using its social media accounts to hail a transgender athlete and defend transgender people in the U.S. military.

Despite the left-wing resume, Benioff has been successful in getting closer to Trump's orbit since his election in 2024. Benioff sat across from Trump at the state dinner hosted by King Charles in the U.K. last month. According to the Times, he repeatedly told Trump "how grateful I am for everything he's doing."

The White House did not immediately respond when Fox News Digital reached out regarding any plans to deploy National Guard to San Francisco.

Trump himself floated the idea in August, however, telling reporters in the Oval Office that Democrats have "destroyed" the city.

"You look at what the Democrats have done to San Francisco — they've destroyed it. We can clean that up, too — we'll clean that one up, too."

MEXICO CITY (AP) — The woman long blamed for her role in the fall of the Aztec empire in 1521 is getting a modern makeover.

The Spanish called her Marina, pre-Hispanic peoples knew her as Malintzin and later she was renamed Malinche. Her work as translator and interpreter for Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés made her a protagonist in a violent colonial period whose effects still reverberate through Latin America. Her story, told only by others, generated myths and legends.

Was she a traitor to her people? The conquistador's lover? A slave using her language skills to survive? Or someone with agency who influenced Cortés and shaped major events?

Five centuries later, the debate continues and Mexico's first woman leader, President Claudia Sheinbaum, is weighing in.

Beginning Sunday, Mexico will kick off cultural events dedicated to reclaiming the story of Malinche on the anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the Americas. 

“We have a working group of anthropologists, historians, and philosophers studying this important, much-maligned figure, and it is very important to vindicate her,” Sheinbaum said recently.




Born around 1500, Malinche learned Nahuatl and the now near-disappeared Oluteco, growing up south of the Gulf of Mexico. The Aztecs sold her as a slave to a Mayan people who later gave her and other women to the Spanish after being defeated in battle. By then, she could speak two more Mayan languages.

The Spanish baptized the women, providing religious cover for them to be raped. 

Malinche was “at their mercy as a victim,” said Camilla Townsend, a historian at Rutgers University and an expert on Malinche. But she easily learned Spanish and “she saved her own life really by choosing to translate.”

Soon she would find herself in front of Moctezuma, the Aztec leader, in the imposing capital Tenochtitlan. As a translator for Cortés, she bridged two radically different worldviews, relaying the desires of Cortés and possibly trying to influence negotiations.

Some historical documents say she saved lives but she was also placed in complicated situations. 

“She was forced to be an intermediary between the Spaniards and these other poor women who were going to be raped,” Townsend said.

Most academics today don't see her as a traitor, because the Aztecs were her enemies in a world of constant wars between different peoples that only centuries later were lumped together as “Indigenous” in a violent colonial system.

Still, viewing her objectively is impossible, according to Federico Navarrete, historian at Mexico's National Autonomous University, because the race and class conflicts left by the conquest persist. Yet, schools only teach a “nationalist” perspective, downplaying nuances such as the support of some Indigenous groups for the Spanish.

Yásnaya Aguilar, a Mixe linguist who has written about Malinche, described her as “a native woman who moved from being a slave to being respected and honored by society in her time.” In fact, the name Malinche was also used to refer to Cortés: they were considered one, but she was the voice.

The Spanish also respected Malinche. Townsend believes that Cortés agreed to give her in marriage to one of his main commanders – the only way for her to avoid returning to slavery – so that she would agree to stay on with him for the conquest of modern day Honduras.

She died around the age of 30, apparently in an epidemic. She had a son with Cortés and a daughter with her husband.

Malinche was largely forgotten until the early 19th century, when Mexico won its independence from Spain and Spain's allies became enemies.

She first appears as “a lascivious and scheming traitor” in a popular, anonymously published novel in 1826, so she became the perfect villain for the new country, according to Townsend. It was the Mexican governments that followed that imposed Spanish on Indigenous peoples.

Malinche's negative image was solidified by Nobel Prize in Literature winner Octavio Paz. In his emblematic work of Mexican identity “The Labyrinth of Solitude,” Paz described her as “a figure representing the Indian women who were fascinated, violated or seduced by the Spaniards” and for whom “the Mexican people have not forgiven her betrayal.”

Her name became a symbol of sympathy for the foreign and contempt for one's own. It carried an idealized romantic relationship with Cortés that historians consider uncalled for and that Aguilar characterized as “patriarchal and chauvinistic.”

It's a caricature that has extended far beyond Mexico's modern borders. “They call me Malinche too from the left for allying myself with white men … with whom we work against extractivist policies,” said Toribia Lero, an Indigenous Bolivian activist of the Sura de los Andes people.

Mexico's Indigenous peoples, however, maintained respect for the woman, naming volcanoes, peaks and ceremonial dances after her. In some rural towns, girls are registered soon after birth to represent Malinche in traditional dances, Aguilar wrote.

Since the 1970s, Malinche's negative image began to be questioned among Chicana feminists in the U.S. because they knew it was very hard to be a bridge between two peoples and they empathized with her, Townsend said. 

Now there is a growing body of academic literature attempting to contextualize her life. And the Mexican government is joining the effort.

Adam Swart, CEO of Crowds on Demand, says the upcoming "No Kings" protest risks being exploited by agitators and interest groups "making money off chaos," while organizers defend their nonviolent record and security plans.

The head of a national crowd-for-hire firm is warning that America's protest culture has become a target for exploitation — by paid agitators, profit-driven interest groups and even foreign actors seeking to fuel division.

Adam Swart, CEO of Crowds on Demand, told Fox News Digital that his company has witnessed firsthand how demonstrations can be co-opted by people "making money off chaos" rather than advancing genuine civic causes.

"My concern is that there are forces — some domestic, some maybe foreign — that actually want to pull America apart," Swart said. "These aren't left or right actors. They're people making money off chaos."

His remarks come as organizers prepare for the "No Kings" protest, a nationwide demonstration planned for Oct. 18 that is expected to denounce political elitism and government overreach.

Swart said his company was approached about the event but declined to participate, calling it "a dud in the making" — another example, he said, of political theater that risks being exploited rather than achieving real persuasion.

"It's the same people saying the same things they've said every time — and getting the same results," he said.

Organizers behind the "No Kings" movement pushed back on Swart's characterization, saying the event is expected to draw turnout "comparable to or larger than" the first nationwide demonstration, which they claim attracted about 5 million participants.

A spokesperson told Fox News Digital the protest "has nothing to do with raising money or energizing voters," describing it instead as an effort to "demonstrate and build the resistance to the authoritarian."

The spokesperson said the movement is built around a commitment to nonviolence and employs extensive security and de-escalation training for volunteers.

"We're monitoring what's going on online in advance and being proactive against any identified threats," the spokesperson said, calling No Kings "mindful, thoughtful, organized and centered on nonviolence."

The spokesperson added that the first protest recorded "very few incidents" and described the movement as part of "a proud American tradition" of peaceful civic demonstrations.

While the movement has drawn support from some progressive groups, Swart said his concerns apply broadly — to any large-scale protest vulnerable to manipulation or infiltration.

Swart described what he calls a "protest industry" — an ecosystem of consultants, operatives and influencers who build brands and bankrolls from political outrage.

He said many movements, regardless of ideology, now operate less as grassroots expressions and more as "performative activism" built to attract funding, followers or online engagement.

"I've taken a pay cut to turn this into a company that advances common-sense causes," he said. "I could make 10 times more if I said yes to everything. But I don't want to be part of the noise."

Swart said Crowds on Demand now declines contracts that he views as divisive or volatile, choosing instead to support peaceful, purposeful demonstrations.

"I want to elevate productive expression — not mob theatrics," he said.

Swart cautioned that not all demonstrations are what they appear to be. In some cases, he said, interest groups or foreign entities can mirror legitimate advocacy networks — legally or otherwise — to obscure who is actually behind an event or campaign.

"I know how you'd structure a web of advocacy groups legally — and how someone could mirror that illegally," he said. "I want to help the government figure out who's funding the division and shut it down."

Swart said growing political polarization has created fertile ground for opportunists — both domestic and foreign — who thrive on outrage and confusion.

"Every time there's an incident, both sides start finger-pointing," he said. "The real winners are the ones trying to divide us. They want Democrats and Republicans blaming each other instead of asking who's profiting from it."

Swart said he's seen examples where the goal of protest activity was less about persuasion and more about generating viral conflict — an approach that, in his view, benefits those monetizing clicks, chaos and outrage.

His remarks echo recent U.S. intelligence warnings that foreign actors—particularly Russia, China and Iran—use disinformation to amplify divisive narratives in the U.S., and could try to spur unrest around major political events.

Swart also blamed major social-media platforms for monetizing outrage and accelerating polarization.

"They only make money when you're doom-scrolling," he said. "If people liked each other, Facebook and X would be a tenth of their size."

He said the problem cuts across ideological lines and is driven by the economics of engagement rather than politics.

"People try to label Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg politically, but both make money off division," Swart said. "It's not about right or left — it's about engagement."

Swart said the exploitation of division has become a national security concern, warning that agitators and influence networks may be working to destabilize the country for profit or geopolitical gain.

"This is one of the greatest national security threats that we face — America coming apart," he said. "The sources of it are not right or left. The sources are far more sinister than that."

Swart emphasized that his warnings aren't about any single protest or political movement but about a larger pattern — one where manipulation and misinformation can turn public expression into a tool for profit or chaos.

"The protest space has to be about purpose again," he said. "If we don't figure that out, we're going to keep getting played by the people who thrive on conflict."

Swart said he remains hopeful that awareness and transparency can help reduce the risks.

"Punch up, not down," he said. "Let's stop finger-pointing and start coalition-building."

            When Marcelo Lombardi, 45, complained he was feeling sleepy on a Friday, his family didn't think much of it.
    


            Lombardi often put in long hours running his family's 17-year-old real estate business in São Paulo, Brazil, working alongside two of his older sisters. A well-known attorney, he was a beloved figure in Sacomã, the southeastern neighborhood where he had lived for more than 35 years.
    


            Fernanda Lombardi, one of his sisters, recalled their life being “perfect” until that day, September 26. “Earlier in the week, he came home with some groceries, which included a bottle of vodka,” she told CNN. “It was his favorite liquor.”
    


            On Saturday, Marcelo woke up blind. “He told his wife he couldn't see anything but a big bright light,” Fernanda said. Upon arriving at the hospital, no one could tell the family what was wrong with Marcelo.
    


            “It took them about five hours to tell us that my brother had been poisoned,” Fernanda said. “By then, all of his organs were shutting down. He looked me in the eye and said, ‘I'm not leaving this place.'” Marcelo died the following day.
    


            The family later learned from health officials that the sips of the vodka cocktail he had casually enjoyed at home days before were laced with an invisible killer – industrial methanol. The colorless liquid is now responsible for an ongoing health crisis that has triggered a nationwide panic affecting about 100 million people across six states in Brazil, according to health authorities.
    


            Methanol is a clear, odorless, highly flammable liquid found in antifreeze, varnish and fuel. Ingesting just a few milliliters can cause blindness or death.
    


            Federal authorities are investigating several fronts to determine how industrial methanol entered Brazil's consumer alcohol supply. In Brazil, methanol commerce is regulated by the government, restricted to industrial uses such as biodiesel production, solvents, and laboratory applications. Its sale is legal but strictly controlled, and every transaction must be registered.
    


            One main line of investigation is that methanol, cheaper than ethanol, may have been intentionally used by counterfeiters to cut liquor production costs. Federal police are examining whether the chemical used by clandestine factories was purchased from gas stations and later diverted to illicit alcohol production. At least one gas station in São Paulo has been identified as a common supplier in several cases. Investigators are also probing whether smuggled or diverted industrial methanol entered Brazil's black market and if it has been used for bottle washing or sterilization by underground distilleries, contaminating drinks later sold illegally.

            As a precaution, health and trade associations are urging consumers and bars to destroy or properly dispose of empty bottles to prevent counterfeiters from reusing them in the production of fake liquor.
    


            Federal investigators have uncovered a massive black-market supply chain flooding bars, venues and homes with counterfeit liquor. So far, authorities have seized hundreds of thousands of fake labels, more than 100,000 of them just in the city of São Paulo, making it hard to estimate how far these poisonous bottles have been distributed.
    


            Joint operations by the Civil Police and the Health Surveillance Agency have led to the closure of four clandestine factories and the arrest of 41 people, according to a statement by the government of São Paulo.
    


            Lombardi was the third documented fatality since the crisis was announced by authorities in September, with the first cases dating to late August.
    


            As of October 8, Brazil's Health Ministry had logged 259 suspected cases nationwide, and five confirmed deaths – as well as confirmed poisonings in São Paulo, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul. All of the deaths have so far occurred in São Paulo, the epicenter of the crisis. Hospitals are also reporting rapid-onset blindness, irreversible comas and organ failure within hours of ingestion.
    


            Eduardo Capitani, toxicologist and pulmonologist at the Center for Intoxication Control at the University of Campinas, one of the country's leading poison-control and research centers, was one of the first to alert the government that a health emergency was underway. Between early and late September, his team saw 10 suspected cases across São Paulo and neighboring cities – enough to trigger a nationwide alert. That alert prompted a joint news conference by the Justice and Health ministries, announcing a coordinated investigation into the origin of the contaminated batches.
    


            “We've seen spikes before, in 2023 and 2024, among unhoused people who drank fuel-grade ethanol,” Capitani said. “This time, victims were drinking cocktails at bars and parties. These are not isolated cases.”
    


            Capitani said Brazil's public health system reacted quickly, but the crisis exposed deep structural weaknesses: Few hospitals have labs capable of testing for methanol or its toxic byproduct, formic acid, and fewer stocked the antidotes needed to treat patients fast.
    


            For Fernanda Lombardi, racing to find an antidote in pharmacies brought a feeling she will never forget. “It could've saved my brother's life, but it wasn't available anywhere. We felt powerless.”
    


            “Ethanol is nature's antidote to methanol,” Capitani explained. “In adulterated drinks, people may be consuming both the poison and its antidote – but in unpredictable proportions.”
    


            Symptoms often mimic a hangover: headache, nausea, dizziness. Within 24 hours, patients may lose their vision and struggle to breathe. If the person is untreated, the methanol metabolizes into formic acid, which attacks the optic nerve and nervous system, leading to blindness, organ failure or death within 48 hours.
    


            Treatment requires intravenous administration of ethanol or fomepizole, a specific antidote that blocks methanol's toxic conversion. Yet ethanol is scarce in most Brazilian hospitals, and fomepizole – approved in the United States and Europe since the 1990s – reached Brazil only this week through the emergency importation of 2,500 doses.
    


            Mariângela Batista Galvão Simão, Brazil's secretary of health and environmental surveillance, oversaw the arrival of the first batch of fomepizole at São Paulo's Guarulhos International Airport. “We're working to keep our antidote reserve full,” she told CNN on Thursday from the airport, “but it's hard to predict how much we'll need.”

            “There's no national antidote policy,” Capitani warned. “Many hospitals didn't have 100 percent ethanol in sufficient quantities. Until it arrives, sometimes hours later, that time can cost a patient their vision or life.”
    


            Brazil's Ministry of Health addressed the issue in a statement to CNN:
    


            “The ministry has been working since February this year on developing the National Antidote Policy, which will strengthen surveillance, access to medicines, and the training of healthcare professionals.”
    


            When pure ethanol isn't available, doctors may temporarily administer vodka, one of the purest forms of commercial ethanol. “But now,” Capitani cautioned, “that's become a Russian roulette, because even vodka could be contaminated.”
    


            Themis Mizerkowski Torres, a rheumatologist and toxicologist leading efforts at São Paulo's Center for Intoxication Control, says the crisis is unprecedented.
    


            “I have been with the center since 2004, and I have never seen anything like it,” she told CNN.
    


            “The guidance is to stay away from any alcoholic beverage for now.” And in the home country of the famous caipirinha drink, made from cachaça, lime and sugar, that is no easy feat.
    


            Torres explained that wine and beer are safer bets due to their fermentation process and how they are manufactured. But as Health Minister Alexandre Padilha stressed in a recent news conference, “there's no such thing as completely safe drinking right now.”
    


            In São Paulo, bars and restaurants in wealthy districts such as Itaim Bibi, Pinheiros and Berrini report steep drops in customers and cancellations of reservations. Some have stopped selling vodka, whiskey and cachaça entirely.
    


            From São Paulo to Pernambuco, fear now overshadows Brazil's vibrant bar culture – a sobering reminder of how one contaminated bottle can devastate families and test the country's ability to contain a crisis.
    


            Fernanda Lombardi says her brother's death destroyed their family and community.
    


            “He was healthy, hard-working, happy,” she said. “He didn't even go out – he drank a little vodka at home. That's what we can't understand.”
    


            The family turned the bottle over to police, but toxicology results have yet to be released.
    


            “My brother was murdered by greed,” she said. “Someone thought about money and not a human life. We want justice, so no other family has to go through this.”

It's not millennial cringe to wonder if you can enjoy the work of problematic artists.

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. It's based on value pluralism — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

My partner and I are having a disagreement about JK Rowling that we want you to weigh in on. For reference, we're a same-sex couple, and despite our different upbringing, we tend to have similar moral compasses and political feelings. 

I love the Harry Potter world — books, movies, broadway plays, video games, etc. He never did. We both agree that JK Rowling's transphobia is problematic and not something we tolerate. However, I still want to engage in the Harry Potter world, which I feel sends a positive message overall. 

To assuage my guilt, whenever I buy something Harry Potter-related that might make JK Rowling any money, I then donate a larger sum of money to the Human Rights Campaign. This is only in addition to what we typically give to the HRC. Is this acceptable? Is this hypocrisy? Am I an ethical Slytherin? Settle this for us.

Dear Guilty Gryffindor,

Ah, the classic “can we separate the art from the artist” question! I've encountered this dilemma before, and I'll tell you straight off the bat that I'm not the type to condemn you as a Slytherin just because you still want to engage with the works of JK Rowling.

I'm totally fine with reading books penned by problematic writers — even if their views have seeped into the books themselves — because I believe I'm capable of separating the wheat from the chaff in these works. And I think it insults readers' intelligence to assume that they're not capable of that.

In fact, so many of us have practically had to become experts at this sort of literary winnowing, because 99 percent of the books humanity has thrown at us contain that chaff. I'm a queer Jewish woman, and if I had to excise from my library every book whose writer was anti-LGBTQ, antisemitic, or misogynist, my shelves would be pretty much empty!

In the case of JK Rowling, both the writer and the books themselves present us with problems. We all know at this point how anti-trans the writer is and how much pain she's caused her fans. And she's not an author who lived centuries ago; she's active right now, and she still profits from Potter-related purchases (more on that soon). Plus, the books themselves have flaws, too. Remember when the Dursleys are mocked by the text for being overweight? Or when the goblins are portrayed as an antisemitic stereotype? Or when the werewolves are presented as a metaphor for HIV? Or when we're told that the house elves actually like being enslaved because their race makes them naturally subservient?

Still, you say that you feel the Harry Potter world sends a positive message overall, and you know what? I agree with you. The main moral message of the books is this: We shouldn't live in a supremacist society. We shouldn't be like Voldemort or like the Death Eaters, who believe “pure-blood” wizards and witches are inherently better than everyone else. We shouldn't discriminate against people who are Muggle-born (like Hermione) or who are poor (like Ron). We should recognize that everyone (even Snape, the Slythiest of Slytherins!) has the agency to choose who they want to become and ultimately do good.

This is the core message that made so many of us fall in love with the Harry Potter world as kids. It made us feel that it's okay to be different — that difference should be respected and even celebrated. Even though Rowling often undercut that open-hearted message with nonsense like “rightfully” enslaved house elves, most of us picked up the main moral message in spite of these flaws. And in that way, the books successfully achieved what good fiction is meant to achieve.

“In the war against moral obtuseness, the artist is our fellow fighter, frequently our guide,” writes the contemporary philosopher Martha Nussbaum. By exposing us to scene after scene of characters encountering moral conundrums, Nussbaum argues, good fiction trains our capacity for moral attention — the capacity to notice the morally salient features of a given situation so that we can respond appropriately.

The Harry Potter books successfully trained a generation of young readers to be exquisitely sensitive to discrimination and to reject it. And it's on precisely that basis that many of those young readers, now all grown up, reject Rowling's anti-trans views.

These readers can choose to reject her books, too. Some do, and that's totally alright. But some don't — and I think that's totally alright too.

In a 2020 episode of the popular podcast Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, co-hosts Casper ter Kuile and Vanessa Zoltan interviewed trans author Jackson Bird. They drew an analogy between reading Harry Potter and reading the Bible: Just as the Bible contains anti-gay statements that can make it painful reading for queer readers, and yet some of those readers still lovingly engage with the text, the same can be true for the Harry Potter books. As Bird said of such texts, “We continue to interrogate, but we still acknowledge and accept the ways in which they are useful for us, or healing.”

The “continue to interrogate” part is key here. Any fandom — whether it's centered on the Christian canon or the Harry Potter canon — is responsible for continuously revising how its canonical texts do and don't get to guide action. If you're going to continue to engage with the Bible, then you have to keep grappling with all the ways it's enabled harm, and you have to try to heal that harm. And if you're going to continue to engage with the Harry Potter world, then you have to continue to wrestle with its wrongs, too.

The good news is: That's doable! Religious communities have been proving that for ages. As early as 2000 years ago, Jewish theologians were inventing a genre called Midrash, which is basically ancient fanfiction; it reimagines problematic bits of the Bible in ways that make them more palatable or meaningful. And over the centuries, many Muslim and Christian theologians have been busy transforming their traditions, giving us everything from Islamic Modernism to Black liberation theology.

So, for you, what can interrogating the Potter canon look like in practice? I'd suggest connecting with other Potterheads so you can both enjoy and interrogate the content together. Whether that's a book club, a movie-watching marathon, a video game night with friends, or a Harry Potter and the Sacred Text episode that you listen to with your partner in the car, the point is to engage with the content and then critically discuss it.

The benefit of doing this in community is that it can actually generate social good. If you end up discussing the house elves, say, you might end up talking about how even the good guys in Rowling's books are way too content with maintaining the status quo rather than calling for systemic change (Dumbledore treats his enslaved house elves nicely, but he still enslaves house elves!). That could lead you into all sorts of discussions about how you are or aren't challenging the status quo in our Muggle world.

If you engage with Rowling's work this way, I think it's plausible that the positive social value you'll be generating will outweigh any negative social value you might create by continuing to be a Potterhead. And, crucially, I suspect you'll stop feeling guilty.

Right now, your strategy to ward off guilt is to focus on the financial aspect of all this — how your Potter-related purchases end up materially benefiting Rowling and, through her, the type of organizations she might support. On a dollar-for-dollar level, this is something you can “offset” by donating to the Human Rights Campaign. In fact, since Rowling is already a billionaire, buying a video game now is not appreciably moving the needle for her, while donating hundreds or thousands of dollars to the HRC could plausibly make a difference to that nonprofit. So this strategy is nothing to sneeze at.

But it's not enough. And we can tell it's not enough because you still feel guilty. You probably have some intuitive sense that you can't just buy moral absolution (Accio clear conscience!). On its own, offsetting feels cheap, and the reason it feels cheap is that it's not demanding that any transformative work take place — either for you personally or for society more broadly.

To reiterate a common critique of philanthropy: Just writing a check does not represent a commitment to a broader project of solidarity or justice. It's letting you throw a pittance at the problem without requiring you to participate, through your own hard work, in changing the status quo and creating systemic change.

Remember, shying away from systemic change is how Rowling deals with problems in her books. You can do better.

President Donald Trump's family is cashing in on the presidential spotlight with less pushback than in the past.

During Trump's first administration, first daughter Ivanka, for example, was criticized for her brand endorsements, including a social media post about Goya beans. Ethics experts at the time complained that she, as a presidential adviser and federal employee, broke federal law.

Five years later, with no members of the first family part of the president's second administration, first granddaughter Kai Trump last month launched her own clothing line using photographs taken at the White House and first son Eric Trump this month is embarking on a book tour for his new memoir, “Under Siege: My Family's Fight to Save Our Nation,” with fewer or at least less vocal critics. 

FULL LIST OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT

Earlier this year, eldest first son Donald Trump Jr., also opened a private social club called the Executive Branch with membership fees reportedly $500,000, Eric's former Republican National Committee co-chair wife Lara, debuted a new television show on Fox News, and first lady Melania Trump created a memecoin. The first lady's documentary, Melania, for which Amazon MGM Studios paid $40 million, is being released on Jan. 30, too.

For Public Citizen government affairs lobbyist Craig Holman, the Trump family “cashing in” on the presidency “is a family affair on a scale never before seen in American political history,” as other experts underscore that it is not illegal.

“There have been occasional embarrassments to former presidents by a relative seeking financial gain from a family member serving as president, such as Hunter Biden receiving consulting fees from foreign governments and Billy Carter lending his family's reputation to sell a beer,” Holman told the Washington Examiner. “But nothing on the scale of the profiteering engineered by multiple family members of Donald Trump.”

Sometimes the profiteering benefits both Trump and the family member, including Eric Trump's book, which is out next Tuesday, according to Holman. Instead of following older sister Ivanka to the White House in 2017, Eric and Don Jr. have remained executives at the Trump Organization. Eric's portfolio incorporates Trump Hotels, Trump Golf, Trump Estates, and Trump Winery, in addition to the company's investments in cryptocurrency.

“The book features a foreword supposedly written by Donald Trump, and goes on to depict President Trump and various members of the Trump family in heroic perspectives,” Holman said. “The book has already become a bestseller on Amazon and will deliver Eric a very handsome profit.”

Sometimes the profiteering rewards the family member responsible for the sales, including Kai Trump's clothing line, Colman added. The 18-year-old golfer's profile has increased exponentially since her primetime appearance during last year's Republican National Convention.

“For monogrammed sweatshirts priced at $130 each, Kai's financial gain will also prove to be lucrative,” he said. “Early orders of the sweatshirt have already sold out because of high demand.”

Eric Trump spokeswoman Kimberly Benza dismissed ethics concerns regarding her boss, particularly with respect to his upcoming book.

“Unlike Hunter Biden, who cashed in on his father's position, selling influence and finger paintings, Eric Trump is a businessman, who has been in the private industry for 25 years, employing tens of thousands of people and has spent the last decade enduring relentless attacks from the radical left — attacks aimed at destroying his family, their business, and his father's legacy,” Benza told the Washington Examiner. There truly is no comparison.”

To that end, Hunter Biden wrote his own memoir in 2021 called Beautiful Things. His father, then-President Joe Biden, praised him for his “strength and courage to talk openly about his addiction so that others might see themselves in his journey and find hope.”

Another example from Hunter Biden, other than his amateur artwork being valued at $500,000, includes a report this week that he pursued a real estate deal in 2017 with a Chinese company for land around the U.S. Embassy in Romania predicated on relationships formed when his father was vice president.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN THE US: A TIMELINE OF KEY INCIDENTS 

The younger Biden, himself, has conceded he would not have had a $50,000-a-month seat on the board of Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings, which was central to Trump's first impeachment, if the elder Biden had not been vice president and leading Obama administration foreign policy in the region.

“I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden,” Hunter said in 2019. “There's literally nothing, as a young man or as a full grown adult that — my father in some way hasn't had influence over. It does not serve either one of us.”

A spokesperson for Kai Trump did not respond to the Washington Examiner's repeated requests for comment.

The New Yorker has estimated that the Trump family made $3.4 billion from the presidency between 2017 and August, including the $1 million membership fee for the president's Mar-a-Lago private resort in West Palm Beach, Florida, though about two-thirds of that amount is thought to be from cryptocurrency. 

Don Jr. and Eric Trump were criticized to an extent before the president's trip to the Middle East in May after they preceded his travel with their own to the region to promote the family's business interests, encompassing a $1 billion luxury hotel in the United Arab Emirates, a villa complex in Qatar, even a $2 billion investment from an Abu Dhabi firm into crypto exchange Binance that was facilitated by the Trump Organization's World Liberty Financial.

Claremont McKenna College politics professor John Pitney agreed with Public Citizen's Colman that “there is no real precedent for the scale and brazenness of the Trumps' profiteering,” citing Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, who Pitney told the Washington Examiner has “made a fortune from the Saudis.”

Kushner has been in the Middle East this week, despite not formally being part of the administration, to help negotiate the peace deal between Israel and Hamas, as well as to have meetings with the likes of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, alongside U.S. Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff, after multiple sit-downs with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Kushner last month struck a different deal with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and other stakeholders to take video-game maker Electronic Arts private through a $55 billion deal that is the largest leveraged buyout in history so far.

The Washington Examiner asked Trump this week about Kushner's role in the Israel-Hamas peace process. The president said, “Jared is a very smart guy,” especially after his experience during the first administration with the Abraham Accords. The Abraham Accords normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries.

“He's a very smart person, and he knows the region, knows the people, knows a lot of the players,” Trump continued. “We had a very smart group of people working this. We had a lot of different players, different countries, and very diverse countries, very different from each other.”

Earlier this month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned a reporter for asking how the administration decided it was “appropriate” for Kushner to become an emissary to “Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia — three countries that combined have given him more than $2.5 billion for his investment firm,” Affinity Partners.

“I think it's frankly despicable that you're trying to suggest that it's inappropriate for Jared Kushner, who is widely respected around the world and has great trust and relationships with these critical partners in these countries, to strike a 20-point comprehensive, detailed peace plan that no other administration would ever be able to achieve,” Leavitt said. “Jared is donating his energy and his time to our government, to the president of the United States, to secure world peace, and that is a very noble thing.”

For Pitney, the Claremont McKenna College professor, “the most unusual part” is Trump's participation, with the president's own memecoin providing foreign and domestic “influence-seekers” with an opportunity “to put vast sums into [his] own pocket.” 

Other examples include Trump's announcement last month that he would hold next year's Group of 20 leaders summit at his golf course in Miami, Florida, after the same proposal was postponed during his first administration because of ethics concerns and the COVID-19 pandemic – not to mention his own merchandise, from gold sneakers to bibles.

TRUMP BETS ON KUSHNER AND WITKOFF TO SEE THROUGH ISRAEL AND HAMAS PEACE DEAL

Regardless, Northeastern University politics professor Costas Panagopoulos reiterated that “while some may find capitalizing on these opportunities distasteful, it does not mean it is necessarily illegal or even unethical.”

“Of course, in some cases, some politicians or their associates cross the line and engage in corrupt practices, but that is not always the case,” Panagopoulos told the Washington Examiner.

When my partner and I began planning a couple's trip to Tunisia, we decided to do something different. Instead of turning to travel sites, we let AI take the lead.

Recently, I've outsourced a lot of my life to ChatGPT — from work projects to personal errands. So, I thought, why not travel planning, too?

ChatGPT has always been my top choice, but my partner wanted to see what Claude—the one she likes the most—would plan for our Italian holiday.

We wanted to see which AI bot planned the best trip. But through this friendly competition, we learned just how differently my partner and I like to travel.

We didn't want chaos, so we set limits. We picked our timeline and the cities in advance: Tunis, Tozeur, and Hammamet.

Then we handed the itinerary-building over to the bots, with each AI designing one full day in each city.

Of course, there were overlaps, but they each produced different trips.

ChatGPT, for example, came back with what felt like a movie script. Tunis started with a sunrise walk through Sidi Bou Saïd, pastries and mint tea in hand, followed by a whirlwind through the Medina and a dramatic half-day at the ruins of Carthage. Then, in Tozeur, it pulled the cinematic card with "Star Wars" filming sets in the desert, and camel rides across dunes at sunset. Hammamet, meanwhile, was framed as a finale of seaside lounging, alternating between couscous feasts and beach walks. It was ambitious, colorful, and a little chaotic — but also thrilling.

Claude's version was slower and more contained. In Tunis, it recommended a guided food tour, before sending us to Carthage for a more paced, historical visit. In Tozeur, it skipped the desert dash altogether, focusing instead on the Medina and a relaxed afternoon by an oasis. It also added two important cultural pit stops we hadn't considered. Hammamet was stripped back to a cultural visit to the Kasbah and an early dinner overlooking the water. Less cinematic, more logical.

Of course, we then needed to build our own itinerary, taking activities recommended by both lists.

ChatGPT's ambitious Tozeur day nearly flattened us. The long drive was far from the breezy jaunt it implied, and when we finally got close, a sandstorm had blocked the highway. "The Star Wars" sets were out of reach, proof that no itinerary can control nature.

Still, other parts of ChatGPT's plan delivered — like Sidi Bou Saïd, where whitewashed walls and cobalt-blue shutters glowed in the sun as we sipped mint tea above the sea. It felt like stepping into a painting.

Claude's food tour in Tunis was a big highlight. We enjoyed sesame-coated pastries as we drifted through narrow streets, pointing toward stalls and corners we would never have found on our own.

Claude also surprised us with two inspired detours: the Great Mosque of Kairouan and El Jem amphitheater. Both were extraordinary stops, layered with history and stillness.

As the trip unfolded, it became clear we were not just comparing AI bots. We were surprised to see our own travel personalities reflected back at us.

ChatGPT's energy mirrored mine: scattershot but adventurous, willing to gamble on exhaustion for the sake of a memory. Claude's calm matched my partner: thoughtful, practical, deliberate.

If we are scoring, ChatGPT delivered the better memories. Claude delivered comfort and culture. But neither really won.

What they gave us was a way of traveling that reflected us back at ourselves — two personalities and two rhythms woven into one trip.

Tunisia was beautiful, bewildering, and slightly AI-engineered. It proved that the best journey is never about choosing one itinerary over the other but about learning how we move through the world together, even when the paths are different.

Investors are looking beyond the prolonged U.S. government shutdown and remain optimistic about growth drivers like the artificial intelligence boom and expectations of further interest rate cuts.

Ignoring the short-term noise, those looking for attractive investment opportunities can consider the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts, whose recommendations are based on a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals and growth catalysts.

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

First on this week's list is Snowflake (SNOW), a cloud-native data platform. At the recently held Snowflake World Tour event in New York City, the company highlighted its product innovation and the vision for driving business transformation through data and artificial intelligence.

After attending this customer conference, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated a buy rating on SNOW stock with a price forecast of $270. Based on his conversations with customers and partners at the event, the analyst noted that Snowflake's product innovation and velocity are accelerating.

Thill highlighted that while traction for Snowflake's AI offerings is building, the inflection point is still ahead. For instance, the top-rated analyst noted that a retailer using Snowpark ML for demand forecasting, and a travel company integrating Snowflake ML models into its customer experience pipeline, both believe that broader usage across their organizations will take a few more quarters.

Another key takeaway was that Snowflake's unstructured data capabilities have strengthened, but there are still some gaps to address. Overall, Thill believes that while traction is building for Snowflake, the "AI Blizzard" still lies ahead.

"SNOW remains one of our favorite data & AI stories and stands to benefit meaningfully as enterprise AI strategies mature and AI driven data volumes grow exponentially in the coming years," concluded Thill. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a "neutral" rating on Snowflake stock with a price target of $255.

Thill ranks No. 251 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.1%. See Snowflake Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Moving on to chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which recently made headlines after announcing a game-changing partnership with OpenAI. Under this deal, OpenAI will deploy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs over multiple years, starting with a 1-gigawatt rollout in the second half of 2026. The agreement also involves a warrant for up to 160 million shares (vesting tied to certain milestones), which, if fully exercised by OpenAI, will give it about a 10% stake in AMD.

Following the news, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis upgraded AMD stock to buy from hold and boosted the price target to $300 from $170. Additionally, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on AMD stock with a price target of $232.

Curtis believes that AMD's deal with OpenAI clearly changed the AI narrative for the semiconductor company. While the chipmaker will still have to achieve some milestones, the 5-star analyst believes that this partnership is a solid confirmation of AMD's AI roadmap and a proof of robust AI demand in general.

Interestingly, Curtis recently raised his estimates for AMD following positive server checks. The analyst stated he was incrementally positive on AMD after his recent Asia trip, with the expectation of 500 basis points per year share gains in server CPUs with the company's Venice platform.

However, these recent checks hadn't helped Curtis grasp anything from the original device manufacturers (ODMs) in terms of AI ramps. "The announcement of OpenAI as a lead customer with the potential for $80-100B in revenue across 6GW of compute through 2030 materially changes that outlook," said Curtis.

Curtis ranks No. 68 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.5%. See AMD ETF Exposure on TipRanks.

IT infrastructure and personal computing solutions provider Dell Technologies (DELL) announced an increase in its long-term financial targets during its analyst meeting on Oct. 7. The improved outlook is backed by demand from the ongoing AI wave.

Following the event, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a buy rating on DELL stock and raised his price target to $170 from $160. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a "neutral" rating on DELL stock with a price target of $135.

Rakesh noted management's commentary about momentum in enterprise and sovereign AI, with strong demand signals over 12-18 months. The top-rated analyst highlighted that the company raised its compound annual growth rate target for revenue for fiscal 2026 to 2030 to the range of 7% to 9%, with non-GAAP EPS expected to rise by 15% or more.

Furthermore, Rakesh noted that Dell's fiscal 2026 AI server revenue estimate of $20 billion is in line with the Street's consensus of $20.6 billion and reflects over 100% growth from $9.8 billion in the previous year. The company expects a 20% to 25% CAGR through Fiscal 2030, implying AI server revenue of $46 billion.

However, the analyst believes that this growth outlook could be conservative, as the company is involved in all at-scale AI cluster deployments and leads in T2 CSP (tier 2 cloud service providers) and enterprise AI deployments with more than 3,000 customers.

Rakesh ranks No. 81 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 24.3%. See Dell Technologies Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks.

Department stores may be falling out of favor with today's younger consumers, but there's a reason older shoppers keep coming back.

Whether it's more generous return policies, promotional events or deep discounts, "if you can learn the benefits of what a store brings you, it creates a much greater experience," said Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor for market research firm Circana.

For example, if a sales associate doesn't have an item you want in stock, often they'll get it and ship it to you at no cost, Cohen said — "that's a big perk."

And yet, for younger shoppers, the mentality is "I don't want to shop where my mother shops," he said.

To be sure, at Macy's and its subsidiary Bloomingdale's, for example, the majority of customers are above the age of 45, according to new Consumer Edge data.

Baby boomers are also much more likely to say in-store shopping is their most common way of making purchases, compared with Generation Z, or those born between 1997 and 2012, according to a Capital One report from March.

"The younger generation grew up online," Cohen said. "The challenge for department stores is to break that paradigm."

Social media plays a big role in how younger consumers make purchases, added Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at TD Cowen. It's a trend he refers to as "the tiktokification of retail."

But while shopping primarily online may seem quick and convenient, it does come with extra hassles.

It can mean relying on a practice known as "bracketing," or ordering multiple products in different sizes or colors with the intention of keeping a few and returning the rest — adding more time and cost to each transaction.

As online retailers try to keep those returns in check, most have rolled out stricter policies, including charging a return or restocking fee, according to a 2023 report from return management company Happy Returns.

But even now, some department stores have held on to the more generous policies of yesteryear, with longer return windows or free shipping, and that has gone a long way when it comes to building brand loyalty.

"There are some savings opportunities that you have when you shop in person that you probably wouldn't have online," said Edgar Dworsky, founder of ConsumerWorld.org.

Although Bloomingdale's shortened its return window to 30 days from 90 days last year, shoppers appreciate the other perks, according to Nancy Quinn, a personal stylist at the flagship store in New York City.

"The biggest thing that Bloomingdale's offers is customer service, that is really where we shine," Quinn said.

Quinn meets her clients, who are mostly women between the ages of 45 and 70, by appointment to help them find clothing for everyday or special occasions. She said she will often waive the shipping fee or send the purchases via messenger at no charge to locations in Manhattan. At times, she has even hand-delivered an item — also as a complimentary service — if the customer is local and under a time constraint.

"Those are things that we try to do to make sure people know how much we appreciate the business," Quinn said. At many high-end department stores, personal stylists work on commission and the assistance they provide is free for customers.

Quinn's appointments book up especially quickly when Bloomingdale's runs promotional events, such as "friends and family," which is typically a 25% discount across many brands.

Still, Quinn says younger customers are less likely to shop with her.

"It's a generational thing," Quinn said. "A lot of younger people are shopping online." Alternatively, "the women I am meeting are really ready to make an investment in themselves and their wardrobe."

To be sure, U.S. department stores have been in a slump for years. Retailers like JCPenney and Macy's have struggled to compete against online retailers and smaller brick-and-mortar stores that can better adapt to changing consumer preferences.

"Small new brands that are emerging have just as much marketing power because the internet levels the playing field," said Circana's Cohen.

However, department stores aren't dead yet.

Last year, Macy's said it would close some of its namesake stores and open more Bloomingdale's locations. According to the company's quarterly report, Bloomingdale's performed better because of its focus on the luxury brands that appeal to higher-income shoppers.  

"Selective higher-end stores" are outpacing the competition, in part because "middle- and lower-income consumers have been disproportionately negatively impacted by the rising cost of necessities," said TD Cowen's Chen.

In an interview last month, Macy's CEO Tony Spring told CNBC that the consumer remains resilient and continues to spend on new items and fashion, despite concerns about tariffs.

The challenge for department stores is to bring shoppers in, even as managing inventory and pricing gets increasingly difficult, Chen said. "It is ironic because everybody does love stores and humans want connection."

This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Ron Podmore, 58, a retired teacher who decided to live out his retirement in Guatemala. He still owns property in Washington and spends about half the year there as he begins the Guatemala residency process. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

I retired two years ago, in June 2023.

I was a high school teacher, and I decided to take early retirement after 32 years of teaching. But because of the fact that I was not eligible for social security, I was only able to receive half of my pension. I will get the other half about six years from now when I turn 65, or whenever I choose to also tap into my social security. It's kind of a mixed blessing, but it seems to be working for me.

I knew that if I was going to pull the plug, so to speak, and retire early, there was a huge gap. There is no way in heck I wanted to be teaching up until I was 65 and then immediately go on social security.

I have seen too many teachers where they're holding on until they turn 65, and then they're going to retire and go on social security, and six months later they're six feet under.

I was using the FIRE method. I spent probably the better part of the last 20 years investing each time I got a pay raise. It worked out favorably for me over the last 20 or 25 years.

Around 2013, I noticed an influx of migrant students coming into my classroom from Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador, and I got to know some of these kids.

I was led to believe that Guatemala is this country with endemic poverty, crime, corruption, cartels — who on earth would want to go down there? And these kids really said, "You need to rethink that."

They encouraged me to travel to Guatemala, and in 2013 or 2014, I took my first trip down there. Then I ended up going down there once or twice a year.

In 2018, I purchased a small condominium in the working-class area of Guatemala City, knowing that if I needed to, I could migrate out of the United States and be able to live down there.

So I had already purchased the property as an investment before I retired, and then I was able to make payments on it. My goal was to have it all paid off by the time I retired. And sure enough, I was able to pay it all off, so I have no mortgage on that unit.

I was making payments on it every month, and then I also expedited that by making extra payments on the principal, and I was able to pay it off within eight years. In order to do that, I took out a HELOC loan against the value of the house that I have in Federal Way, which is a suburb just south of Seattle. When you purchase property, in most places around the world, it's all cash. You cannot go to the bank of that country and ask for a loan. You have to take care of your financing with whatever bank you have in the United States or your home country.

The property that I purchased down there is a two-bedroom, one-bath with underground parking, concierge services, security, et cetera, and that was for about $125,000. The mortgage was for 10 years, just under $1,500.

There was no renting — it was vacant for years. It was just a matter of time for me to begin furnishing, purchasing things like the couches, and the chairs, and the dining room tables, and the beds, and stuff like that.

I had to do that little by little over the eight years. At the time, I was living in Washington State, and you have to factor in airplane tickets to get down there, and how much money you're going to spend on not only purchasing these items, but also having them delivered and being there and so forth. It took me about two or three years to build it all up.

I started being down there full-time in August 2024. I'm in the process of securing a temporary and a permanent residency card. That's about a three- to five-year long process.

I would be getting a visa that would allow me to live in Guatemala for extended periods of time — greater than six months.

Right now, as it is, I'm only allowed to stay in Guatemala up to six months at a time.

I have a private health insurance plan in Guatemala that runs me about $315 a month; no deductibles and no copay. That's a private hospital that also covers medicines, X-rays, MRIs, and hospital stays, and you do not get a bill at the end of any of that.

And there is such a contrast for superior services: they have better bedside manners in Central America. You're not surrounded by a certified nursing assistant or an intake specialist or a finance and operations person determining how are you going to make these payments and everything. You go into an office, the reception is right there, and the second person you see is the doctor.

Glasses, optometry, and dental I am not insured on. When I'm down there I get my teeth cleaned every six months, just like I do up here, and my teeth cleaning on average is about $65 per visit. To contrast that, when I was going to get my teeth cleaned at my local dentist up here in Washington, that would be close to $800 or $900. What the insurance carrier for dental is not covering of that is forced onto me. So each time I went to get my teeth cleaned in the States, it was slightly over $200 for my portion of the bill.

If you think about the concept of snowbirds, at least out here on the West Coast, we have a huge influx of people in their fifties who decide to retire early and they immediately relocate to Southern California, Southern Arizona, Southern New Mexico, in border towns all along the Texas border, so they can have immediate access — to drive to the border or walk across the border — to purchase their prescriptions, get their teeth done, get their X-rays done, or go into the local hospital.

If there is an emergency, they're going to run over to that border before they dial 911 in the United States.

I've just taken that concept one extra country over, which is the next country after Mexico, and that's Guatemala.

If you've got that nagging itch about changing roles, you may be onto something.

AWS senior vice president of applied AI solutions Colleen Aubrey has spent over 20 years at Amazon, building its advertising business from the ground up. She's also a member of the company's elite S-Team. 

She told Business Insider that throughout her career, she's faced numerous challenges — and as she puts it, "pretty much every six months, something significant changes."

"We have a new product idea; there's a new problem to go after; there's a new customer to get to understand," Aubrey said.

That "constant change" is the reason she's stayed at Amazon for as long as she has, and remains engaged in her work. For anyone questioning whether they're in the right role or ready for a new challenge, Aubrey said there are typically three boxes to check off.

"Are you in a place which ticks those boxes? And if you aren't, then maybe it's worth looking at changing the mix, in order to get that," Aubrey said. "Because I think when you have those elements, then work is invigorating."

Here's what you should consider, she said:

Aubrey told Business Insider that you should first ask yourself whether you're working for a leader with whom you have mutual respect.

"Are you working for a leader that you respect, that you're inspired by, that you're learning from, and vice versa?" Aubrey said.

Aubrey said that people generally need their leaders to help with the things only they can provide: resourcing, hard decisions, trade-offs, judgment calls, prioritization, advocacy, and big-picture thinking.

Sometimes, people end up with a manager who isn't the right match, even if that person is trying their best. The executive said it can become challenging to work in a space where you feel "disenchanted," and in that case, it may be time to move on to something new.

"You can choose to live through it and be dissatisfied. I think that's challenging," Aubrey said.

Aubrey said you should also ask yourself if you're working on the right team. The executive has worked on various teams throughout her roughly two decades at the retail giant. The right team includes people you're really learning from, she said.

"Are they challenging you, or is it a creative and innovative environment that works for you?" Aubrey said.

Amazon's infamous "two-pizza teams" describes the ideal team to promote innovation. The idea is that no team should be big enough that it would take more than two pizzas to feed them. The ideal size is somewhere around six to eight people, and the goal is for those teams to own something from end-to-end.

The third question you should ask yourself is what stage of the business you want to work in, Aubrey said.

"It's important to think through what is the type of product and business and problem that you like solving," Aubrey said. "Are you in a place that has that type of characteristics?"

For example, Aubrey said she had a colleague who worked on the retail side, which can be a complicated and demanding area, but he loved finding improvements in cost optimization and in the supply chain. Personally, she said she loves "X-factor growth," or working on a part of the business ripe for exponential growth.

"I like the blank sheet of paper," Aubrey said.

Warner Bros Discovery has rebuffed Paramount Skydance's initial takeover approach as too low, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday.

Warner Bros rejected Paramount's offer of around $20 per share in recent weeks, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Paramount declined to comment on the report, while Warner Bros did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

Paramount, led by David Ellison, is exploring several paths in its bid for Warner Bros, including increasing its offer, appealing directly to shareholders or securing extra support from a financial partner, Bloomberg said.

Paramount has been in talks with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management about backing its bid, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.

Ellison took over Paramount in August after completing an $8 billion merger with his film production company Skydance Media.

China on Sunday said "we are not afraid of" a trade war with the United States after President Donald Trump vowed to impose punishing new retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports.

A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce accused the U.S. of a "textbook double standard" with Trump's promise on Friday to tack on additional 100% tariffs on those imports after China imposed new export controls on rare earths minerals.

That promise in a social media post by the president shook U.S. stock markets on Friday, erasing $2 trillion in equity values in a single day.

Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China," the ministry spokesperson said.

"China's position on the trade war is consistent: we do not want it, but we are not afraid of it," they added.

The spokesperson said that the United States "for a long time … has been overstretching the concept of national security, abusing export control, taking discriminatory actions against China, and imposing unilateral long-arm jurisdiction measures on various products, including semiconductor equipment and chips."

The U.S. Commerce Control list covers more than 3,000 items, more than three times the approximately 900 items on China's Export Control List of Dual-use Items, the spokesperson said.

China called its export controls on rare earth exports a "legitimate" measure under international law, pushing back against U.S. accusations of economic coercion.

The Commerce Ministry said the controls, issued Thursday, were part of Beijing's effort to strengthen its export control system and "better safeguard world peace and regional stability" amid what it described as a turbulent global security environment.

The measures, which now cover not only rare earth materials but also related intellectual property and technologies, were announced just weeks before a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

"These controls do not constitute export bans. Applications that meet the requirements will be approved," the Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.

"China has fully assessed the potential impact of these measures on the supply chain and is confident that the impact will be very limited."

Beijing's new curbs also require foreign entities to obtain a license to export products containing more than 0.1% of domestically-sourced rare earths, or manufactured using China's extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology. Applications for items that could be used in weapons or other military purposes will be denied.

Shortly after Beijing tightened export controls on rare earths, the European Chamber of Commerce in China reported a backlog of export license applications awaiting approval, saying the new restrictions "add further complexity to the global supply chains of rare earth elements."

In response to Beijing's move, Trump on Friday announced new tariffs of 100% on imports from China "over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying" beginning Nov. 1.

Trump also said that the U.S., on that same date, would also impose export controls on "any and all critical software."

Stock markets plunged after Trump said on Truth Social that "there is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive'" with its rare earths policy.

China accounts for about 70% of the global supply of rare earths and has repeatedly used the critically needed minerals as a bargaining chip in trade discussions.

Hours after tightening export controls on rare earths, Beijing also announced that it would start charging U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports from Oct. 14, mirroring a new U.S. fee on Chinese vessels arriving at U.S. ports, set to take effect the same day.

The U.S. accounts for only 0.1% of global shipbuilding, compared to 53.3% for China, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

China's Commerce Ministry defended its reciprocal decision as "necessary passive defensive actions." It added that the U.S. actions "seriously undermined the atmosphere of the economic and trade talks between the two sides."

Senior U.S. and Chinese officials met for trade negotiations in Geneva in May — the first since Trump launched a global trade war. A follow-up meeting in London in June led to a trade "framework," while a third round of high-level talks took place a month later in Stockholm, where both sides signaled progress in negotiations.

The most recent trade meetings in Madrid in September yielded a "basic framework consensus" on the divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok, ahead of a deadline to either sell off its U.S. business or shut down the social media app in the country.

On Sept. 19, Trump and Xi spoke on the phone but did not finalize a deal on TikTok. After the call, Trump announced that he and Xi agreed to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum during the last week of October in Gyeongju, South Korea.

While China has been silent on future meetings, Trump had also said he would visit China early next year and that Xi would come to the U.S. at a later date.

However, Trump on Friday threatened in a social media post to cancel his upcoming meeting with Xi after China's latest tightening of export curbs on rare earths.

Oops, something went wrong

Gift cards have long been the go-to for last-minute holiday shoppers — easy to buy, easy to wrap, and usually appreciated. But many of those cards end up forgotten in drawers, unspent or lost to expiration dates. A new kind of gift card aims to change that by turning gifting into an investment opportunity: Bitcoin.

Fold (NASDAQ:FLD), a fintech company founded to make Bitcoin more accessible to everyday consumers, recently launched what it calls the first-ever Bitcoin gift card. The cards are being rolled out to major retailers nationwide through a partnership with Blackhawk Network, one of the largest gift card distributors in the U.S.

"Fold was founded with the idea that Bitcoin could be an incredible tool for savings for everyday people, specifically for millennials who are finding it increasingly hard to build savings," Fold CEO Will Reeves told Benzinga. "And Bitcoin has been the best performing asset of the last decade."

Fold started by letting users earn Bitcoin instead of traditional cash-back or airline miles rewards. Since its founding, Reeves says customers have earned over $90 million in Bitcoin rewards, compared to less than $20 million had they opted for cash back.

The Bitcoin gift card functions like a traditional one, but with digital potential. Shoppers can buy the card online or off a retail shelf for a set dollar amount. The recipient redeems it by downloading the Fold app, where the Bitcoin value is instantly credited to their account.

Reeves explained that the process eliminates many of the hurdles typically involved in gifting crypto. "It doesn't require them to already have a Bitcoin wallet or to really understand Bitcoin," he said.

Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Once redeemed, recipients can save, spend, or even cash out their Bitcoin through Fold's app.

"You can send it to someone else, you can turn it into physical cash at an ATM, you can use it to spend on a debit card, and earn more Bitcoin rewards," Reeves told Benzinga. "So it creates a great and very flexible environment for people to receive Bitcoin."

For many, volatility remains a concern when it comes to Bitcoin. Reeves acknowledged that while price swings are part of the asset's nature, gifting offers a safe entry point.

"This is not you putting up your own hard-earned money or hard-earned savings," he said, adding that some may be nervous because of a temporary downturn. "This is a way for you to get some [Bitcoin], that's not from you putting up any capital. It's a risk-free way to start getting used to the asset and start to see it over a longer period of time."

Reeves told Benzinga the card could broaden Bitcoin's reach beyond the tech-savvy crowd. "Bitcoin has been very heavily male-dominated in terms of who is adopting it," he said. "And that's typically because investing and trading is an activity that — when you look at the demographics — skews very male."

He added that he believes Fold — and particularly this Bitcoin gift card — will speak to broader demographics because it makes crypto so much more accessible. It's not just for "crypto bro culture" anymore, but for those managing household finances and trying to make smart financial decisions, "giving more financial foundation for your family."

Reeves is optimistic about where this gift card could lead. "We see Bitcoin is very close to all-time highs, and we expect that to continue over the next few years," he said. "It really situates this to usurp not only all gift cards but to become the number one gift in America, overall."

China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) says its new rare-earth export controls are lawful national-security steps — not blanket bans — and that licenses will be issued for eligible civilian trade, according to a spokesperson's Q&A posted on X Sunday morning local time.

Rare earths — a group of 17 elements used in permanent-magnet motors for electric vehicles (EVs) and wind turbines, defense electronics and other high-tech gear — occupy an outsized role in supply chains because China dominates the sector. 

Beijing accounts for roughly 70% of global production and about 90% of processing and refining; so licensing shifts can ripple downstream even when mining or final manufacturing happens elsewhere.

In remarks published only hours ago, the MOFCOM spokesperson framed the Oct. 9 action — taken with the General Administration of Customs — as part of a longer effort to “refine” China's export control system in line with domestic law and non-proliferation obligations. 

The spokesperson cited the military relevance of medium- and heavy rare earths and said partners were notified in advance through bilateral export-control dialogue mechanisms.

Implementation, the ministry said, will hinge on licensing rather than prohibition. 

Reviews will be conducted under law, licenses will be granted where applications qualify, and Beijing is “actively considering” facilitation measures — including potential general licenses and license exemptions — to promote legitimate trade. 

The spokesperson also said China had assessed the measures' effects ahead of time and expects the broader supply-chain impact to be “very limited.” The message to commercial users was explicit: compliant civilian exports “can get approval.”

MOFCOM also addressed President Donald Trump's comments from Oct. 10 on Truth Social about an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports (becoming effective Nov. 1, 2025) and prospective U.S. export controls on “critical software.” 

The spokesperson called the American position a “double standard,” pointing to the breadth of U.S. control lists and de minimis rules as examples of Washington's expansive approach. 

At the same time, the ministry emphasized process, saying China “does not want” a trade war but “is not afraid” of one, and urging a return to established consultation channels to manage differences on a reciprocal basis. The spokesperson said China would take “resolute measures” to protect its interests if the U.S. proceeds.

Separate comments criticized U.S. port fees due to take effect Oct. 14 on certain Chinese-linked vessels. 

MOFCOM described those fees as unilateral and inconsistent with WTO rules and bilateral agreements. China, the ministry said, will levy special port fees on U.S.-linked vessels under domestic regulations — characterizing the step as a defensive countermeasure aimed at safeguarding the rights of Chinese companies and maintaining fair competition in shipping.

As of Sunday, 9:15 a.m. UTC, according to CoinDesk Data, bitcoin traded around $111,271, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours and 10% from Thursday's Oct. 9 intraday high of $123,641. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index read 24 — "Extreme Fear" — versus "Greed" a week ago, underscoring fragile sentiment.

Robert Kiyosaki warns of the “biggest crash in world history” this year, urging investors to avoid fiat assets and focus on real assets like silver and Ethereum. Despite the warning, his preferred portfolio has gained nearly 40% in 2025, reinforcing his belief in tangible and scarce assets as financial protection.

While most of the market is still recovering from the steep tariff-driven crash, a few altcoins that beat the crypto market crash have already turned heads with 24-hour gains, even going as high as 100%. These tokens managed to rebound faster than others, showing strong on-chain activity and retail demand even as larger assets lag behind. 

This article discusses those three crash-beating altcoins and how their price charts are shaping up amid the broader market weakness. 

Radiant Capital — a DeFi lending platform built to bridge liquidity across chains — has emerged as one of the few altcoins to beat the crypto market crash. 

RDNT rallied nearly 100% in the past 24 hours, rebounding to around $0.029. The move is powered by an interesting split between retail excitement and cautious large-holder interest.

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures how much institutional or large-wallet money is flowing in or out of a token, remains just below zero. 

However, it has started curling upward, suggesting that big players are slowly returning — but still trading carefully. For CMF to confirm full institutional conviction, it needs to cross decisively above the zero line.

In contrast, the Money Flow Index (MFI), which tracks trading volume and retail inflows, has surged to an overheated 94.68, reflecting intense retail buying. 

This shows smaller investors are aggressively chasing every rise and dip, driving short-term euphoria around Radiant.

Technically, while RDNT's 100% surge looks impressive, the chart flashes an early warning. 

Between April 25 and October 11, the price made a higher high, but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) made a lower high — a bearish divergence that often signals a possible correction rather than a full trend reversal.

At the same time, the RDNT price has just broken out of a descending channel, a bearish structure it had traded in for months. The breakout is promising, but it's not yet a confirmed bullish reversal.

For the move to sustain, Radiant must hold above $0.029 and close a daily candle above $0.034 even. Failure to do so could invite selling pressure back toward $0.020 or lower.

Morpho has quietly become another DeFi token, beating the crypto market crash, showing that decentralized lending projects may be leading the recovery. 

While most altcoins remain deep in red, MORPHO is down only 10% over the past week and up 4.2% in the past 24 hours, hinting that DeFi resilience might be returning to the market.

Over the past 24 hours, Morpho whales increased their holdings by 5.34%, taking their total stash to 4.6 million MORPHO tokens. At the current price of $1.68, that translates to a stash worth nearly $8 million.

This accumulation came even as exchange balances rose 2.66%, showing that selling is continuing across cohorts, primarily by retail and smart money. 

MORPHO's price chart also paints an interesting story. Before the crash, the token was trading inside a rising wedge, a structure often seen before short-term corrections. 

The crash broke this wedge to the downside, but the current bounce has pushed the MORPHO price back above the lower trendline, showing early signs of stabilization.

The Bull Bear Power (BBP) indicator — which tracks the strength balance between buyers and sellers — supports that view. The bearish bars have shrunk sharply since October 10, suggesting that selling pressure is fading and that bulls might be regaining control.

At press time, MORPHO trades around $1.69. For the recovery to continue, the price must hold above $1.61 and push through $1.91 to retest higher resistance levels at $2.47 and $2.85. If $1.61 fails, short-term support lies at $1.55 and $1.44.

Despite market-wide volatility, Morpho's steady whale accumulation and fading bearish power suggest that it could remain one of the few DeFi altcoins outperforming during the crypto market crash, provided large money keeps backing the rebound.

Succinct's PROVE token, which powers its zero-knowledge proof (ZK-proof) infrastructure network, has emerged as one of the altcoins beating the crypto crash. 

Over the past 24 hours, PROVE is up nearly 19%, signaling renewed confidence in infrastructure-based DeFi projects even as most of the market struggles to recover.

On-chain data paints a clear picture of who's driving the move. Whale holdings fell 22.38%, dropping to just over 1,171 tokens, while exchange balances rose 6.27% to 38.25 million tokens. This suggests large holders are taking profits.

The Money Flow Index (MFI) — which tracks money entering or leaving the asset — currently stands near 73.22, moving toward overbought levels. This means buyers remain active, but the momentum is largely retail-driven, and may need fresh whale inflows to stay strong.

Technically, PROVE continues to respect a falling wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart, a structure that often hints at a trend reversal once confirmed. 

Between September 26 and October 10, the price made a lower low while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) formed a higher low, showing bullish divergence and fading selling momentum.

At press time, PROVE trades near $0.74. A 4-hour candle close above $0.85 could open the path toward $0.94 and $0.98, marking a potential 25% to 30% upside from current levels. However, a drop below $0.72 could push the price toward $0.67, where the next key support lies.

For now, retail enthusiasm continues to drive PROVE's recovery, but whale re-entry will decide whether it can extend its lead among the altcoins already beating the crypto crash.

While these DeFi names impressed during the recovery, Zcash (ZEC) deserves an honorary mention for completely defying the crypto market crash. The privacy-focused token is up more than 74% this week and nearly 10% in the past 24 hours, trading close to $290.

Both retail and institutional money continue flowing into ZEC, keeping the rally alive even as most other altcoins struggle to recover. For more insights, read our full Zcash analysis here.

Oops, something went wrong

After months of debate, Kenya's parliament has passed the country's first comprehensive crypto legislation. VASP will be key in driving adoption and creating a regulatory framework for crypto businesses in the country.

In Uganda, an initiative to launch the country's first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is going into effect. CBDC continues to lose momentum as stablecoins, like the USDC and USDT, take over

Meanwhile, approximately 650,000 crypto merchants in South Africa can now accept Bitcoin payments following the integration of the Lightning Network (LN). The LN scales the Bitcoin mainnet, enabling low-fee transactions. Presently, the Bitcoin Lightning Network has a capacity of over $471M worth of BTC.

Other than the Floki crypto funding of the WWFA in Malawi, let's look at stories making continental headlines this week:

The Kenyan parliament has passed the Virtual Asset Providers Bill (VASP), which is the country's first comprehensive crypto legislation. This bill creates a licensing and supervisory framework for crypto service providers in the country.

One of the most critical introductions is the multi-agency regulation of the crypto sector. Kenya's Central Bank and the Communications Authority of Kenya have a role rather than having a single regulator for the sector.

One notable requirement for service providers is having a physical office in the country and at least three natural persons on their board of directors. These measures ensure Kenya better complies with international requirements in AML/KYC.

Binance-linked lobby group, Virtual Assets Chamber of Commerce, played a role in changes to the bill.

Uganda has launched a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot programme.

This CBDC will entail a digital Ugandan shilling backed by treasury bonds and will run on a blockchain.

It will feature a $5.5Bn real-world asset tokenization project led by Global Settlement Network (GSN) and Diacente Group.

GSN co-founder Ryan Kirkley explained the initiative as follows:

“We're building infrastructure that goes beyond theory — a programmable economy grounded in real assets, regulatory collaboration, and mass accessibility,”

Some target assets for the new portfolio are food production, mining, renewable energy, and trade.

Uganda has a broad range of possible tokenized assets, and this project intends to leverage these possibilities.

However, it is still unclear whether the country's government will enact any regulatory changes to promote the success of this initiative.

South African merchant crypto acceptance has soared to 650,000 after Scan to Go integrated the Lightning Network for Bitcoin payments.

Presently, the Africa's economic powerhouse already boasts the best numbers on the continent in crypto payments, and this move raises that number even higher.

Due to its inherent architecture, Bitcoin has historically faced scalability problems. The Lightning Network came to improve payment efficiency and ensure Bitcoin could become more compatible with merchants' instant settlement needs.

The total number of merchants now accepting crypto payments is approximately 650,000. This increased rate is a strong representation of South African business. Crypto continues to achieve impressive integration into the real economy and will continue to grow if current trends hold.

 An investigation has tied the Hyperliquid whale controlling over 100,000 BTC to Garrett Jin, the ex-BitForex CEO whose exchange collapsed amid fraud probes. 

An onchain investigation by crypto researcher Eye has linked the mysterious Hyperliquid whale, who controls over 100,000 BTC, to Garrett Jin, the former CEO of BitForex, a now-defunct exchange embroiled in a fraud scandal.

In a Saturday post on X, the onchain sleuth noted that the whale's main wallet, ereignis.eth, was connected to another ENS name, garrettjin.eth, which directly leads to Jin's verified X (Twitter) account, @GarrettBullish.

“The ENS name ereignis.eth (“event” in German) confirms his link to this wallet, identifying him as the actor behind the large-scale operations on Hyperliquid/Hyperunit,” Eye wrote on X. 

The wallet activity also matched Jin's known business dealings, including transfers to staking contracts and addresses funded by exchanges he had past ties with, such as Huobi (HTX).

Further, the whale's wallet received and sent funds that traced back to BitForex-related addresses and to Binance deposits used to open massive trades, including a $735 million Bitcoin (BTC) short.

Jin led BitForex from 2017 to 2020. The exchange was later accused of falsifying trading volumes and flagged by Japan's Financial Services Agency for operating without registration. 

In 2024, BitForex lost $57 million from its hot wallets, froze withdrawals and ultimately shut down after its team was detained in China. Hong Kong's SFC later issued a warning for suspected fraud, and users claimed millions in unrecovered funds.

Following BitForex's collapse, Jin founded several ventures, including WaveLabs VC (2020), TanglePay (2021), IotaBee (2022) and GroupFi (2023). Most of these projects have since become inactive. 

In 2024, he launched XHash.com, a platform for institutional Ethereum staking, which investigators allege may have been used to onboard questionable funds. After the allegations surfaced, Jin reportedly removed XHash from his social media bio, though it remains visible on his Telegram account.

Crypto analyst Quinten François expressed skepticism over the claims linking the Hyperliquid whale to the former BitForex CEO, arguing that the evidence may be too convenient. 

“Why would you have an .eth name leading to your X handle in a wallet that directly connects to market manipulation wallets and wallets for other crime?” he wrote on X, adding that such a setup “sounds way too simple to be true.”

$83 billion has just been sitting there underground this whole time.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A deposit of gold ore recently discovered in China isn't just giant. It's supergiant. So much so, in fact, that Chinese experts claim it could be the largest deposit of any precious metal—not just gold ore—in existence today. 

How big is the “supergiant” deposit located under the Wangu gold field in the Hunan province? Experts estimate it at 1,100 tons. 

According to Chinese state media, a team of geologists detected over 40 gold veins of roughly 330 tons of gold ore dipping 6,600 feet deep under Pingjiang County's Wangu gold field. But 3D modeling blows that number out of the water, showing there could be as much as 1,100 tons as deep as 9,800 feet. If the models are accurate, the deposit in its entirely could be worth roughly $83 billion. 

Adding some more heft to the already weighty (literally) find was the report that the new discovery features 138 grams of gold per metric ton of ore, a valuable rate not often found in gold mining. “Many drilled rock cores showed visible gold,” said Chen Rulin, an ore-prospecting expert at China's Hunan Province's Geological Bureau, according to Chinese state media. 

If the 1,100-ton figure holds up, that makes this new find the largest gold mine in the world, even outpacing South Africa's South Deep gold mine with its 1,025 tons of gold, according to Mining Technology. Mines in Indonesia, Russia, New Guinea, and Chile round out the top-five gold mines in the world. The Carlin Trend and Cortez gold mines, both in Nevada, are ranked sixth and 10th worldwide. 

Historically, the world has mined 233,000 tons of gold, all of it still around in some form, and two-thirds of that mining has occurred since 1950. 

Already the world's top gold producer with about 10 percent of global production, China is heavily dependent on the metal, using about three times more gold than it mines annually. A rate that high requires the country to purchase so much gold from other countries that it's also the world's top importer of the valuable metal. This new discovery has put the world's gold markets on notice, enough so that the price of gold rose to $2,700 per ounce, according to CCN.com. 

And the gold news may not stop there. According to Liu Yongjun, vice head of the bureau, additional gold ore was found when drilling around the site's peripheral areas.

I was still able to steer and brake with power steering and brakes for maybe 30 seconds before those went out too. After putting it into park and pressing the brake and start button it started back up and I could drive it normally for a little bit, but it happened two more times on my 1.5 mi drive home.If that happened on the highway I could easily see people being killed.

"Steer by wire" means there is nothing but copper signal wires between your steering wheel and the front wheels. Your steering wheel is essentially a video game controller.This has nothing to do with the car's mode of propulsion though, and both EVs and ICE cars can have steer by wire controls. So far, it's only the cybertruck that has this paradigm, all other EV's all have normal power steering.For normal power steering systems there are two types: hydraulic and electric. Both types have a solid steel shaft between your steering wheel and the front wheels. You can remove the engine/motor completely, and you'll still be able to steer the car. The hydraulic or electric motor merely helps you turn the wheel, nothing more. Hydraulic is being phased out for electric in both EVs and ICE vehicles.

The Infinity Q50, QX50, QX55 and QX60 (with backup that connects upon electric failure).Without backup, but triple redundancy, can be found in the Tesla Cybertruck. But I'd take that redundancy with a grain of salt as they don't have the best track record telling you the truth.That said, I really with companies would go back to the good old hydraulic steering. I don't need self-parking. But self-parking needs at least electric steering (with our without steering column).

It's amazing how much more reliable cars have gotten. You used to be always on the alert for some critical function to fail spontaneously, and also listening for warning signs.

reply

In general, this wasn't especially hazardous, since I rarely needed to move the wheel very far while moving at very low speed in a place where other cars could be a hazard.(Yes, I got this fixed.  And the old LS400 cars were extremely well designed and built.)

That's not what is going on here. These cars are not being intentionally shut down remotely. Instead, a software update for some computerized components of the car was pushed down to the cars and installed with the owners permissions, but that update apparently has severe bugs that should have been caught by QA.

Even if the owner gave permission to install the update, I would strongly wager that they did not give concurrent permission for the update to change the behavior of the vehicle.Of course, I sincerely doubt the EULA offers any way to separate those permissions; you are all in, or you are all out. Assuming that you even have an option to opt out.And that's exactly why these cars can never be trusted under any circumstances, ever.

Most people have a variety of things they are looking for in a car they want to purchase, and other factors are more important to them than this one, which they figure probably won't happen anyway. There may be few options that aren't updateable over the air, and those options don't meet their other criteria -- if they even get that deep into considering it, which they probably don't, they just aren't really thinking about it. But even if they did. you don't have the option of buying your perfect fantasy car. I'd like to buy a car with manual mechanical controls instead of touch screen controls, but there aren't that many options for that either, and they may not meet my other needs.

Because afaik, all the modern cars have this as a 'feature', but there's lots of other nice features they have.The best of both worlds right now is an earlier modern car where the 2g/3g modem can no longer connect to the outside world. Even better if you can pull the modem, but they're usually up behind a lot of trim.

One answer to this I would presume is: there are no other new cars for sale without this flaw.Why there aren't regulations or forced options in the market without these functions (as well as with physical control knobs instead of touch surfaces) is a good question too. There is huge demand for cars without most of this nonsense, yet I don't see that demand being met.I doubt anyone wants a car whose infotainment system can be improperly updated to cause catastrophic power and engine failure while driving, if given this information and a choice to avoid it.

Jeep has already confirmed they've pushed out a fix. That is not bricked.

I've had some pretty nasty brickings of devices, like overwriting the bootloader, that I've been able to recover from by getting it into some barely documented system on chip mode with a special cable, booting a new bootloader into RAM via the cable, and reflashing that way. One could go to the extreme and say any flash storage chip where all software bits are directly writable by a factory tool is technically unbrickable. But the customers won't see it that way.

Being strict about the word "bricked" and limiting it to the truly unrecoverable situations just makes it nigh-on useless.Very few things can make a modern system truly unrecoverable if one is willing to pour unreasonable resources into them. It's incredibly common to be in a situation where a system is unrecoverable by you though. There's no practical difference between these two except that one depends on the surrounding context.

I live in a city so I don't need a car, but if I had to buy one, "it should not have a network interface" would be my most important requirement. "It should not have a video display" would be a secondary one. If I had to buy a car with a network interface, I would do my best to neutralize it to make sure it stays 100% offline.

reply

Whereas the problem is that cars have had computers for a long time (eg ECU, ABS, entertainment), then those started getting connected together locally via CAN, then finally they added an Internet connection for surveillance and control. So the centralizing proprietary software tentacles go deep into the car in a way that's not easy to remove or replace.There is the black box approach of disabling network interfaces, but I could even see that going away - cannot contact network -> car cannot be sure that warranty recalls have been done in a timely fashion -> disable itself after a month until you "take it to a dealer" (or reconnect the cell backhaul).

Researchers at Fudan University have created a working memory chip just a few atoms thick.

For the first time, scientists have successfully built a fully functional memory chip using two-dimensional materials and integrated it directly onto a conventional silicon die — a milestone that could change how future semiconductors are made. The research, led by Chunsen Liu and colleagues at Fudan University in Shanghai, was published on October 9 in the journal Nature.

The research may mark a turning point for 2D electronics, which have long promised atomic-scale performance and efficiency but struggled to move beyond lab demonstrations. Using a process the team calls ATOM2CHIP, the researchers grew a layer of molybdenum disulfide just a few atoms thick directly on top of a conventional 0.13-micrometer CMOS silicon chip. The result is a hybrid chip that combines a 2D NOR flash memory array with a standard CMOS controller, effectively bridging the gap between experimental nanomaterials and industry-standard fabrication.

The Fudan team reports a 94.34% yield from full-chip testing — a figure that rivals commercial silicon production — and operational speeds up to five megahertz. Each bit consumes just 0.644 picojoules, far below the energy draw of today's silicon flash cells. The memory demonstrated fast 20-nanosecond programming and erasing, ten-year data retention, and endurance of over 100,000 write cycles.

 




To achieve this, the researchers had to overcome the challenge of surface roughness. Silicon chips, even after polishing, have uneven terrain at the nanometer scale that can tear or stress atomic-thin layers. The ATOM2CHIP method introduced a conformal adhesion process that allows the 2D material to “flow” over the contours of the underlying circuits without breaking, while a 2D-friendly packaging system guards against heat and electrostatic damage.

Equally crucial was the team's “cross-platform system design,” a custom interface ensuring the 2D layer could communicate seamlessly with the CMOS control logic. This design enables instruction-driven operations, 32-bit parallelism, and random access, or, in other words, a full-featured memory chip.

In their paper, the authors describe the result as “an important milestone in extending the superiority of 2D electronics to real-world applications.” The implications go well beyond flash storage. If scaled, such hybrid architectures could drastically reduce power use and increase density in next-generation processors and AI processors, effectively continuing Moore's Law at the atomic limit. While mass production is still years away, this is the closest 2D materials have come to commercial relevance.

Finding bugs can make you a millionaire.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Apple announced at Hexacon 2025, the top global offensive security conference, that it will double its highest security bounty to $2 million. This makes Cupertino the most generous company that offers an award for unearthing vulnerabilities, and it's even offering top-up bonuses that can see security experts earning more than $5 million for uncovering exploits. According to Apple's Security Research blog, it has already awarded over $35 million to more than 800 security researchers since 2020, bringing the average award to $43,750. It even claimed that multiple individuals have received $500,000 in rewards.

The top $2-million award is reserved for those who discover sophisticated exploit chains similar to what mercenary spyware attacks exploit. Beyond that, there's also a bonus system for those who can break Apple's Lockdown Mode secure environment and vulnerabilities in its beta software, bringing the potential payout to over $5 million. There are also smaller awards, like $1 million for those who can crack broad iCloud security and those who can create a wireless proximity attack using radio, up to $300,000 to anyone who develops a one-click WebKit sandbox escape mechanism, and $100,000 to those who can bypass Gatekeeper on macOS.

 




This isn't the only bug bounty program anyone can participate in. AMD announced its own program last year, with a payout of up to $30,000, while Intel offers a maximum of $100,000. Microsoft's maximum award at the moment is $250,000, and it has even lowered its age limit to 13 because of this high school junior who filed over 20 security vulnerability reports last summer. Meta launched a bug bounty program in 2011 and now offers a maximum bug bounty of $300,000 (with $25,000,000 awarded to date). And last, but not least, Google began its Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) in 2010. The search giant's rewards vary from a few hundred dollars to a million dollars for the most serious vulnerabilities on its Titan M security chip. The company paid $11.8 million in 2024 to 660 researchers, bringing the average award to $17,800 per head.

These awards can make finding bugs a lucrative field, especially for talented security researchers. And while it might seem like an expensive proposition for companies, it's far cheaper for them to pay out these bounties instead of having a bad actor discover it and disseminate it under their noses, resulting in reputational and financial damages for the corporation. Moreover, software mistakes can potentially cost lives, as state actors and other third parties are increasingly using sophisticated means to target specific personalities.

Fall means cooler weather and leaves turning and pumpkins and all that fun stuff. It also means mud, those leaves stuck to shoes or your dog's paws, Halloween and Thanksgiving foot traffic, and generally a more challenging time keeping your floors and carpets clean. If there was ever a time to upgrade your floor cleaning game, it's now, and Dreame's superstar robot vacuum and mop combo, the X50 Ultra (Complete), is 29% off at Amazon. Plus, you can save an extra 5% at Amazon with the code DMGMPD5OFF for an even better deal.

Dreame's awesome Prime Day sale is still in effect, with enormous price breaks on their finest cleaning machines for your floors and your air. Between the hot deals on the Dreame L50 Ultra and the X50 Ultra (Complete), there's a programmable, self-cleaning, highly intelligent robot floor machine ready to tackle all of the mess, dirt, pet hair, and more, while taking the lion's share of the work away from you once and for all.

One of the new tech features that dropped jaws at CES 2025 was Dreame's ProLeap System, which gives the X50 Ultra (Complete) the ability to actually scale steps and thresholds up to 2.36 inches in height. If you know the sound of a robot vacuum that's hung up on a threshold between rooms, you know it means you need to get up and give it an assist. The Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete) eliminates that frustrating situation, and also eliminates previously unreachable dirt that hides in corners with its MopExtend RoboSwing tech that reaches over an inch and a half into those elusive spots.

Dirty corners and threshold obstacles aren't the only common robot vacuum shortcomings solved by the Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete). The innovative HyperStream Detangling Duo Brush eradicates those hair tangles that bring the rollers of lesser robot vacs to a complete standstill. It allows the X50 Ultra (Complete) to pick up a full 100% of large particles and hair, with no tangles snarling the rollers. VersaLift Navigation with advanced LiDAR and AI continuously map its path in real time to avoid obstacles, and even determining which pieces of furniture it can successfully go under for optimal cleaning without getting stuck or, worse, lost.

The Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete) is better at taking care of itself than any robot floor cleaner we've seen, whether it's self-emptying dirt in its Intelligent PowerDock, or using the AceClean DryBoard system that hits the mop pads with 20 streams of hot, cleansing water, and then dries them with hot air to prevent those bad, damp smells. The mop is clean and ready to go again without any work on your part. The X50 Ultra (Complete) also toggles seamlessly between hard floors and carpets, with five tailored modes that protect your carpets from the mop, boost the suction for thicker carpets, and more.

The Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete) is well-named. It gets your hard floors and carpets ultra clean, does a complete job including hard-to-reach corners and beneath some furniture items, and completely takes the drudgery of vacuuming and even more taxing mopping jobs out of your hands — which sounds like a dream scenario to us, but it's very real. The 29% off deal at Amazon wipes $500 from the price of the Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete), making it a $1,200 investment in years of effortlessly clean floors and hundreds of hours back that you previously spent cleaning. Don't forget to use the code DMGMPD5OFF at Amazon to snag an extra 5%.

The Netherlands will aim to place one foot in the 2026 World Cup's list of qualified teams as it seeks a fifth qualifying win at home to Finland on Sunday.

The Netherlands will bring the curtain down on its international break when it hosts Finland on Sunday hoping to extend its three-point lead at the top of UEFA Group G. De Oranje already sits clear at the head of its pool, but Finland can cause a stir in Amsterdam as it sits third in the pecking order and just three points off the peak.

Ronald Koeman's hosts will feel upbeat about their chances of a third straight qualifying win given they beat Finland 2-0 in Helsinki four months ago. That marked a fifth straight defeat to the Dutch in their head-to-head, and it's now been 75 years since Finland's only win over the Netherlands to date.

Memphis Depay's injury-time finish in Thursday's 4-0 win over Malta took him two goals clear of Robin van Persie as the Netherlands' all-time top scorer, with 52 goals to his name. The Corinthians attacker doesn't appear to have lost his sheen since moving to Brazil and will be out for blood after scoring in the win over Finland earlier this year, with five goals to his name in qualifying thus far.

Legendary striker Robert Lewandowski could be set to leave Barcelona when his contract expires next summer, as the Catalan giants are not expected to offer a new contract to the 37-year-old ahead of the expiry of his current deal in June 2026. Lewandowski has struck four times in seven La Liga appearances so far this season, but has often been limited to substitute appearances and the club reportedly believe now is the time to seek his successor.

Chelsea owner Todd Boehly has made it his mission to bring some of the top young players to his clubs since investing, and now one of the top talents in the United States is reportedly on their radar.

The Blues have spent big money on bringing in wonderkids to both Chelsea and Strasbourg, and Chelsea are finally starting to reap the rewards of this strategy.

Estevao Willian is the most high-profile addition the club have made so far, and he announced himself to the Stamford Bridge faithful with a dramatic winning goal against Liverpool.

Despite a plethora of talent already on their books, they are continuing to analyse around the world for top players they can bring in to either BlueCo club.

One of those who is standing out right now is Seattle Sounders star Obed Vargas, who was recently voted as number one on the MLS' list of 22 under 22.

The Mexican has been a regular in the high-flying side for a number of years now, and the Chelsea owners have registered interest in a deal.

According to The Telegraph, he is on the radar of BlueCo, who own both of Chelsea and Strasbourg.

The Ligue 1 side are very much being used as a feeder club for the Blues at the moment, with a number of their top performers set for long careers in West London.

Kendry Paez, Mike Penders, Mamadou Sarr and Emanuel Emegha are all currently owned by the Blues, however will remain with Strasbourg for this season at least.

Seattle Sounders didn't make it out of the group stage at the Club World Cup, however there was time for Vargas to make his mark.

He left the tournament as one of the most promising young players, who has gained the attention of a number of clubs around Europe as a result.

Vargas impressed against both Atletico Madrid and PSG, with the latter being decimated by the Blues in the final of the competition.

BlueCo have already signed Julio Enciso, who has a chance of making it at Stamford Bridge, and the same could be on the cards for Vargas if he does move to Strasbourg.

Inter Milan wingback Federico Dimarco and striker Francesco Pio Esposito were among the stars in Italy's win over Estonia.

This is the view in today's print edition of Turin-based newspaper Tuttosport, via FCInterNews. They also argue that Nerazzurri duo Nicolo Barella and Alessandro Bastoni were also solid.

Italy got a hugely significant win over Estonia yesterday evening.

The Azzurri have been at risk of missing out on a third straight World Cup. They had already failed to qualify for the 2018 and 2022 editions of the tournament, and did not get their qualification off to the best of starts this time around.

However, Italy secured a convincing 3-1 win over Estonia in a World Cup qualifying victory yesterday.

In the view of Tuttosport, two of Italy's top performers were Inter wingback Federico Dimarco and striker Francesco Pio Esposito.

Wingback Dimarco started the match. He assisted Moise Kean's opening goal within the first few minutes.

Overall, Dimarco had a strong match, Tuttosport argue, continuing his bright start to the season with Inter.

Meanwhile, Francesco Pio Esposito came on as a substitute for Kean after the Fiorentina striker suffered an injury.

In the view of Tuttosport, Pio Esposito's display was outstanding. Then, the 20-year-old Nerazzurri striker capped it off with the third goal of the match in the second half.

In the view of Tuttosport, meanwhile, Inter midfielder Nicolo Barella and defender Alessandro Bastoni enjoyed solid matches.

Tuchel is 'fully expected' to see through his contract to after the 2026 World Cup, while the German was 'unimpressed' with the Red Devils' hiring process when he was previously contacted as a potential replacement for Erik ten Hag.

Inter Milan striker Francesco Pio Esposito has been named as the “MVP” for Italy in yesterday's World Cup qualifying win over Estonia.

Today's print edition of Milan-based newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, via FCInterNews, highlight the 20-year-old's sparkling display. The newspaper also praises Nerazzurri duo Nicolo Barella and Federico Dimarco.

Italy secured a hugely important victory over Estonia yesterday.

At risk of missing out on a third consecutive World Cup, the EURO 2020 winners needed to take three points.

Italy got off to just the right start. Fiorentina striker Moise Kean put the Azzurri ahead in the fourth minute. This courtesy of an assist from Inter wingback Federico Dimarco.

Then, Mateo Retegui doubled Italy's advantage a few minutes before halftime.

Italy conceded a second half goal that introduced some major doubts. However, Inter striker Francesco Pio Esposito came off the bench and scored his first ever goal for the national team to wrap up the victory.

In the view of the Gazzetta dello Sport, Pio Esposito was Italy's outstanding performer.

The 20-year-old's performance was more than just his vital goal.

Pio Esposito gave the Azzurri a boost with his energy and physicality as soon as he stepped out onto the pitch.

However, Pio Esposito is not the only Inter player to receive praise from the Gazzetta.

The newspaper also highlight the performance of Nerazzurri midfielder Nicolo Barella. The 28-year-old was in firm control of the central battle.

Furthermore, with Dimarco's assist, the Gazzetta also name the 27-year-old as one of Italy's top performers on the night.

Barcelona are believed to be delighted with Marcus Rashford's progress and are considering sealing a permanent transfer for the Englishman next summer, following an impressive start to life in Catalunya. Rashford joined on an initial loan deal from Manchester United in August, with Barca bosses said to be wary that the deal seemed "too good to be true". The 27-year-old has proven his worth, particularly as he fired La Blaugrana to victory at Newcastle in the Champions League, and he may see his Barcelona story stretch beyond next summer.

It was friends-turned-foes Sunday in Wuhan, as former doubles partners Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula faced off in a WTA final for the first time in their careers. In the end, it was Gauff getting the better of her fellow American, winning 6-4, 7-5 in 1 hour and 42 minutes to claim her third WTA 1000 title.

Two years after sharing the WTA 1000 doubles title in Miami, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula stood on stage side by side again Sunday, this time as singles finalists at the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open.

But unlike their shared triumph in 2023, only one could lift the winner's trophy on this occasion. In the end, it was Gauff defeating her fellow American and former doubles partner in straight sets, 6-4, 7-5, to claim the title in 1 hour and 42 minutes.

It was the first time the friends had met in a WTA final.

During the trophy presentation, Gauff thanked Pegula for her support early on in her career.

“When I came on tour, you were one of the first people to be nice to me and welcome me with open arms,” Gauff said. “That really went a long way, so I appreciate you. It's great to finally play in the final against you, and I hope for many more. So, congratulations and thank you.”

The win marked Gauff's 11th career WTA singles title and her second of 2025, following her French Open victory. Of those titles, two are Grand Slams and three are WTA 1000s. She also owns 10 doubles titles, including one Grand Slam and four WTA 1000s.

She became the first player in history to go 9-0 in hard-court finals. All three of her career finals' losses have come on clay.

Here's how she got it done:

Winners, winners: Gauff hit 24 winners, 11 more than Pegula and two more than her unforced errors count. But it wasn't just the volume, but the timing that made these winners count, as the 21-year-old consistently delivered in the biggest moments, starting with the very first point.

The match began with a 15-shot rally, one Gauff finished with a forehand winner down the line. It was the first of six straight points as she raced out to a 3-0, then 4-1 lead.

Pegula responded with three consecutive games to level the set at 4-all, but Gauff held firm. A cross-court backhand for Gauff, winner helped her survive a tense service game to go up 5-4, allowing her to break Pegula the following game to take the set

In the second set, Pegula surged ahead 3-0, putting Gauff on the defensive. Facing a potential 4-0 deficit, Gauff dug in. She came to the net to finish an eight-shot rally with a smash winner, then reeled off three straight games to tie the set at 3-3.

Down 5-4 with Pegula serving for the set, Gauff broke again. After winning the first point of the game, she outlasted Pegula in a 12-shot rally, finishing with a backhand down the line to seal the penultimate break.

Gauff would capture her fourth break of the set in the final game, closing the match with her fourth straight game -- and one final forehand winner.

No sets dropped: With her straight sets win in the final, Gauff became the first player to win the Wuhan Open without dropping a set since the tournament's inception in 2014. She also lost just 25 games en route to the title -- the fewest by any champion in tournament history.

Her run began with a second-round win over Moyuka Uchijima, dropping just one game in 51 minutes. She needed only an hour to get past Zhang Shuai in the third round, then lost three games to Laura Siegemund in the quarterfinals.

The competition stiffened in the semifinals against Jasmine Paolini, who had beaten Gauff three times in 2025 and was fresh off a dominant win over Iga Swiatek. But Gauff dismissed the Italian in short order to reach the final.

Pegula, meanwhile, entered the match having played eight consecutive three-setters, winning seven and holding match points in all eight.

Gauff knew she couldn't let it go the distance.

“You're the three-set queen,” she said to Pegula during the ceremony. “So, I was determined not to let you get there today, because it felt like the odds would be in your favor in the third set.”

All the love for the support in China 🫶@CocoGauff | #WuhanOpen pic.twitter.com/WgOecbU4SM

What it means: Gauff leaves Wuhan with another title, as well as bragging rights over her friend -- even though she still trails Pegula 4-3 in their head-to-head.

By completing the sweep of China's two WTA 1000 tournaments, following her China Open title last year, Gauff becomes just the second player to win both events, joining Caroline Garcia, who accomplished the feat in 2017.

She remains No.3 in the PIF WTA Rankings, but widened the gap over her nearest competitor, Amanda Anisimova, to nearly 2,000 points. She also reclaimed the No. 3 spot in the Race, overtaking Anisimova.

Looking ahead, Gauff and Pegula will both have one more opportunity to capture a big title this season at the WTA Finals in Riyadh in November.

If Gauff wins, she'll not only defend her title from last year, but also end the season with at least one Grand Slam, one WTA 1000 singles title, one WTA 1000 doubles title and a win at the WTA Finals.

The No. 6 seed found her timing to build a 3-0 double break advantage. Even after the 21-year-old erased the deficit, Pegula regained the break with a terrific re-drop and consolidated for 5-3.With all of her previous Wuhan matches going the distance, one could have easily expected this to follow the pattern when Pegula served for the set. Gauff had other ideas.The 21-year-old went on a 10-point run, continuing to frustrate Pegula with a mix of high spins, slices and selective aggression. At 5-6, 30-30, Pegula knifed a superb backhand volley on her approach only to miss the open court on her forehand volley follow-up. She came in again facing match point and was passed by her countrywoman with a forehand to end the encounter.Gauff improved to 11-3 in tour-level singles finals. The Delray Beach, Fla. resident did not drop a set en route to picking up her third career WTA 1000 title.

After seven clean holds to start the second set, Vacherot made his move. Rinderknech saved the first break point he faced with an ace out wide, but after the Monegasque denied him a game point with a stella return, Vacherot produced the loudest winner of the night with a backhand down the line to turn the tide for 5-3. A hold at 15 sent the match into a decider.Rinderknech immediately fell behind 0-40, and on his third chance to strike, Vacherot curled a sublime backhand pass to seize the break. The 30-year-old avoided falling behind a double break in his next two service games, masterfully saving a combined seven break points.He couldn't make any dent on return, though, as Vacherot won his first 15 points at the line in the final set. At 3-5, Vacherot delivered a pair of blows to open 0-30 and secured the storybook ending on his second championship point with one final forehand winner. The two cousins shared a lengthy embrace, before Vacherot soaked up his winning moment.“Tried to be the guy on the other side of the net. Tried to put it on the side that it's my cousin, the guy that I've been training (and) growing up with. It was really tough,” Vacherot said.“He did a better job than me in the first set with cooperating with the pressure and everything, he played way better than me. Just found a way to turn that around and then make the match a little bit (about) myself at the end.”

Valentin Vacherot and Arthur Rinderknech's remarkable respective runs at the Rolex Shanghai Masters came to a fairytale close on Sunday, when Vacherot rallied to defeat his cousin and former college teammate 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 and capture his maiden tour-level title. In doing so, the Monegasque World No. 204 became the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 champion in history (since 1990).

“It is unreal what just happened. I have no idea what is happening right now. I am not even dreaming, it is just crazy,” Vacherot said. “I am just so happy with my performances the past two weeks. I just want to thank everyone who has helped with my career since the beginning. There has to be one loser but I think there is two winners today, one family that won. And I think for the sport of tennis, the story is unreal."

Competing in front of a packed Stadium Court at one of the biggest events on the ATP Tour, the setting for the final could not have been further removed from the pair's Texas A&M University days, where they played side by side in 2018.

Fast forward seven years and their paths have diverged. Rinderknech arrived in Shanghai with a career-high of No. 42 in the PIF ATP Rankings, with his best result a final run at the ATP 250 in Adelaide in 2022. He had never progressed beyond the third round at a Masters 1000 event until this week.

Vacherot's rise, however, proved even more improbable. The 26-year-old entered the tournament with just one tour-level win to his name, earned earlier this year in Monte-Carlo. He became the lowest-ranked finalist in Masters 1000 history (since 1990), and over the course of two unforgettable weeks, rewrote the trajectory of his career.

After battling through qualifying, the 26-year-old notched wins against Laslo Djere, Alexander Bublik, Tomas Machac, and Tallon Griekspoor to become the first player representing Monaco to reach a Masters 1000 quarter-final. He then stunned Holger Rune and four-time Shanghai champion Novak Djokovic to reach the title match.

In a compelling final, Vacherot once again showcased his resilience. He rallied from a set down for the sixth time this tournament, including qualifying, to become the first player representing Monaco to win a tour-level title in the Open Era. He is also just the third qualifier to win a Masters 1000 crown, joining Roberto Carretero (Hamburg 1996) and Albert Portas (Hamburg 2001).

“I feel when I am down, I have no choice and need to bring my A-game," Vacherot said on his impressive record of coming from behind. "In the first set I didn't do that and he was playing better than me. I took my first chance to break in the second set and from that the crowd got more involved and we put on more of a show in the second part of the match.”

From alternate to MASTERS 1000 CHAMPION 🏆

The Monegasque is the eighth first-time champion on Tour this season and just the fifth man in ATP Masters 1000 history to claim his maiden tour-level title at this level, following Jakub Mensik, who achieved the feat earlier this year in Miami.

Vacherot leaves Shanghai up 164 spots to No. 40 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is set to crack the Top 100 and Top 50 for the first time on Monday. He also takes $1,124,380 in prize money with him, having earned $594,077 for his whole career before this fortnight.

“I was just trying to beat the guy on the other side of the net,” Vacherot said on the dynamics of facing Rinderknech. “[I tried] to put on the side that it is my cousin and the guy I have been training with and growing up with. It was very tough and he did a better job than me in the first set, coping with the pressure. But I just found a way to turn it around.”



Throughout the fortnight, Rinderknech and Vacherot supported each other from the sidelines, cheering one another on and sharing words of encouragement both in person and through their family group chat.

Vacherot had a front-row seat for Rinderknech's standout run, which included wins against Top 20 opponents Alexander Zverev, Jiri Lehecka, Felix Auger-Aliassime, and Daniil Medvedev. On Sunday, he experienced first-hand just how tough his cousin can be to beat.

Rinderknech struck 12 winners and committed just two unforced errors in an impressive opening-set display. The 30-year-old took the ball early to rush Vacherot and gained the decisive break of the first set in the third game to lead in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash.

Vacherot responded in the second set. The 26-year-old kept Rinderknech deep behind the baseline, gaining the first strike in the exchanges to dictate the tempo. From 3-3 in the second set, Vacherot broke Rinderknech in consecutive games to lead by a break in the third set. From there, he continued to play aggressively, taking large cuts at the ball to dominate. He won 92 per cent of his first-serve points in the decider, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and hit just one unforced error in the third set to capture the biggest win of his life after two hours and 11 minutes.

Rinderknech is up 26 places to No. 28 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will rise to a career high on Monday. The 30-year-old recorded his 100th tour-level win in the semi-finals to become the ninth French Masters 1000 finalist in series history.

Did You Know?
Rinderknech's meeting with Vacherot was just the third all-unseeded Masters 1000 final in series history.

In 2018 the Texas A&M University men's tennis team suffered a heartbreaking 4-3 loss in the semi-finals of the NCAA Championships to Wake Forest University. Arthur Rinderknech played No. 2 singles for A&M while his cousin, Valentin Vacherot, competed at No. 4 singles. Their matches were side by side on that difficult day, which marked the end of Rinderknech's accomplished college tennis career.

Head coach Steve Denton, the two-time Australian Open finalist, still remembers what Rinderknech said to him in the aftermath of that loss.

“When Arthur left to go out to try to go play [professionally], I remember him saying to me, ‘Steve, make sure that you take care of my cousin like you took care of me'," Denton told ATPTour.com. “I said, ‘Absolutely, I'll do that'.” 

Denton has maintained his relationship with the cousins, who on Sunday will meet for ATP Masters 1000 glory in the final of the Rolex Shanghai Masters. They each defeated a former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings — Rinderknech ousted Daniil Medvedev and Vacherot beat Novak Djokovic — in the semi-finals.

“This is a dream come true for these two guys,” Denton said. “They've taken the road maybe not traveled as much, obviously, and unless you're a freak like a [Jannik] Sinner and [Carlos] Alcaraz, a lot of players have to go through all these things in order to get to where they are.”

The college coach has been waking up in the middle of the night to watch his former players playing in China. It has been a thrilling experience for Denton, who wanted to travel to Shanghai for the final. However, by the time the former Aggies reached the championship match, there were no flights that would arrive on time.

“I went to sleep last night and it was very improbable that Valentin Vacherot was going to beat Novak Djokovic,” Denton said. “Arthur has been playing really well, and he's very confident, but still, Medvedev is a former number one player in the world and for Arthur to be able to win that match and then get to play each other in the finals is just an amazing story.”

Denton traveled to France when Rinderknech was still a junior to watch three or four players and gauge his interest in them. After watching Arthur for two minutes, the former singles World No. 12 and doubles World No. 2 knew which player he wanted.

When Rinderknech first arrived on campus at Texas A&M, the Frenchman was unable to compete for a year because he was ineligible. The character he showed that year stuck with the longtime coach.

“He suffered watching the other guys play,” Denton said. “And I think that suffering that he went through really helped him in a lot of respects, molded him into being this selfless leader.”

It was all about the team for Rinderknech in an individual sport. Fast forward to Saturday when he lost the first set in the semi-finals against Medvedev. A career-best run was nearing an end against the 2019 Shanghai champion and in the moment, the 30-year-old was not fully focused on winning the match, but trying to help wear down Medvedev so he would be exhausted Sunday in the final against his cousin.

“That's the kind of kid he is. He's always been a team player for us,” Denton said. “He was a team player, and he kind of hung in there in that match thinking, ‘Well, if I can't win, maybe I can take Medvedev's legs away from him a little bit by staying out here and giving Val a better chance'. And they both think that way. They both have a lot of humility. They both are very team oriented and clearly even more so than that, they are family oriented.”

That is a big reason why Vacherot ended up playing at Texas A&M, even if Denton had no idea Rinderknech had a cousin — let alone such a good tennis player — early on. 

“After the first year and me having a good relationship with him and him loving it here, I think he thought, ‘Okay, this is a good spot for my cousin, I'm going to look out for him and I'm going to make sure he comes here',” Denton said. “And that's what happened.”

The pair overlapped for two seasons and helped take the programme to its greatest heights. Rinderknech was more confident and outgoing compared to Vacherot, who was “pretty reserved”. But both proved great leaders, just in their own style. It has been special to watch their dramatic breakthrough from afar.

“You tell young players and their families that you're going to take care of them and that you're going to help them to try to go play pro tennis,” Denton said. “And so by doing that, you have to continue to stay involved in their game. And I've been involved with their game from the beginning, and as long as they want me to help them, I'm happy to do it.” 

Although Denton will not be in Shanghai, he is eager to turn on the match in the early hours of Sunday morning in Texas to watch his Aggies battle in just the second ATP Masters 1000 final between former college tennis players in series history (since 1990). Mikael Pernfors (Georgia) beat Todd Martin (Northwestern) in the 1993 Canada final.

“There are lots of exciting stories about tennis, but this story, at this time, is I think as good as any this year,” Denton said. “And what I'm excited about is these two guys have basically told the rest of the world that college tennis is a definite pathway to the Tour.”

The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola paid tribute to Diane Keaton Sunday following news of the legendary actress' death.


	“Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful,” the filmmaker wrote of the actress who portrayed Kay Adams in the Godfather saga.

A post shared by Francis Ford Coppola (@francisfordcoppola)


	“From her earliest performances in ‘Hair' and throughout her amazing career, she was an extraordinary actor. I saw her in the film ‘Lovers and Other Strangers' and knew I had to have her play Kay in The Godfather, (which she told me she based on my wife Ellie) and her wonderful work in ‘Annie Hall' while simultaneously setting a new fashion trend. Everything about Diane was creativity personified.”

	“Some actors play emotions. Diane Keaton lived inside them,” the Academy — which awarded a Best Actress Oscar to Keaton for Annie Hall — wrote on social media. “Diane Keaton embodied the contradictions of being human: funny and fragile, bright and bruised, always achingly honest. For decades, she filled every frame with warmth, wit, and wonder. A Best Actress Oscar winner and four-time nominee, her presence shaped generations of storytelling. Her spirit will live forever on screen, and in the hearts of all who saw themselves in her.”

Who cares we want a real movie sequel not a re-make again and actually the next one would be part 10 because part 5 was just a copycat killer Freddy vs Jason wasn't a real Friday sequel the re-make either.

Bette Midler, Francis Ford Coppola, Kate Hudson, Steve Martin, Jane Fonda, Octavia Spencer and more stars are sharing their condolences for the Oscar-winning actress who died on Saturday.

	Hollywood is mourning the loss of Diane Keaton.


	The Oscar-winning actress — known for her roles in Annie Hall, the Godfather trilogy, Father of the Bride, Something's Gotta Give and The First Wives Club — died on Saturday in California at the age of 79. Her cause of death is not yet available.




	Following the news of her death, many of her former co-stars, industry figures and stars took to social media to share tributes.


	Robert De Niro shared a statement with The Hollywood Reporter, which reads: “I am very sad to hear of Diane's passing. I was very fond of her and the news of her leaving us has taken me totally by surprise. I was not expecting her to leave us. She will be missed. May she rest in peace.”

					Diane Keaton, Oscar-Winning Star of 'Annie Hall,' Dies at 79		
			









	Bette Midler, who starred alongside Keaton and Goldie Hawn in 1996's The First Wives Club, took to Instagram to write: “The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!”


	Additionally, Hawn's daughter and actress Kate Hudson shared a clip of three women in the film with the caption, “We love you so much Diane.”


	Francis Ford Coppola, Keaton's director on The Godfather films, posted a tribute on Instagram. “Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful. From her earliest performances in Hair and throughout her amazing career, she was an extraordinary actor,” he wrote. “I saw her in the film Lovers and Other Strangers and knew I had to have her play Kay in The Godfather, (which she told me she based on my wife Ellie) and her wonderful work in Annie Hall while simultaneously setting a new fashion trend. Everything about Diane was creativity personified.”

	











	Steve Martin, whom she starred alongside in 1991's Father of the Bride, shared a clip of a 2021 interview she did with Martin Short for Interview magazine, in which Short asks Keaton, “Who's sexier, me or Steve Martin?,” and Keaton replies, “I mean, you're both idiots.” Martin captioned the post: “Don't know who first posted this, but it sums up our delightful relationship with Diane.”


	Keaton's Book Club co-star Candice Bergen said in a statement to THR, “This is a huge loss both personally and for all of us. Diane was a true artist — tremendously gifted and uniquely talented in so many disciplines yet also modest and wonderfully eccentric. I will miss her terribly.” Mary Steenburgen also shared a statement with THR, which read, “Diane was magic. There was no one, nor will there ever be, anyone like her. I loved her and felt blessed to be her friend. My love to her family. What a wonder she was!!!”


	Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Keaton's nephew in Marvin's Room (where she earned one of her four Oscar noms), posted a tribute on his Instagram Stories. “Diane Keaton was one of a kind. Brilliant, funny, and unapologetically herself,” he wrote alongside a photo of himself and Keaton. “A legend, an icon, and a truly kind human being. I had the honor of working with her at 18. She will be deeply missed.”

I was so honored to call Diane Keaton a friend. She was an amazingly kind and creative person who also just happened to be a Hollywood legend. She has been taken from us far too soon. We will miss you, Diane. 💔

	Among the topics Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update took on were Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s latest unscientific comments and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem‘s odd attempt to blame Democrats for the government shutdown. 


	“Health secretary RFK Jr., seen here trying to cure cancer with his mind, said this week that men who were circumcised are more likely to be autistic,” co-anchor Colin Jost said of the proponent of vaccine misinformation, who has claimed that Tylenol is linked to autism. “—Which isn't surprising coming from a man who looks like he's made out of foreskin.”


	Jost then addressed how Noem is subjecting airline passengers in line at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints to a video of her insisting that the government shutdown, which is occurring under a GOP-controlled Senate, House and a Republican president, is actually all Democrats' fault.

	Jost then played a portion of the video—which turned out to be the first line of fictional serial killer Jigsaw's videotaped message to his tortured victims: “I want to play a game.”

	











	Weekend Update also addressed a recent development—of questionable legality—in the U.S. Treasury.


	That department, Michael Che announced, “is planning to release a silver dollar with President Trump's face on it. And then on the other side, he has Harriet Tubman in a head lock.”


	Tubman, the abolitionist and slave rescuer, would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said way back in 2016. But it's looking like that may not come about until at least 2030.

	











	Jost also called out Trump for proclaiming an end to Indigenous People's Day and labeling Christopher Columbus “original American hero.”

	“So while Trump is rounding up people with ICE, he is praising Columbus, a guy who literally brought boat loads of Hispanics to America,” Jost said.


	Weekend Update concluded with a joke off between Jost, Che, and former anchors Tina Fey, Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler, who was SNL‘s host Saturday.

The Oscar-winning star of ‘Annie Hall,' ‘Manhattan,' all three ‘Godfather' movies, ‘Reds' and ‘The First Wives Club' was a one-of-a-kind screen presence.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	There's a very funny scene in Ron Howard's frothy 1984 interspecies rom-com, Splash, in which Daryl Hannah, playing a mermaid in Manhattan who swaps her tail for legs, skips out to buy suitable land attire. Given that she emerged from the sea naked, she throws together an outfit from the Tom Hanks character's closet.


	The “fish out of water” turns up on a Bloomingdale's womenswear floor in a men's black suit, white shirt, black leather derbies and what looks like a school tie. The ensemble instantly brings a horrified saleslady scurrying over: “Oh my God, darling, darling, darling! That outfit is to die from! What happened, you saw Annie Hall a hundred times? That look is over.”

					Diane Keaton, Oscar-Winning Star of 'Annie Hall,' Dies at 79		
			









	That was seven years after the release of Annie Hall and the imprint on fashion and popular culture of Diane Keaton's iconic looks as the title character remained an instantly identifiable reference.


	Even more than Marlene Dietrich had done in white tie and tuxedo ensembles in the 1930s, Keaton in Annie Hall kickstarted a wave of genderless dressing with her men's shirts and wide ties, slouchy trousers and oversized jackets, button-up vests and fedoras.


	What made the layered wardrobe trend resonate — and continue to be seen on stylish women today — was how effortlessly cool it looked on Keaton. Her outfits were eccentric but unfussy, tomboyish but distinctly feminine. They made her character appear confident, even at her most insecure. And while the costumes mostly came from shopping expeditions to Ralph Lauren and other menswear emporiums, they were 100 percent reflective of Keaton's personal style off-camera.

	











	The misconception that comedy is easy — and that Keaton was essentially playing a version of herself — caused some quiet ripples of discontent when she beat out competition that included Anne Bancroft, Jane Fonda and Shirley MacLaine in dramatic roles to take home the best actress Oscar in 1977.


	But Keaton's justly honored performance in Annie Hall endures for reasons that go far beyond the synthesis of her on- and offscreen personas. She essentially reinvented the classic screwball heroine for a more socially evolved age. Annie might have come off to a casual observer as a kooky ditz, but she was clever, witty, talented, a sponge for knowledge and, eventually, an assertive voice for her own independence.


	She emerged with a wave of actresses in the 1970s and early ‘80s that defied traditional standards of silver-screen glamour by being utterly natural, among them Karen Allen, Brooke Adams, JoBeth Williams, Jill Clayburgh and Margot Kidder. And yet Keaton was very much an original, never part of any pack.


	The announcement of her unexpected death at 79, less than a month after Robert Redford's passing, represents another stinging loss to the pantheon of New Hollywood in the decades before the major studios largely stepped away from making movies for grownups.


	Irrespective of your views on the now-controversial figure of Woody Allen, the films he made with Keaton, both during and after their romantic involvement, remain among her most outstanding screen work — Annie Hall and Manhattan in particular.

	











	That's at least partly because while Keaton's characters might have been amused by the brainy verbosity and self-effacing neuroses of Allen's alter egos, she was never intimidated or outmatched by them. She challenged her writer-director and co-star in ways that few other women in his movies ever have.


	Keaton's innate radiance and verve made her born to play comedy, but she was no less gifted a dramatic actor. The women in Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather trilogy are generally submissive. But Keaton made Kay Adams-Corleone — an initially naïve outsider, favoring love over clarity as she agrees to marry Al Pacino's Michael Corleone — the moral tether to the outside world, beyond the vicious criminal enterprises of the Mafia dynasty. She stands up to Michael and walks away, as few others get to do.


	The same year Annie Hall was released, Keaton took on a risky role for a rising-star actress in Looking for Mr. Goodbar. In a fearless performance, she played Theresa Dunn, a dedicated schoolteacher whose repressive Catholic upbringing and history of childhood illness become fuel for her defiant sexuality. After feeling used and disrespected in her first experiences with men, Theresa throws herself into an increasingly dark spiral of sleazy pickup bars and hookups with strangers, ultimately with fatal results.


	With a lesser interpreter, the movie might have been just a sensationalistic shocker, but Keaton brought integrity and emotional candor to Theresa's messy search to define herself. That made it a rare example for its time of a character study that explored a modern woman's erotic desires without shame.

	











	Keaton was tough, impassioned and ultimately heartbreaking as feminist journalist and Russian Revolution sympathizer Louise Bryant, starring opposite writer-director (and offscreen partner at the time) Warren Beatty as Bohemian communist activist John Reed in his 1981 historical epic, Reds.


	But her crowning dramatic achievement came arguably the following year in Alan Parker's raw, unflinching depiction of marital breakdown Shoot the Moon, starring opposite Albert Finney. In an ecstatic New Yorker review, Pauline Kael described their characters as torn from inside the writer, director and the two stars. Faith Dunlop was a role that allowed Keaton to embrace both depression and steadfast self-possession, refusing to endure more pain from the man she married, even at the cost of great distress to their children.


	“Diane Keaton acts on a different plane from her previous film roles,” wrote Kael. “She brings the character a full measure of dread and awareness, and does it in a special, intuitive way that's right for screen acting. Nothing looks rehearsed, yet it's all fully created.”


	Aside from Paolo Sorrentino, who gave Keaton red meat to chew on as the formidable American nun and spiritual consigliere in the HBO series The Young Pope, it's disappointing that in the later years of her six-decade career, directors mostly stopped challenging Keaton.


	More often they leaned on her signature quirks and mannerisms, at times pushing her to the point of self-caricature. But Keaton could shine even in humdrum material and there are gems among the many cute comedies she could do with her hands tied behind her back.

	











	One such keeper is The First Wives Club, an effervescent feminist revenge comedy in which Keaton, Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler play women pushed aside for younger models who turn the tables on their philandering husbands. Another is the role that landed Keaton her fourth Oscar nomination, in Nancy Meyers' advanced-age romantic comedy, Something's Gotta Give. She stars as a whip-smart playwright who's much more than a foil to Jack Nicholson's smug playboy, who prides himself on dating only women under 30.


	With her sheer, undiminished magnetism alone, Keaton remained a feisty rebuke to that kind of ageism in Hollywood. Her vitality was unextinguishable. We are fortunate to have shared so much of her life.

Just weeks before her passing, Diane Keaton quietly listed her beloved Los Angeles home for sale — a place she had once called her “dream home.” The decision came as her health began to decline, marking a poignant final gesture from the Oscar-winning actress known for her authenticity, creativity, and timeless sense of style.

A post shared by Estate Media (@estatemediaofficial)

In March 2025, Keaton made a decision that surprised many: she listed her beloved Los Angeles home for sale, despite previously saying she planned to live there indefinitely. The move came during a period when her health had quietly begun to decline. Friends later shared that the decision reflected a sense of practicality and peace — a final act of letting go from the actress who had spent her life creating beauty in everything she touched.

The Brentwood estate, a five-bedroom, seven-bath residence, was listed for around $29 million. The home wasn't just another luxury property; it was the culmination of Keaton's lifelong passion for architecture, design, and restoration. Every wall, tile, and brick had her touch. Her choice to sell it shortly before her passing now feels like a meaningful chapter in her story — one that blended creativity, reflection, and grace.

Keaton purchased the home in 2017 and spent years transforming it into a warm, light-filled masterpiece. Inspired by her love of craftsmanship and her childhood fascination with brick homes, she designed it to feel timeless and grounded. She often said she admired the durability and character of brick — something that reflected her own spirit.

Her approach to design was hands-on and visionary. She didn't just decorate; she rebuilt. Every project she took on blended her artistic instincts with her sharp eye for storytelling. The home became a symbol of her creativity, serving as both sanctuary and expression.

Keaton even chronicled her design philosophy in her book “The House That Pinterest Built,” where she celebrated her love for curated spaces and bold, personal aesthetics. The Brentwood property perfectly embodied that vision — rustic yet refined, personal yet inviting. It was her dream home in every sense, filled with character and the comfort of a life well-lived.

As her health declined, Keaton began stepping back from public life. Those who lived nearby noticed her quiet absence from daily walks with her dog, Reggie, around the neighborhood. Listing her home seemed to mark a subtle farewell — a sign she was preparing for change with her usual sense of dignity and calm.

A post shared by Interiors Collective (@the_interiorscollective)

For a woman who built her legacy on authenticity, the sale wasn't about money or status. It was about simplicity and closure. In her final months, Keaton showed the same grace she carried throughout her career — whether starring in “Annie Hall,” “Father of the Bride,” or “Something's Gotta Give.” The decision to sell her dream home was more than a real estate move; it was a final act of reflection from a woman who always knew how to turn life into art.
