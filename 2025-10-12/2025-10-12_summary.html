Vice-president calls crime ‘out of control' in US cities as Trump faces legal battles for use of federal forces

The White House is talking about invoking the Insurrection Act that would allow the deployment of military troops on US soil to quell domestic unrest amid legal challenges over the moves, JD Vance confirmed on Sunday.

Vance was asked on NBC News's Meet the Press whether Donald Trump was seriously considering invoking the emergency power to deploy national guard forces and even the US military in domestic settings.

“The president's looking at all of his options,” he said, adding that “we are talking about this because crime has gotten out of control in our cities”.

Trump's attempts to use federal national guard forces in Democratic-run cities has faced challenges in the courts, most notably in Chicago in recent days.

The vice-president's ominous remarks came days after Trump referred to the Insurrection Act from the Oval Office, bluntly stating: “If I had to enact it, I would do that.” Military forces are forbidden from engaging in law enforcement duties on home soil.

But under the Insurrection Act, which was signed in 1807, the president can deploy them domestically in cases of insurrection or rebellion, violence that is preventing the functioning of federal laws.

The power was used during the 1960s civil rights movement during clashes over desegregation of the south but since then has been very rarely activated. The last time a president called on it was in 1992 when the governor of California requested military aid from George HW Bush in response to civil unrest in Los Angeles.

In Sunday's Meet the Press interview, Vance said Trump “hasn't felt he needed to” invoke the Insurrection Act up to this point. But he confirmed that it was among the tactics being considered as the administration continues to be stymied in federal courts from deploying federalised national guard forces in Democratic-run cities.

Federal courts have blocked the White House from using troops in Oregon and Illinois. On Thursday a federal judge prohibited the deployment of federalised national guard personnel in Chicago, admonishing the administration that she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois”.

National guard troops have been sent into Illinois by the Trump administration from both Texas and California but under the temporary court order cannot be put out into the streets.

Vance told NBC News that options such as the Insurrection Act were being considered because “there are places in Chicago where people are afraid to take their children … for fear of gun violence, for fear of gang drive-by shootings”.

In a separate interview with This Week on ABC News, Vance said that Chicago had been given over to “lawlessness and gangs” and had a murder rate “that rivals the worst places in the third world”.

In fact, violent crime has been falling at unprecedented rates in America's biggest cities including Chicago over the past two years. Chicago is not in the top four large US cities with the highest murder rates – all of whom are in states controlled by Republicans.

As Vance did the rounds of Sunday's political talkshows, tension between the Trump administration and the Democratic states it is targeting exploded across TV screens. The vice-president was repeatedly asked by George Stephanopoulos on ABC News whether the Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, had committed a crime that could see him being prosecuted by the Department of Justice as have several other of Trump's “political enemies”.

Vance skirted the question until he was pressed into saying: “He should suffer consequences. Whether he has violated a crime I would leave to the courts, but he has certainly violated his oath of office and that seems pretty criminal to me.”

Pritzker responded to the veiled threat by accusing Vance of coming out with a “tidal wave of lies”. The governor told This Week that he was not intimidated by the prospect of prosecution as has befallen the former FBI director James Comey and the New York attorney general Letitia James, who have both been indicted in recent days.

Pritzker said: “I am not afraid. Do I think he could do it? He might. But as I have said before, come and get me. I mean, you're dead wrong, Mr President and Mr Vice-President, and I will stand up for the law and the constitution.”

Raw emotions were widely on display across the TV studios as the federal government shutdown entered day 12. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, told Fox News Sunday that the crisis had been orchestrated by Democratic leaders in Congress as a partisan move “so that they can prove to their Marxist base that they are willing to fight Trump”.

He said that after eight attempts to reopen the government had all failed in votes in the Senate, the shutdown was causing “real pain for real people – and the Democrats don't seem to care”.

On the same program, the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, denied that the Democratic stance was partisan. “We will sit down with anyone, any time, any place, go back to the White House, to have a bipartisan discussion about reopening the government,” he said.

The Democrats' aim, Jeffries added, was to “improve the quality of life of the American people and address the healthcare crisis that threatens tens of millions of people across the country”.

The potential supply of U.S. Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine has raised "extreme concern" in the Kremlin, which warned that the war has reached a "very dramatic moment" with tensions escalating from all sides.

"The topic of Tomahawks is of extreme concern," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said and added that "Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides."

U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the matter on Oct. 6, saying he would need to know Ukraine's intended use for the missiles before agreeing to provide them, as he does not wish to escalate the war. He did indicate, however, that he had "sort of made a decision" on the issue.

The Tomahawk is a subsonic, long-range cruise missile designed for precision strikes. With a range of 1,600 to 2,500 kilometers (995 to 1,550 miles), it would allow Kyiv to reach targets as far as Siberia.

Meanwhile Peskov highlighted what he called the grave implications of this range, noting that some older versions of the missile are nuclear-capable, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service.

"Just imagine: a long-range missile is launched and is flying and we know that it could be nuclear. What should the Russian Federation think? Just how should Russia react? Military experts overseas should understand this," Peskov said. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin previously warned that providing these missiles would be a "qualitatively new stage of escalation," claiming they cannot be used without the direct involvement of U.S. military personnel.

The escalating confrontation is the deadliest in Europe since World War Two, with Russian officials viewing it as a "hot" conflict with the West. The war is framed by Putin as a pivotal point stemming from what he describes as the West's post-1991 humiliation of Russia, while Ukraine and its allies condemn it as an act of imperial-style land seizure.

"The topic of Tomahawks is of extreme concern," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Oct. 12. "Just imagine: a long-range missile is launched and is flying and we know that it could be nuclear."



Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine's railway infrastructure as autumn sets in, resulting in increasing train delays and cancellations.

The two leaders discussed air defense support and long-range strikes, as Russia ramps up its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

"Not only is this an attempted theft of a peaceful Ukrainian nuclear facility. Unauthorized actions of Russia's (state nuclear energy corporation) Rosatom violate internationally recognized nuclear safety protocols, contradict Ukrainian license, and directly threaten a nuclear incident," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said.

A second vessel of the same class is expected to be delivered by the end of 2025, with crew training already underway, said Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa.  

Ukrainian forces downed 103 out of the 118 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. A missile and 15 drones struck 10 different locations, according to the statement.

Ukrainian troops have liberated the village of Mali Shcherbaky in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine's 24th Separate Assault Battalion "Aidar" announced on Oct. 12, releasing footage purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers in the settlement.

 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur breaks down renewed U.S. discussions about supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles — and Russia's reaction.



In a renewed effort to disrupt Ukraine's energy grid ahead of winter, Russia carried out several large-scale missile and drone strikes on energy and gas facilities this week.

Sources told the Financial Times that the U.S. is involved at every stage of operational planning, although Kyiv retains control over target selection, with Washington advising on target vulnerabilities.

The number includes 1,240 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

The Atesh partisan group sabotaged railway infrastructure in Russia's Rostov Oblast, disrupting Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on Oct. 12.

Russian independent media outlet Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC Russian service, has confirmed the identities of 135,100 Russian military personnel killed in Ukraine.

MOSCOW, October 12. /TASS/. European leaders are ready for reckless actions because they don't believe that Russia may use nuclear weapons, Ukraine's former Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov told TASS.

"Based on their possibilities - and they do have them, they want to ensure their superiority over Russia in terms of conventional arms and unleash a conflict. They make no secret of this and speak about 2027 or 2030 as the latest," he said.

"They [European politicians] don't think that this is a reckless step. They think that Russia will never venture to use nuclear weapons. They really believe that Russia will not use its nuclear arms," he said, adding that "this is what their strategy of building up arsenals of conventional weapons is based on."

According to Azarov, Europe needs to be reassured that "Russia has the right to deliver a preemptive strike defending itself or respond as it should in such a situation."

He noted that changes in Europe are inevitable, with "more realistic politicians coming to power." In his words, politicians should not play believe-it-or-not games but make decisions based on realities. "And the realities are that Russia has nowhere to retreat: if the European Union attacks it, I think, the Russian leadership will use every opportunity to inflict a defeat on the one who attacked it," he underscored.

Live Updates


            • The 20 hostages held in Gaza thought to be alive are expected to be released early Monday morning local time before being transferred to the Red Cross, an Israeli government spokesperson said today. Nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel will also be freed.
    


            • US President Donald Trump will depart for the Middle East today ahead of a speech at Israel's parliament on Monday and meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as the families of the hostages. Leaders from more than 20 countries will then join Trump in Egypt for a summit on Gaza's future.
    


• Aid trucks are expected to enter southern Gaza today, according to Egyptian state-affiliated media. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have returned home to find only ruins as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas enters a third day.
    


            Palestinian Authority Vice President Hussein Al-Sheikh said on Sunday he met former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to discuss their future vision for Gaza.
    


                    “I met today with Mr. Tony Blair to discuss the day after and ways to support President (Donald) Trump's efforts aimed at ending the war and establishing lasting peace in the region,” Al-Sheikh posted on X.






            In the meeting, Al-Sheikh and Blair affirmed their “readiness” to work with Trump and other parties to “solidify the ceasefire, allow the entry of humanitarian aid, release hostages and prisoners, and move toward recovery and reconstruction,” the post said.
    


            Blair, who led his country into the war in Iraq, has recently returned to the limelight given his prospective involvement in an authority tasked with the reconstruction of Gaza.
    


            The Palestinian Prisoners Media Office said Sunday that “complex obstacles” are currently preventing the announcement of the full list of prisoners to be released under the ceasefire agreement.
    


                    “Complex obstacles still prevent the official announcement of the lists of released prisoners as part of the exchange deal, including prisoners from Gaza,” the office said. “We also affirm that efforts are being made around the clock to overcome these obstacles and complete the necessary procedures,” the office said.
                





            All details related to the deal “will be announced as soon as the negotiations are concluded and the final lists up to the last name are approved,” the office added.
    


Remember: Under the ceasefire agreement, Israel must free 250 Palestinian prisoners who hold life sentences, as well as 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza detained after October 7, 2023.
    


            As Israel prepares for the arrival of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, the country's hospitals are also making sure they are well-equipped to handle any medical needs that may arise once they arrive home.
    


            Dr Eli Sprecher, the CEO of Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital, showed CNN's Wolf Blitzer around his medical center today and said that his staff were “all very much looking forward to that truly historical moment.”
    


            Some 24 hostages who were previously freed from Gaza have been treated at the hospital, Sprecher said. Medical teams are preparing for the latest hostage release based off their past experience.
    


            The first issue that will need to be dealt with is likely going to be malnutrition, which “can affect almost any organ in the body, any tissue in the body, the heart, the brain, the kidneys, et cetera,” Sprecher said.
    


            The hostages could also face orthopedic problems from being kept underground in tunnels for so long, as well as psychological difficulties from two years of captivity, he added.
    


            Dr Inbal Reuveni, the vice chair of the hospital's psychiatry department, said that the center is making sure that the hostages returning are given a “safe space” to reunite with their families in.
    


            Sprecher said that the hospital is trying to recreate a “home-like atmosphere” for those admitted tomorrow. Hospital rooms will have two beds in them so the hostages can sleep with a family member nearby and a playground has been set up for the hostages who have children, he said.
    


            US Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza will be released soon.
    


            Earlier, a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office, said hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees set to be released Monday will be driven into Gaza once the hostages held in the enclave cross back into Israel,
    


            “The President of the United States is planning to travel to the Middle East to greet the hostages,” Vance told NBC's “Meet the Press.”
    


            Asked if he considered the ceasefire agreement and the release of the remaining hostages to be the end of the war in Gaza, Vance said the administration is still going to have a lot of work to do to ensure it “stays ended.”
    


                    “The reason why we're at this moment … is because the president of the United States. He gave unusual authorities to people who had never been in diplomacy before, he actually broke the mold,” Vance said. “Instead of doing diplomacy the same old way that it had failed for the past 30 or 40 years. He gave Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner a remarkable amount of authority to go and get a peace deal done.”
                





            Vance said the US is not planning to put troops on the ground in Israel or Gaza to ensure the deal is followed through.
    


            “He is not planning to put boots on the ground in Gaza or Israel,” Vance said. “We have central command troops that are already there that are going to monitor this peace proposal.”
    


CNN's Catherine Nicholls contributed to this report. 



            As we reported earlier, US President Donald Trump will address Israel's Knesset after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as the families of the Israeli hostages.
    


            Israel's Knesset committee chair has said today “we're all eagerly waiting” to thank Trump during tomorrow's visit “for everything he's done,” according to a spokesperson.
    


                    “We're all eagerly waiting to thank the president for everything he's done, doing and will do for us. He is the best friend of the state of Israel, always standing by our side, also in the difficult moments, and tomorrow we shall all thank him,” Ofir Katz said.
                





            On Sunday, the Knesset committee also approved a “special session” to honor Trump, which will take place tomorrow, the spokesperson said.
    


Remember: Trump will then travel to Egypt, where he is due to co-chair a summit on Gaza alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
    


            The bodies of at least 117 Palestinians have been recovered in Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the enclave, with another seven people dying in the same time period.
    


            This means that at least 67,806 people have been killed in Gaza during the last two years of war, with 170,066 reported injuries, according to the health ministry.
    


            The current ceasefire has allowed the recovery of people previously buried under the debris of destroyed buildings and infrastructure throughout the Gaza Strip.
    


            A spokesperson for Gaza's Civil Defense told CNN yesterday that approximately 10,000 Palestinians are believed to have been buried under rubble across Gaza since October 7, 2023.
    


            We heard earlier from a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office on how they expect Monday's final exchange of hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners and detainees to take place.
    


            Here's a round-up from Shosh Bedrosian's news conference:
    


            Ruby Chen can only hope for a miracle.
    


            His 19-year-old son Itay Chen, a soldier with the Israel Defense Forces, was initially believed to have been taken hostage during the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel, but was later declared dead by the IDF.
    


            Despite this, his father speaks of sustaining hope in the absence of “physical evidence” as he grapples with the reality of losing his middle son, who he described as the “connector of the family.”
    


            “It's like a suspended situation,” he told CNN's Becky Anderson earlier today, while speaking from Netanya, Israel.
    


                    “The knowledge of the IDF that indeed he was killed, we do not have that physical evidence. That's missing. That leaves some sort of doubt that hopefully, even tomorrow, there might be some sort of surprise for us. A miracle.”
                





            When asked about Monday's anticipated release of the 48 remaining hostages – 20 of whom are thought to still be alive – Chen reported “a mixed bag of emotions,” noting uncertainty for the relatives of the 28 who are thought to be deceased or whose status is unknown.
    


                    “On one hand, excitement for those that will be able to hug their loved ones. Anticipation that finally this chapter of the people of Israel that began two years ago will finally come to an end,” he said.
                





            On the other hand, he added, there's “the anxiety that some of the 28 families will not be reunited with their loved ones and will be still stuck in this chapter.”
    


            As thousands of displaced Palestinians make their way back north to Gaza City, many are returning to scenes beyond their imagination.
    


            Eighty-year-old Jawad Mahmoud Ajjour told CNN that he had witnessed mass Palestinian displacement and war in 1956 and 1967, but that he had “never seen that level of destruction” until today.
    


            Another Gaza City resident, Um Abdullah, showed CNN video of the destroyed nursery that her sister helped to build – and then ran for 20 years.
    


            “She taught generations, and those who were taught here sent their kinds too to be taught here in the same nursery. Some grew up to become journalists, doctors; she raised many generations,” Um Abdullah said of her sister.
    


            The United Nations said in August that more than 90% of Gaza's schools have been either destroyed or severely damaged, with 518 out of 564 school buildings needing either full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again.
    


            Younis Ahmed Mahmoud, a resident of Gaza City's Al-Shati Camp, said he did not recognize his neighborhood.
    


                    “I got lost in the street… I struggled to reach my house… it looked like an earthquake hit the area,” he said.
                





            Hundreds of thousands of people left Gaza City since the Israeli military began its ground offensive in August that flattened vast swaths of the city.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) earlier this month estimated that around 900,000 of the city's 1 million residents had left, figures that CNN is unable to verify.
    


            The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said last week that over 200,000 people had remained in Gaza City.
    


            Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian now turns to the subject of the hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees set to be released tomorrow under the Gaza ceasefire agreement.
    


            She says they will be driven out of Israel once the hostages held in the enclave cross back into the country.
    


                    “The Palestinian prisoners will be released once Israel has confirmation that all of our hostages set to be released tomorrow are (across) the border into Israel,” she adds.
                





            The prisoners will likely already be on the buses that will take them out of Israel on Monday, awaiting confirmation of the hostage release. The buses will set off once the transfer has been verified, Bedrosian said.
    


                    “Once the confirmation comes through (that) they (the hostages) have crossed into Israeli territory, those buses will start and they (the Palestinian prisoners) will begin their journey,” Bedrosian adds.
                





            More now from Israel's Prime Minister's spokesperson, Shosh Bedrosian, who has just said if Hamas is unable to find the bodies of some of the hostages held in Gaza, an international committee will help locate them.
    


            Three Israeli sources told CNN earlier this week that Israel assesses the militant group may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.
    


            “An international body, which was agreed on in this (ceasefire) plan, will help locate the hostages if they are not found and released tomorrow,” Bedrosian adds.
    


                    “The Prime Minister (Benjamin Netanyahu) insists that we will act to locate all of these hostages as soon as possible, and we will do that as a sacred duty of communal responsibility,” she added. “All 48 of our hostages will be returning back to Israel, whether they are alive or deceased,” the spokesperson said.
                





            No Hamas propaganda will be displayed during the release of the hostages being held in Gaza tomorrow, Shosh Bedrosian now says.
    


            In previous hostage releases, Hamas has staged macabre ceremonies before transferring the people they kidnapped over to the Red Cross - both living and deceased.
    


            This time round, the 20 living hostages held in Gaza will be “released together at one time to the Red Cross and transported among six to eight vehicles without any sick displays by Hamas, the terror organization,” Bedrosian adds.
    


            The hostages who have been held in Gaza will be released early on Monday morning, a spokesperson for Israel's Prime Minister's Office has just said.
    


            The 20 living hostages will all be released at the same time, Shosh Bedrosian added, and will be transferred to the custody of the Red Cross before eventually being driven to Israel.
    


            Iran will not be sending a delegation to the upcoming summit in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh despite receiving an invitation, the state-affiliated Tasnim news agency reported, citing an unnamed source.
    


            US President Donald Trump is arriving in the city on Monday to chair the event in celebration of the signing of the first phase of an agreement to end the war in Gaza.
    


            A regional diplomat familiar with the matter also told CNN that Iran had received a formal invitation to attend the summit.
    


            At least 20 countries are expected to attend the ceremony, the Egyptian Presidency said without clarifying which nations have been invited.
    


            Among the confirmed attendees are France, Britain, Jordan and Germany.
    


            Israel is waiting to receive the 48 remaining hostages held in Gaza, who are expected to be freed Monday morning, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they are “prepared and ready” for their imminent arrival home.
    


            US President Donald Trump is expected to address Israel's parliament on Monday during his visit to the country.
    


Here's the latest: 



            We can bring you some footage now from Gaza City, obtained by the Reuters news agency. It shows markets bustling as crowds gathered today in the streets to browse stalls and buy essential goods.
    


            One Palestinian man, Wissam Joudeh, said the busy markets were a sign “life is returning” to the embattled enclave, after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire came into effect on Friday.
    


            Another Palestinian resident, Ahmed Hamadeh, said safety and security had returned due to the ceasefire. “Despite the destruction and everything we went through, thank God once the truce was announced, life returned to normalcy,” he said.
    


            The ceasefire in Gaza agreed upon by Israel and Hamas has “given a spark of hope in the Holy Land,” Pope Leo XIV said today, speaking after a mass in St Peter's Square.
    


            Since his papacy began in May, the American pontiff has been robust in his criticism of Israel's war in Gaza, consistently voicing his concern for Palestinian civilians that faced Israeli bombardment.
    


            Today, Leo said that he encourages those involved in the conflict to “courageously continue on the path towards a just and lasting peace that respects the legitimate aspirations of the Israeli and Palestinian people.”
    


                    “Two years of conflict have left death and rubble everywhere, especially in the hearts of those who have brutally lost their children, parents, friends, everything,” he said.
                





            The pontiff also called for those in the region to “rediscover that the other is not an enemy, but a brother to look at, forgive, (and) offer the hope of reconciliation.”
    


            Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza is being prepared to receive hundreds of prisoners and detainees that Israel is set to release early next week, the Palestinian health ministry says.
    


                    “We are preparing Nasser Hospital to receive 1,900 detainees that the occupation will release tomorrow, in addition to receiving a large number of bodies,” the ministry's Director-General Dr. Munir Al-Bursh wrote on X.
                





            Most of the detainees due to be released are suffering from diseases and will require urgent medical attention, he said.
    


            Earlier this week, the Israeli justice ministry published the names of 250 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails and set for release as part of a ceasefire agreement that will first see Hamas free the remaining hostages it holds.
    


            Israel is also due to release around 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza, detained after the October 7 attacks.
    


            Al-Bursh also called on the international community to “open the crossings and bring in medical supplies and equipment” in his statement.
    


            As part of the ceasefire deal, Israel has agreed to the daily entry of 600 humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza, operated by the UN and other donors.
    


            Israel is “prepared and ready for the immediate reception of all our hostages,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has just said.
    


            Netanyahu spoke with Hostage and Missing Persons Coordinator Gal Hirsch today.
    


            A total of 48 hostages are expected to be released as part of this week's ceasefire agreement.
    


            Of those captured on October 7, 2023, 20 are presumed alive and 25 are believed to be dead, with the status of two others uncertain.
    


            There is one additional hostage whose body was held in Gaza before the October 7 attacks. He is an IDF soldier who was killed in 2014.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has released an itinerary ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the country tomorrow.
    


            Their timings show the US president will meet with Netanyahu in his office at the Knesset at 10.15 a.m. local time (3.15 a.m. ET).
    


            Later that hour, at 10.45 a.m. (3.45 a.m. ET), also at the Knesset, Trump is due to meet with families of the hostages.
    


            Trump is then set to deliver a speech to the Knesset during a plenary session, at 11 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET). Netanyahu, the Speaker of the Knesset, and Israel's opposition leader are also expected to give speeches during this session, the Israeli statement said.
    


            Trump will depart Israel at 1 p.m. local time (6 a.m. ET), Netanyahu's office said.
    


            This itinerary largely aligns with Trump's official schedule of the visit, which was released overnight.
    


            Trump will then travel to Egypt, where he is due to co-chair a summit on Gaza alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. According to the US President's schedule, he is set to land in Egypt at 1.45 p.m. local time (6.45 a.m. ET).

María Corina Machado's Nobel award puts focus on country but analysts doubt it will produce democratic change

In March 2019 as a nationwide blackout plunged Venezuela into darkness, hundreds of citizens huddled on a basketball court in the city of Maracaibo to hear their leader promise to guide them out of the gloom.

“We are, quite literally, living through our darkest hour. But these are also the brightest of times,” María Corina Machado told supporters as they used mobile phones to illuminate the night.

Six and a half years later, on Friday Machado used almost identical words to celebrate winning the Nobel peace prize for her “extraordinary” – yet incomplete – struggle against Venezuela's “brutal, authoritarian state” under the president, Nicolás Maduro.

“We are … living the darkest hours. But at the same time there is enormous hope,” Machado declared after hearing the news, before vowing: “Venezuela will be free.”

For all Machado's relentless optimism, one question lingered after Friday's surprise announcement in Oslo: this time, was she right? Would receiving the prestigious prize advance Machado's tenacious campaign to unseat Maduro, or could it backfire and lead to greater repression from the autocrat's feared security forces?

International supporters voiced confidence that political change was coming for a country that has slipped into authoritarianism and economic malfunction since Maduro succeeded Hugo Chávez in 2013, with about 8 million citizens fleeing abroad. “The thirst for democracy always prevails,” wrote the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.

Carlos Lizarralde, the author of a book about Venezuela's collapse, said the prize would boost Machado by “cementing her position in the eyes of the international community … as the one credible opposition leader” in the South American country.

“A Nobel laureate, in many ways, is the secular equivalent of a living saint. This perfectly complements her quasi-religious public image,” Lizarralde said of Machado, a devout Catholic who before going into hiding after last year's rigged presidential election attended rallies clutching a rosary and wearing crosses around her neck.

Others are more sceptical. David Smilde, a Tulane University Venezuela expert, said the prize would “definitely draw more international attention to the Venezuelan conflict and perhaps [create] more resolve” to end it.

“But judging by past Nobel winners, it will not be fundamental,” Smilde added, noting how the 1994 prize shared by Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin did not fundamentally reconfigure the interests and forces involved in the Middle East conflict.

Ronald Krebs, a political scientist who has studied the impact of Nobel peace prizes awarded in the hope of promoting political change in authoritarian countries, said his research showed they rarely succeeded.

Krebs cited Liu Xiaobo, the Chinese poet and activist who received the prize in 2010 while in prison – a decision Beijing called an “anti-China farce”. Liu died seven years later, still in custody and with his homeland having become an even more repressive one-party state under its Communist party leader, Xi Jinping.

In 2003, the Iranian activist Shirin Ebadi was honoured for her struggle for democracy and human rights. Krebs said becoming a laureate “insulated” Ebadi from persecution since Tehran feared jailing such a high-profile figure. “But it did absolutely nothing for those who were not similarly protected … if anything they were further repressed because of the Nobel peace prize,” he said.

Krebs said peace prizes could inspire human rights defenders “to come forward with greater vigour”. “[But] at the same time it gives the repressive regime even more incentive to repress those who would seek to effect change. [So] it creates a really problematic and worrisome dynamic that … ultimately works to the detriment of those who are advocating for domestic political change … The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”

Allies hope Machado's prize will “bulletproof” her against regime reprisals. But Krebs said it was “extraordinarily doubtful” it would produce democratic change.

Andrés Izarra, a former minister for Maduro's mentor Chávez, was also doubtful, although he said Venezuela's authoritarian president was facing the greatest challenge of his 12-year reign.

Internationally isolated after being accused of stealing last year's election from Machado's ally Edmundo González, Maduro is also facing an unprecedented US pressure campaign that many suspect is aimed at forcing regime change.

Since August, Donald Trump has ordered a major naval buildup off Venezuela's Caribbean coast, with a series of deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug smuggling boats. “There's never been a clearer chance of displacing [Maduro] from power than now,” Izarra said.

But the ex-minister dismissed the idea that Trump's pressure campaign would “break” Maduro's regime by sparking a military revolt. Izarra also doubted Trump would invade. “What you have in the Caribbean is a regime change operation … but it's a performative one,” he said, designed to coerce Maduro into making concessions during secret talks Izarra believes are happening between US and Venezuelan officials.

“This is all going to resolve itself at the negotiating table,” Izarra predicted. Maduro and his allies were “never going to surrender power voluntarily” but equally Trump would never alienate his anti-intervention Maga movement by putting boots on the ground. “They don't want forever wars. They don't want Vietnam. They don't want Iraq,” Izarra said.

Perhaps the only certainty is that Machado, a famously stubborn Margaret Thatcher-admiring conservative known as Venezuela's “Iron Lady”, is unlikely to turn.

“She's a true fighter,” said Lizarralde, predicting Machado would battle on. “In her mind, this is an epic struggle between good and evil … and she [is convinced she] represents good.”

            Hamas is reasserting control of parts of Gaza not occupied by Israeli forces as the ceasefire takes hold – amid continuing uncertainty about security in the territory if the group is disarmed.
    


            Hamas' internal security forces were pictured on the streets of Gaza City on Saturday, and there have been multiple reports of clashes between the group and clans opposing it in recent days.
    


            “A number of collaborators and informants were apprehended and arrested in Gaza City, after it was proven that they were involved in spying for the enemy,” as well as “participating in the assassination of several resistance members,” the Palestinian Home Front, a Telegram channel affiliated with Hamas, said Sunday.
    


            “The security services and the resistance are conducting a wide-scale field campaign across all areas of the Gaza Strip, from north to south, to locate and arrest collaborators and informants,” it said.
    


            A video distributed by Hamas-affiliated Telegram channels on Saturday showed an alleged collaborator being beaten in an unknown location.
    


            Other social media videos showed armed and masked Hamas personnel walking through a street market in Gaza City, and the Hamas-run interior ministry shared images of officers with rifles and baseball caps that read “police” in Gaza City interacting with locals.
    


            Hamas has long held an iron grip over Gaza that continued even into the war. CNN has reported on Hamas executing and maiming alleged looters, a sign of the group's continuing power despite being weakened by Israel.
    


            The Hamas-controlled interior ministry has declared a week-long amnesty to begin Monday for members of criminal gangs “not involved in bloodshed or killings.”
    


            But Hamas' control of Gaza has been challenged by several clans in recent months, especially in the south. Some of those groups have received protection from the Israeli military.
    


            Social media channels affiliated with Hamas reported clashes in the Sabra area of Gaza City between a prominent family and security forces during which Muhammad Imad Aql, the son of a senior Hamas military commander, was killed.
    


            Hamas forces surrounded the Dughmush family's neighborhood on Friday night. Sources told CNN that several members of the family had been killed, and a large number of masked, armed men had been deployed around the Jordanian hospital in Gaza City.
    


            CNN was told Sunday that clashes continued in the area.
    


            In southern Gaza, a group opposed to Hamas known as the Popular Forces has refused to lay down its arms.
    


The group has been involved in escorting aid shipments and has publicly challenged Hamas, which in turn has said it will confront what it called a criminal gang.
    


            One of its commanders, Hussam al-Astal, posted on Facebook Saturday: “To all the Hamas rats, your tunnels are destroyed, your rights no longer exist. Repent before it's too late – there is no Hamas from today onward.”
    


            “We are trying to be an alternative to Hamas,” al-Astal told Israeli network Channel 12. “They commit to psychological warfare… and they will use all their power to prove that there is no other option in the strip but them.”
    


            However, Popular Forces members are thought to have relocated behind what is known as the ‘yellow line' inside southern Gaza, where Israeli forces are still present.
    


            It is unclear how security and policing will work in Gaza in weeks and months to come.
    


            Israel has long demanded that Hamas disarm but the group has resisted this.
    


            US President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan, published last week, says that “Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty.”
    


            It also says there will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza “under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning.”
    


            In the place of Hamas, according to the Trump plan, an International Stabilization Force (ISF) will immediately deploy to Gaza and “will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces.”
    


            But critical details of the security force and a planned international oversight mechanism have yet to be worked out beyond the vague bullet points of the initial plan.
    


            In the complex reality of Gaza's current situation, such a force could take months or longer to establish, especially amid a humanitarian crisis and massive damage to buildings and other infrastructure.
    


            “Deployment (of the ISF) in the required numbers will have to occur over some time, and will be a major logistical challenge,” according to London-based think tank Chatham House.
    


            “Issues of coordination, direction and control of an untested multinational venture of the scale required will also be formidable,” it said last week.
    


            Casualties among Gaza's police force during the two-year conflict have contributed to a deterioration in security, with looting of aid becoming commonplace.
    


            Jordan and Egypt are expected to take the leading role in training and supervising the new police force. But it's unclear when that force will begin to patrol the streets of Gaza, and whether Hamas' internal security forces will disappear when it does.

China signalled on Sunday that it would not back down in the face of a 100 per cent tariff threat from U.S. President Donald Trump and urged the United States to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats. Trump responded by taking a less confrontational approach without retreating from his demands, while his vice president seemed to warn Beijing not to react aggressively.

“China's stance is consistent,” the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online. “We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one.”

It was China's first official comment on Trump's threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products.

Hours later, Trump used his Truth Social platform to send a message to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

“Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!” the Republican president wrote. “Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn't want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”

Trump may have had an eye toward to U.S. financial markets on the eve of the new business week. The stock market will be open Monday, though bond markets will close for the Columbus Day holiday. On Friday, the broad S&P 500 stock market index plunged 2.7 per cent, its worst day in about six months after Trump's tariff threat.

The back and forth threatens to derail a possible meeting between Trump and Xi and end a truce in a trade war in which new tariffs from both sides briefly topped 100 per cent in April.

Vice President JD Vance said Trump was committed to protecting America's economic livelihoods while making the U.S. more self-sufficient. He said the fact that China has “so much control over critical supply in the United States of America” is the definition of a national emergency and therefore justifies Trump's move to impose tough tariffs.

“It's going to be delicate dance and a lot of it is going to depend on how the Chinese respond. If they respond in a highly aggressive manner, I guarantee you the president of the United States has far more cards than the People's Republic of China,” Vance said on Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures.”

“If, however, they're willing to be reasonable, then Donald Trump is always willing to be a reasonable negotiator. We're going to find out a lot in the weeks to come about whether China wants to start a trade war with us or whether they actually want to be reasonable,” Vance continued. “I hope they choose the path of reason. The president of the United States is going to defend America regardless.”

Trump says U.S. will impose additional 100% tariff on China

Trump has raised taxes on imports from many U.S. trading partners since taking office in January, seeking to win concessions. China has been one of the few countries that hasn't backed down, relying on its economic clout.

“Frequently resorting to the threat of high tariffs is not the correct way to get along with China,” the Commerce Ministry said in its post, which was presented as a series of answers from an unnamed spokesperson to four questions from unspecified media outlets.

The statement called for addressing any concerns through dialogue.

“If the U.S. side obstinately insists on its practice, China will be sure to resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the post said.

In addition to the 100 per cent tariff, Trump threatened to impose export controls on what he called “critical software,” without specifying what that means.

Both sides accuse the other of violating the spirit of the truce by imposing new restrictions on trade.

Shares in rare earth companies jump as China expands export controls, tightens semiconductor restrictions

Trump said in a social media post that China is “becoming very hostile” and that it is holding the world captive by restricting access to rare earth metals and magnets.

The Chinese Commerce Ministry post said the U.S. has introduced several new restrictions in recent weeks, including expanding the number of Chinese companies subject to U.S. export controls.

On rare earths, the ministry said that export licenses would be granted for legitimate civilian uses, noting that the minerals also have military applications.

The new regulations include a requirement that foreign companies get Chinese government approval to export items that contain rare earths sourced from China, no matter where the products are manufactured.

China accounts for nearly 70 per cent of the world's rare earths mining and controls roughly 90 per cent of their global processing. Access to the material is a key point of contention in trade talks between Washington and Beijing.

The critical minerals go into many products, from jet engines, radar systems and electric vehicles to consumer electronics including laptops and phones. China's export controls have hit European and other manufacturers, as well as American ones.

The Commerce Ministry statement said that the U.S. is also ignoring Chinese concerns by going forward with new port fees on Chinese ships that take effect Tuesday. China announced Friday that it would impose port fees on American ships in response.

Experts say the move could eliminate the federal government's power to cancel educational loans

Officials in the Trump administration are reportedly weighing the possibility of selling portions of the federal government's $1.6tn student loan portfolio to private investors, which experts say could carry risks for both taxpayers and borrowers – potentially reshaping the student loan landscape in unpredictable ways.

Senior officials at the education and treasury departments have been engaged in internal conversations about offloading select, high-performing segments of the government's student debt holdings, according to a Politico report this week. These loans are part of the larger portfolio owed by roughly 45 million borrowers nationwide.

Administration officials have also reportedly reached out to figures in the financial industry, including potential buyers, to discuss the idea. The deliberations, which began earlier this year, initially included “department of government efficiency” (Doge) officials stationed at the education department but are now being guided primarily by senior political appointees.

It's unclear how far the administration will take the idea, or which parts of the $1.6tn portfolio could be put on the market.

Daniel Zibel, vice-president and chief counsel at the National Student Legal Defense Network, described the proposed loan sale as a “complex and unprecedented” idea, essentially the reverse of the 2008 financial crisis, when the government bought privately held loans to stabilize the market.

“The system for student debt is incredibly complicated, and for the administration to do this in a way that lives up to the protections that exist in the law for student loan borrowers makes it even more complicated,” Zibel said.

Selling them off now, he said, would shift repayment and management responsibilities to private entities, raising questions about enforcement, oversight, and the continuity of borrower protections. It could also eliminate the government's power to cancel the loan.

“If you're talking about unilateral cancellation, like what president Biden had been talking about, the department would certainly lose all authority to tell a private company that they had to cancel a debt,” he said.

The sale proposal aligns with the administration's broader goal of reducing the federal footprint in the student loan system and encouraging more private-sector involvement. It could also explain why the Trump administration was so eager to roll back the loan forgiveness offered by the Biden administration.

“Now we know why President Trump and Secretary [Linda] McMahon are hell bent on squeezing every last dollar out of families with student debt,” Mike Pierce, executive director of Protect Borrowers, said in a statement. “Once again, we see that across the Trump Administration, when Wall Street's demands run against the financial needs of working people, the banks get what they want.”

Michele Zampini, associate vice-president of federal policy at the Institute for College Access and Success, says the plan is likely linked to the Trump administration's broader ideological aim of shrinking or dismantling the education department.

“This is all part of that same conversation, because the department manages this huge, billion plus dollar loan portfolio,” Zampini said. “You can't really wind down the department while still having responsibility for this type of loan portfolio. It's driven by their desire to wind down the department more broadly. This is the roadblock in their way in many senses.”

Any attempt to sell off federal student loans would raise major legal and logistical questions. Borrowers could face uncertainty about whether current consumer protections, often more favorable than those offered in the private market, would remain intact. It's also unclear whether the government would continue to guarantee the loans.

Zampini adds that the move would put borrower protections at particular risk “because there's really no precedent for this”.

“There is no indication that there is, first of all, interest from the private market. And if there is interest, their interest would likely be to squeeze as much profit from the repayment as they could,” she said. “And so the interest of a private purchaser and a private investor would very likely not be to provide borrowers with any type of generous benefits or relief programs.”

This is not the first time the idea has surfaced. During Trump's first term, the education department hired consulting firms to evaluate the student loan portfolio and estimate its potential sale value. That analysis revealed the loans were worth substantially less than government accountants had assumed, and the plan was shelved as the Covid-19 pandemic upended the economy.

Now, with Trump back in office, the administration appears to be reviving the concept as part of a broader rethink of the student loan system. Officials are reportedly exploring whether to transfer management of the loan portfolio, or segments of it, from the education department to the treasury department, an idea seemingly consistent with Trump's stated desire to close the education department altogether.

“I don't think this is driven by an interest in helping borrowers,” Zampini said. “Certainly, I don't think it's driven by an interest in improving the program. And I also don't think it's driven by an actual interest in saving taxpayers money. I think it's driven mostly by a political interest.”

The potential sale is only one part of a sweeping effort to overhaul the student loan system. The administration has already rolled back nearly all Biden-era policies that offered loan forgiveness or expanded repayment options. It has also resumed collecting defaulted loans for the first time since March 2020, when the pandemic prompted a nationwide pause.

Still, it's not completely clear how feasible these plans are under the current legal system.

“The law does specifically allow the secretary of education to work with the treasury department to sell loans,” Zibel said. “But it very clearly says that the secretary has to determine that it is in the best interest of the United States to do so, but also that there will not result in any cost to the federal government.”

The concerns are not just that current borrowers might be at risk of losing their protections, but that a student loan market controlled by private entities would increase the barriers to attend college.

“The federal student loan program is unique because the loans are not originated with the goal of making a profit on them,” Zampini said. “They are essentially an access tool to enable people to go to college who wouldn't necessarily be able to access that same credit in the private market.

“All of those factors make them a lot less likely to generate a return for an investor. And so it's hard to see how someone looking to make a return on these loans, on this portfolio, would do anything but increase as much as they can the amount of payment and decrease the relief programs and the flexibilities that the federal government offers.”

This country was founded on splitting the difference, creating a political culture that is proving to be remarkably resilient to extremism

In Thanksgiving 2025, Canadians should be grateful that this country's political culture appears to have largely escaped the intense polarization that afflicts many of our allies and friends.

In the United States and in parts of Europe, resentments that were once expressed through fringe elements are taking centre stage. Extremists are rising to power. Far-right political movements are no longer very far away at all.

But in Canada, the mainstream remains mainstream. The long Canadian tradition of muddling through conflicts and concerns has thus far kept our politics relatively civil – a blessing in these troubled times.

Canada certainly has its fair share of problems. Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have more than simply dampened growth. They threaten the future of our trading relationship with the United States, which for decades has been fundamental to this country's economy.

Efforts to promote internal free trade, as a way to compensate for the loss of trade with the United States, are incomplete, to say the least. It remains far too difficult for people, goods and services to move freely across the country, within a uniform regulatory environment.

Speaking of regulations, there are too many of them, obstructing natural resource development and sending entrepreneurs in search of friendlier environments.

Our national security is threatened, not only by Russian and Chinese ambition in the Arctic, but by our own miserable record of underinvestment in defence.

And regional resentments threaten national unity, while younger generations who struggle to find secure jobs and homes that they can afford look with resentment toward the we're-all-right-Jack complacency of the older and better-off.

And yet these problems pale in comparison to those of some other democracies. In the United States, President Trump has turned the federal Department of Justice into an instrument of personal vengeance, directly ordering his attorney-general to indict James Comey, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and calling for philanthropist George Soros to be thrown in jail for supporting progressive causes and the Democratic Party. For good measure, he has accused former president Barack Obama of treason.

In Great Britain, Nigel Farage's populist anti-immigration party is far ahead in the polls. Barring a huge political reversal, he is likely to become prime minister after the next general election.

France has had five prime ministers in less than two years, as opposition politicians, labour groups and the general public resist the efforts of President Emmanuel Macron and his allies to rein in the country's spiralling debt through reduced spending and entitlements. The far-right National Rally, which helped bring down the most recent government, is a formidable force in the country and in parliament.

Globalized capitalism has left many people feeling that the very wealthy and other privileged elites use government to promote their own interests, leaving the common folk dispossessed. In many cases, resentment flows not only toward those elites, but toward immigrants, who are seen as a threat to the traditional national culture.

Canadians are in no way immune to the stresses that account for the rise of populist, right-wing, anti-immigrant parties in other countries. Yet such movements in Canada are virtually non-existent. The populist, immigration-unfriendly People's Party of Canada, led by former Conservative cabinet minister Maxime Bernier, received 0.7 per cent of the vote in last April's federal election.

Polls show that, in recent years, a majority Canadians have come to believe that too many immigrants are entering Canada, but this shift in attitude largely appears to stem from objections to the utter mismanagement of the immigration system by the Trudeau-era Liberal government, which allowed a flood of temporary foreign workers and international students into the country, rather than from nativist resentment of immigrants.

Partly that's because four in 10 Canadians are themselves either immigrants or the children of at least one immigrant, according to the 2021 census. No major political party could have any hope of forming a national government while stoking nativist resentment.

But there is more to Canada's tolerant approach to immigration than simple numbers. What some see as one of Canada's greatest weaknesses is also a source of strength.

There is no single Canadian nation. That's because, for more than two centuries, French and English have co-existed within what was once called British North America.

In Europe, the French and English had been at war with each other as often as not for hundreds of years. How could the two cultures possibly inhabit a single political space?

The solution was for each to leave the other largely alone, and to co-operate in matters of mutual interest. Each accommodated the other. Two solitudes, the critics called it, but those solitudes learned to live together, and to accommodate as well the cultures of the millions who came here from around the world.

Things are far from perfect. Separatist sentiment in Quebec led to two referendums on sovereignty. A third could be on the horizon if, as expected, the Parti Québécois comes to power after the next election. Alberta could one day hold a sovereignty referendum of its own.

But whatever the strains and stresses, the very forces that have prevented Canada from gelling into a nation state have also contributed to the broad attitude of tolerance and accommodation that continue to define this country.

Canadians face many challenges in the months ahead. Sustaining our economy and our national security in a world of rising barriers will be no easy feat. As Fen Hampson, Chancellor's Professor & Professor of International Affairs at Carleton University, recently warned: “You‘re going to have to work harder and you're going to be poorer.”

But whatever awaits us, we will face it with less distrust of each toward the other than troubles some other countries. Canada, we hope, will continue to go forward as it always has, often by just getting by.

And for that, Canadians should truly be thankful.

The U.S. has been assisting Ukraine in conducting strikes on Russian energy sites for several months, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 12, citing unnamed Ukrainian and American officials.

Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil facilities intensified significantly this summer, disrupting operations and worsening a nationwide fuel shortage.

According to the newspaper, U.S. intelligence has supplied Kyiv with targeting data for Russian major oil refineries and infrastructure far beyond the frontline.

American support reportedly extends to helping plan the flight routes, timing, altitude and tactics of Ukrainian drones, allowing them to evade Russian air defense systems.

Sources told FT that the U.S. is involved at every stage of operational planning, although Kyiv retains control over target selection, with Washington advising on target vulnerabilities.

According to the FT's sources, the move is also part of a coordinated effort to weaken Russian President Vladimir Putin's economy and pressure him to come to the negotiating table.

Ukrainian drones have struck at least 16 of Russia's 38 oil refineries since August 2025, according to the Financial Times, driving diesel exports to their lowest levels since 2020.

Kyiv has urged Western partners to tighten sanctions on Russia's energy sector, arguing that cutting Moscow's oil revenues would further undermine its capacity to finance the war against Ukraine.

Neither the U.S. nor Ukraine has officially commented on these reports.

In late September, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that U.S. President Donald Trump backed Ukraine's strikes on Russian energy facilities, as Moscow resumed attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and continued hitting civilian areas.

Several media outlets reported in July that Trump asked Zelensky a month earlier whether Kyiv could strike Moscow or St. Petersburg if provided with long-range U.S. weapons. Zelensky allegedly replied that such an attack would be possible if the U.S. supplied the necessary weapons.

The news comes as Trump appears to be considering transferring Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, which would bolster Kyiv's ability to strike Russian military targets.

Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine's railway infrastructure as autumn sets in, resulting in increasing train delays and cancellations.

The two leaders discussed air defense support and long-range strikes, as Russia ramps up its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

"Not only is this an attempted theft of a peaceful Ukrainian nuclear facility. Unauthorized actions of Russia's (state nuclear energy corporation) Rosatom violate internationally recognized nuclear safety protocols, contradict Ukrainian license, and directly threaten a nuclear incident," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said.

A second vessel of the same class is expected to be delivered by the end of 2025, with crew training already underway, said Navy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa.  

Ukrainian forces downed 103 out of the 118 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. A missile and 15 drones struck 10 different locations, according to the statement.

In a renewed effort to disrupt Ukraine's energy grid ahead of winter, Russia carried out several large-scale missile and drone strikes on energy and gas facilities this week.

Sources told the Financial Times that the U.S. is involved at every stage of operational planning, although Kyiv retains control over target selection, with Washington advising on target vulnerabilities.

The number includes 1,240 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

The Atesh partisan group sabotaged railway infrastructure in Russia's Rostov Oblast, disrupting Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on Oct. 12.

MOSCOW, October 12. /TASS/. Current authorities of Moldova makes a serious mistake by making Russia its antagonist for the sake of building up their relations with Europe, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told TASS, commenting on the new military strategy adopted by Chisinau this week, where Russia is called the threat.

"This is the continuation of rather confrontational line in respect of our country, the unfriendly line. From our point of view, current leaders of Moldova make a serious mistake," Peskov noted.

"They believe the line of building up relations with Europe implies full antagonization of Russia. One country has already made such a mistake. It did not bring any good to this one country," he stressed.

On October 8, the new military strategy of Moldova by 2035 was approved at the meeting of the government, according to which Russia is the main security threat for Moldova.

Russian independent media outlet Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC Russian service, has confirmed the identities of 135,100 Russian military personnel killed in Ukraine.

The publications' latest report covers the period of Feb. 24, 2022 to Oct. 9, 2025. Since it was last updated at the end of September, 2,485 additional Russian military personnel have been confirmed killed.

The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, memorial community tree-plantings, regional media reports, statements from local authorities, among other sources.

The reported death toll now includes 38,200 volunteers, 18,450 recruited prisoners, and 15,200 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. Over 5,800 officers have also been confirmed to have been killed.

In August, Mediazona, in collaboration with independent Russian outlet Meduza, released a report estimating that an estimated 220,000 Russians have been killed in the country's war against Ukraine — although that number has grown since.

The average age of the dead soldiers was 35.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the figures reported by the publications.

Moscow and Kyiv rarely officially report their losses. Ukraine estimates that Russia's overall casualties during the full-scale war have surpassed 1 million.

In a briefing to reporters on Aug. 12, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Russian losses are approximately three times greater than that of Ukraine, without specifying the total number of losses suffered.

Despite the heavy losses, Russia has been able to make advances in Donetsk Oblast in Ukraine's east as it is able to offset its casualties through fresh contract soldiers. In turn, Kyiv faces increasingly serious manpower shortages, particularly among infantry units holding the front line.

As of Oct. 11, Ukraine's General Staff estimates that Russia has lost 1,121,570 troops in Ukraine since the start of the war on Feb. 24, 2022. The numbers are largely in-line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies.

The outlet published the complete list of identified casualties for the first time in February, marking three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the publication, volunteers manually enter and verify each record to prevent duplicate entries in the database.

 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur breaks down renewed U.S. discussions about supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles — and Russia's reaction.



In a renewed effort to disrupt Ukraine's energy grid ahead of winter, Russia carried out several large-scale missile and drone strikes on energy and gas facilities this week.

Sources told the Financial Times that the U.S. is involved at every stage of operational planning, although Kyiv retains control over target selection, with Washington advising on target vulnerabilities.

The number includes 1,240 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

The Atesh partisan group sabotaged railway infrastructure in Russia's Rostov Oblast, disrupting Russian logistics, the group claimed in a Telegram post on Oct. 12.

Russian independent media outlet Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC Russian service, has confirmed the identities of 135,100 Russian military personnel killed in Ukraine.

An estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Cuban fighters are actively participating in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported Oct. 5, citing an internal U.S. State Department cable obtained by the outlet.

            Dozens of fighters were killed in overnight border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, both sides said on Sunday, in the most serious fighting between the neighbours since the Taliban came to power in Kabul.
    


            The Pakistan military said that 23 of its soldiers were killed in the clashes. The Taliban said nine on its side were killed.
    


            Tensions have risen after Islamabad demanded the Taliban take action against militants who have stepped up attacks in Pakistan, saying they operate from havens in Afghanistan. The Taliban, which came to power in 2021, denies that Pakistani militants are present on its soil.
    


            Each side said it inflicted far higher casualties on the other side, without providing evidence. Pakistan said it had killed more than 200 Afghan Taliban and allied fighters, while Afghanistan said that it had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers.
    


            Reuters was not able to independently verify the figures.
    


            On Thursday, Pakistan carried out airstrikes in Kabul and on a marketplace in eastern Afghanistan, according to Pakistani security officials and the Taliban, setting off retaliatory attacks by the Taliban. Pakistan has not officially acknowledged the airstrikes.
    


            Afghan troops opened fire on Pakistani border posts late on Saturday. Pakistan said that it had responded with gun and artillery fire.
    


            Both nations claimed to have destroyed border posts of the other side. Pakistani security officials shared video footage, which they said showed Afghan posts being hit.

            The exchanges were mostly over on Sunday morning, Pakistani security officials said. But in Pakistan's Kurram area, intermittent gunfire continued, according to local officials and residents.
    


            Afghanistan's ministry of defence had previously said that their operation had finished at midnight local time.
    


            Kabul said on Sunday that it had halted attacks at the request of Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The two Arab Gulf nations had released statements of concern about the clashes.
    


            “There is no kind of threat in any part of Afghanistan's territory,” the Taliban administration's spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said Sunday. “The Islamic Emirate and the people of Afghanistan will defend their land and remain resolute and committed in this defence.”
    


            Mujahid said that fighting was ongoing in some areas.
    


            Pakistani officials said on Sunday Pakistan had closed crossings along the 2,600-km (1,600-mile) border with Afghanistan, a disputed colonial-era frontier known as the Durand line drawn up by the British in 1893.
    


            The two main border crossings with Afghanistan, at Torkham and Chaman, and at least three minor crossings, at Kharlachi, Angoor Adda and Ghulam Khan, were closed on Sunday, local officials said.
    


            The Pakistani airstrikes coincided with a rare visit to India by a Taliban leader, Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, which resulted in an announcement by India on Friday to upgrade relations. India is Pakistan's longstanding adversary, with the trip causing concern in Islamabad.

            Ian Watkins, the former frontman of Welsh rock band Lostprophets who was serving a 35-year sentence for child sex offenses, has been killed in prison by another inmate, British media reported on Saturday.
    


            Watkins, 48, was serving his sentence at Wakefield Prison in northern England.
    


            “At 9.39am this morning (Saturday), police were called by staff at HMP Wakefield reporting an assault on a prisoner,” West Yorkshire Police said in a statement.
    


            “Emergency services attended and the man was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.” The statement did not name Watkins.
    


            Police did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
    


            Watkins was convicted in 2013 after pleading guilty to 13 charges. He had admitted two attempted rapes, sexually assaulting a child under 13, aiding and abetting the sexual assault of a child under 13, conspiring to rape a child under 13 and conspiring to sexually assault another child under 13.
    


            He had also pleaded guilty to six counts of taking and possessing indecent images of children and one of possessing extreme pornographic images.

Journalist and pro-Israel activist Emily Austin joins 'Fox & Friends First' to break down the Virginia gubernatorial debate and President Trump not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.

With just weeks left before Virginians head to the voting booth, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger has been rattled by twin controversies — a violent text message scandal involving a fellow Democrat and fresh criticism over her stance on transgender bathroom policies.

In 2022, Virginia state attorney general candidate Jay Jones told a colleague via text that he wished violence against former Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his children. The private messages, which recently came to light, have sparked outrage from Republicans and discomfort among Democrats, forcing Spanberger to navigate one of the most volatile moments of her campaign.

‘CONSUMED WITH HATE': WINSOME SEARS, JASON MIYARES UNLOAD ON DEMOCRAT JAY JONES OVER VIOLENT TEXTS

Spanberger's cautious tone carried into last Thursday's debate, where she faced off against GOP nominee Winsome Earle-Sears.

"Jay Jones advocated the murder — Abigail — the murder of a man, a former speaker, as well as his children who were 2 years and 5 years old. You have little girls. Would it take him pulling the trigger? Is that what would do it?" Earle-Sears asked Thursday night. "Please ask him to get out of the race. Have some courage." 

She sidestepped several rounds of questions throughout the debate on whether she still endorsed Jones.

Meanwhile, fellow Democrats have rallied around Jones, emphasizing forgiveness and unity as the campaign enters its final stretch.

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., was also unwilling to call on Jones' to drop out. He told Fox News Digital he's still a supporter of the embattled candidate for his state's attorney general seat. 

"I think those statements were not in character, and he has apologized — I wish other people in public life would sincerely apologize for stuff," the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee said. "I've known Jay Jones for 25 years."

VIRGINIA DEMS BACK AG CANDIDATE JAY JONES, DESPITE TEXT MESSAGES

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., did not respond when Fox News Digital repeatedly asked whether Jay Jones should end his campaign. Warner was also pressed on whether he would seek the return of a $25,000 August donation from Jones or express regret over the show of support, but once again declined to respond.

After the texts came to light, the Virginia Beach Democratic Committee moved quickly to defend Jones, urging Virginians to "line up behind" him.

"We are lined up, ten toes down, ready to organize, mobilize and deliver voters for Jay and our entire Democratic ticket," the statement read. "Recent press may have spotlighted past mistakes. We say, let those without sin cast the first stone. Jay Jones has taken responsibility, apologized and shown he is committed to serving with integrity and accountability that his public record already shows."

Jones has since apologized, calling the remarks "embarrassing and shameful," and said he had reached out personally to Gilbert and his family.

DEMOCRATS UNDER FIRE FOR STANDING BY VIRGINIA AG HOPEFUL WHO JOKED ABOUT SHOOTING GOP RIVAL

Last week, President Donald Trump called for Jones to drop out of the race, calling the text messages "sick" and "demented."

"Democrat Jay Jones should drop out of the race immediately and the people of Virginia must continue to have a great attorney general in Jason Miyares who, by the way, has my complete and total endorsement," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Oct. 5.

The latest revelation comes amid heightened political tensions and a growing number of incidents that have fueled concerns about violence in national politics.

On a separate issue, Spanberger has also sidestepped her stance on transgender issues.

Earlier this month, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued an executive directive ensuring bathrooms, locker rooms and other intimate spaces remain separated by sex assigned at birth. The directive also instructs the state Board of Health to bar biological males from competing on female athletic teams.

When asked, point-blank, whether she would rescind that directive, Spanberger refused to give a definitive answer.

"My answer is that in each local community decisions should be made between parents and educators, and teachers in each community. It shouldn't be dictated by politicians," Spanberger responded. "I'm a mother of three daughters in Virginia public schools, and nothing is more important to me than their safety and their experience in schools," Spanberger added in response to questions about her stance on transgender issues.

Fox News correspondent Brooke Taylor has the latest on the search and rescue efforts on 'Special Report.'

Federal and local authorities rescued more than 30 missing children and uncovered multiple trafficking operations targeting vulnerable youth during a coordinated crackdown across Texas.

The effort, centered in San Antonio, led to arrests, felony warrants and several new investigations under a joint mission known as "Operation Lightning Bug."

Teams from the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) out of San Antonio, Del Rio, Midland, and Pecos joined forces with San Antonio Police Department's Missing Persons Unit, Special Victims Unit, Street Crimes Unit and covert operatives. Together, they combed through Texas and national crime databases to identify at-risk juveniles and coordinate recovery efforts.

The results included:

Each recovered child was interviewed by SAPD's Special Victims Unit to determine whether they had been victimized. Survivors were referred to support services provided by agencies such as Health and Human Services to ensure long-term care and protection.

U.S. Marshal Susan Pamerleau, for the Western District of Texas, said in a statement that protecting children remains central to the Marshals Service's mission.

"The safety of our children is the safety of our communities, and justice demands that we protect those who cannot protect themselves," Pamerleau said. "Through Operation Lightning Bug, we reaffirm our promise to safeguard the most vulnerable and strengthen the safety of our communities."

San Antonio Police Chief William McManus echoed those sentiments, praising the effort as an example of law enforcement unity.

"Every suspect arrested, juvenile returned home and survivor taken out of harm's way matters," McManus said. "This operation demonstrates what can be achieved when law enforcement agencies unite to protect children."

The U.S. Marshals conducted the sweep under the authority of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, which empowers the agency to recover missing or endangered children, even when no fugitive is involved. That law also led to the creation of the USMS Missing Child Unit, which leads similar recovery efforts nationwide.

Kirsta Leeberg-Melton, founder and CEO of the Institute to Combat Trafficking, said operations like this one underscore the larger issue of exploitation in Texas and beyond.

"Trafficking is something that the city of San Antonio and the state of Texas and the nation have been grappling with for a considerable period of time," she said in an interview with Fox News Digital. 

She said traffickers often target instability — children without consistent housing, food or family support.

"They are easy pickings for traffickers to take advantage of," she warned. "They exploit these needs by offering those items and then calling in debts and putting those kids in a position where they are able to exploit them for sex or for labor."

Leeberg-Melton said the public often underestimates how widespread trafficking is — and how much it has evolved, especially online.

"Trafficking is the exploitation of men, women and children for forced sex or forced labor by a third party for their profit or gain. That's been around forever," Leeberg-Melton said. "What hasn't really been around is people's understanding of that crime and their knowledge that it's happening everywhere!"

She added that traffickers increasingly use technology to recruit and control victims.

"As technology advances, traffickers…are early adopters and adapters of technology," she said. "The internet allows them to connect with victims and buyers far beyond their local area."

Leeberg-Melton emphasized that trafficking is not limited to border regions.

"American citizens can traffic American citizens on American soil," she said, adding that most trafficking cases prosecuted in the U.S. involve American perpetrators exploiting American victims.

"The biggest myth is that it happens somewhere else, and it happens to someone else," she said. "Until we start recognizing that people have value, no matter who they are, where they come from, what they've done or what's been done to them, we will continue to excuse some level of exploitation."

Leeberg-Melton also described sextortion as a growing form of trafficking that uses coercion to force sexual conduct or imagery.

"When you have someone that you are holding something over their head and then you are asking them for additional photographs or additional sexual conduct with the threat…that is a form, frankly, of human trafficking," she said.

Struggles by several top 10 teams in Week 7 of college football should send shockwaves through the latest AP Top 25 rankings, dropping at 2 p.m. ET.

No. 3 Oregon suffered its first loss of the season, delivered by No. 7 Indiana in a 30-20 road win.

No. 4 Ole Miss pulled out a 24-21 victory over Washington State in a game that shouldn't have been close.

No. 6 Oklahoma was outperformed by the Texas Longhorns, whose stint as an unranked team will likely be short-lived after a convincing 23-6 win.

So how will the top of the poll shake out?

Nine AP Top 25 teams maintained an undefeated record through Week 7: No. 1 Ohio State, No. 2 Miami, No. 4 Ole Miss, No. 5 Texas A&M, No. 7 Indiana, No. 9 Texas Tech, No. 13 Georgia Tech, No. 18 BYU and No. 23 Memphis.

Memphis entered the Top 25 just last week after a 45-7 win against Tulsa. The Tigers had the week off and will return to game action on Oct. 18 with a trip to UAB.

BYU squeaked by Arizona in a double-overtime thriller on Saturday night. A 7-yard rushing touchdown by BYU freshman quarterback Bear Bachmeier sealed the deal for the Cougars.

Future games holds significant value. 

For example, Ole Miss and Tennessee did not have convincing games this week. However, they will be heavily monitored next week because of their matchups against ranked opponents.

▶ Ask him a question about the Top 25 poll

No. 7 Indiana is poised to crack the top five after outscoring No. 3 Oregon 30-20 in Ducks' territory. 

Other Saturday highlights included unranked USC, Texas and Utah teams delivering big-time wins against ranked opponents.

The Trojans could return to the rankings after outplaying No. 15 Michigan, beating the Wolverines 31-13. Texas came out on top of the Red River Rivalry, beating No. 6 Oklahoma 23-6. Utah rounded out competition for the day with a dominant 42-10 win against No. 21 Arizona State.

No. 9 Texas Tech could see its highest ranking of the season after a 42-17 win against Kansas.

Alabama's opening season loss to FSU will weigh down its record. However, three straight Top 25 wins in SEC play has them as the frontrunner to win the conference. 

Their biggest strength right now is the defense coming up big late in games and the brilliance of QB TY Simpson as one of the best passers in the country.

Stock down: No. 3 Oregon is set to slip out of the top five after falling to No. 7 Indiana at home. The Ducks ranked in the top three for the past two weeks after beating Penn State. 

No. 4 Ole Miss could fall in the poll after unexpectedly struggling against Washington State. The Rebels pulled out a 24-21 win, but could see a slight drop off in the rankings after the uninspiring outing. 

No. 6 Oklahoma could drop out of the top 10 for the first time in weeks after losing to an unranked Texas team on Saturday.

Indiana is off to a 6-0 start and now has two wins against ranked teams after having zero in 2024. It's worth considering that this may be the best year in Indiana history. So moving them up was a given, seeing how the rest of their conference schedule holds up. 

For Oregon, the remaining schedule does include quality opponents like USC and Washington, but none are against teams that entered this weekend ranked inside the Top 25. 

Not to mention, the Ducks' best win is against Penn State, who just dropped back-to-back losses to conference opponents.

▶ Ask him a question about the Top 25 poll

Two top 10 teams lost on Saturday, paving the way for movement in today's poll.

No. 3 Oregon hopes to hang on to its top 10 status after a loss to No. 7 Indiana. And No. 6 Oklahoma has a substantial fall at stake after losing to Texas in a matchup that wasn't particularly close.

No. 5 Texas A&M, No. 8 Alabama and No. 9 Texas Tech each racked up a win Saturday and could benefit from Oklahoma and Oregon's losses.

College football writer and Top 25 voter Jerry Humphrey will answer a few questions before and after the rankings drop.






No organization has been ranking teams and naming a major college football national champion longer than The Associated Press, since 1936.

AP employees don't vote themselves, but they do choose the voters. AP Top 25 voters comprise around 60 writers and broadcasters who cover college football for AP members and other select outlets. The goal is to have every state with a Football Bowl Subdivision school represented by at least one voter.

Voting is a straight points system: A first-place vote is worth 25 points, a second-place vote is worth 24 points, down to 1 point for a 25th-place vote. 

Then it's just a summary of which teams are 1-25 based on the totals. Others receiving votes are also noted.

Voting is done online, and the tabulation is automated.

Panelists Brent Sadler and Derek Maltz weigh in on the Pentagon taking aim at narcoterrorists near Venezuela on ‘America Reports.'

President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented war against cartels and has threatened narco-terrorists, saying he will "blow you out of existence" as his administration seeks to curb the influx of drugs into the U.S. 

The White House sent lawmakers a memo Sept. 30 informing them that the U.S. is now participating in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug smugglers — on top of conducting four fatal strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean since September. 

The Department of War recently announced a new counter-narcotics Joint Task Force in the Southern Command area of responsibility, according to Secretary of War Pete Hegseth. 

The aim of the task force is to "crush the cartels, stop the poison, and keep America safe," Hegseth wrote on X Friday. "The message is clear: if you traffic drugs toward our shores, we will stop you cold."

HOW TRUMP'S STRIKES AGAINST ALLEGED NARCO-TERRORISTS ARE RESHAPING THE CARTEL BATTLEFIELD: 'ONE-WAY TICKET'

These recent developments suggest that Trump is eyeing targets within Venezuela, not just those within international waters, according to Geoff Ramsey, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council international affairs think tank.

"This is a sign that President Trump is taking the US war on drugs in Latin America to the next level," Ramsey said in a Monday email to Fox News Digital. "By involving the military, the president is going after drug cartels in a way that no previous US administration has dared to so far. I think it is likely that we will see the Pentagon evaluate targets inside Venezuela."

President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he ordered a lethal strike on a vessel linked to a designated terrorist organization operating in the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility Sept. 19, 2025.  (@realDonaldTrump via Truth Social)

Additional strikes could target more drug shipments or drug flights, which often take off from covert airfields near the Colombian border, Ramsey said. 

"It's a bad time to be posted in a guerrilla camp on the Colombian border or operating a Tren de Aragua safe house along the Caribbean trafficking route," Ramsey said. 

Even so, Ramsey said it would be challenging to strike within Venezuela's territory. Doing so would require the U.S. to dismantle Venezuela's air defense system, which would escalate hostilities by openly engaging with Venezuela's military, he said. 

That's a departure from the current approach, in which the U.S. has intentionally avoided targeting Venezuelan military assets, Ramsey said. 

"When two Venezuelan F-16s flew over a US destroyer last month, the fact that those planes weren't blown out of the sky suggests that the US is not interested in a shooting war with Venezuela's military," Ramsey said. 

Trump himself has not ruled out conducting strikes within Venezuela though, and signaled such strikes could happen when he told military leaders in Quantico, Virginia, Sept. 30 that his administration would "look very seriously at cartels coming by land."

WAR ON CARTELS? WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT HAS AN IRON-CLAD CASE TO STRIKE NARCO-TERRORIST GROUPS

So far, the Trump administration has utilized maritime forces to address drug threats, and has beefed up naval assets in the Caribbean in recent months. For example, Trump approved sending several U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers to bolster the administration's counter-narcotics efforts in the region starting in August. 

"I expect these deployments to continue for months or more than a year, with new ships rotating in to replace those that need to return home for maintenance or crew rest," Bryan Clark, director of the Hudson Institute think tank's Center for Defense Concepts and Technology, told Fox News Digital in September. 

Nathan Jones, a nonresident scholar in drug policy and Mexico studies at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, predicted the strikes are unlikely to impact the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. That's because fentanyl precursors originate in China, and are then produced in labs in Mexico before they head north without a pathway into the Caribbean. 

"I wouldn't expect your drug flow to be affected because of these strikes," Jones told Fox News Digital Tuesday. "This could, though, leave transnational criminal organizations running a little scared in terms of what the administration is going to do." 

Still, Jones said that he predicted drug flow routes would adapt and that land or aerial drug routes would take precedence over sea routes in the Caribbean. 

The strikes have prompted members of Congress to question their legality and senators Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., filed a war powers resolution in September that would block U.S. forces from engaging in "hostilities" against certain non-state organizations.

"There has been no authorization to use force by Congress in this way," Schiff told reporters Wednesday. "I feel it is plainly unconstitutional. The fact that the administration claims to have a list and has put organizations on a list does not somehow empower the administration to usurp Congress's power of declaring war or refusing to declare war or refusing to authorize the use of force." 

However, the measure failed in the Senate by a 51–48 margin Wednesday. Even so, the measure attracted support from Republicans Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted alongside their Democratic counterparts for the resolution. 

Other Republicans have defended the strikes though, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, said that Trump's actions were well within his rights and that the resolution was "unreasonable." 

"When he sees an attack like this coming — an attack of drugs or explosives or anything else that's going to kill Americans — he not only has the authority to do something about it, he has the duty to do something about it," Risch said Wednesday before the vote.

Four people were killed and at least 20 others were injured in a mass shooting at a South Carolina bar early Sunday, according to police.

Four victims were pronounced dead at the scene, while the rest were transported to nearby hospitals.

At least four victims were in critical condition following the shooting at Willie's Bar and Grill on St. Helena Island before 1 a.m., the Beaufort County Sheriff's Office said.

“Upon arriving at the scene deputies made contact with a large crowd of people, several of which were suffering from gunshot wounds. It was learned that hundreds of people were at the location when the shooting occurred. Multiple victims and witnesses ran to the nearby businesses and properties seeking shelter from the gun shots,” the statement read.

“Several victims were transported by Beaufort County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to the hospital,” the statement continued. “More victims continued to show up at area hospitals seeking medical attention from injuries sustained at the scene.”

The county sheriff's office said the investigation into the circumstances of the incident and possible suspects is ongoing. Authorities declined to release the names of the victims at this time.

Sunday's shooting in South Carolina comes two days after two separate shootings in Mississippi killed at least eight people, including a pregnant woman. The shootings were related to Friday's high school homecoming football games in the state.

There was a similar third shooting in another part of the state that came under investigation, but it appeared there were no injuries from that incident.

ARREST MADE A WEEK AFTER ALABAMA MASS SHOOTING KILLED TWO AND WOUNDED 12

In Alabama, there was a shooting that left two people dead last weekend. Gunfire erupted between different parties after a college football game in downtown Montgomery.

On Friday, local police announced a suspect had been arrested and charged with capital murder, first-degree assault, and second-degree assault. The suspect was an unnamed juvenile male. Montgomery's mayor said authorities are searching for additional suspects in that case.

Actress Diane Keaton shot to fame after starring in ‘The Godfather' and collaborated with Woody Allen in ‘Annie Hall.'

More details surrounding Diane Keaton's death continue to emerge. 

According to the 911 audio obtained by TMZ, a dispatcher revealed there was a "person down" in the early hours of Saturday morning. 

"Rescue 19, person down," the dispatcher said on Oct. 11, before revealing the actress' address. The outlet reported that Keaton was transported to a local hospital by the Los Angeles Fire Department.

Keaton died at the age of 79, her family confirmed to People magazine.

A close friend of the Hollywood icon told the outlet that Keaton's health had rapidly declined. 

"She declined very suddenly, which was heartbreaking for everyone who loved her," a friend of the Oscar winner told People. "It was so unexpected, especially for someone with such strength and spirit."

"In her final months, she was surrounded only by her closest family, who chose to keep things very private. Even longtime friends weren't fully aware of what was happening," the friend added. 

Grammy and Oscar-winning songwriter Carole Bayer Sager detailed her final visit with Keaton just weeks before her death. 

"I saw her two or three weeks ago, and she was very thin," Sager, who co-wrote Keaton's single, "First Christmas," told People. "She had lost so much weight."

"She had to go to Palm Springs because her house had been damaged inside [from the L.A. wildfires], and they had to clean everything," she continued. "She was down there for a while, and when she came back, I was kind of stunned by how much weight she'd lost."

Despite her health struggles, said Sager, "she was a magic light for everyone."

"I just loved her. She was so special, she just lit up a room with her energy. She was happy and upbeat and taking photographs of everything she saw. She was completely creative; she never stopped creating."

Another friend of the star said Keaton "was funny right up until the end."

"She lived exactly how she wanted to, which was on her own terms, surrounded by the people and things she really loved," the friend told People. "In these last few years, she kept a close circle and she liked it that way. She was funny right up until the end and she had this way of making even ordinary moments feel special. That was just who she was."

After news broke of Keaton's passing, there was an outpouring of tributes to the Hollywood legend from her former co-stars and other celebrities.

Goldie Hawn, Steve Martin, Kimberly Williams-Paisley were among the many stars who honored Keaton's legacy. 

Martin, who played Keaton's on-screen husband in the hit 1991 comedy "Father of the Bride" and its 1995 sequel "Father of the Bride II," which also starred Martin Short, shared a humorous remembrance of the actress as he posted a screenshot of quotes from a joint interview with his co-stars.

"Who's sexier? Me or Steve Martin?" Short asked in the article, published by Interview magazine in 2021. 

"I mean, you're both idiots," Keaton replied.

"Don't know who first posted this, but it sums up our delightful relationship with Diane," Martin wrote in the caption.

The Hollywood icon was honored by fellow colleagues.  

Williams-Paisley, who portrayed Annie Banks, the daughter of Martin's George Banks and Keaton's Nina Banks in the "Father of the Bride" movies, commented on the "Only Murders in the Building" star's post, writing, "I can absolutely hear her saying that," adding a crying laughing smiley face emoji. 

Williams-Paisley also shared her own Instagram tribute to Keaton, posting photos of herself with her on-screen mother. 

"Diane, working with you will always be one of the highlights of my life," Williams-Paisley wrote in the caption. "You are one of a kind, and it was thrilling to be in your orbit for a time. Thank you for your kindness, your generosity, your talent, and above all, your laughter." 

Hawn, who co-starred with Keaton and Bette Midler in the 1996 hit ensemble comedy "The First Wives Club," shared an emotional post on Instagram.

"Diane, we aren't ready to lose you. You've left us with a trail of fairy dust, filled with particles of light and memories beyond imagination," Hawn wrote alongside a photo of Keaton.

She continued: "How do we say goodbye? What words can come to mind when your heart is broken? You never liked praise, so humble, but now you can't tell me to ‘shut up' honey. There was, and will be, no one like you. You stole the hearts of the world and shared your genius with millions, making films that made us laugh and cry in ways only you could."

"I was blessed to make ‘First Wives Club' with you, our days starting with coffee in the makeup trailer, laughing and joking, right through to the very last day of filming," Hawn added. "It was a roller coaster of love.

"We agreed to grow old together, and one day, maybe live together with all our girlfriends," Hawn wrote. "Well, we never got to live together, but we did grow older together. Who knows… maybe in the next life.

"Shine your fairy dust up there, girlfriend. I'm going to miss the hell out of you. My heart goes out to your beautiful children, Dex and Duke," the Academy Award winner concluded. 

Midler also paid tribute to Keaton, posting a black-and-white image of the actress on her Instagram page along with a heartfelt caption. 

"The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died," she wrote. "I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me.

"She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star," Midler added. "What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!"

The Department of Education has dismissed nearly all employees in its Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services as part of a new round of layoffs that began on Friday, according to the union representing agency staff.

The exact number of layoffs remains unclear, as the agency has not released an official estimate. An Education Department spokesperson confirmed Friday that the agency would be included in the reduction in force but did not specify how many positions would be cut or which divisions would be affected. 

A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget, where Director Russell Vought announced the layoffs in a post on X, described the government-wide cuts as “substantial.”

REPUBLICANS ARE PUSHING THESE FIVE DEMOCRATS TO FLIP ON FUNDING BILL

Rachel Gittleman, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, said reports from staff and managers indicate that the workforce reduction affected most employees below the leadership level. She added that workers in the department's TRIO college access program, housed in a separate office, were also among those let go.

“Once again, the Trump administration is acting as though they have impunity to cut staff from an already lean, efficient agency,” Gittleman said in a prepared statement. “Dismantling the government through mass firings, especially at the ED, is not the solution to our problems as a country.”

Education Secretary Linda McMahon has repeatedly emphasized that protecting the rights of students with disabilities and ensuring they receive the educational resources guaranteed to them by law are among her highest priorities. She has repeatedly said her goal is to shift more authority and responsibility for education to state and local government.

“I'd like to see even more funding directed to states to support that work,” she told CNN in March.

When the Trump administration began, the department employed just over 4,000 people. Following a series of buyouts, early retirements, voluntary departures, and a Reduction in Force earlier this year, its workforce has been cut by nearly half.

In a court filing Friday, the Justice Department reported that more than 460 Education Department employees had been laid off, eliminating roughly one-fifth of the agency's already depleted workforce. The total is expected to rise further.

TRUMP MASS LAYOFFS SHOW HE ISN'T BLUFFING ON SHUTDOWN THREATS

President Trump has said that oversight of special needs and student nutrition programs will eventually move to the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., though that transfer has not yet taken place.

The layoffs, affecting employees across more than half a dozen federal agencies, are part of a broader Trump administration strategy to increase pressure on congressional Democrats to resolve the ongoing government shutdown. At the Education Department, nearly 90% of staff remain furloughed.

Fox News correspondent Garrett Tenney has the latest on President Donald Trump's efforts to create a National Guard presence in Illinois on ‘America Reports.'

Tech billionaire Marc Benioff is shifting his tone toward President Donald Trump, saying he "fully" supports the president and is now urging him to deploy the National Guard to Benioff's home city of San Francisco.

"We don't have enough cops, so if [the National Guard] can be cops, I'm all for it," Benioff said in an interview with The New York Times.

"I fully support the president," he added. "I think he's doing a great job."

His comments come a week before his annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. He complained to the Times that he has to pay out of pocket for off-duty police officers to bolster security in the convention area every year.

"You'll see. When you walk through San Francisco next week, there will be cops on every corner," he promised. "That's how it used to be."

The friendly words for Trump are an about-face for the California billionaire, however, having spent recent years funneling tens of millions of dollars toward left-wing activist groups. Benioff's company, Salesforce, has also a championed transgender ideology.

Between 2022 and 2024 alone, Salesforce donated over $23 million to the left-wing Tides Foundation. Salesforce also created the "Pledge 1%" program, a model that encourages corporations to donate 1% of equity, product, profit, and employee time to charity.

Salesforce kicked the program over to Tides Foundation, which has been handling the Pledge 1% funds since at least 2019. Salesforce says at least 9,000 companies have joined the program since its inception.

Salesforce also donated $1.5 million to the liberal dark money group New Venture Fund. Reporting from the Washington Examiner says the organization has links to a Palestinian terrorist group.

Aside from funding, Benioff's company has used its own reach to push transgender activism, using its social media accounts to hail a transgender athlete and defend transgender people in the U.S. military.

Despite the left-wing resume, Benioff has been successful in getting closer to Trump's orbit since his election in 2024. Benioff sat across from Trump at the state dinner hosted by King Charles in the U.K. last month. According to the Times, he repeatedly told Trump "how grateful I am for everything he's doing."

The White House did not immediately respond when Fox News Digital reached out regarding any plans to deploy National Guard to San Francisco.

Trump himself floated the idea in August, however, telling reporters in the Oval Office that Democrats have "destroyed" the city.

"You look at what the Democrats have done to San Francisco — they've destroyed it. We can clean that up, too — we'll clean that one up, too."

            Hundreds of staff fired from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention late Friday have been reinstated, according to the American Federation of Government Employees.
    


            After a new round of layoff notices sent late Friday night to around 1,300 workers at the CDC, approximately 700 were reinstated on Saturday, while about 600 remain laid off, according to the union, which represents federal workers.
    


            “The employees who received incorrect notifications were never separated from the agency and have all been notified that they are not subject to the reduction in force,” said Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the US Department of Health and Human Services.
    


            Among reinstated employees are staff that publish the agency's flagship journal, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, according to Dr. Debra Houry, who recently resigned as the agency's chief medical officer and deputy director for program and science. Houry and other high-level CDC officials resigned in August in protest over the firing of recently confirmed CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez.
    


            Athalia Christie, the incident commander for the measles response, was among hundreds of employees mistakenly fired on Friday. The annual total of measles cases in the US – now up to 1,563 cases since January – is the highest by a significant margin since measles was declared eliminated in America a quarter-century ago.
    


            Staff were also reinstated at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, the Global Health Center, and the Public Health Infrastructure Center, which manages more than $3 billion in grants to 107 state and local governments to help build local public health workforces, said Dr. Brian Castrucci, who is president and chief executive officer of the de Beaumont Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for public health workers.
    


Trump's move to fund military paychecks during shutdown comes as families face strain and uncertainty



            Staff and officers at the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service who were able to check their emails have also received notices that their firings were in error, according to a CDC official with knowledge of the situation who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation.
    


            Epidemic Intelligence Service officers, also known as “disease detectives,” are often the first to respond to disease threats when they arise.
    


            “We think all staff and all officers” are back, the official said.
    


            The mistakenly fired employees were sent incorrect notifications because of a coding error on the notices, according to an HHS official. The employees who got the miscoded notifications were all told about the glitch on Friday or Saturday, the person said.
    


            Staff at CDC's Washington office, in its Violence Prevention programs, and in the Office of the Director of the Injury Center, remain separated from the agency as part of the latest round of the Trump administration's Reduction in Force initiatives.
    


‘The damage is beyond repair': The CDC is facing another round of deep staff cuts



            President Donald Trump said late Friday afternoon that he planned to fire “a lot” of federal workers in retaliation for the government shutdown, vowing to target those deemed to be aligned with the Democratic Party.
    


“We figure they started this thing, so they should be Democrat-oriented,” Trump said, placing blame for the shutdown on Democratic lawmakers. Trump did not provide details on what qualified the affected workers as “Democrat-oriented.”
    


            The legality of firing federal workers during a government shutdown is also in question. Shortly after Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought posted “The RIFs have begun” on X on Friday AFGE replied “The lawsuit has been filed.”
    


            A court filing in that case indicates more than 4,100 federal workers were impacted by the cuts at HHS as well as the departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Homeland Security and Treasury.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — The woman long blamed for her role in the fall of the Aztec empire in 1521 is getting a modern makeover.

The Spanish called her Marina, pre-Hispanic peoples knew her as Malintzin and later she was renamed Malinche. Her work as translator and interpreter for Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés made her a protagonist in a violent colonial period whose effects still reverberate through Latin America. Her story, told only by others, generated myths and legends.

Was she a traitor to her people? The conquistador's lover? A slave using her language skills to survive? Or someone with agency who influenced Cortés and shaped major events?

Five centuries later, the debate continues and Mexico's first woman leader, President Claudia Sheinbaum, is weighing in.

Beginning Sunday, Mexico will kick off cultural events dedicated to reclaiming the story of Malinche on the anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the Americas. 

“We have a working group of anthropologists, historians, and philosophers studying this important, much-maligned figure, and it is very important to vindicate her,” Sheinbaum said recently.




Born around 1500, Malinche learned Nahuatl and the now near-disappeared Oluteco, growing up south of the Gulf of Mexico. The Aztecs sold her as a slave to a Mayan people who later gave her and other women to the Spanish after being defeated in battle. By then, she could speak two more Mayan languages.

The Spanish baptized the women, providing religious cover for them to be raped. 

Malinche was “at their mercy as a victim,” said Camilla Townsend, a historian at Rutgers University and an expert on Malinche. But she easily learned Spanish and “she saved her own life really by choosing to translate.”

Soon she would find herself in front of Moctezuma, the Aztec leader, in the imposing capital Tenochtitlan. As a translator for Cortés, she bridged two radically different worldviews, relaying the desires of Cortés and possibly trying to influence negotiations.

Some historical documents say she saved lives but she was also placed in complicated situations. 

“She was forced to be an intermediary between the Spaniards and these other poor women who were going to be raped,” Townsend said.

Most academics today don't see her as a traitor, because the Aztecs were her enemies in a world of constant wars between different peoples that only centuries later were lumped together as “Indigenous” in a violent colonial system.

Still, viewing her objectively is impossible, according to Federico Navarrete, historian at Mexico's National Autonomous University, because the race and class conflicts left by the conquest persist. Yet, schools only teach a “nationalist” perspective, downplaying nuances such as the support of some Indigenous groups for the Spanish.

Yásnaya Aguilar, a Mixe linguist who has written about Malinche, described her as “a native woman who moved from being a slave to being respected and honored by society in her time.” In fact, the name Malinche was also used to refer to Cortés: they were considered one, but she was the voice.

The Spanish also respected Malinche. Townsend believes that Cortés agreed to give her in marriage to one of his main commanders – the only way for her to avoid returning to slavery – so that she would agree to stay on with him for the conquest of modern day Honduras.

She died around the age of 30, apparently in an epidemic. She had a son with Cortés and a daughter with her husband.

Malinche was largely forgotten until the early 19th century, when Mexico won its independence from Spain and Spain's allies became enemies.

She first appears as “a lascivious and scheming traitor” in a popular, anonymously published novel in 1826, so she became the perfect villain for the new country, according to Townsend. It was the Mexican governments that followed that imposed Spanish on Indigenous peoples.

Malinche's negative image was solidified by Nobel Prize in Literature winner Octavio Paz. In his emblematic work of Mexican identity “The Labyrinth of Solitude,” Paz described her as “a figure representing the Indian women who were fascinated, violated or seduced by the Spaniards” and for whom “the Mexican people have not forgiven her betrayal.”

Her name became a symbol of sympathy for the foreign and contempt for one's own. It carried an idealized romantic relationship with Cortés that historians consider uncalled for and that Aguilar characterized as “patriarchal and chauvinistic.”

It's a caricature that has extended far beyond Mexico's modern borders. “They call me Malinche too from the left for allying myself with white men … with whom we work against extractivist policies,” said Toribia Lero, an Indigenous Bolivian activist of the Sura de los Andes people.

Mexico's Indigenous peoples, however, maintained respect for the woman, naming volcanoes, peaks and ceremonial dances after her. In some rural towns, girls are registered soon after birth to represent Malinche in traditional dances, Aguilar wrote.

Since the 1970s, Malinche's negative image began to be questioned among Chicana feminists in the U.S. because they knew it was very hard to be a bridge between two peoples and they empathized with her, Townsend said. 

Now there is a growing body of academic literature attempting to contextualize her life. And the Mexican government is joining the effort.

U.S. President Donald Trump will have a one-day trip to the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war ceasefire.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday expressed confidence that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which went into effect earlier Friday, will hold. Trump also confirmed that he will deliver an address to the Knesset and meet with world leaders in Egypt.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is setting off for Israel and Egypt on Sunday to celebrate the U.S.-brokered ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas and urge Middle East allies to seize the opportunity to build a durable peace in the volatile region.

It's a fragile moment with Israel and Hamas only in the early stages of implementing the first phase of the Trump agreement designed to bring a permanent end to the war sparked by the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas-led militants. 

Trump thinks there is a narrow window to reshape the Mideast and reset long-fraught relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors. 

It is a moment, the Republican president says, that has been helped along by his administration's support of Israel's decimation of Iranian proxies, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. 

The White House says momentum is also building because Arab and Muslim states are demonstrating a renewed focus on resolving the broader, decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict and, in some cases, deepening relations with the United States

“I think you are going to have tremendous success and Gaza is going to be rebuilt,” Trump said Friday. “And you have some very wealthy countries, as you know, over there. It would take a small fraction of their wealth to do that. And I think they want to do it.”

The first phase of the ceasefire agreement calls for the release of the final 48 hostages held by Hamas, including about 20 believed to be alive; the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel; a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza; and a partial pullback by Israeli forces from Gaza's main cities.

Israeli troops on Friday finished withdrawing from parts of Gaza, triggering a 72-hour countdown under the deal for Hamas to release the Israeli hostages, potentially while Trump is on the ground there. He said he expected their return to be completed on Monday or Tuesday.

Trump will visit Israel first to meet with hostage families and address the Knesset, or parliament, an honor last extended to President George W. Bush during a visit in 2008. Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said Trump also was likely to meet with newly freed hostages, too.

“Knock on wood, but we feel very confident the hostages will be released and this president is actually traveling to the Middle East, likely this evening, in order to meet them and greet them in person,” Vance told CBS' “Face the Nation.”

Trump then stops in Egypt, where he and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi will lead a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh with leaders from more than 20 countries on peace in Gaza and the broader Middle East.

It is a tenuous truce and it is unclear whether the sides have reached any agreement on Gaza's postwar governance, the territory's reconstruction and Israel's demand that Hamas disarm. Negotiations over those issues could break down, and Israel has hinted it may resume military operations if its demands are not met.

“I think the chances of (Hamas) disarming themselves, you know, are pretty close to zero,” H.R. McMaster, a national security adviser during Trump's first term, said at an event hosted by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies on Thursday. He said he thought what probably would happen in the coming months is that the Israeli military “is going to have to destroy them.”

Israel continues to rule over millions of Palestinians without basic rights as settlements expand rapidly across the occupied West Bank. Despite growing international recognition, Palestinian statehood appears exceedingly remote because of Israel's opposition and actions on the ground, 

The war has left Israel isolated internationally and facing allegations of genocide, which it denies. International arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister are in effect, and the United Nations' highest court is considering allegations of genocide brought by South Africa.

Hamas has been militarily decimated and has given up its only bargaining chip with Israel by releasing the hostages. But the Islamic militant group is still intact and could eventually rebuild if there's an extended period of calm.

Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would continue with its demilitarization of Hamas after the hostages are returned.

“Hamas agreed to the deal only when it felt that the sword was on its neck — and it is still on its neck,” Netanyahu said Friday as Israel began to pull back its troops.

Much of Gaza has been reduced to rubble and rebuilding is expected to take years. The territory's roughly 2 million residents continue to struggle in desperate conditions.

Under the deal, Israel agreed to reopen five border crossings, which will help ease the flow of food and other supplies into Gaza, parts of which are experiencing famine.

Trump is also standing up a U.S.-led civil-military coordination center in Israel to help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into Gaza.

Roughly 200 U.S. troops will help support and monitor the ceasefire deal as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players. U.S. troops will not be sent to Gaza, Adm. Brad Cooper, the U.S. military commander for the region, said in a social media post Saturday.

The White House has signaled that Trump is looking to quickly return attention to building on a first-term effort known as the Abraham Accords, which forged diplomatic and commercial ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco.

A permanent agreement in Gaza would help pave the path for Trump to begin talks with Saudi Arabia as well Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country, toward normalizing ties with Israel, according to a senior Trump administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.

Such a deal with Saudi Arabia, the most powerful and wealthy Arab state, has the potential to reshape the region and boost Israel's standing in historic ways. 

But brokering such an agreement remains a heavy lift as the kingdom has said it won't officially recognize Israel before a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Hooters waitress Alli Lamb, who works at the Boca Raton, Florida, restaurant and appears on the back cover of the 2025 swimsuit calendar, tells Fox News Digital her three favorite foods she likes to order at work.

"Hooters makes you happy" was a lyric to a jingle from a series of 1990s television commercials about the Florida-founded restaurant chain.

It's one of the memorable catchphrases shared by once-loyal Hooters patrons during an era when the brand was appealing to single men and families alike.

Now, amid bankruptcy proceedings, the founding group — along with another franchisee — announced a plan earlier this year to reclaim control of the brand, which Hooters Inc. CEO Neil Kiefer told Fox News Digital strayed too far from the original vision under Hooters of America management.

HOOTERS PLANS TO MAKE ICONIC ORANGE SHORTS LESS REVEALING AS PART OF BRAND REBIRTH

While the buyer group awaits approval from a bankruptcy court, here's a trip down memory lane — featuring five facts about Hooters' history that may come as a surprise to some.

During a game of Parcheesi, six "semi-intellectual Clearwater businessmen" developed a sudden urge for Buffalo-style chicken wings, according to the website for Hooters Inc., which still operates the original Hooters location and nearly two dozen others throughout the Tampa Bay and Chicagoland areas.

SENIORS FLOCK TO SURPRISING NEW HOOTERS RESTAURANT IN FLORIDA RETIREMENT PARADISE: 'I'D COME BACK'

Knowing they couldn't agree on anything as a group, the "Hooters Six," as they came to be known, "decided to embark upon a major undertaking" and "open a place in Clearwater where other people of their caliber could gather and quench their thirst for the finer things in life."

But what would they call it?

"Simple — what else brings a gleam to men's eyes everywhere besides beer and chicken wings and an occasional winning football season? Hence, the name Hooters."

Hooters opened its flagship location in Oct. 1983.

The name is a double entendre, referring to both a slang term for women's breasts, giving birth to the "breastaurant" concept — and the logo, an owl known for its hooting calls.

Oh, and the owl mascot's name is Hootie.

Before young Hooters waitresses were widely welcomed into homes as bikini centerfolds in the annual Hooters calendar, they found fame on late-night television.

Hooters girls first hit the small screen in 1987, introducing and hosting a late-night movie of the week called "Hooters Nite Owl Theater."

Lynne Austin, the original Hooters calendar girl who also appeared as the July 1986 Playboy Playmate, was the debut host.

The syndicated show was later renamed "Hooters Movie of the Weak." And that's not a typo.

Syndicated in 13 major markets, the show became a hit with viewers for its comedy sketches and political skewers that bookended the movie and aired between commercial breaks, soon ranking No. 1 in its time slot, according to Hooters.

The show eventually moved to the afternoon before being yanked in 1995, "victim of a legal skirmish between Hooters of America and Hooters Inc."

Broadcasting + Cable magazine reported that comedian George Gray was set to host "Who Wants to Date a Hooters Girl?" — while Doug Schwartz, creator of the popular 1990s series "Baywatch," was attached as executive producer. The show never aired.

Hooters was more than just a restaurant chain. It was also a football team in the 1990s.

Under a marketing agreement with the restaurant chain, the team played as the Hooters from 1993-95.

After a paltry 11-26 record over three seasons, the sponsorship was terminated and the team relocated to West Palm Beach, taking on a new identity as the Florida Bobcats.

Hooters girls soared at 30,000 feet in the early 2000s.

Hooters Air, through a partnership with Pace Airlines, operated a Boeing fleet that flew to 15 U.S. destinations under a flat-fare model of $129 each way, according to Forbes.

The airline was founded by Robert Brooks, who was chairman of Hooters of America and had acquired Pace Airlines in 2002.

Adam Swart, CEO of Crowds on Demand, says the upcoming "No Kings" protest risks being exploited by agitators and interest groups "making money off chaos," while organizers defend their nonviolent record and security plans.

The head of a national crowd-for-hire firm is warning that America's protest culture has become a target for exploitation — by paid agitators, profit-driven interest groups and even foreign actors seeking to fuel division.

Adam Swart, CEO of Crowds on Demand, told Fox News Digital that his company has witnessed firsthand how demonstrations can be co-opted by people "making money off chaos" rather than advancing genuine civic causes.

"My concern is that there are forces — some domestic, some maybe foreign — that actually want to pull America apart," Swart said. "These aren't left or right actors. They're people making money off chaos."

His remarks come as organizers prepare for the "No Kings" protest, a nationwide demonstration planned for Oct. 18 that is expected to denounce political elitism and government overreach.

Swart said his company was approached about the event but declined to participate, calling it "a dud in the making" — another example, he said, of political theater that risks being exploited rather than achieving real persuasion.

"It's the same people saying the same things they've said every time — and getting the same results," he said.

Organizers behind the "No Kings" movement pushed back on Swart's characterization, saying the event is expected to draw turnout "comparable to or larger than" the first nationwide demonstration, which they claim attracted about 5 million participants.

A spokesperson told Fox News Digital the protest "has nothing to do with raising money or energizing voters," describing it instead as an effort to "demonstrate and build the resistance to the authoritarian."

The spokesperson said the movement is built around a commitment to nonviolence and employs extensive security and de-escalation training for volunteers.

"We're monitoring what's going on online in advance and being proactive against any identified threats," the spokesperson said, calling No Kings "mindful, thoughtful, organized and centered on nonviolence."

The spokesperson added that the first protest recorded "very few incidents" and described the movement as part of "a proud American tradition" of peaceful civic demonstrations.

While the movement has drawn support from some progressive groups, Swart said his concerns apply broadly — to any large-scale protest vulnerable to manipulation or infiltration.

Swart described what he calls a "protest industry" — an ecosystem of consultants, operatives and influencers who build brands and bankrolls from political outrage.

He said many movements, regardless of ideology, now operate less as grassroots expressions and more as "performative activism" built to attract funding, followers or online engagement.

"I've taken a pay cut to turn this into a company that advances common-sense causes," he said. "I could make 10 times more if I said yes to everything. But I don't want to be part of the noise."

Swart said Crowds on Demand now declines contracts that he views as divisive or volatile, choosing instead to support peaceful, purposeful demonstrations.

"I want to elevate productive expression — not mob theatrics," he said.

Swart cautioned that not all demonstrations are what they appear to be. In some cases, he said, interest groups or foreign entities can mirror legitimate advocacy networks — legally or otherwise — to obscure who is actually behind an event or campaign.

"I know how you'd structure a web of advocacy groups legally — and how someone could mirror that illegally," he said. "I want to help the government figure out who's funding the division and shut it down."

Swart said growing political polarization has created fertile ground for opportunists — both domestic and foreign — who thrive on outrage and confusion.

"Every time there's an incident, both sides start finger-pointing," he said. "The real winners are the ones trying to divide us. They want Democrats and Republicans blaming each other instead of asking who's profiting from it."

Swart said he's seen examples where the goal of protest activity was less about persuasion and more about generating viral conflict — an approach that, in his view, benefits those monetizing clicks, chaos and outrage.

His remarks echo recent U.S. intelligence warnings that foreign actors—particularly Russia, China and Iran—use disinformation to amplify divisive narratives in the U.S., and could try to spur unrest around major political events.

Swart also blamed major social-media platforms for monetizing outrage and accelerating polarization.

"They only make money when you're doom-scrolling," he said. "If people liked each other, Facebook and X would be a tenth of their size."

He said the problem cuts across ideological lines and is driven by the economics of engagement rather than politics.

"People try to label Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg politically, but both make money off division," Swart said. "It's not about right or left — it's about engagement."

Swart said the exploitation of division has become a national security concern, warning that agitators and influence networks may be working to destabilize the country for profit or geopolitical gain.

"This is one of the greatest national security threats that we face — America coming apart," he said. "The sources of it are not right or left. The sources are far more sinister than that."

Swart emphasized that his warnings aren't about any single protest or political movement but about a larger pattern — one where manipulation and misinformation can turn public expression into a tool for profit or chaos.

"The protest space has to be about purpose again," he said. "If we don't figure that out, we're going to keep getting played by the people who thrive on conflict."

Swart said he remains hopeful that awareness and transparency can help reduce the risks.

"Punch up, not down," he said. "Let's stop finger-pointing and start coalition-building."

            When Marcelo Lombardi, 45, complained he was feeling sleepy on a Friday, his family didn't think much of it.
    


            Lombardi often put in long hours running his family's 17-year-old real estate business in São Paulo, Brazil, working alongside two of his older sisters. A well-known attorney, he was a beloved figure in Sacomã, the southeastern neighborhood where he had lived for more than 35 years.
    


            Fernanda Lombardi, one of his sisters, recalled their life being “perfect” until that day, September 26. “Earlier in the week, he came home with some groceries, which included a bottle of vodka,” she told CNN. “It was his favorite liquor.”
    


            On Saturday, Marcelo woke up blind. “He told his wife he couldn't see anything but a big bright light,” Fernanda said. Upon arriving at the hospital, no one could tell the family what was wrong with Marcelo.
    


            “It took them about five hours to tell us that my brother had been poisoned,” Fernanda said. “By then, all of his organs were shutting down. He looked me in the eye and said, ‘I'm not leaving this place.'” Marcelo died the following day.
    


            The family later learned from health officials that the sips of the vodka cocktail he had casually enjoyed at home days before were laced with an invisible killer – industrial methanol. The colorless liquid is now responsible for an ongoing health crisis that has triggered a nationwide panic affecting about 100 million people across six states in Brazil, according to health authorities.
    


            Methanol is a clear, odorless, highly flammable liquid found in antifreeze, varnish and fuel. Ingesting just a few milliliters can cause blindness or death.
    


            Federal authorities are investigating several fronts to determine how industrial methanol entered Brazil's consumer alcohol supply. In Brazil, methanol commerce is regulated by the government, restricted to industrial uses such as biodiesel production, solvents, and laboratory applications. Its sale is legal but strictly controlled, and every transaction must be registered.
    


            One main line of investigation is that methanol, cheaper than ethanol, may have been intentionally used by counterfeiters to cut liquor production costs. Federal police are examining whether the chemical used by clandestine factories was purchased from gas stations and later diverted to illicit alcohol production. At least one gas station in São Paulo has been identified as a common supplier in several cases. Investigators are also probing whether smuggled or diverted industrial methanol entered Brazil's black market and if it has been used for bottle washing or sterilization by underground distilleries, contaminating drinks later sold illegally.

            As a precaution, health and trade associations are urging consumers and bars to destroy or properly dispose of empty bottles to prevent counterfeiters from reusing them in the production of fake liquor.
    


            Federal investigators have uncovered a massive black-market supply chain flooding bars, venues and homes with counterfeit liquor. So far, authorities have seized hundreds of thousands of fake labels, more than 100,000 of them just in the city of São Paulo, making it hard to estimate how far these poisonous bottles have been distributed.
    


            Joint operations by the Civil Police and the Health Surveillance Agency have led to the closure of four clandestine factories and the arrest of 41 people, according to a statement by the government of São Paulo.
    


            Lombardi was the third documented fatality since the crisis was announced by authorities in September, with the first cases dating to late August.
    


            As of October 8, Brazil's Health Ministry had logged 259 suspected cases nationwide, and five confirmed deaths – as well as confirmed poisonings in São Paulo, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul. All of the deaths have so far occurred in São Paulo, the epicenter of the crisis. Hospitals are also reporting rapid-onset blindness, irreversible comas and organ failure within hours of ingestion.
    


            Eduardo Capitani, toxicologist and pulmonologist at the Center for Intoxication Control at the University of Campinas, one of the country's leading poison-control and research centers, was one of the first to alert the government that a health emergency was underway. Between early and late September, his team saw 10 suspected cases across São Paulo and neighboring cities – enough to trigger a nationwide alert. That alert prompted a joint news conference by the Justice and Health ministries, announcing a coordinated investigation into the origin of the contaminated batches.
    


            “We've seen spikes before, in 2023 and 2024, among unhoused people who drank fuel-grade ethanol,” Capitani said. “This time, victims were drinking cocktails at bars and parties. These are not isolated cases.”
    


            Capitani said Brazil's public health system reacted quickly, but the crisis exposed deep structural weaknesses: Few hospitals have labs capable of testing for methanol or its toxic byproduct, formic acid, and fewer stocked the antidotes needed to treat patients fast.
    


            For Fernanda Lombardi, racing to find an antidote in pharmacies brought a feeling she will never forget. “It could've saved my brother's life, but it wasn't available anywhere. We felt powerless.”
    


            “Ethanol is nature's antidote to methanol,” Capitani explained. “In adulterated drinks, people may be consuming both the poison and its antidote – but in unpredictable proportions.”
    


            Symptoms often mimic a hangover: headache, nausea, dizziness. Within 24 hours, patients may lose their vision and struggle to breathe. If the person is untreated, the methanol metabolizes into formic acid, which attacks the optic nerve and nervous system, leading to blindness, organ failure or death within 48 hours.
    


            Treatment requires intravenous administration of ethanol or fomepizole, a specific antidote that blocks methanol's toxic conversion. Yet ethanol is scarce in most Brazilian hospitals, and fomepizole – approved in the United States and Europe since the 1990s – reached Brazil only this week through the emergency importation of 2,500 doses.
    


            Mariângela Batista Galvão Simão, Brazil's secretary of health and environmental surveillance, oversaw the arrival of the first batch of fomepizole at São Paulo's Guarulhos International Airport. “We're working to keep our antidote reserve full,” she told CNN on Thursday from the airport, “but it's hard to predict how much we'll need.”

            “There's no national antidote policy,” Capitani warned. “Many hospitals didn't have 100 percent ethanol in sufficient quantities. Until it arrives, sometimes hours later, that time can cost a patient their vision or life.”
    


            Brazil's Ministry of Health addressed the issue in a statement to CNN:
    


            “The ministry has been working since February this year on developing the National Antidote Policy, which will strengthen surveillance, access to medicines, and the training of healthcare professionals.”
    


            When pure ethanol isn't available, doctors may temporarily administer vodka, one of the purest forms of commercial ethanol. “But now,” Capitani cautioned, “that's become a Russian roulette, because even vodka could be contaminated.”
    


            Themis Mizerkowski Torres, a rheumatologist and toxicologist leading efforts at São Paulo's Center for Intoxication Control, says the crisis is unprecedented.
    


            “I have been with the center since 2004, and I have never seen anything like it,” she told CNN.
    


            “The guidance is to stay away from any alcoholic beverage for now.” And in the home country of the famous caipirinha drink, made from cachaça, lime and sugar, that is no easy feat.
    


            Torres explained that wine and beer are safer bets due to their fermentation process and how they are manufactured. But as Health Minister Alexandre Padilha stressed in a recent news conference, “there's no such thing as completely safe drinking right now.”
    


            In São Paulo, bars and restaurants in wealthy districts such as Itaim Bibi, Pinheiros and Berrini report steep drops in customers and cancellations of reservations. Some have stopped selling vodka, whiskey and cachaça entirely.
    


            From São Paulo to Pernambuco, fear now overshadows Brazil's vibrant bar culture – a sobering reminder of how one contaminated bottle can devastate families and test the country's ability to contain a crisis.
    


            Fernanda Lombardi says her brother's death destroyed their family and community.
    


            “He was healthy, hard-working, happy,” she said. “He didn't even go out – he drank a little vodka at home. That's what we can't understand.”
    


            The family turned the bottle over to police, but toxicology results have yet to be released.
    


            “My brother was murdered by greed,” she said. “Someone thought about money and not a human life. We want justice, so no other family has to go through this.”
    


            At his funeral, hundreds of mourners came to pay respects.
    


            “Everyone had a story about how he helped them, and I had no idea,” Fernanda Lombardi said. “He did good quietly.”

It's not millennial cringe to wonder if you can enjoy the work of problematic artists.

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. It's based on value pluralism — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

My partner and I are having a disagreement about JK Rowling that we want you to weigh in on. For reference, we're a same-sex couple, and despite our different upbringing, we tend to have similar moral compasses and political feelings. 

I love the Harry Potter world — books, movies, broadway plays, video games, etc. He never did. We both agree that JK Rowling's transphobia is problematic and not something we tolerate. However, I still want to engage in the Harry Potter world, which I feel sends a positive message overall. 

To assuage my guilt, whenever I buy something Harry Potter-related that might make JK Rowling any money, I then donate a larger sum of money to the Human Rights Campaign. This is only in addition to what we typically give to the HRC. Is this acceptable? Is this hypocrisy? Am I an ethical Slytherin? Settle this for us.

Dear Guilty Gryffindor,

Ah, the classic “can we separate the art from the artist” question! I've encountered this dilemma before, and I'll tell you straight off the bat that I'm not the type to condemn you as a Slytherin just because you still want to engage with the works of JK Rowling.

I'm totally fine with reading books penned by problematic writers — even if their views have seeped into the books themselves — because I believe I'm capable of separating the wheat from the chaff in these works. And I think it insults readers' intelligence to assume that they're not capable of that.

In fact, so many of us have practically had to become experts at this sort of literary winnowing, because 99 percent of the books humanity has thrown at us contain that chaff. I'm a queer Jewish woman, and if I had to excise from my library every book whose writer was anti-LGBTQ, antisemitic, or misogynist, my shelves would be pretty much empty!

In the case of JK Rowling, both the writer and the books themselves present us with problems. We all know at this point how anti-trans the writer is and how much pain she's caused her fans. And she's not an author who lived centuries ago; she's active right now, and she still profits from Potter-related purchases (more on that soon). Plus, the books themselves have flaws, too. Remember when the Dursleys are mocked by the text for being overweight? Or when the goblins are portrayed as an antisemitic stereotype? Or when the werewolves are presented as a metaphor for HIV? Or when we're told that the house elves actually like being enslaved because their race makes them naturally subservient?

Feel free to fill out this anonymous form! Newsletter subscribers will get my column before anyone else does and their questions will be prioritized for future editions. Sign up here!

Still, you say that you feel the Harry Potter world sends a positive message overall, and you know what? I agree with you. The main moral message of the books is this: We shouldn't live in a supremacist society. We shouldn't be like Voldemort or like the Death Eaters, who believe “pure-blood” wizards and witches are inherently better than everyone else. We shouldn't discriminate against people who are Muggle-born (like Hermione) or who are poor (like Ron). We should recognize that everyone (even Snape, the Slythiest of Slytherins!) has the agency to choose who they want to become and ultimately do good.

This is the core message that made so many of us fall in love with the Harry Potter world as kids. It made us feel that it's okay to be different — that difference should be respected and even celebrated. Even though Rowling often undercut that open-hearted message with nonsense like “rightfully” enslaved house elves, most of us picked up the main moral message in spite of these flaws. And in that way, the books successfully achieved what good fiction is meant to achieve.

“In the war against moral obtuseness, the artist is our fellow fighter, frequently our guide,” writes the contemporary philosopher Martha Nussbaum. By exposing us to scene after scene of characters encountering moral conundrums, Nussbaum argues, good fiction trains our capacity for moral attention — the capacity to notice the morally salient features of a given situation so that we can respond appropriately.

The Harry Potter books successfully trained a generation of young readers to be exquisitely sensitive to discrimination and to reject it. And it's on precisely that basis that many of those young readers, now all grown up, reject Rowling's anti-trans views.

These readers can choose to reject her books, too. Some do, and that's totally alright. But some don't — and I think that's totally alright too.

In a 2020 episode of the popular podcast Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, co-hosts Casper ter Kuile and Vanessa Zoltan interviewed trans author Jackson Bird. They drew an analogy between reading Harry Potter and reading the Bible: Just as the Bible contains anti-gay statements that can make it painful reading for queer readers, and yet some of those readers still lovingly engage with the text, the same can be true for the Harry Potter books. As Bird said of such texts, “We continue to interrogate, but we still acknowledge and accept the ways in which they are useful for us, or healing.”

The “continue to interrogate” part is key here. Any fandom — whether it's centered on the Christian canon or the Harry Potter canon — is responsible for continuously revising how its canonical texts do and don't get to guide action. If you're going to continue to engage with the Bible, then you have to keep grappling with all the ways it's enabled harm, and you have to try to heal that harm. And if you're going to continue to engage with the Harry Potter world, then you have to continue to wrestle with its wrongs, too.

The good news is: That's doable! Religious communities have been proving that for ages. As early as 2000 years ago, Jewish theologians were inventing a genre called Midrash, which is basically ancient fanfiction; it reimagines problematic bits of the Bible in ways that make them more palatable or meaningful. And over the centuries, many Muslim and Christian theologians have been busy transforming their traditions, giving us everything from Islamic Modernism to Black liberation theology.

So, for you, what can interrogating the Potter canon look like in practice? I'd suggest connecting with other Potterheads so you can both enjoy and interrogate the content together. Whether that's a book club, a movie-watching marathon, a video game night with friends, or a Harry Potter and the Sacred Text episode that you listen to with your partner in the car, the point is to engage with the content and then critically discuss it.

The benefit of doing this in community is that it can actually generate social good. If you end up discussing the house elves, say, you might end up talking about how even the good guys in Rowling's books are way too content with maintaining the status quo rather than calling for systemic change (Dumbledore treats his enslaved house elves nicely, but he still enslaves house elves!). That could lead you into all sorts of discussions about how you are or aren't challenging the status quo in our Muggle world.

If you engage with Rowling's work this way, I think it's plausible that the positive social value you'll be generating will outweigh any negative social value you might create by continuing to be a Potterhead. And, crucially, I suspect you'll stop feeling guilty.

Right now, your strategy to ward off guilt is to focus on the financial aspect of all this — how your Potter-related purchases end up materially benefiting Rowling and, through her, the type of organizations she might support. On a dollar-for-dollar level, this is something you can “offset” by donating to the Human Rights Campaign. In fact, since Rowling is already a billionaire, buying a video game now is not appreciably moving the needle for her, while donating hundreds or thousands of dollars to the HRC could plausibly make a difference to that nonprofit. So this strategy is nothing to sneeze at.

But it's not enough. And we can tell it's not enough because you still feel guilty. You probably have some intuitive sense that you can't just buy moral absolution (Accio clear conscience!). On its own, offsetting feels cheap, and the reason it feels cheap is that it's not demanding that any transformative work take place — either for you personally or for society more broadly.

To reiterate a common critique of philanthropy: Just writing a check does not represent a commitment to a broader project of solidarity or justice. It's letting you throw a pittance at the problem without requiring you to participate, through your own hard work, in changing the status quo and creating systemic change.

Remember, shying away from systemic change is how Rowling deals with problems in her books. You can do better.

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Afghanistan said Sunday it killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in overnight border operations, in response to what it called repeated violations of its territory and airspace. Pakistan's army gave far lower casualty figures, saying 23 troops were killed. 

Earlier in the week, Afghan authorities accused Pakistan of bombing the capital, Kabul, and a market in the country's east. Pakistan did not claim responsibility for the assault.

The Taliban government's chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said Afghan forces have captured 25 Pakistani army posts, leaving 30 Pakistani soldiers wounded.

“The situation on all official borders and de facto lines of Afghanistan is under complete control, and illegal activities have been largely prevented,” Mujahid told a news conference in Kabul. 

Pakistan has previously struck locations inside Afghanistan, targeting what it alleges are militant hideouts, but these have been in remote and mountainous areas. The two sides have also skirmished along the border in the past. Saturday night's heavy clashes underscore the deepening tensions.

The Taliban government's Defense Ministry said early Sunday morning its forces had conducted “retaliatory and successful operations” along the border.

“If the opposing side again violates Afghanistan's territorial integrity, our armed forces are fully prepared to defend the nation's borders and will deliver a strong response,” the ministry added. 




The Torkham crossing, one of two main trade routes between the two countries, did not open on Sunday at its usual time of 8 a.m. 

The crossing at Chaman, southwest Pakistan, was also closed. People, including Afghan refugees leaving Pakistan, were turned away due to the worsening security situation. 

An Associated Press reporter in Chaman heard jets over Spin Boldak, a city in Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province, and saw smoke rising after an explosion. 

Pakistan accuses Afghan authorities of harboring members of the banned group Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Islamabad says the group carries out deadly attacks inside Pakistan, but Kabul denies the charge, saying it does not allow its territory to be used against other countries.

Pakistan is grappling with surging militancy, especially in areas bordering Afghanistan. It also accuses its nuclear-armed neighbor and rival India of backing armed groups, without providing any evidence. 

The overnight border clashes could fuel regional instability, as India and Pakistan came close to war earlier this year after a tourist massacre in the disputed region of Kashmir.

India has also boosted its relations with Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, most recently announcing an upgrade of its technical mission in Kabul to a full embassy. 

The Saudi Foreign Ministry called for “restraint, avoidance of escalation and the adoption of dialogue and wisdom to help de-escalate tensions and maintain the security and stability of the region.” Saudi Arabia just reached a mutual defense pact with Pakistan. Qatar also urged restraint.

The Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who is in India on an official visit, told journalists that Afghanistan respected the calls made by the two Gulf powers to stop what he called “retaliatory strikes” against Pakistan. But he also warned that Kabul reserved the right to protect itself.

“We want a peaceful resolution of the situation, but if the peace efforts don't succeed, we have other options,” Muttaqi said.

Before the Afghan claim of casualties, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the assault and said the country's army “not only gave a befitting reply to Afghanistan's provocations but also destroyed several of their posts, forcing them to retreat.” 

Pakistani security officials shared videos purporting to show destroyed Afghan checkpoints, but the footage could not be independently verified because the media does not have access to these areas.

The Pakistani army said more than 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralized, while the number of injured is much higher.”

According to Pakistani security officials, Afghan forces opened fire in several northwestern border areas in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 

One official in Islamabad told The Associated Press that Pakistan had taken control of 19 Afghan border posts from where attacks were being launched. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. 

“The Taliban personnel at these posts have either been killed or fled. Fires and visible destruction have been observed at the captured Afghan posts,” the official added. 

The two countries share a 2,611-kilometer (1,622-mile) border known as the Durand Line, but Afghanistan has never recognized it.

President Donald Trump's family is cashing in on the presidential spotlight with less pushback than in the past.

During Trump's first administration, first daughter Ivanka, for example, was criticized for her brand endorsements, including a social media post about Goya beans. Ethics experts at the time complained that she, as a presidential adviser and federal employee, broke federal law.

Five years later, with no members of the first family part of the president's second administration, first granddaughter Kai Trump last month launched her own clothing line using photographs taken at the White House and first son Eric Trump this month is embarking on a book tour for his new memoir, “Under Siege: My Family's Fight to Save Our Nation,” with fewer or at least less vocal critics. 

FULL LIST OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT

Earlier this year, eldest first son Donald Trump Jr., also opened a private social club called the Executive Branch with membership fees reportedly $500,000, Eric's former Republican National Committee co-chair wife Lara, debuted a new television show on Fox News, and first lady Melania Trump created a memecoin. The first lady's documentary, Melania, for which Amazon MGM Studios paid $40 million, is being released on Jan. 30, too.

For Public Citizen government affairs lobbyist Craig Holman, the Trump family “cashing in” on the presidency “is a family affair on a scale never before seen in American political history,” as other experts underscore that it is not illegal.

“There have been occasional embarrassments to former presidents by a relative seeking financial gain from a family member serving as president, such as Hunter Biden receiving consulting fees from foreign governments and Billy Carter lending his family's reputation to sell a beer,” Holman told the Washington Examiner. “But nothing on the scale of the profiteering engineered by multiple family members of Donald Trump.”

Sometimes the profiteering benefits both Trump and the family member, including Eric Trump's book, which is out next Tuesday, according to Holman. Instead of following older sister Ivanka to the White House in 2017, Eric and Don Jr. have remained executives at the Trump Organization. Eric's portfolio incorporates Trump Hotels, Trump Golf, Trump Estates, and Trump Winery, in addition to the company's investments in cryptocurrency.

“The book features a foreword supposedly written by Donald Trump, and goes on to depict President Trump and various members of the Trump family in heroic perspectives,” Holman said. “The book has already become a bestseller on Amazon and will deliver Eric a very handsome profit.”

Sometimes the profiteering rewards the family member responsible for the sales, including Kai Trump's clothing line, Colman added. The 18-year-old golfer's profile has increased exponentially since her primetime appearance during last year's Republican National Convention.

“For monogrammed sweatshirts priced at $130 each, Kai's financial gain will also prove to be lucrative,” he said. “Early orders of the sweatshirt have already sold out because of high demand.”

Eric Trump spokeswoman Kimberly Benza dismissed ethics concerns regarding her boss, particularly with respect to his upcoming book.

“Unlike Hunter Biden, who cashed in on his father's position, selling influence and finger paintings, Eric Trump is a businessman, who has been in the private industry for 25 years, employing tens of thousands of people and has spent the last decade enduring relentless attacks from the radical left — attacks aimed at destroying his family, their business, and his father's legacy,” Benza told the Washington Examiner. There truly is no comparison.”

To that end, Hunter Biden wrote his own memoir in 2021 called Beautiful Things. His father, then-President Joe Biden, praised him for his “strength and courage to talk openly about his addiction so that others might see themselves in his journey and find hope.”

Another example from Hunter Biden, other than his amateur artwork being valued at $500,000, includes a report this week that he pursued a real estate deal in 2017 with a Chinese company for land around the U.S. Embassy in Romania predicated on relationships formed when his father was vice president.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN THE US: A TIMELINE OF KEY INCIDENTS 

The younger Biden, himself, has conceded he would not have had a $50,000-a-month seat on the board of Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings, which was central to Trump's first impeachment, if the elder Biden had not been vice president and leading Obama administration foreign policy in the region.

“I don't think that there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden,” Hunter said in 2019. “There's literally nothing, as a young man or as a full grown adult that — my father in some way hasn't had influence over. It does not serve either one of us.”

A spokesperson for Kai Trump did not respond to the Washington Examiner's repeated requests for comment.

The New Yorker has estimated that the Trump family made $3.4 billion from the presidency between 2017 and August, including the $1 million membership fee for the president's Mar-a-Lago private resort in West Palm Beach, Florida, though about two-thirds of that amount is thought to be from cryptocurrency. 

Don Jr. and Eric Trump were criticized to an extent before the president's trip to the Middle East in May after they preceded his travel with their own to the region to promote the family's business interests, encompassing a $1 billion luxury hotel in the United Arab Emirates, a villa complex in Qatar, even a $2 billion investment from an Abu Dhabi firm into crypto exchange Binance that was facilitated by the Trump Organization's World Liberty Financial.

Claremont McKenna College politics professor John Pitney agreed with Public Citizen's Colman that “there is no real precedent for the scale and brazenness of the Trumps' profiteering,” citing Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, who Pitney told the Washington Examiner has “made a fortune from the Saudis.”

Kushner has been in the Middle East this week, despite not formally being part of the administration, to help negotiate the peace deal between Israel and Hamas, as well as to have meetings with the likes of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, alongside U.S. Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff, after multiple sit-downs with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Kushner last month struck a different deal with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and other stakeholders to take video-game maker Electronic Arts private through a $55 billion deal that is the largest leveraged buyout in history so far.

The Washington Examiner asked Trump this week about Kushner's role in the Israel-Hamas peace process. The president said, “Jared is a very smart guy,” especially after his experience during the first administration with the Abraham Accords. The Abraham Accords normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries.

“He's a very smart person, and he knows the region, knows the people, knows a lot of the players,” Trump continued. “We had a very smart group of people working this. We had a lot of different players, different countries, and very diverse countries, very different from each other.”

Earlier this month, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt condemned a reporter for asking how the administration decided it was “appropriate” for Kushner to become an emissary to “Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia — three countries that combined have given him more than $2.5 billion for his investment firm,” Affinity Partners.

“I think it's frankly despicable that you're trying to suggest that it's inappropriate for Jared Kushner, who is widely respected around the world and has great trust and relationships with these critical partners in these countries, to strike a 20-point comprehensive, detailed peace plan that no other administration would ever be able to achieve,” Leavitt said. “Jared is donating his energy and his time to our government, to the president of the United States, to secure world peace, and that is a very noble thing.”

For Pitney, the Claremont McKenna College professor, “the most unusual part” is Trump's participation, with the president's own memecoin providing foreign and domestic “influence-seekers” with an opportunity “to put vast sums into [his] own pocket.” 

Other examples include Trump's announcement last month that he would hold next year's Group of 20 leaders summit at his golf course in Miami, Florida, after the same proposal was postponed during his first administration because of ethics concerns and the COVID-19 pandemic – not to mention his own merchandise, from gold sneakers to bibles.

TRUMP BETS ON KUSHNER AND WITKOFF TO SEE THROUGH ISRAEL AND HAMAS PEACE DEAL

Regardless, Northeastern University politics professor Costas Panagopoulos reiterated that “while some may find capitalizing on these opportunities distasteful, it does not mean it is necessarily illegal or even unethical.”

“Of course, in some cases, some politicians or their associates cross the line and engage in corrupt practices, but that is not always the case,” Panagopoulos told the Washington Examiner.

            An impactful nor'easter is strengthening and unleashing damaging wind gusts, heavy rain and coastal flooding as it tracks up the mid-Atlantic coast.
    


            The storm is packing a serious punch as it slowly moves north and disrupts air travel at major Northeast airports and threatens to push the ocean into homes and onto roads along the mid-Atlantic coast.
    


            This coastal storm is called a nor'easter due to the prevailing wind direction from the northeast ahead of its center. These northeast winds push water toward the coast, causing it to erode beaches and pile up and cause flooding.
    


Here's the latest:



            Dozens of river gauge locations are expected to reach moderate or major flood stage, the most severe level, from this nor'easter. Areas from the Virginia Tidewater into Delaware and southern New Jersey are of particular concern.
    


            The major coastal flooding could inundate roads and homes, as well as cause beach erosion when combined with the heavy rain and strong winds.
    


            Water levels could climb near major flood stage Sunday afternoon at Atlantic City, New Jersey, and then rise above 8 feet Monday, which would be the highest level observed since Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Atlantic City water levels were nearing moderate flood stage early Sunday afternoon and enough floodwater had already come ashore to shut down Route 40 in both directions in and out of the city. Levels at Cape May, New Jersey, are projected to reach over 8 feet and would be the third-highest on record and the highest since January 2016.
    


            The slow movement of the nor'easter will result in multiple rounds of coastal flooding and increase the beach erosion potential up and down the East Coast.
    


            This potent coastal storm has already caused coastal flooding in the Southeast. Portions of North Carolina Highway 12 are closed Sunday due to ocean overwash. The Department of Transportation has warned drivers that travel is dangerous in the Outer Banks.
    


            Ongoing beach erosion in the Outer Banks will add to concerns there. At least nine unoccupied homes have collapsed into the Atlantic since September 30 due to intense wave action and erosion from recent storms.
    


            Charleston Harbor in South Carolina reached major flood stage Saturday afternoon and Friday morning, flooding streets there.
    


            Heavy rain is also amping up the threat level: The motorists rescued from floodwater in Georgetown, South Carolina, were “checked on by fire personnel, removed from their vehicles and brought to dry ground,” Ellis said, adding no injuries have been reported. He did not have an exact number of people rescued but estimated about a half dozen were assisted within the city.
    


            Though officials there hope the worst is behind them, Ellis urged motorists to “turn around, don't drown” when encountering flood water or barricades. 



            Leaders up and down the East Coast have told residents in their states to be cautious. Acting New Jersey Gov. Tahesha Way declared a state of emergency that went into effect Saturday night “out of an abundance of caution,” asking residents to stay off the roads “unless absolutely necessary.”
    


            Governors like Kathy Hochul of New York and Wes Moore of Maryland stopped short of declaring emergencies but still urged vigilance.
    


            “I also encourage all Marylanders to ensure their loved ones and neighbors are properly monitoring the potential for high winds, rain, and flooding,” Moore said. “Take care of yourself. Take care of your people.”
    


            Atlantic City has been getting ready for the storm over the last week, Mayor Marty Small Sr. told CNN on Sunday, adding the city had learned from past storms like Sandy how best to prepare.
    


            “We always prepare for the worst and keep hoping for the best,” the city's Acting Emergency Management Coordinator Michael Famularo told CNN.
    


            Climate change is supercharging the winds of the strongest nor'easters, a recent study found, and this one has the potential to bring significant impacts to multiple locations along the East Coast.
    


            Strong, prolonged damaging wind gusts of 40 to 55 mph will lash the coast as the storm crawls north. Some of the strongest gusts over 55 mph are expected from New Jersey into southern New England. These wind gusts are as strong as what a tropical storm produces, despite this storm not being classified as one.
    


            The high winds could last into Tuesday morning along the Northeast coast and could down tree branches and send unsecured objects flying. 



            Power outages are possible, especially in coastal areas, and gusty winds will stretch farther inland to more heavily populated areas. Windy conditions will likely cause air travel delays and cancellations Sunday and Monday for major hubs like Washington, DC, New York City and Boston.
    


            Rainfall of 1 to 3 inches will be common along the East Coast, with some spots in eastern North Carolina and southeastern New England possibly picking up totals of up to 6 inches. Localized flash flooding will be a concern in areas that experience multiple rounds of heavy rain.
    


            The nor'easter will finally either weaken or pull away from the coast Tuesday. High pressure will build in behind the storm, resulting in dry weather and decreasing winds.

            The families of 16 victims killed in a devastating blast at a Tennessee explosives plant have been notified of their loss, as investigators methodically work to clear the scene and gather evidence to determine what caused the tragedy in the tight-knit community.
    


            In the coming days, authorities will slowly work their way through the debris-ridden plant “foot by foot,” ensuring each area of the site, approximately half a square mile, is safe for those at the scene.
    


            “Due to the constraints that we have here … we're literally having to take one foot at a time,” said Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis.
    


            The thundering early morning blast at Accurate Energetic Systems reverberated across the surrounding community Friday, razing an entire building on the plant's sprawling campus and leading to a painstaking search that ultimately found no survivors.
    


            “We're moving to recovery,” an emotional Davis said during a news conference Saturday, his voice trailing off at times.
    


            With the investigation still in its early stages, the cause of the explosion has not yet been determined, according to Tyra Cunningham, assistant special agent in charge at the Nashville division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Explosives.
    


            “Every effort is being made to conduct a thorough, methodical and science-based investigation to find the answers that led to this tragedy and the answers that this community deserves,” Cunningham said at a news conference Saturday evening.
    


            Investigators are starting at the outside of the scene and working their way into where they believe the blast originated, said Brice McCracken, special agent in charge at the ATF's National Center for Explosives Training and Research.
    


            “Once we get inside there, then we'll start looking at what's remaining, what is in that scene,” he said. “The team will document every piece of evidence that we recover as we move from that outside to the inner explosive scene,” McCracken said.
    


            Investigators are also pulling employment records and conducting controlled explosions, a source familiar with the investigation said.
    


            ATF will ensure “that if criminal activity is involved, those responsible will be held accountable, and if it was accidental, that lessons have been learned to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again,” Cunningham said.
    


            Meanwhile, the central Tennessee community that is home to the plant is grappling with a wave of grief as 16 of their families try to make sense of the tragedy.
    


            “We need our communities to come together and understand that we've lost a lot of people. This don't only affect those families, it runs deeper … this could be people that you grew up with,” Davis said.
    


            Accurate Energetic Systems – a manufacturer of military and demolition explosives – employs around 80 people, including scores of local residents.
    


            “This is their extended family,” Davis said Saturday.
    


            Spread across 1,300 acres in a rural, wooded area, the site consists of five production buildings and a quality lab, according to a company profile from the nongovernmental Association of the United States Army, which lists AES as a sponsor.
    


            Sammy Creech, a 78-year-old former employee who lives about 12 miles away from the facility, thought the explosion was an earthquake at first.
    


            “The blast shook our house,” he told CNN Saturday.
    


            Then, the chilling news came: about a dozen of Creech's friends and former co-workers were at the facility when the blast happened. He described them as “good people” from neighboring counties.
    


            “I might've slept three hours last night, off and on,” Creech said. “I could see their faces. I can hear their voices.”
    


            The incident hit close to home for Creech, who used to eat lunch almost daily in the building where the explosion happened. Employees would change shifts around the time the explosion happened at 7:45 a.m., which is likely why there were so many in the building at the time, he said.
    


            Creech said the victims were “really good friends” that he “really enjoyed just about all of them.”
    


            “I'm really tired,” he said. “And I just feel sorry for all their families.”
    


            Safety concerns have previously been raised at the plant, which faced federal fines several years ago related to workplace safety practices, according to federal records.
    


            The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company $7,200 after a 2019 inspection found violations related to personal protective equipment, employee exposure to contaminants and inadequate safety training, among other citations. The company contested the findings and eventually reached a formal settlement, OSHA records show.
    


            The company has reported 46 work-related injuries and no deaths since 2016, the earliest year on record. In 2024, the most recent year for which data is available, the company reported five injuries and one illness.
    


            In 2021, Creech sued the company, alleging wrongful termination after being blamed for a fire that broke out at the facility the previous year. Creech alleged he had been discriminated against because of his age.
    


            “There was a few times there was some slurs and comments about my age,” he said.
    


            Creech, a diabetic, said the company did not like that he took snack breaks during the day to keep his blood sugar regulated. His supervisors were repeatedly told by plant management to replace Creech because he was “too old and too slow” to complete his job duties, the complaint filed in the lawsuit alleges.
    


            “It hurt my feelings. It bothered me a great deal…how they were treating me,” he said.
    


            The fire happened in October 2020, in the same building where Friday's explosion happened, according to Creech, who said he was told days later he was being terminated for “poor housekeeping” that contributed to the fire. An investigation was conducted, but Creech said he was not asked for a statement.
    


            “I tried to talk and reason with them…they seemed to enjoy the dismissal,” he said. “I was very ashamed that I was fired.”
    


            The company disputed Creech's claim that he was wrongfully terminated, and the case was dropped after mediation.
    


            Friday's tragedy has placed a heavy strain on the area's close-knit community, many of whom have come together at vigils honoring the victims and praying for them.
    


            “When you have small counties like this, we know each other … we love each other,” Davis said.
    


            Among those believed to have died was Melissa Dawn Stanford, a 53-year-old production supervisor at the plant, her niece, Brittany Kirouac, told CNN in a statement Saturday. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation informed Kirouac they don't believe her aunt could have survived, she said.
    


            “To say our family is devastated is to put it lightly. We are honestly at a loss for words and grief is not linear. In the past 24 hours I have seen: anger, sadness, bargaining, denial, and acceptance,” Kirouac said.
    


            “Not only from our family, but from the families who surrounded us waiting to hear news about their loved ones,” she continued. “At this time, we are just hoping to bring her home to say goodbye.”
    


            Kirouac asked for prayers as her family, like so many others, attempts to “navigate these coming days, weeks, and months.”
    


            On Saturday, local Janie Brown sought comfort at a prayer vigil at a chapel in McEwen, Tennessee. She said she knew and worked with some victims and their families.
    


            “It's going to be a sad, sad day in our community for a while,” she lamented, urging people to “give us time to heal, and pray for us.”
    


            The focus now should be on the families, not on how the tragedy occurred, she said.
    


            “The time is not to worry about why it happened. It's to worry about who it happened to, the families,” said Brown, adding the victims “were loved by their families and by their communities … Everybody knew them.”
    


            For some, the deadly blast brought back painful memories of another past disaster that swept the area years ago.
    


            “Both our counties was hit pretty hard in '21,” Davis said as he choked up, seemingly referring to devastating flooding that hit Humphreys County, killing 20 people and destroying or damaging hundreds of homes and businesses.
    


            “We've already taken plans to prepare to take care of our loved ones and our families even more,” he said.
    


            Counseling will be provided at schools starting Monday to help families involved, Davis said.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A Chinese coast guard ship used a powerful water cannon on Sunday then rammed and slightly damaged an anchored Philippine government vessel off an island inhabited by Filipinos in the disputed South China Sea, the Philippine coast guard said.

There were no injuries among Filipino crewmen of the BRP Datu Pagbuaya, part of the fisheries fleet that provides support to Filipino fishermen. The Chinese coast guard targeted Pagbuaya off the Philippines-occupied Thitu island in the latest flare-up of the long-simmering territorial disputes involving Manila, Beijing and four other governments.

The Chinese coast guard accused the Philippine vessels of illegally entering what it called Chinese waters near a cluster of sandbars known as Sandy Cay, which lies between Thitu and China's artificial island base called Subi and “ignoring repeated stern warnings from the Chinese side.” It said it “took control measures against the Philippine vessels in accordance with the law and resolutely drove them away.”

China has repeatedly restated its sovereignty and control over virtually the entire South China Sea, a major trade route, despite a 2016 arbitration ruling that invalidated its historic claims. That ruling has been rejected by China but supported by the United States and its Western and Asian allies, including Japan, Australia, the European Union and Canada.

The U.S. immediately condemned “China's aggressive actions in defiance of international law” and expressed support for the Philippines, a close Asian treaty ally. U.S. Ambassador to Manila MaryKay Carlson praised the Filipino personnel involved in the incident for their “tremendous valor and skill in the face of China's dangerous ramming and use of water cannons.”




Pagbuaya and two other Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources vessels were anchored in the territorial waters off Thitu, called Pag-asa by the Philippines, when Chinese coast guard and suspected militia ships suddenly approached and staged “dangerous and provocative maneuvers,” the Philippine coast guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela said in a statement. He added that such aggression would not prompt Manila to “surrender a square inch of our territory to any foreign power.”

A Chinese coast guard ship with bow number 21559 “fired its water cannon directly at the BRP Datu Pagbuaya, hitting the vessel,” then rammed the stern of the Philippine fisheries vessel three minutes later, causing “minor structural damage but no injuries to the crew.”

Video issued by the Philippine coast guard shows a Chinese coast guard ship firing a water cannon, hitting the vessel and its two Philippine flags. The Filipino-manned ship is seen moving away from the Chinese coast guard ship.

“Despite these bullying tactics and aggressive actions, the Philippine coast guard and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources remain resolute,” Tarriela said. “We will not be intimidated or driven away.”

In Beijing, Chinese coast guard spokesperson Liu Dejun said in a statement the two Philippine vessels illegally entered waters near Sandy Cay, which China calls Tiexian Reef, “without the permission of the Chinese government.” One dangerously approached the Chinese Coast Guard vessel, causing a scrape, he said.

 The responsibility rests entirely with the Philippine side, Liu said, accusing the Philippines of undermining the peace and stability in the South China Sea and ”sternly warned” the Southeast Asian country “to immediately stop infringement and harassment.”

“The harassment we faced today only strengthens our resolve,” Philippine coast guard commandant Admiral Ronnie Gil Gavan said. “Filipino fisherfolk depend on these waters and neither water cannons nor ramming will deter us from fulfilling our commitment to Pres. Ferdinand Marcos to not surrender a square inch of our territory to any foreign power.”

Thitu is the largest of nine islands, islets and reefs inhabited by Philippine forces and also has a fishing community in the Spratlys archipelago, the most fiercely disputed region of the South China Sea, where China turned seven barren reefs into island bases protected by a missile system. Three of the artificial islands have runways, including Subi, which lies just more than 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Thitu, which China also claims.

WAKE FOREST, N.C. (AP) — Thousands turned out Saturday in this Baptist seminary town to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community, but the current political climate was never far from their thoughts.

“If we're paying attention, we're seeing what could happen,” said Amanda Cottrill, co-chair of Wake Forest Pride Fest. “History repeats itself, (which is) why it's so important for us to be learning and celebrating history.”

This year's event coincided with National Coming Out Day. It also came at a time when President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to bar transgender people from serving in the military and issuing orders about biological sex and gender.

Police watched from atop the town hall and patrolled the streets with dogs, as people in rainbow clothing confronted a group that came to sing hymns and wave signs telling them to repent. There were applause and tears in the crowd as author, activist and former youth pastor John Pavlovitz spoke from a stage. 

“We are going through it right now, but we're going through it together,” Pavlovitz said as he paced the plaza in brightly-colored sneakers. “We will not allow ourselves or the people we care about to be dehumanized or mistreated or erased. We will not stand for it.”

Phoenix Bilodeau, who is transgender, said they always worry about violence when attending such public events.

“They've already designated trans as terrorists,” Bilodeau said. “So, like, maybe next they're going to say, like, we're enemies of the state. I don't know. And so it's just scary, because you don't even know what's going to happen.”




Wake Forest, just north of the state capital, is home to the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. 

In front of the town hall, people banged drums and shouted as the group sang hymns and waved signs. Local farmer Will Arterburn, who organized the singing, lamented the attempts to drown them out.

“This particular event is directly against the scriptures and the teachings of the Bible,” he said. “Sexual immorality on display in the public square. And we wanted to be here as a presence of light, to oppose the principalities and powers on display here.”

Nikki Lyons, whose family moved here from California about a year and a half ago, laughed as she watched her 2-year-old daughter, Maeve, use a miniature Pride flag to joust with a blow-up man. Lyons said events like this are more important than ever.

“We have to come together and stand against this administration,” Lyons said, choking up with emotion and scooping her daughter up in a hug. “Because we all deserve to be loved.”

When my partner and I began planning a couple's trip to Tunisia, we decided to do something different. Instead of turning to travel sites, we let AI take the lead.

Recently, I've outsourced a lot of my life to ChatGPT — from work projects to personal errands. So, I thought, why not travel planning, too?

ChatGPT has always been my top choice, but my partner wanted to see what Claude—the one she likes the most—would plan for our Italian holiday.

We wanted to see which AI bot planned the best trip. But through this friendly competition, we learned just how differently my partner and I like to travel.

We didn't want chaos, so we set limits. We picked our timeline and the cities in advance: Tunis, Tozeur, and Hammamet.

Then we handed the itinerary-building over to the bots, with each AI designing one full day in each city.

Of course, there were overlaps, but they each produced different trips.

ChatGPT, for example, came back with what felt like a movie script. Tunis started with a sunrise walk through Sidi Bou Saïd, pastries and mint tea in hand, followed by a whirlwind through the Medina and a dramatic half-day at the ruins of Carthage. Then, in Tozeur, it pulled the cinematic card with "Star Wars" filming sets in the desert, and camel rides across dunes at sunset. Hammamet, meanwhile, was framed as a finale of seaside lounging, alternating between couscous feasts and beach walks. It was ambitious, colorful, and a little chaotic — but also thrilling.

Claude's version was slower and more contained. In Tunis, it recommended a guided food tour, before sending us to Carthage for a more paced, historical visit. In Tozeur, it skipped the desert dash altogether, focusing instead on the Medina and a relaxed afternoon by an oasis. It also added two important cultural pit stops we hadn't considered. Hammamet was stripped back to a cultural visit to the Kasbah and an early dinner overlooking the water. Less cinematic, more logical.

Of course, we then needed to build our own itinerary, taking activities recommended by both lists.

ChatGPT's ambitious Tozeur day nearly flattened us. The long drive was far from the breezy jaunt it implied, and when we finally got close, a sandstorm had blocked the highway. "The Star Wars" sets were out of reach, proof that no itinerary can control nature.

Still, other parts of ChatGPT's plan delivered — like Sidi Bou Saïd, where whitewashed walls and cobalt-blue shutters glowed in the sun as we sipped mint tea above the sea. It felt like stepping into a painting.

Claude's food tour in Tunis was a big highlight. We enjoyed sesame-coated pastries as we drifted through narrow streets, pointing toward stalls and corners we would never have found on our own.

Claude also surprised us with two inspired detours: the Great Mosque of Kairouan and El Jem amphitheater. Both were extraordinary stops, layered with history and stillness.

As the trip unfolded, it became clear we were not just comparing AI bots. We were surprised to see our own travel personalities reflected back at us.

ChatGPT's energy mirrored mine: scattershot but adventurous, willing to gamble on exhaustion for the sake of a memory. Claude's calm matched my partner: thoughtful, practical, deliberate.

If we are scoring, ChatGPT delivered the better memories. Claude delivered comfort and culture. But neither really won.

What they gave us was a way of traveling that reflected us back at ourselves — two personalities and two rhythms woven into one trip.

Tunisia was beautiful, bewildering, and slightly AI-engineered. It proved that the best journey is never about choosing one itinerary over the other but about learning how we move through the world together, even when the paths are different.

Investors are looking beyond the prolonged U.S. government shutdown and remain optimistic about growth drivers like the artificial intelligence boom and expectations of further interest rate cuts.

Ignoring the short-term noise, those looking for attractive investment opportunities can consider the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts, whose recommendations are based on a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals and growth catalysts.

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

First on this week's list is Snowflake (SNOW), a cloud-native data platform. At the recently held Snowflake World Tour event in New York City, the company highlighted its product innovation and the vision for driving business transformation through data and artificial intelligence.

After attending this customer conference, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated a buy rating on SNOW stock with a price forecast of $270. Based on his conversations with customers and partners at the event, the analyst noted that Snowflake's product innovation and velocity are accelerating.

Thill highlighted that while traction for Snowflake's AI offerings is building, the inflection point is still ahead. For instance, the top-rated analyst noted that a retailer using Snowpark ML for demand forecasting, and a travel company integrating Snowflake ML models into its customer experience pipeline, both believe that broader usage across their organizations will take a few more quarters.

Another key takeaway was that Snowflake's unstructured data capabilities have strengthened, but there are still some gaps to address. Overall, Thill believes that while traction is building for Snowflake, the "AI Blizzard" still lies ahead.

"SNOW remains one of our favorite data & AI stories and stands to benefit meaningfully as enterprise AI strategies mature and AI driven data volumes grow exponentially in the coming years," concluded Thill. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a "neutral" rating on Snowflake stock with a price target of $255.

Thill ranks No. 251 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.1%. See Snowflake Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Moving on to chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which recently made headlines after announcing a game-changing partnership with OpenAI. Under this deal, OpenAI will deploy up to 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs over multiple years, starting with a 1-gigawatt rollout in the second half of 2026. The agreement also involves a warrant for up to 160 million shares (vesting tied to certain milestones), which, if fully exercised by OpenAI, will give it about a 10% stake in AMD.

Following the news, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis upgraded AMD stock to buy from hold and boosted the price target to $300 from $170. Additionally, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on AMD stock with a price target of $232.

Curtis believes that AMD's deal with OpenAI clearly changed the AI narrative for the semiconductor company. While the chipmaker will still have to achieve some milestones, the 5-star analyst believes that this partnership is a solid confirmation of AMD's AI roadmap and a proof of robust AI demand in general.

Interestingly, Curtis recently raised his estimates for AMD following positive server checks. The analyst stated he was incrementally positive on AMD after his recent Asia trip, with the expectation of 500 basis points per year share gains in server CPUs with the company's Venice platform.

However, these recent checks hadn't helped Curtis grasp anything from the original device manufacturers (ODMs) in terms of AI ramps. "The announcement of OpenAI as a lead customer with the potential for $80-100B in revenue across 6GW of compute through 2030 materially changes that outlook," said Curtis.

Curtis ranks No. 68 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.5%. See AMD ETF Exposure on TipRanks.

IT infrastructure and personal computing solutions provider Dell Technologies (DELL) announced an increase in its long-term financial targets during its analyst meeting on Oct. 7. The improved outlook is backed by demand from the ongoing AI wave.

Following the event, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a buy rating on DELL stock and raised his price target to $170 from $160. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a "neutral" rating on DELL stock with a price target of $135.

Rakesh noted management's commentary about momentum in enterprise and sovereign AI, with strong demand signals over 12-18 months. The top-rated analyst highlighted that the company raised its compound annual growth rate target for revenue for fiscal 2026 to 2030 to the range of 7% to 9%, with non-GAAP EPS expected to rise by 15% or more.

Furthermore, Rakesh noted that Dell's fiscal 2026 AI server revenue estimate of $20 billion is in line with the Street's consensus of $20.6 billion and reflects over 100% growth from $9.8 billion in the previous year. The company expects a 20% to 25% CAGR through Fiscal 2030, implying AI server revenue of $46 billion.

However, the analyst believes that this growth outlook could be conservative, as the company is involved in all at-scale AI cluster deployments and leads in T2 CSP (tier 2 cloud service providers) and enterprise AI deployments with more than 3,000 customers.

Rakesh ranks No. 81 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 24.3%. See Dell Technologies Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks.

Department stores may be falling out of favor with today's younger consumers, but there's a reason older shoppers keep coming back.

Whether it's more generous return policies, promotional events or deep discounts, "if you can learn the benefits of what a store brings you, it creates a much greater experience," said Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor for market research firm Circana.

For example, if a sales associate doesn't have an item you want in stock, often they'll get it and ship it to you at no cost, Cohen said — "that's a big perk."

And yet, for younger shoppers, the mentality is "I don't want to shop where my mother shops," he said.

To be sure, at Macy's and its subsidiary Bloomingdale's, for example, the majority of customers are above the age of 45, according to new Consumer Edge data.

Baby boomers are also much more likely to say in-store shopping is their most common way of making purchases, compared with Generation Z, or those born between 1997 and 2012, according to a Capital One report from March.

"The younger generation grew up online," Cohen said. "The challenge for department stores is to break that paradigm."

Social media plays a big role in how younger consumers make purchases, added Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at TD Cowen. It's a trend he refers to as "the tiktokification of retail."

But while shopping primarily online may seem quick and convenient, it does come with extra hassles.

It can mean relying on a practice known as "bracketing," or ordering multiple products in different sizes or colors with the intention of keeping a few and returning the rest — adding more time and cost to each transaction.

As online retailers try to keep those returns in check, most have rolled out stricter policies, including charging a return or restocking fee, according to a 2023 report from return management company Happy Returns.

But even now, some department stores have held on to the more generous policies of yesteryear, with longer return windows or free shipping, and that has gone a long way when it comes to building brand loyalty.

"There are some savings opportunities that you have when you shop in person that you probably wouldn't have online," said Edgar Dworsky, founder of ConsumerWorld.org.

Although Bloomingdale's shortened its return window to 30 days from 90 days last year, shoppers appreciate the other perks, according to Nancy Quinn, a personal stylist at the flagship store in New York City.

"The biggest thing that Bloomingdale's offers is customer service, that is really where we shine," Quinn said.

Quinn meets her clients, who are mostly women between the ages of 45 and 70, by appointment to help them find clothing for everyday or special occasions. She said she will often waive the shipping fee or send the purchases via messenger at no charge to locations in Manhattan. At times, she has even hand-delivered an item — also as a complimentary service — if the customer is local and under a time constraint.

"Those are things that we try to do to make sure people know how much we appreciate the business," Quinn said. At many high-end department stores, personal stylists work on commission and the assistance they provide is free for customers.

Quinn's appointments book up especially quickly when Bloomingdale's runs promotional events, such as "friends and family," which is typically a 25% discount across many brands.

Still, Quinn says younger customers are less likely to shop with her.

"It's a generational thing," Quinn said. "A lot of younger people are shopping online." Alternatively, "the women I am meeting are really ready to make an investment in themselves and their wardrobe."

To be sure, U.S. department stores have been in a slump for years. Retailers like JCPenney and Macy's have struggled to compete against online retailers and smaller brick-and-mortar stores that can better adapt to changing consumer preferences.

"Small new brands that are emerging have just as much marketing power because the internet levels the playing field," said Circana's Cohen.

However, department stores aren't dead yet.

Last year, Macy's said it would close some of its namesake stores and open more Bloomingdale's locations. According to the company's quarterly report, Bloomingdale's performed better because of its focus on the luxury brands that appeal to higher-income shoppers.  

"Selective higher-end stores" are outpacing the competition, in part because "middle- and lower-income consumers have been disproportionately negatively impacted by the rising cost of necessities," said TD Cowen's Chen.

In an interview last month, Macy's CEO Tony Spring told CNBC that the consumer remains resilient and continues to spend on new items and fashion, despite concerns about tariffs.

The challenge for department stores is to bring shoppers in, even as managing inventory and pricing gets increasingly difficult, Chen said. "It is ironic because everybody does love stores and humans want connection."

This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Ron Podmore, 58, a retired teacher who decided to live out his retirement in Guatemala. He still owns property in Washington and spends about half the year there as he begins the Guatemala residency process. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

I retired two years ago, in June 2023.

I was a high school teacher, and I decided to take early retirement after 32 years of teaching. But because of the fact that I was not eligible for social security, I was only able to receive half of my pension. I will get the other half about six years from now when I turn 65, or whenever I choose to also tap into my social security. It's kind of a mixed blessing, but it seems to be working for me.

I knew that if I was going to pull the plug, so to speak, and retire early, there was a huge gap. There is no way in heck I wanted to be teaching up until I was 65 and then immediately go on social security.

I have seen too many teachers where they're holding on until they turn 65, and then they're going to retire and go on social security, and six months later they're six feet under.

I was using the FIRE method. I spent probably the better part of the last 20 years investing each time I got a pay raise. It worked out favorably for me over the last 20 or 25 years.

Around 2013, I noticed an influx of migrant students coming into my classroom from Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador, and I got to know some of these kids.

I was led to believe that Guatemala is this country with endemic poverty, crime, corruption, cartels — who on earth would want to go down there? And these kids really said, "You need to rethink that."

They encouraged me to travel to Guatemala, and in 2013 or 2014, I took my first trip down there. Then I ended up going down there once or twice a year.

In 2018, I purchased a small condominium in the working-class area of Guatemala City, knowing that if I needed to, I could migrate out of the United States and be able to live down there.

So I had already purchased the property as an investment before I retired, and then I was able to make payments on it. My goal was to have it all paid off by the time I retired. And sure enough, I was able to pay it all off, so I have no mortgage on that unit.

I was making payments on it every month, and then I also expedited that by making extra payments on the principal, and I was able to pay it off within eight years. In order to do that, I took out a HELOC loan against the value of the house that I have in Federal Way, which is a suburb just south of Seattle. When you purchase property, in most places around the world, it's all cash. You cannot go to the bank of that country and ask for a loan. You have to take care of your financing with whatever bank you have in the United States or your home country.

The property that I purchased down there is a two-bedroom, one-bath with underground parking, concierge services, security, et cetera, and that was for about $125,000. The mortgage was for 10 years, just under $1,500.

There was no renting — it was vacant for years. It was just a matter of time for me to begin furnishing, purchasing things like the couches, and the chairs, and the dining room tables, and the beds, and stuff like that.

I had to do that little by little over the eight years. At the time, I was living in Washington State, and you have to factor in airplane tickets to get down there, and how much money you're going to spend on not only purchasing these items, but also having them delivered and being there and so forth. It took me about two or three years to build it all up.

I started being down there full-time in August 2024. I'm in the process of securing a temporary and a permanent residency card. That's about a three- to five-year long process.

I would be getting a visa that would allow me to live in Guatemala for extended periods of time — greater than six months.

Right now, as it is, I'm only allowed to stay in Guatemala up to six months at a time.

I have a private health insurance plan in Guatemala that runs me about $315 a month; no deductibles and no copay. That's a private hospital that also covers medicines, X-rays, MRIs, and hospital stays, and you do not get a bill at the end of any of that.

And there is such a contrast for superior services: they have better bedside manners in Central America. You're not surrounded by a certified nursing assistant or an intake specialist or a finance and operations person determining how are you going to make these payments and everything. You go into an office, the reception is right there, and the second person you see is the doctor.

Glasses, optometry, and dental I am not insured on. When I'm down there I get my teeth cleaned every six months, just like I do up here, and my teeth cleaning on average is about $65 per visit. To contrast that, when I was going to get my teeth cleaned at my local dentist up here in Washington, that would be close to $800 or $900. What the insurance carrier for dental is not covering of that is forced onto me. So each time I went to get my teeth cleaned in the States, it was slightly over $200 for my portion of the bill.

If you think about the concept of snowbirds, at least out here on the West Coast, we have a huge influx of people in their fifties who decide to retire early and they immediately relocate to Southern California, Southern Arizona, Southern New Mexico, in border towns all along the Texas border, so they can have immediate access — to drive to the border or walk across the border — to purchase their prescriptions, get their teeth done, get their X-rays done, or go into the local hospital.

If there is an emergency, they're going to run over to that border before they dial 911 in the United States.

I've just taken that concept one extra country over, which is the next country after Mexico, and that's Guatemala.

If you've got that nagging itch about changing roles, you may be onto something.

AWS senior vice president of applied AI solutions Colleen Aubrey has spent over 20 years at Amazon, building its advertising business from the ground up. She's also a member of the company's elite S-Team. 

She told Business Insider that throughout her career, she's faced numerous challenges — and as she puts it, "pretty much every six months, something significant changes."

"We have a new product idea; there's a new problem to go after; there's a new customer to get to understand," Aubrey said.

That "constant change" is the reason she's stayed at Amazon for as long as she has, and remains engaged in her work. For anyone questioning whether they're in the right role or ready for a new challenge, Aubrey said there are typically three boxes to check off.

"Are you in a place which ticks those boxes? And if you aren't, then maybe it's worth looking at changing the mix, in order to get that," Aubrey said. "Because I think when you have those elements, then work is invigorating."

Here's what you should consider, she said:

Aubrey told Business Insider that you should first ask yourself whether you're working for a leader with whom you have mutual respect.

"Are you working for a leader that you respect, that you're inspired by, that you're learning from, and vice versa?" Aubrey said.

Aubrey said that people generally need their leaders to help with the things only they can provide: resourcing, hard decisions, trade-offs, judgment calls, prioritization, advocacy, and big-picture thinking.

Sometimes, people end up with a manager who isn't the right match, even if that person is trying their best. The executive said it can become challenging to work in a space where you feel "disenchanted," and in that case, it may be time to move on to something new.

"You can choose to live through it and be dissatisfied. I think that's challenging," Aubrey said.

Aubrey said you should also ask yourself if you're working on the right team. The executive has worked on various teams throughout her roughly two decades at the retail giant. The right team includes people you're really learning from, she said.

"Are they challenging you, or is it a creative and innovative environment that works for you?" Aubrey said.

Amazon's infamous "two-pizza teams" describes the ideal team to promote innovation. The idea is that no team should be big enough that it would take more than two pizzas to feed them. The ideal size is somewhere around six to eight people, and the goal is for those teams to own something from end-to-end.

The third question you should ask yourself is what stage of the business you want to work in, Aubrey said.

"It's important to think through what is the type of product and business and problem that you like solving," Aubrey said. "Are you in a place that has that type of characteristics?"

For example, Aubrey said she had a colleague who worked on the retail side, which can be a complicated and demanding area, but he loved finding improvements in cost optimization and in the supply chain. Personally, she said she loves "X-factor growth," or working on a part of the business ripe for exponential growth.

"I like the blank sheet of paper," Aubrey said.

Concerns of an entrepreneurial ambition deficit in the U.K. have led some venture capitalists to question the role of risk-averse parents and a costly education system in disenfranchising young British people from becoming founders.

Last month, U.K. Business Secretary Peter Kyle said university students in Britain don't have the same ambition to start their own businesses when compared with their peers in America.

"In Britain, if you went to a group of undergraduates, how big would that group have to be before you found someone that said their choice of going to university… was because they wanted to become a founder?" Kyle said at an event hosted by AI chipmaker Nvidia in London.

"The entrepreneurialism simply isn't there – the drive, the vigour," Kyle added.

Harry Stebbings, the founder of 20VC, a firm managing $650 million in funds, said one of the main barriers young people in the U.K. face when trying to get into entrepreneurship is their parents.

"Parents are a massive problem. Parents f*** you up," Stebbings told CNBC Make It in an interview. "Parents are inherently risk-off and not risk on in the U.K. So they say: 'Hey, get this job. Hey, you've been to university. Hey, I paid for all of your university. Hey, I pay for this. Get that job.'"

"And actually in the U.S., it's much more: 'Start a business. Go try that. Go join a startup.' Very different mindset towards risk and careers, and I think that's a really different element to how a child starts," he added.

Stebbings comments are part of a broader debate on whether the U.K. fosters a culture of risk-aversion. One Forbes 30 under 30 founder, Tom Wallace-Smith, who launched nuclear fusion startup Astral Systems in 2021, previously told CNBC Make It that entrepreneurship feels out of reach to most people in the U.K.

Wallace-Smith said he didn't even know entrepreneurship was a viable career path when he was completing his PhD at the University of Bristol, and expected to end up in academics or a corporate job.

He argued that the U.K. has no shortage of successful entrepreneurs, but the government and media "could do a better job of telling founders' stories" and increasing exposure to startup environments.

"They [young people] still want to go and work at Jane Street. They still want to go and work at Goldman. They still want to go and work at McKinsey. It is astonishing to me, we do not have anywhere near the same entrepreneurial ambitions early," Stebbings said.

Dama Sathianathan, a senior partner at London-based venture capital firm Bethnal Green Ventures, agreed that parents are more risk-averse in the U.K., but explained it's likely because entrepreneurship is seen as a financially unstable path.

"It's not being really infused, embedded in the whole scholarly curriculum ... people opt to to pay incredible fees to just infuse their children with better chances in school and ultimately university. That's sort of the traditional pathway for people, which is just so expensive, if you think about it," Sathianathan said in an interview with CNBC Make It.

Private school fees in the U.K. were up 22.6% on average in January after the government introduced a VAT, according to the Independent Schools Council (ISC). The average termly fee for a day school in January was £7,382 ($9,799), including a 20% VAT, according to the ISC, compared with £6,021 last year.

Meanwhile, university tuition fees rose for the first time in eight years in 2025, with the annual maximum fee going up by £285 to £9,535 next year, an increase of 3.1%.

Although university fees tend to be much higher in the U.S., salaries also tend to be higher, meaning successful graduates can potentially take more risks such as starting their own business, compared to their U.K. counterparts.

A survey from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) and Simply Business in March, found that nearly 60% of young British people are interested in starting their own businesses but they cite a number of roadblocks holding them back.

Only 16% of the 2,079 people surveyed between the ages of 18 and 34 in the U.K., had actually taken the leap into entrepreneurship, with most saying a lack of formal business education was an obstacle.

As young people and their parents absorb high educational fees, pursuing the path of entrepreneurship doesn't seem to offer worthwhile rewards.

"The risk appetite then is really a question about: 'Will I have the chance to be financially stable in a cost of living crisis? Will I be able to actually make this into a career move when it doesn't work out because entrepreneurship doesn't always pan out," Sathianathan added.

Warner Bros Discovery has rebuffed Paramount Skydance's initial takeover approach as too low, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday.

Warner Bros rejected Paramount's offer of around $20 per share in recent weeks, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Paramount declined to comment on the report, while Warner Bros did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

Paramount, led by David Ellison, is exploring several paths in its bid for Warner Bros, including increasing its offer, appealing directly to shareholders or securing extra support from a financial partner, Bloomberg said.

Paramount has been in talks with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management about backing its bid, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.

Ellison took over Paramount in August after completing an $8 billion merger with his film production company Skydance Media.

The Philippines accused Chinese maritime forces of using water cannon and ramming a Filipino vessel near the Philippine-occupied Thitu Island, calling the actions a "clear threat" that escalates tensions in contested South China Sea waters.

The Philippines Coast Guard said three Filipino vessels, including the BRP Datu Pagbuaya, were anchored near Thitu Island, locally known as Pag-asa Island, early on Sunday as part of a government programme to protect local fishermen when Chinese ships reportedly approached and used water cannon to intimidate them.

An hour later, a China coast guard ship allegedly fired its water cannon directly at the BRP Datu Pagbuaya before ramming its stern, causing minor damage but no injuries, the PCG said.

Manila's coast guard and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources vowed to continue their operations in the area, saying their presence is essential to safeguarding the livelihood of Filipino fishermen.

China's embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tensions between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea have been rising through the year, particularly over the Scarborough Shoal, a prime fishing ground.

China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, a vital waterway for more than $3 trillion in annual ship-borne trade, parts of which are also claimed by Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.

China on Sunday said "we are not afraid of" a trade war with the United States after President Donald Trump vowed to impose punishing new retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports.

A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce accused the U.S. of a "textbook double standard" with Trump's promise on Friday to tack on additional 100% tariffs on those imports after China imposed new export controls on rare earths minerals.

That promise in a social media post by the president shook U.S. stock markets on Friday, erasing $2 trillion in equity values in a single day.

Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China," the ministry spokesperson said.

"China's position on the trade war is consistent: we do not want it, but we are not afraid of it," they added.

The spokesperson said that the United States "for a long time … has been overstretching the concept of national security, abusing export control, taking discriminatory actions against China, and imposing unilateral long-arm jurisdiction measures on various products, including semiconductor equipment and chips."

The U.S. Commerce Control list covers more than 3,000 items, more than three times the approximately 900 items on China's Export Control List of Dual-use Items, the spokesperson said.

China called its export controls on rare earth exports a "legitimate" measure under international law, pushing back against U.S. accusations of economic coercion.

The Commerce Ministry said the controls, issued Thursday, were part of Beijing's effort to strengthen its export control system and "better safeguard world peace and regional stability" amid what it described as a turbulent global security environment.

The measures, which now cover not only rare earth materials but also related intellectual property and technologies, were announced just weeks before a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

"These controls do not constitute export bans. Applications that meet the requirements will be approved," the Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.

"China has fully assessed the potential impact of these measures on the supply chain and is confident that the impact will be very limited."

Beijing's new curbs also require foreign entities to obtain a license to export products containing more than 0.1% of domestically-sourced rare earths, or manufactured using China's extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology. Applications for items that could be used in weapons or other military purposes will be denied.

Shortly after Beijing tightened export controls on rare earths, the European Chamber of Commerce in China reported a backlog of export license applications awaiting approval, saying the new restrictions "add further complexity to the global supply chains of rare earth elements."

In response to Beijing's move, Trump on Friday announced new tariffs of 100% on imports from China "over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying" beginning Nov. 1.

Trump also said that the U.S., on that same date, would also impose export controls on "any and all critical software."

Stock markets plunged after Trump said on Truth Social that "there is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive'" with its rare earths policy.

China accounts for about 70% of the global supply of rare earths and has repeatedly used the critically needed minerals as a bargaining chip in trade discussions.

Hours after tightening export controls on rare earths, Beijing also announced that it would start charging U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports from Oct. 14, mirroring a new U.S. fee on Chinese vessels arriving at U.S. ports, set to take effect the same day.

The U.S. accounts for only 0.1% of global shipbuilding, compared to 53.3% for China, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

China's Commerce Ministry defended its reciprocal decision as "necessary passive defensive actions." It added that the U.S. actions "seriously undermined the atmosphere of the economic and trade talks between the two sides."

Senior U.S. and Chinese officials met for trade negotiations in Geneva in May — the first since Trump launched a global trade war. A follow-up meeting in London in June led to a trade "framework," while a third round of high-level talks took place a month later in Stockholm, where both sides signaled progress in negotiations.

The most recent trade meetings in Madrid in September yielded a "basic framework consensus" on the divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok, ahead of a deadline to either sell off its U.S. business or shut down the social media app in the country.

On Sept. 19, Trump and Xi spoke on the phone but did not finalize a deal on TikTok. After the call, Trump announced that he and Xi agreed to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum during the last week of October in Gyeongju, South Korea.

While China has been silent on future meetings, Trump had also said he would visit China early next year and that Xi would come to the U.S. at a later date.

However, Trump on Friday threatened in a social media post to cancel his upcoming meeting with Xi after China's latest tightening of export curbs on rare earths.

China on Sunday said "we are not afraid of" a trade war with the United States after President Donald Trump vowed to impose punishing new retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports.

A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce accused the U.S. of a "textbook double standard" with Trump's promise on Friday to tack on additional 100% tariffs on those imports after China imposed new export controls on rare earths minerals.

That promise in a social media post by the president shook U.S. stock markets on Friday, erasing $2 trillion in equity values in a single day.

Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China," the ministry spokesperson said.

"China's position on the trade war is consistent: we do not want it, but we are not afraid of it," they added.

The spokesperson said that the United States "for a long time … has been overstretching the concept of national security, abusing export control, taking discriminatory actions against China, and imposing unilateral long-arm jurisdiction measures on various products, including semiconductor equipment and chips."

The U.S. Commerce Control list covers more than 3,000 items, more than three times the approximately 900 items on China's Export Control List of Dual-use Items, the spokesperson said.

China called its export controls on rare earth exports a "legitimate" measure under international law, pushing back against U.S. accusations of economic coercion.

The Commerce Ministry said the controls, issued Thursday, were part of Beijing's effort to strengthen its export control system and "better safeguard world peace and regional stability" amid what it described as a turbulent global security environment.

The measures, which now cover not only rare earth materials but also related intellectual property and technologies, were announced just weeks before a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

"These controls do not constitute export bans. Applications that meet the requirements will be approved," the Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.

"China has fully assessed the potential impact of these measures on the supply chain and is confident that the impact will be very limited."

Beijing's new curbs also require foreign entities to obtain a license to export products containing more than 0.1% of domestically-sourced rare earths, or manufactured using China's extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology. Applications for items that could be used in weapons or other military purposes will be denied.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamison Greer said Sunday that the U.S. was not notified of the new export controls in advance, "and quickly, as soon as we found out from public sources, we reached out to the Chinese to have a phone call, and they deferred."

Greer, speaking on Fox News' "Sunday Briefing," called China's move "a power grab."

Shortly after Beijing tightened export controls on rare earths, the European Chamber of Commerce in China reported a backlog of export license applications awaiting approval, saying the new restrictions "add further complexity to the global supply chains of rare earth elements."

In response to Beijing's move, Trump on Friday announced new tariffs of 100% on imports from China "over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying" beginning Nov. 1.

Trump also said that the U.S., on that same date, would also impose export controls on "any and all critical software."

Stock markets plunged after Trump said on Truth Social that "there is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive'" with its rare earths policy.

China accounts for about 70% of the global supply of rare earths and has repeatedly used the critically needed minerals as a bargaining chip in trade discussions.

Hours after tightening export controls on rare earths, Beijing also announced that it would start charging U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports from Oct. 14, mirroring a new U.S. fee on Chinese vessels arriving at U.S. ports, set to take effect the same day.

The U.S. accounts for only 0.1% of global shipbuilding, compared to 53.3% for China, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

China's Commerce Ministry defended its reciprocal decision as "necessary passive defensive actions." It added that the U.S. actions "seriously undermined the atmosphere of the economic and trade talks between the two sides."

Senior U.S. and Chinese officials met for trade negotiations in Geneva in May — the first since Trump launched a global trade war. A follow-up meeting in London in June led to a trade "framework," while a third round of high-level talks took place a month later in Stockholm, where both sides signaled progress in negotiations.

The most recent trade meetings in Madrid in September yielded a "basic framework consensus" on the divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok, ahead of a deadline to either sell off its U.S. business or shut down the social media app in the country.

On Sept. 19, Trump and Xi spoke on the phone but did not finalize a deal on TikTok. After the call, Trump announced that he and Xi agreed to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum during the last week of October in Gyeongju, South Korea.

While China has been silent on future meetings, Trump had also said he would visit China early next year and that Xi would come to the U.S. at a later date.

However, Trump on Friday threatened in a social media post to cancel his upcoming meeting with Xi after China's latest tightening of export curbs on rare earths.

Oops, something went wrong

The Trump-China drama may have been perfectly timed because Donald Trump struck a calm, almost rehearsed tone after Friday's sudden market crash, before TradFi markets open on Monday.

Crypto is often caught holding the ball as President Trump's market-moving announcements tend to come on Friday, almost sparing stocks from the carnage.

Global markets could be steady by Monday morning, and crypto, which absorbed the shock over the weekend, is already leading the rebound.

Bitcoin was approaching the $115,000 mark, while Ethereum reclaimed $4,100, following Trump's comments on Truth Social, which eased China fears. Investors interpreted his remarks as deliberate de-escalation after a politically charged sell-off.

“Don't worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment… The USA wants to help China, not hurt it,” Trump noted.

The timing raised familiar eyebrows. The plunge came late Friday, just as Wall Street shut for the weekend, leaving only 24/7 crypto markets to process the fallout.

Indeed, markets are already on a rebound, with Bitcoin trading for $114,359 as of this writing, while Ethereum has already reclaimed the $4,100 mark. Notably, Ethereum is up by over 20% from its Friday low.

Sentiment is already flipping, and equities could open Monday largely unscathed. Many traders now suspect that Trump prefers weekend volatility, allowing crypto markets to bleed privately before the S&P 500 can react.

The White House also pointed to Trump's softer stance, with reports indicating that Vice President JD Vance revealed his boss's willingness to be a reasonable negotiator with China.

Similarly, White House officials reportedly suggested that markets would “calm down this week.” With crypto markets showing strength, traders may read this as a green light for risk assets.

On whether Trump will impose a 100% tariff on China by November 1, Polymarket bettors see a measly 8% chance. This marks a significant drawdown from minutes before Trump's announcement on Truth Social, where the odds stood at 26%.

The change points to de-escalation, implying most participants see Trump's rhetoric as bluff, not brinkmanship.

Still, for crypto investors, the pattern feels intentional. Crypto trades nonstop, making it the first asset class to price in sudden political shocks, and the easiest to shake out leveraged players before calmer Monday headlines appear.

“Liquidating everyone just to push prices to new ATHs would be pretty frustrating… and honestly, it seems likely,” Crypto Rover quipped.

In the same tone, Helius Labs CEO, Mert, said the crypto markets are an oracle for Trump's social media mood.

Whether orchestrated or coincidental, the weekend whiplash reflects how deeply political theater now intersects with digital assets. Trump crashes the market on Friday, calms it by Sunday, and the S&P may never even flinch, only Bitcoin does.

Stock Analysis

Reviewed by Kshitija Bhandaru

Forward Industries (FORD) recently launched an institutional grade validator node on the Solana blockchain. The node is powered by DoubleZero's infrastructure and Jump Crypto's Firedancer client. This step signals a strategic push into blockchain infrastructure, with collaborative partnerships in focus.

See our latest analysis for Forward Industries.

Forward Industries' share price has been on a rollercoaster, surging 133% over the past 90 days and a staggering 307% year-to-date, despite some recent volatility sparked by its blockchain push and a $4 billion at-the-market equity program. The one-year total shareholder return sits at an impressive 462%, highlighting strong momentum as the company pivots toward decentralized infrastructure and ecosystem expansion.

With Forward Industries' share price soaring and its blockchain pivot in full swing, investors may wonder if the company's true value has been recognized or if these moves have opened a window for further upside growth.

Forward Industries currently trades with a staggering negative price-to-book ratio of -1095x, which stands in sharp contrast to both its industry peers and standard valuation benchmarks at the last close price of $20.39.

The price-to-book ratio compares a company's market value to its book value, and is a widely used indicator for asset-heavy sectors like electronics. In Forward's case, the ratio is negative because the company reports negative equity, reflecting more liabilities than assets and a history of unprofitability.

This result signals that the market value is disconnected from underlying fundamentals, with extreme downside risk if the company cannot reverse losses. Compared to the US Electronic industry's average price-to-book of 2.6x and a peer average of 1.8x, Forward's figure underscores just how speculative the stock's valuation has become. There is also insufficient data to support a fair ratio estimate, leaving the true justified value in question.

See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.

Result: Price-to-Book Ratio of -1095x (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, persistent negative net income and lack of recent revenue growth could quickly erode investor confidence if these issues are not addressed in upcoming quarters.

The BTC price swung hard on tariff headlines as talk of a China trade war made the markets volatile, and Ethereum cooled after hitting tough resistance. In that chaos, Remittix stands out for real utility, a security-first approach, a clear roadmap, and an active community that keeps growing. Traders like that it has visible progress, simple user rewards, and steady demand even when charts go red. For many, it feels like a calmer place to put new capital while the market settles

The BTC price is battling a crucial zone around $111k after rejection at $123k to $126k. A daily close below $110k risks a slide toward $104k to $107k. Reclaiming $114k to $115k could spark a climb back toward $120k. 

With the BTC price tied to macro headlines and heavy leverage, position size and patience matter. A trade war headline can still swing the BTC price fast, so confirm breaks and watch volume before making an attempt to buy.

Ethereum failed to hold above the heavy $4,800 supply and is leaning toward the $4,250 to $4,300 demand zone. If Ethereum loses that shelf, a deeper test near $4,050 to $4,150 is possible. A clean break and retest over $4,500 would reopen $4,700 to $4,950.

Even with hot narratives, Ethereum reacts to the same macro shocks. Track open interest and funding so you do not chase a tired bounce. When Ethereum trends, it often stair-steps higher with shallow pullbacks.



Remittix is one of the best crypto stories this month, and it is built for PayFi use cases, not hype. The presale numbers and security stack set it apart, while the team keeps shipping products and listings. The presale has raised over $27.3M by selling 677M+ tokens at $0.1130. Two CEX listings are announced, with another major CEX reveal teased soon.

If you trade, let the BTC price and Ethereum confirm direction before chasing. If you invest, pick projects with roadmaps and real utility. Remittix fits that lane while the presale continues and listings line up. That is why some traders looked to Remittix for balance, since the presale value did not slip with every headline.

Oops, something went wrong

Gift cards have long been the go-to for last-minute holiday shoppers — easy to buy, easy to wrap, and usually appreciated. But many of those cards end up forgotten in drawers, unspent or lost to expiration dates. A new kind of gift card aims to change that by turning gifting into an investment opportunity: Bitcoin.

Fold (NASDAQ:FLD), a fintech company founded to make Bitcoin more accessible to everyday consumers, recently launched what it calls the first-ever Bitcoin gift card. The cards are being rolled out to major retailers nationwide through a partnership with Blackhawk Network, one of the largest gift card distributors in the U.S.

"Fold was founded with the idea that Bitcoin could be an incredible tool for savings for everyday people, specifically for millennials who are finding it increasingly hard to build savings," Fold CEO Will Reeves told Benzinga. "And Bitcoin has been the best performing asset of the last decade."

Fold started by letting users earn Bitcoin instead of traditional cash-back or airline miles rewards. Since its founding, Reeves says customers have earned over $90 million in Bitcoin rewards, compared to less than $20 million had they opted for cash back.

The Bitcoin gift card functions like a traditional one, but with digital potential. Shoppers can buy the card online or off a retail shelf for a set dollar amount. The recipient redeems it by downloading the Fold app, where the Bitcoin value is instantly credited to their account.

Reeves explained that the process eliminates many of the hurdles typically involved in gifting crypto. "It doesn't require them to already have a Bitcoin wallet or to really understand Bitcoin," he said.

Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Once redeemed, recipients can save, spend, or even cash out their Bitcoin through Fold's app.

"You can send it to someone else, you can turn it into physical cash at an ATM, you can use it to spend on a debit card, and earn more Bitcoin rewards," Reeves told Benzinga. "So it creates a great and very flexible environment for people to receive Bitcoin."

For many, volatility remains a concern when it comes to Bitcoin. Reeves acknowledged that while price swings are part of the asset's nature, gifting offers a safe entry point.

"This is not you putting up your own hard-earned money or hard-earned savings," he said, adding that some may be nervous because of a temporary downturn. "This is a way for you to get some [Bitcoin], that's not from you putting up any capital. It's a risk-free way to start getting used to the asset and start to see it over a longer period of time."

Reeves told Benzinga the card could broaden Bitcoin's reach beyond the tech-savvy crowd. "Bitcoin has been very heavily male-dominated in terms of who is adopting it," he said. "And that's typically because investing and trading is an activity that — when you look at the demographics — skews very male."

He added that he believes Fold — and particularly this Bitcoin gift card — will speak to broader demographics because it makes crypto so much more accessible. It's not just for "crypto bro culture" anymore, but for those managing household finances and trying to make smart financial decisions, "giving more financial foundation for your family."

Reeves is optimistic about where this gift card could lead. "We see Bitcoin is very close to all-time highs, and we expect that to continue over the next few years," he said. "It really situates this to usurp not only all gift cards but to become the number one gift in America, overall."

Lawsuit alleges domain was renewed and should not have been auctioned off.



A high-profile expired domain auction for blockchain.ai ended today, but the former registrant has filed a lawsuit claiming he renewed the domain.

In the lawsuit, Howard Gould stated that he was the domain's registrant as of December 2017.

The domain was set to auto-renew with OnlyDomains, but the auto-renewal failed, resulting in the domain expiring on July 19, 2025.

After becoming aware of the failure on September 21, Gould claims he paid OnlyDomains for the renewal and received a confirmation.

On October 3, he emailed OnlyDomain asking why his invoice was still labeled as pending. He also noticed the domain was listed for sale in a Namecheap auction.

The .ai domain registry, managed by Identity Digital, has a partnership with Namecheap to sell expired domains through its auction platform. When the domain was on the verge of deletion, an auction was initiated at Namecheap.

On October 6, OnlyDomains informed Gould that he would also have to pay a restoration fee for the domain. After paying the invoices, he alleges that the domain still went into PendingDelete status.

Gould, through an attorney, contacted Identity Digital on October 8 to try to halt the auction.

That didn't happen, so Gould filed a lawsuit (pdf) yesterday in California. The suit names OnlyDomains, its parent company CentralNic NZ Ltd (part of Team Internet Group), Identity Digital, and Namecheap.

I am very sure there is something wrong with Identity Digital.. Ram Mohan should answer it. May be he is another Aman Bhutani.
Even after having exclusive partnership with namecheap for expired domains , they dont deliver .ai domain names. If you win at namecheap expired .ai auction , chances are that the auction might be cancelled and someone else takes domain name via hand reg.

Home - Crypto Presales - Crypto News: XRP Price Prediction & Latest Updates From Viral Remittix ICO

The latest crypto news comes amid chaos across the markets, as Donald Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on China triggered the sharpest crypto crash of 2025. While analysts debate the next XRP price prediction, all eyes are on the viral Remittix ICO, which has already raised over $27.4 million.

Designed for real-world crypto-to-fiat payments, Remittix is emerging as the breakout project of 2025, drawing attention from traders seeking the next big post-Ripple success story.











The XRP price today trades at around $2.44, down 13.47% in the last 24 hours, reflecting the broad market sell-off that followed Trump's tariff shock. Earlier, XRP was consolidating between $2.79 support and $2.83 resistance, a tight compression zone that hinted at an imminent move. The crash has now driven the Ripple price to a key support region. This will be a major test of investor confidence.

At the moment, several market analysts have remained cautiously optimistic. The Fibonacci level near $2.40 remains a critical zone for buyers. On the other hand, a sustained recovery above $2.60 could restore momentum.











Analyst CasiTrades highlighted this setup, calling it a “coiled spring” pattern that could soon expand either way. She predicts that once the panic settles, XRP could rebound toward $3.00 in the coming weeks if broader sentiment improves. 

The RSI's bullish divergence adds weight to the XRP price prediction of an upcoming reversal, as buyers appear to be regaining control. Market sentiment around Bitcoin and macro trends could further influence XRP's next move.

Meanwhile, Ripple news investors are also eyeing the viral Remittix (RTX) ICO, which has already raised $27.4 million as it positions itself as the next big payments-focused project in crypto.











While XRP price battles short-term pressure, investors are flocking toward Remittix (RTX), the PayFi project transforming how crypto connects to everyday finance. While XRP crypto news focuses on institutional partnerships, Remittix is winning over retail investors with real-world usability. 

The platform lets users send crypto and instantly convert it to fiat, depositing funds directly into any bank account worldwide with no delays, hidden fees or regulatory friction.

As Trump's tariffs inject fear into traditional markets, Remittix bridges the gap between digital and traditional finance like never before. Its privacy-first payment model gives users control over their money while expanding crypto's practical use. Analysts now call it the most viral ICO since early Ripple and it's only just getting started.

Ethereum (ETH/USD) is trading around $3,813, attempting to regain momentum after a sharp correction from its $4,400 peak earlier this month. The market's uncertainty comes just as financial author Robert Kiyosaki issues one of his most urgent warnings yet, calling for what he describes as the biggest crash in world history and signaling renewed faith in Ethereum and silver as protection against currency devaluation.

REMINDER: I predicted the biggest crash in world history was coming in my book Rich Dad's Prophecy.  That crash will happen this year.  Baby Boom Retirements are going to be wiped out.  Many boomers will be homeless or living in their kids basement.  Sad.REMiNDER:  I have…

In a series of posts on X, the author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad cautioned that a global financial reset could wipe out the savings of millions of retirees. He urged followers to avoid “printed assets” and move toward tangible value, writing: “Inflation turns savers' cash into trash.”

While Kiyosaki has long supported gold, silver, and Bitcoin, his recent comments highlight a growing conviction in Ethereum's dual role as both a store of value and a practical asset within the digital economy.

“Today, I believe silver and Ethereum are the best because they are stores of value, but more importantly, used in industry, and prices are low,” he said.

Earlier this week, he called silver and Ethereum “hot, hot, hot,” suggesting both could see explosive upside once investors begin shifting from fiat-based assets. He believes the next phase of wealth preservation will favor scarce, productive assets, whether that's physical metal or programmable money.

On the technical front, Ethereum price prediction appears bearish, as BTC consolidates in a sideways range between $3,720 and $3,860, holding above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,719, which has acted as near-term support. 

The RSI at 39 suggests oversold conditions, hinting that sellers may be losing control. Despite trading below its 100-period moving average (around $4,270), the broader structure shows signs of a descending trendline compression, often preceding a reversal. 

The 61.8% Fibonacci level at $4,055 forms a significant resistance zone; a breakout above it could confirm a bullish reversal toward $4,200–$4,330, areas where Ethereum last consolidated before its September drop. If, however, ETH slips below $3,720, bears could test $3,512, the base of the prior rally. 

For traders, a potential buy-the-dip setup near $3,720–$3,760 offers a favorable risk-reward profile, with targets at $3,950-$4,200 and stops below $3,680.

Kiyosaki's warning about a weakening dollar mirrors rising concerns over debt, inflation, and policy fatigue. His shift toward Ethereum suggests that even traditional investors are starting to view blockchain assets as protection against currency erosion.

If global devaluation continues, Ethereum's real-world utility in decentralized finance, tokenization, and smart contracts could make it a digital parallel to silver, limited in supply and increasingly adopted by institutions.

For now, Ethereum's consolidation near $3,800 reflects market caution. A clear move above $4,050 could revive momentum toward $4,400, while failure to hold $3,720 risks further downside.

Kiyosaki's argument highlights a changing mindset: investors are redefining what holds value in an economy driven by digital systems. If he's right, Ethereum could emerge as one of the main winners in that transition.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation.

By combining BTC's unmatched security with Solana's high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development.

The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations.

Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $23 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today's stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.013095 – but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) says its new rare-earth export controls are lawful national-security steps — not blanket bans — and that licenses will be issued for eligible civilian trade, according to a spokesperson's Q&A posted on X Sunday morning local time.

Rare earths — a group of 17 elements used in permanent-magnet motors for electric vehicles (EVs) and wind turbines, defense electronics and other high-tech gear — occupy an outsized role in supply chains because China dominates the sector. 

Beijing accounts for roughly 70% of global production and about 90% of processing and refining; so licensing shifts can ripple downstream even when mining or final manufacturing happens elsewhere.

In remarks published only hours ago, the MOFCOM spokesperson framed the Oct. 9 action — taken with the General Administration of Customs — as part of a longer effort to “refine” China's export control system in line with domestic law and non-proliferation obligations. 

The spokesperson cited the military relevance of medium- and heavy rare earths and said partners were notified in advance through bilateral export-control dialogue mechanisms.

Implementation, the ministry said, will hinge on licensing rather than prohibition. 

Reviews will be conducted under law, licenses will be granted where applications qualify, and Beijing is “actively considering” facilitation measures — including potential general licenses and license exemptions — to promote legitimate trade. 

The spokesperson also said China had assessed the measures' effects ahead of time and expects the broader supply-chain impact to be “very limited.” The message to commercial users was explicit: compliant civilian exports “can get approval.”

MOFCOM also addressed President Donald Trump's comments from Oct. 10 on Truth Social about an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports (becoming effective Nov. 1, 2025) and prospective U.S. export controls on “critical software.” 

The spokesperson called the American position a “double standard,” pointing to the breadth of U.S. control lists and de minimis rules as examples of Washington's expansive approach. 

At the same time, the ministry emphasized process, saying China “does not want” a trade war but “is not afraid” of one, and urging a return to established consultation channels to manage differences on a reciprocal basis. The spokesperson said China would take “resolute measures” to protect its interests if the U.S. proceeds.

Separate comments criticized U.S. port fees due to take effect Oct. 14 on certain Chinese-linked vessels. 

MOFCOM described those fees as unilateral and inconsistent with WTO rules and bilateral agreements. China, the ministry said, will levy special port fees on U.S.-linked vessels under domestic regulations — characterizing the step as a defensive countermeasure aimed at safeguarding the rights of Chinese companies and maintaining fair competition in shipping.

As of Sunday, 9:15 a.m. UTC, according to CoinDesk Data, bitcoin traded around $111,271, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours and 10% from Thursday's Oct. 9 intraday high of $123,641. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index read 24 — "Extreme Fear" — versus "Greed" a week ago, underscoring fragile sentiment.

The cryptocurrency market has seen a drastic fall for two days in a row. Reports suggest this downturn comes in the wake of President Donald Trump‘s imposing 100% tariffs on China.

On Sunday, the total market capitalization of the crypto market has plummeted to $3.7 trillion, down from a historic high of $4 trillion just last week. The trading volume currently stands at $250.02 billion, as indicated by CoinMarketCap data.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), the leading cryptocurrency globally, was valued at $1,11,660.41, while Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) was priced at $3,817.26. The wider crypto market experienced a 0.89% fall over the past 24 hours, adding to a seven-day decline of 11.5%.

Market analysts are attributing this downturn to the geopolitical disturbance caused by Trump's tariffs on China and the restrictions on US software exports, which have ignited fears of a potential trade war. 

According to Coinglass data, over $19 billion in bets have been wiped out, with more than 1.6 million traders facing liquidation. Remarkably, nearly $7 billion of those positions were cleared within just an hour of Friday's trading.

"The focus now turns to counterparty exposure and whether this triggers broader market contagion," Brian Strugats, head trader at Multicoin Capital told Bloomberg. 

There was an 18% drop in open interest among traders as they moved away from risky positions, signaling a low appetite for investment in the crypto market. 

Analysts believe this fall is a result of a mix of macro shockwaves and extreme leverage, marking the worst day for crypto since Q1 2025.

According to the data, the Bitcoin was trading at $111,773.13, down by almost 11% in the last seven days. Similarly Ethereum was trading at $3,842.09, down by 16% in the last seven days.

The SEC faces 16 altcoin ETF decisions this October, with deadlines scattered throughout the month for Solana, XRP, Litecoin, and Dogecoin funds. Analysts predict these approvals could spark the long-awaited altcoin rally, with Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas placing approval odds at 100% after the SEC introduced generic listing standards for crypto ETPs.

For investors hunting the best crypto presale ahead of this surge, timing matters. While established altcoins will benefit from ETF flows, early-stage projects offer exponentially higher upside.

DeepSnitch AI leads at $0.01841 in Stage 1, having raised over $344,173 with five AI surveillance tools designed for the tokenization wave. This combination positions it as the best crypto presale to buy before the altcoin season hits.



October 2025 could mark a watershed moment for crypto markets. The SEC must decide on 16 separate ETF applications throughout the month, starting with Canary Capital's Litecoin ETF on October 2 and ending with WisdomTree's XRP fund on October 24. Between these sit multiple applications for Solana, XRP, Litecoin, and Dogecoin ETFs from prominent asset managers, including Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton.



The game changed when the SEC approved generic listing standards for crypto ETPs. This eliminates the need for individual 19b-4 rule change filings, which previously came with 240-day statutory review windows.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart emphasized: “The baby could come any day. Be ready.” His colleague Eric Balchunas raised approval odds to 100%, noting that generic listing standards make the old approval clock “meaningless.”

Why does this matter for presale investors? Bitfinex analysts predicted that ETF approvals could trigger a new altcoin season, providing retail investors with lower-risk exposure through regulated products.

When institutional money floods into altcoins via ETFs, prices across the sector typically rise. Smart money positions ahead of this flow, which is why the best crypto presale projects are seeing explosive interest.

History supports this. Bitcoin ETF approvals in January 2024 triggered massive institutional inflows that drove BTC above $125,000. With 16 altcoin ETFs potentially launching within weeks, the setup for smaller-cap tokens and presales looks equally compelling.

Once ETF approvals hit and rallies begin, presale opportunities dry up as projects launch at higher valuations. Finding the best crypto presale now means positioning before the crowd arrives.

When altcoin season arrives and Wall Street money floods crypto through newly approved ETFs, retail traders will face a more complex market. That's where DeepSnitch AI delivers maximum value.

DeepSnitch features five AI agents built by on-chain analysts to level the information gap between retail and institutions. While most presales pitches vague utility, DeepSnitch delivers actual tools: whale movement alerts, rug scanners, and instant market intelligence.

This matters as tokenization accelerates. With trillions in traditional assets heading on-chain and 16 altcoin ETFs potentially approved this month, the crypto market is getting significantly more institutional. Information asymmetries have always favored whales and institutions. DeepSnitch leverages that advantage by providing everyday traders with surveillance-level data.

Here's the upside angle: tokens like Solana or XRP won't deliver 100x anymore at multi-billion-dollar valuations. DeepSnitch sits at the perfect market cap where even modest capital inflows create massive multiples. If Pepe ran 100x in 2023 with zero utility, DeepSnitch can replicate that performance with actual AI-powered tools.

DeepSnitch taps into Telegram's 1 billion active users, giving it built-in distribution that most projects never achieve. Utility plus reach is the formula that turns presales into global movements.

The project is designed for the altcoin boom that ETF approvals could trigger. As retail traders rush into newly accessible tokens through ETFs, they'll need better tools to navigate whale manipulation and scam risks. DeepSnitch provides that edge, positioning it as functional infrastructure for the next market cycle.

Right now, DeepSnitch AI is in Stage 1 at $0.01841, having raised over $344,173 in days. Early buyers lock in the lowest entry before the next stage increase. For anyone asking what's the best crypto presale with moonshot potential ahead of altcoin season, DeepSnitch checks every box.



BlockchainFX has emerged as one of October's most talked-about presales, raising over $8.75 million from 12,700+ early participants. Currently priced at $0.026 with a confirmed $0.05 launch target, BFX offers a trading platform that redistributes up to 70% of daily fees as USDT rewards to holders.

The project delivers immediate utility through its live trading app and passive income mechanics. Early community members report 4-7% daily returns from staking.

However, at $0.026 entry and a $0.05 launch price, immediate upside is more modest compared to earlier-stage presales. BFX offers solid fundamentals and working product utility, but for traders chasing 100x potential ahead of the October ETF rush, lower-priced presales with higher risk-reward profiles may present bigger opportunities.

BlockchainFX is a strong candidate as the best crypto presale for those prioritizing yield over maximum asymmetric upside.

Bitcoin Hyper introduces the first SVM rollup on Bitcoin, integrating Solana Virtual Machine smart contracts into a Layer 2 network built on BTC. This addresses Bitcoin's scalability limitations by enabling near-instant transaction finality with lower fees while maintaining main chain security.

The project uses trustless zero-knowledge proofs to verify every transaction on the BTC Layer 2. HYPER, the native token, powers staking, BTC transfers, and governance within this ecosystem. The presale offers entry at what 99Bitcoins calls “a fraction of its future price.”

Bitcoin Hyper appeals to investors seeking technical innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem. However, Bitcoin Hyper targets a specific technical niche rather than broad retail appeal. For traders prioritizing the best crypto presale for explosive gains as altcoin season ignites, earlier-stage projects with lower entry points often deliver higher multiples.

October's 16 altcoin ETF approvals could unleash institutional flows that finally trigger altcoin season. When that capital enters through regulated products, prices typically surge.

DeepSnitch AI operates in a different weight class entirely. At $0.01841 in Stage 1 presale, even modest demand could send prices exponentially higher, something established altcoins at billion-dollar valuations simply cannot deliver.

Five AI surveillance tools give early buyers an operational advantage for navigating the incoming flood of tokenized assets, not just speculative positioning.

Early entries beat the crowd. That's the 100x setup.

Visit the DeepSnitch AI presale to secure Stage 1 pricing before October's ETF decisions reshape the market.



ETF approvals will lift established altcoins, but DeepSnitch AI at $0.01841 has far more room to run. Small-cap presales can deliver 100x returns that billion-dollar tokens physically cannot match, making DSNT the best crypto presale for maximum upside.

BFX offers solid fundamentals with daily USDT rewards and a working platform. However, at $0.026 entry, immediate upside is limited compared to Stage 1 presales like DeepSnitch AI. Traders seeking the best crypto presale for explosive gains may prefer lower entry points.

DeepSnitch combines rock-bottom presale pricing ($0.01841) with five AI surveillance tools that give traders an edge as markets become more complex. This mix of early-stage entry and functional utility ahead of ETF-driven altcoin rallies is rare, making it the best crypto presale pick for October 2025.

While most of the market is still recovering from the steep tariff-driven crash, a few altcoins that beat the crypto market crash have already turned heads with 24-hour gains, even going as high as 100%. These tokens managed to rebound faster than others, showing strong on-chain activity and retail demand even as larger assets lag behind. 

This article discusses those three crash-beating altcoins and how their price charts are shaping up amid the broader market weakness. 

Radiant Capital — a DeFi lending platform built to bridge liquidity across chains — has emerged as one of the few altcoins to beat the crypto market crash. 

RDNT rallied nearly 100% in the past 24 hours, rebounding to around $0.029. The move is powered by an interesting split between retail excitement and cautious large-holder interest.

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures how much institutional or large-wallet money is flowing in or out of a token, remains just below zero. 

However, it has started curling upward, suggesting that big players are slowly returning — but still trading carefully. For CMF to confirm full institutional conviction, it needs to cross decisively above the zero line.

In contrast, the Money Flow Index (MFI), which tracks trading volume and retail inflows, has surged to an overheated 94.68, reflecting intense retail buying. 

This shows smaller investors are aggressively chasing every rise and dip, driving short-term euphoria around Radiant.

Technically, while RDNT's 100% surge looks impressive, the chart flashes an early warning. 

Between April 25 and October 11, the price made a higher high, but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) made a lower high — a bearish divergence that often signals a possible correction rather than a full trend reversal.

At the same time, the RDNT price has just broken out of a descending channel, a bearish structure it had traded in for months. The breakout is promising, but it's not yet a confirmed bullish reversal.

For the move to sustain, Radiant must hold above $0.029 and close a daily candle above $0.034 even. Failure to do so could invite selling pressure back toward $0.020 or lower.

Morpho has quietly become another DeFi token, beating the crypto market crash, showing that decentralized lending projects may be leading the recovery. 

While most altcoins remain deep in red, MORPHO is down only 10% over the past week and up 4.2% in the past 24 hours, hinting that DeFi resilience might be returning to the market.

Over the past 24 hours, Morpho whales increased their holdings by 5.34%, taking their total stash to 4.6 million MORPHO tokens. At the current price of $1.68, that translates to a stash worth nearly $8 million.

This accumulation came even as exchange balances rose 2.66%, showing that selling is continuing across cohorts, primarily by retail and smart money. 

MORPHO's price chart also paints an interesting story. Before the crash, the token was trading inside a rising wedge, a structure often seen before short-term corrections. 

The crash broke this wedge to the downside, but the current bounce has pushed the MORPHO price back above the lower trendline, showing early signs of stabilization.

The Bull Bear Power (BBP) indicator — which tracks the strength balance between buyers and sellers — supports that view. The bearish bars have shrunk sharply since October 10, suggesting that selling pressure is fading and that bulls might be regaining control.

At press time, MORPHO trades around $1.69. For the recovery to continue, the price must hold above $1.61 and push through $1.91 to retest higher resistance levels at $2.47 and $2.85. If $1.61 fails, short-term support lies at $1.55 and $1.44.

Despite market-wide volatility, Morpho's steady whale accumulation and fading bearish power suggest that it could remain one of the few DeFi altcoins outperforming during the crypto market crash, provided large money keeps backing the rebound.

Succinct's PROVE token, which powers its zero-knowledge proof (ZK-proof) infrastructure network, has emerged as one of the altcoins beating the crypto crash. 

Over the past 24 hours, PROVE is up nearly 19%, signaling renewed confidence in infrastructure-based DeFi projects even as most of the market struggles to recover.

On-chain data paints a clear picture of who's driving the move. Whale holdings fell 22.38%, dropping to just over 1,171 tokens, while exchange balances rose 6.27% to 38.25 million tokens. This suggests large holders are taking profits.

The Money Flow Index (MFI) — which tracks money entering or leaving the asset — currently stands near 73.22, moving toward overbought levels. This means buyers remain active, but the momentum is largely retail-driven, and may need fresh whale inflows to stay strong.

Technically, PROVE continues to respect a falling wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart, a structure that often hints at a trend reversal once confirmed. 

Between September 26 and October 10, the price made a lower low while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) formed a higher low, showing bullish divergence and fading selling momentum.

At press time, PROVE trades near $0.74. A 4-hour candle close above $0.85 could open the path toward $0.94 and $0.98, marking a potential 25% to 30% upside from current levels. However, a drop below $0.72 could push the price toward $0.67, where the next key support lies.

For now, retail enthusiasm continues to drive PROVE's recovery, but whale re-entry will decide whether it can extend its lead among the altcoins already beating the crypto crash.

While these DeFi names impressed during the recovery, Zcash (ZEC) deserves an honorary mention for completely defying the crypto market crash. The privacy-focused token is up more than 74% this week and nearly 10% in the past 24 hours, trading close to $290.

Both retail and institutional money continue flowing into ZEC, keeping the rally alive even as most other altcoins struggle to recover. For more insights, read our full Zcash analysis here.

Oops, something went wrong

After months of debate, Kenya's parliament has passed the country's first comprehensive crypto legislation. VASP will be key in driving adoption and creating a regulatory framework for crypto businesses in the country.

In Uganda, an initiative to launch the country's first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is going into effect. CBDC continues to lose momentum as stablecoins, like the USDC and USDT, take over

Meanwhile, approximately 650,000 crypto merchants in South Africa can now accept Bitcoin payments following the integration of the Lightning Network (LN). The LN scales the Bitcoin mainnet, enabling low-fee transactions. Presently, the Bitcoin Lightning Network has a capacity of over $471M worth of BTC.

Other than the Floki crypto funding of the WWFA in Malawi, let's look at stories making continental headlines this week:

The Kenyan parliament has passed the Virtual Asset Providers Bill (VASP), which is the country's first comprehensive crypto legislation. This bill creates a licensing and supervisory framework for crypto service providers in the country.

One of the most critical introductions is the multi-agency regulation of the crypto sector. Kenya's Central Bank and the Communications Authority of Kenya have a role rather than having a single regulator for the sector.

One notable requirement for service providers is having a physical office in the country and at least three natural persons on their board of directors. These measures ensure Kenya better complies with international requirements in AML/KYC.

Binance-linked lobby group, Virtual Assets Chamber of Commerce, played a role in changes to the bill.

Uganda has launched a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot programme.

This CBDC will entail a digital Ugandan shilling backed by treasury bonds and will run on a blockchain.

It will feature a $5.5Bn real-world asset tokenization project led by Global Settlement Network (GSN) and Diacente Group.

GSN co-founder Ryan Kirkley explained the initiative as follows:

“We're building infrastructure that goes beyond theory — a programmable economy grounded in real assets, regulatory collaboration, and mass accessibility,”

Some target assets for the new portfolio are food production, mining, renewable energy, and trade.

Uganda has a broad range of possible tokenized assets, and this project intends to leverage these possibilities.

However, it is still unclear whether the country's government will enact any regulatory changes to promote the success of this initiative.

South African merchant crypto acceptance has soared to 650,000 after Scan to Go integrated the Lightning Network for Bitcoin payments.

Presently, the Africa's economic powerhouse already boasts the best numbers on the continent in crypto payments, and this move raises that number even higher.

Due to its inherent architecture, Bitcoin has historically faced scalability problems. The Lightning Network came to improve payment efficiency and ensure Bitcoin could become more compatible with merchants' instant settlement needs.

The total number of merchants now accepting crypto payments is approximately 650,000. This increased rate is a strong representation of South African business. Crypto continues to achieve impressive integration into the real economy and will continue to grow if current trends hold.

 An investigation has tied the Hyperliquid whale controlling over 100,000 BTC to Garrett Jin, the ex-BitForex CEO whose exchange collapsed amid fraud probes. 

An onchain investigation by crypto researcher Eye has linked the mysterious Hyperliquid whale, who controls over 100,000 BTC, to Garrett Jin, the former CEO of BitForex, a now-defunct exchange embroiled in a fraud scandal.

In a Saturday post on X, the onchain sleuth noted that the whale's main wallet, ereignis.eth, was connected to another ENS name, garrettjin.eth, which directly leads to Jin's verified X (Twitter) account, @GarrettBullish.

“The ENS name ereignis.eth (“event” in German) confirms his link to this wallet, identifying him as the actor behind the large-scale operations on Hyperliquid/Hyperunit,” Eye wrote on X. 

The wallet activity also matched Jin's known business dealings, including transfers to staking contracts and addresses funded by exchanges he had past ties with, such as Huobi (HTX).

Further, the whale's wallet received and sent funds that traced back to BitForex-related addresses and to Binance deposits used to open massive trades, including a $735 million Bitcoin (BTC) short.

Jin led BitForex from 2017 to 2020. The exchange was later accused of falsifying trading volumes and flagged by Japan's Financial Services Agency for operating without registration. 

In 2024, BitForex lost $57 million from its hot wallets, froze withdrawals and ultimately shut down after its team was detained in China. Hong Kong's SFC later issued a warning for suspected fraud, and users claimed millions in unrecovered funds.

Following BitForex's collapse, Jin founded several ventures, including WaveLabs VC (2020), TanglePay (2021), IotaBee (2022) and GroupFi (2023). Most of these projects have since become inactive. 

In 2024, he launched XHash.com, a platform for institutional Ethereum staking, which investigators allege may have been used to onboard questionable funds. After the allegations surfaced, Jin reportedly removed XHash from his social media bio, though it remains visible on his Telegram account.

Crypto analyst Quinten François expressed skepticism over the claims linking the Hyperliquid whale to the former BitForex CEO, arguing that the evidence may be too convenient. 

“Why would you have an .eth name leading to your X handle in a wallet that directly connects to market manipulation wallets and wallets for other crime?” he wrote on X, adding that such a setup “sounds way too simple to be true.”

The coming decade will be judged by how we digitize trust. That is the simple political economy at the heart of the CBDC versus stablecoin versus tokenized-treasury debate. Each instrument promises to modernize payments, shrink frictions and redefine who controls the plumbing of finance. Yet they are not interchangeable. They are competing visions of money — with distinct governance models, geopolitical implications and social trade-offs.
I: The Central Banker's Answer — CBDCs
Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) represent sovereign money in programmable form — digital legal tender issued by the state, designed to ensure monetary sovereignty in a digitized economy.Advocates tout their ability to streamline welfare transfers, strengthen financial inclusion, and preserve the central bank's role in a future where private payments dominate. The European Central Bank's digital euro embodies this logic: a public good designed to counterbalance Big Tech and private tokens, guaranteeing universal access to risk-free digital money.
Yet CBDCs are politically heavy and operationally complex. They raise profound privacy and surveillance questions — who monitors the ledger, and under what authority? Programmable CBDCs could, in principle, restrict spending or impose expiry dates on funds, prompting civil-liberties debates about the boundaries between monetary policy and social engineering. The philosophical divide is deep: CBDCs are trust in state systems, while stablecoins represent trust in code and corporate governance.
The Trump 2.0 administration has openly rejected a U.S. CBDC, framing it as “government surveillance money.” Washington instead favors regulated, dollar-backed stablecoins — maintaining U.S. monetary influence globally while avoiding domestic political backlash. The contrast with the EU could not be starker: Brussels is advancing the digital euro as an instrument of sovereignty, not surveillance.
II: The Market's Solution — Stablecoins
Stablecoins are privately issued, typically dollar-pegged tokens that promise stability and usability across global payment systems. Their appeal lies in speed, interoperability, and innovation — they integrate seamlessly with decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border payments, and fintech rails that traditional banks can't match.
For U.S. policymakers, stablecoins are a strategic export tool. In lieu of a CBDC, regulated stablecoins such as USDC or PayPal USD sustain the dollar's global reach. Legislation such as the Clarity for Stablecoins Act and support from the Treasury indicate a policy pivot toward “dollarization by private proxy.”
Still, stablecoins' stability is not guaranteed. Their peg depends on reserve quality, transparency, and regulatory oversight. Weakly collateralized coins risk “digital bank runs,” while even fully backed ones raise systemic questions if they siphon deposits from commercial banks.In emerging markets, the flood of dollar stablecoins could undermine local monetary policy and accelerate digital dollarization — an unspoken geopolitical extension of U.S. soft power.
III: The Yield Engine — Tokenized Treasuries
Tokenized Treasuries, the quiet revolution of 2025, bridge traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure. These are digital representations of U.S. government securities, issued and traded on blockchain platforms, offering real-time settlement, transparency, and reduced transaction costs.For institutional investors, they are a pragmatic blend of yield, safety, and liquidity — a digital version of the safest asset in the world.
The market momentum is striking. Platforms like BlackRock's BUIDL Fund, Franklin Templeton's OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, and Circle's integration of tokenized treasuries with stablecoin reserves demonstrate that tokenization has become more than a proof of concept — it's an evolving market infrastructure.
Critically, tokenized treasuries are not currencies; they are collateral instruments. Yet their yield and safety make them natural complements to stablecoins, which can use tokenized T-bills as backing. The result: an ecosystem where stablecoins provide payments liquidity, tokenized treasuries provide yield, and DeFi protocols combine them into programmable financial instruments.
This convergence signals a broader shift — from speculative crypto to institutional blockchain finance.
IV: Geopolitics of Digital Money
The digital currency race is no longer theoretical. It's geopolitical.


China's e-CNY is expanding through Belt and Road digital corridors, enabling cross-border settlement and reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar.


The BRICS bloc — notably Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — are experimenting with a shared settlement token for energy and commodity trade.


The Gulf states, led by the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are piloting cross-border CBDCs through the mBridge project, exploring oil trade settlement beyond SWIFT.


Meanwhile, Africa is experimenting with CBDCs for financial inclusion, from Nigeria's eNaira to Ghana's eCedi, though adoption remains tepid.


The result is a fragmenting monetary order, where competing digital rails may mirror geopolitical blocs. The contest is not just technological — it is a struggle for monetary influence in a multipolar world.
V: Infrastructure, Interoperability, and the Coming Standard War
The next global contest will not be fought over whether money becomes digital — but whose digital money can talk to whose system.
Interoperability frameworks such as SWIFT's CBDC Bridge, Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), and BIS's Project Icebreaker aim to connect different blockchain networks and CBDC systems. Meanwhile, ISO 20022-compliant blockchain protocols are becoming the lingua franca for financial messaging.
The analogy is instructive: digital currency standards in 2025 are where internet protocols were in 1995 — chaotic, fragmented, and about to consolidate. Whoever sets the dominant interoperability layer will, in effect, own the next generation of global settlement.
VI: The Ethics of Programmability and Surveillance
Programmable money introduces powerful possibilities — and risks.Governments could automate stimulus, target subsidies, or impose consumption limits. Private issuers could embed smart-contract restrictions that enforce compliance. The line between policy tool and control mechanism is thin.
This raises a broader philosophical tension:


CBDCs maximize control but risk eroding privacy.


Stablecoins maximize flexibility but risk fragility.


Tokenized assets maximize efficiency but rely on market discipline.


The question becomes: how much trust should we encode — and in whom?
VII: The Global South and the Trust Deficit
For emerging markets, the stakes are existential.CBDCs promise inclusion for the unbanked, but digital literacy, weak institutions, and low trust often blunt adoption. Nigeria's eNaira has struggled to gain traction; Kenya's pilot projects are more successful but limited in scope.
Conversely, dollar-denominated stablecoins have found natural adoption in inflation-prone economies like Argentina, Turkey, and Lebanon. For citizens facing volatile local currencies, stablecoins are not speculation — they're survival. Yet such usage sidelines domestic policy and erodes the local banking base.
The digital divide in money, therefore, is not about access but agency — who gets to define value in the system they use.
VIII: Environmental and Energy Efficiency
As finance digitizes, sustainability enters the ledger.CBDCs and permissioned blockchains are typically energy-light, while public chains hosting stablecoins and tokenized assets face scrutiny over energy intensity.Ethereum's 2022 shift to proof-of-stake mitigated much of this, reducing its energy consumption by over 99%, but ESG-minded institutions still demand green certification for digital assets.
A “digital-green finance” framework is emerging, linking tokenization to carbon accounting and sustainable bond issuance, aligning with the EU's Green Deal and the IMF's climate finance agenda.
IX: Integration with DeFi and Capital Markets
The border between DeFi and traditional finance is dissolving.Tokenized treasuries serve as collateral in DeFi lending, and on-chain repurchase agreements (tokenized repo) are now tested by major banks.Instant T+0 settlement and 24/7 liquidity are no longer utopian — they are operational prototypes.
This creates a new hybrid system:


CeFi meets DeFi, regulated by code but supervised by compliance.


Real-World Assets (RWA) become the bridge that legitimizes decentralized finance for institutional capital.


The risk? Code errors or liquidity crunches could propagate faster through programmable markets than regulators can react.
X: The Policy Horizon — Regulation, Resilience, and Pluralism
Regulators face a trilemma: encourage innovation, preserve stability, and protect privacy.A pragmatic approach is pluralism with guardrails — multiple forms of digital money coexisting under clear, enforceable standards.
Key policy moves now taking shape:


The EU advancing legal frameworks for the digital euro and MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets).


The U.S. endorsing regulated stablecoins while rejecting a retail CBDC.


The BIS and IMF crafting global guidance for tokenized assets and interoperability.


If successful, this architecture could enable programmable finance without creating an unregulated casino or an overbearing surveillance system.
Conclusion: Trust Is the Real Currency
The CBDC, stablecoin, and tokenized-treasury triad are not binary choices but components of an emerging digital-finance ecosystem.CBDCs will serve as the public backstop; stablecoins will dominate payments and cross-border liquidity; tokenized treasuries will anchor yield and collateral.
The question that remains is not technical but moral:

Who do we trust to define money — the state, the market, or the algorithm?

In that sense, the future of money is the future of democracy itself.

Digital Assets Week London 2025: Lord Chris Holmes and the Future of Inclusive Innovation
[https://daweek.org/london-25/]
Digital Assets Week London, held on 8–9 October 2025 at One Great George Street in Westminster, stood as one of the defining gatherings in the digital finance calendar — a meeting point between innovation and regulation. The event convened institutional investors, asset managers, central bankers, technologists, and policymakers to discuss how blockchain infrastructure, tokenization, and digital securities are reshaping capital markets. Over two days, participants explored interoperability, regulatory clarity, digital identity, and the rapid institutionalization of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) such as government bonds and money market funds. London, with its blend of financial tradition and openness to technological change, provided a fitting stage for these conversations about the future of digital finance.
Among the leading voices was Lord Chris Holmes of Richmond, a Tory peer in the House of Lords and one of the UK's foremost advocates for accessible, ethical, and human-centred technology. A long-standing proponent of innovation that serves the public good, Holmes framed his remarks around the twin principles of trust and consensus. He argued that while blockchain offers immense potential for efficiency and transparency, its true test lies in whether it can deliver collective benefit rather than fragmenting financial systems into competing silos. For Holmes, the future of digital assets depends less on technological capability and more on the ability of industry, regulators, and governments to reach a shared, consensus-based vision for digital infrastructure — one that balances innovation, consumer protection, and systemic resilience.
Holmes praised the UK's evolving digital asset framework, acknowledging the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HM Treasury for their work in defining proportionate, innovation-friendly regulation. However, he warned that innovation without coordination risks confusion and exclusion. To him, the answer lies in dialogue and co-creation: policymakers, technologists, and financial institutions must build standards together rather than in isolation. Regulation, he stressed, should not be a constraint but a catalyst for trust, ensuring transparency and interoperability across jurisdictions.
He also reiterated his lifelong theme of digital inclusion, emphasizing that progress in tokenization, distributed ledger technology (DLT), and programmable finance must extend benefits beyond capital markets to citizens, small businesses, and public services. Holmes's vision — grounded in ethical innovation and consensus governance — resonated throughout the conference. His message captured the moment perfectly: the digital asset revolution will only achieve legitimacy when it is built not just on smart contracts, but on shared trust, common standards, and collective purpose.










Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) represent sovereign money in programmable form — digital legal tender issued by the state, designed to ensure monetary sovereignty in a digitized economy.Advocates tout their ability to streamline welfare transfers, strengthen financial inclusion, and preserve the central bank's role in a future where private payments dominate. The European Central Bank's digital euro embodies this logic: a public good designed to counterbalance Big Tech and private tokens, guaranteeing universal access to risk-free digital money.
Yet CBDCs are politically heavy and operationally complex. They raise profound privacy and surveillance questions — who monitors the ledger, and under what authority? Programmable CBDCs could, in principle, restrict spending or impose expiry dates on funds, prompting civil-liberties debates about the boundaries between monetary policy and social engineering. The philosophical divide is deep: CBDCs are trust in state systems, while stablecoins represent trust in code and corporate governance.
The Trump 2.0 administration has openly rejected a U.S. CBDC, framing it as “government surveillance money.” Washington instead favors regulated, dollar-backed stablecoins — maintaining U.S. monetary influence globally while avoiding domestic political backlash. The contrast with the EU could not be starker: Brussels is advancing the digital euro as an instrument of sovereignty, not surveillance.
II: The Market's Solution — Stablecoins
Stablecoins are privately issued, typically dollar-pegged tokens that promise stability and usability across global payment systems. Their appeal lies in speed, interoperability, and innovation — they integrate seamlessly with decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border payments, and fintech rails that traditional banks can't match.
For U.S. policymakers, stablecoins are a strategic export tool. In lieu of a CBDC, regulated stablecoins such as USDC or PayPal USD sustain the dollar's global reach. Legislation such as the Clarity for Stablecoins Act and support from the Treasury indicate a policy pivot toward “dollarization by private proxy.”
Still, stablecoins' stability is not guaranteed. Their peg depends on reserve quality, transparency, and regulatory oversight. Weakly collateralized coins risk “digital bank runs,” while even fully backed ones raise systemic questions if they siphon deposits from commercial banks.In emerging markets, the flood of dollar stablecoins could undermine local monetary policy and accelerate digital dollarization — an unspoken geopolitical extension of U.S. soft power.
III: The Yield Engine — Tokenized Treasuries
Tokenized Treasuries, the quiet revolution of 2025, bridge traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure. These are digital representations of U.S. government securities, issued and traded on blockchain platforms, offering real-time settlement, transparency, and reduced transaction costs.For institutional investors, they are a pragmatic blend of yield, safety, and liquidity — a digital version of the safest asset in the world.
The market momentum is striking. Platforms like BlackRock's BUIDL Fund, Franklin Templeton's OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, and Circle's integration of tokenized treasuries with stablecoin reserves demonstrate that tokenization has become more than a proof of concept — it's an evolving market infrastructure.
Critically, tokenized treasuries are not currencies; they are collateral instruments. Yet their yield and safety make them natural complements to stablecoins, which can use tokenized T-bills as backing. The result: an ecosystem where stablecoins provide payments liquidity, tokenized treasuries provide yield, and DeFi protocols combine them into programmable financial instruments.
This convergence signals a broader shift — from speculative crypto to institutional blockchain finance.
IV: Geopolitics of Digital Money
The digital currency race is no longer theoretical. It's geopolitical.


China's e-CNY is expanding through Belt and Road digital corridors, enabling cross-border settlement and reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar.


The BRICS bloc — notably Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — are experimenting with a shared settlement token for energy and commodity trade.


The Gulf states, led by the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are piloting cross-border CBDCs through the mBridge project, exploring oil trade settlement beyond SWIFT.


Meanwhile, Africa is experimenting with CBDCs for financial inclusion, from Nigeria's eNaira to Ghana's eCedi, though adoption remains tepid.


The result is a fragmenting monetary order, where competing digital rails may mirror geopolitical blocs. The contest is not just technological — it is a struggle for monetary influence in a multipolar world.
V: Infrastructure, Interoperability, and the Coming Standard War
The next global contest will not be fought over whether money becomes digital — but whose digital money can talk to whose system.
Interoperability frameworks such as SWIFT's CBDC Bridge, Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), and BIS's Project Icebreaker aim to connect different blockchain networks and CBDC systems. Meanwhile, ISO 20022-compliant blockchain protocols are becoming the lingua franca for financial messaging.
The analogy is instructive: digital currency standards in 2025 are where internet protocols were in 1995 — chaotic, fragmented, and about to consolidate. Whoever sets the dominant interoperability layer will, in effect, own the next generation of global settlement.
VI: The Ethics of Programmability and Surveillance
Programmable money introduces powerful possibilities — and risks.Governments could automate stimulus, target subsidies, or impose consumption limits. Private issuers could embed smart-contract restrictions that enforce compliance. The line between policy tool and control mechanism is thin.
This raises a broader philosophical tension:


CBDCs maximize control but risk eroding privacy.


Stablecoins maximize flexibility but risk fragility.


Tokenized assets maximize efficiency but rely on market discipline.


The question becomes: how much trust should we encode — and in whom?
VII: The Global South and the Trust Deficit
For emerging markets, the stakes are existential.CBDCs promise inclusion for the unbanked, but digital literacy, weak institutions, and low trust often blunt adoption. Nigeria's eNaira has struggled to gain traction; Kenya's pilot projects are more successful but limited in scope.
Conversely, dollar-denominated stablecoins have found natural adoption in inflation-prone economies like Argentina, Turkey, and Lebanon. For citizens facing volatile local currencies, stablecoins are not speculation — they're survival. Yet such usage sidelines domestic policy and erodes the local banking base.
The digital divide in money, therefore, is not about access but agency — who gets to define value in the system they use.
VIII: Environmental and Energy Efficiency
As finance digitizes, sustainability enters the ledger.CBDCs and permissioned blockchains are typically energy-light, while public chains hosting stablecoins and tokenized assets face scrutiny over energy intensity.Ethereum's 2022 shift to proof-of-stake mitigated much of this, reducing its energy consumption by over 99%, but ESG-minded institutions still demand green certification for digital assets.
A “digital-green finance” framework is emerging, linking tokenization to carbon accounting and sustainable bond issuance, aligning with the EU's Green Deal and the IMF's climate finance agenda.
IX: Integration with DeFi and Capital Markets
The border between DeFi and traditional finance is dissolving.Tokenized treasuries serve as collateral in DeFi lending, and on-chain repurchase agreements (tokenized repo) are now tested by major banks.Instant T+0 settlement and 24/7 liquidity are no longer utopian — they are operational prototypes.
This creates a new hybrid system:


CeFi meets DeFi, regulated by code but supervised by compliance.


Real-World Assets (RWA) become the bridge that legitimizes decentralized finance for institutional capital.


The risk? Code errors or liquidity crunches could propagate faster through programmable markets than regulators can react.
X: The Policy Horizon — Regulation, Resilience, and Pluralism
Regulators face a trilemma: encourage innovation, preserve stability, and protect privacy.A pragmatic approach is pluralism with guardrails — multiple forms of digital money coexisting under clear, enforceable standards.
Key policy moves now taking shape:


The EU advancing legal frameworks for the digital euro and MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets).


The U.S. endorsing regulated stablecoins while rejecting a retail CBDC.


The BIS and IMF crafting global guidance for tokenized assets and interoperability.


If successful, this architecture could enable programmable finance without creating an unregulated casino or an overbearing surveillance system.
Conclusion: Trust Is the Real Currency
The CBDC, stablecoin, and tokenized-treasury triad are not binary choices but components of an emerging digital-finance ecosystem.CBDCs will serve as the public backstop; stablecoins will dominate payments and cross-border liquidity; tokenized treasuries will anchor yield and collateral.
The question that remains is not technical but moral:

Who do we trust to define money — the state, the market, or the algorithm?

In that sense, the future of money is the future of democracy itself.

For Holmes, the future of digital assets depends less on technological capability and more on the ability of industry, regulators, and governments to reach a shared, consensus-based vision for digital infrastructure — one that balances innovation, consumer protection, and systemic resilience.
Holmes praised the UK's evolving digital asset framework, acknowledging the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HM Treasury for their work in defining proportionate, innovation-friendly regulation. However, he warned that innovation without coordination risks confusion and exclusion. To him, the answer lies in dialogue and co-creation: policymakers, technologists, and financial institutions must build standards together rather than in isolation. Regulation, he stressed, should not be a constraint but a catalyst for trust, ensuring transparency and interoperability across jurisdictions.
He also reiterated his lifelong theme of digital inclusion, emphasizing that progress in tokenization, distributed ledger technology (DLT), and programmable finance must extend benefits beyond capital markets to citizens, small businesses, and public services. Holmes's vision — grounded in ethical innovation and consensus governance — resonated throughout the conference. His message captured the moment perfectly: the digital asset revolution will only achieve legitimacy when it is built not just on smart contracts, but on shared trust, common standards, and collective purpose.










Stablecoins are privately issued, typically dollar-pegged tokens that promise stability and usability across global payment systems. Their appeal lies in speed, interoperability, and innovation — they integrate seamlessly with decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border payments, and fintech rails that traditional banks can't match.
For U.S. policymakers, stablecoins are a strategic export tool. In lieu of a CBDC, regulated stablecoins such as USDC or PayPal USD sustain the dollar's global reach. Legislation such as the Clarity for Stablecoins Act and support from the Treasury indicate a policy pivot toward “dollarization by private proxy.”
Still, stablecoins' stability is not guaranteed. Their peg depends on reserve quality, transparency, and regulatory oversight. Weakly collateralized coins risk “digital bank runs,” while even fully backed ones raise systemic questions if they siphon deposits from commercial banks.In emerging markets, the flood of dollar stablecoins could undermine local monetary policy and accelerate digital dollarization — an unspoken geopolitical extension of U.S. soft power.
III: The Yield Engine — Tokenized Treasuries
Tokenized Treasuries, the quiet revolution of 2025, bridge traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure. These are digital representations of U.S. government securities, issued and traded on blockchain platforms, offering real-time settlement, transparency, and reduced transaction costs.For institutional investors, they are a pragmatic blend of yield, safety, and liquidity — a digital version of the safest asset in the world.
The market momentum is striking. Platforms like BlackRock's BUIDL Fund, Franklin Templeton's OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, and Circle's integration of tokenized treasuries with stablecoin reserves demonstrate that tokenization has become more than a proof of concept — it's an evolving market infrastructure.
Critically, tokenized treasuries are not currencies; they are collateral instruments. Yet their yield and safety make them natural complements to stablecoins, which can use tokenized T-bills as backing. The result: an ecosystem where stablecoins provide payments liquidity, tokenized treasuries provide yield, and DeFi protocols combine them into programmable financial instruments.
This convergence signals a broader shift — from speculative crypto to institutional blockchain finance.
IV: Geopolitics of Digital Money
The digital currency race is no longer theoretical. It's geopolitical.


China's e-CNY is expanding through Belt and Road digital corridors, enabling cross-border settlement and reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar.


The BRICS bloc — notably Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — are experimenting with a shared settlement token for energy and commodity trade.


The Gulf states, led by the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are piloting cross-border CBDCs through the mBridge project, exploring oil trade settlement beyond SWIFT.


Meanwhile, Africa is experimenting with CBDCs for financial inclusion, from Nigeria's eNaira to Ghana's eCedi, though adoption remains tepid.


The result is a fragmenting monetary order, where competing digital rails may mirror geopolitical blocs. The contest is not just technological — it is a struggle for monetary influence in a multipolar world.
V: Infrastructure, Interoperability, and the Coming Standard War
The next global contest will not be fought over whether money becomes digital — but whose digital money can talk to whose system.
Interoperability frameworks such as SWIFT's CBDC Bridge, Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), and BIS's Project Icebreaker aim to connect different blockchain networks and CBDC systems. Meanwhile, ISO 20022-compliant blockchain protocols are becoming the lingua franca for financial messaging.
The analogy is instructive: digital currency standards in 2025 are where internet protocols were in 1995 — chaotic, fragmented, and about to consolidate. Whoever sets the dominant interoperability layer will, in effect, own the next generation of global settlement.
VI: The Ethics of Programmability and Surveillance
Programmable money introduces powerful possibilities — and risks.Governments could automate stimulus, target subsidies, or impose consumption limits. Private issuers could embed smart-contract restrictions that enforce compliance. The line between policy tool and control mechanism is thin.
This raises a broader philosophical tension:


CBDCs maximize control but risk eroding privacy.


Stablecoins maximize flexibility but risk fragility.


Tokenized assets maximize efficiency but rely on market discipline.


The question becomes: how much trust should we encode — and in whom?
VII: The Global South and the Trust Deficit
For emerging markets, the stakes are existential.CBDCs promise inclusion for the unbanked, but digital literacy, weak institutions, and low trust often blunt adoption. Nigeria's eNaira has struggled to gain traction; Kenya's pilot projects are more successful but limited in scope.
Conversely, dollar-denominated stablecoins have found natural adoption in inflation-prone economies like Argentina, Turkey, and Lebanon. For citizens facing volatile local currencies, stablecoins are not speculation — they're survival. Yet such usage sidelines domestic policy and erodes the local banking base.
The digital divide in money, therefore, is not about access but agency — who gets to define value in the system they use.
VIII: Environmental and Energy Efficiency
As finance digitizes, sustainability enters the ledger.CBDCs and permissioned blockchains are typically energy-light, while public chains hosting stablecoins and tokenized assets face scrutiny over energy intensity.Ethereum's 2022 shift to proof-of-stake mitigated much of this, reducing its energy consumption by over 99%, but ESG-minded institutions still demand green certification for digital assets.
A “digital-green finance” framework is emerging, linking tokenization to carbon accounting and sustainable bond issuance, aligning with the EU's Green Deal and the IMF's climate finance agenda.
IX: Integration with DeFi and Capital Markets
The border between DeFi and traditional finance is dissolving.Tokenized treasuries serve as collateral in DeFi lending, and on-chain repurchase agreements (tokenized repo) are now tested by major banks.Instant T+0 settlement and 24/7 liquidity are no longer utopian — they are operational prototypes.
This creates a new hybrid system:


CeFi meets DeFi, regulated by code but supervised by compliance.


Real-World Assets (RWA) become the bridge that legitimizes decentralized finance for institutional capital.


The risk? Code errors or liquidity crunches could propagate faster through programmable markets than regulators can react.
X: The Policy Horizon — Regulation, Resilience, and Pluralism
Regulators face a trilemma: encourage innovation, preserve stability, and protect privacy.A pragmatic approach is pluralism with guardrails — multiple forms of digital money coexisting under clear, enforceable standards.
Key policy moves now taking shape:


The EU advancing legal frameworks for the digital euro and MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets).


The U.S. endorsing regulated stablecoins while rejecting a retail CBDC.


The BIS and IMF crafting global guidance for tokenized assets and interoperability.


If successful, this architecture could enable programmable finance without creating an unregulated casino or an overbearing surveillance system.
Conclusion: Trust Is the Real Currency
The CBDC, stablecoin, and tokenized-treasury triad are not binary choices but components of an emerging digital-finance ecosystem.CBDCs will serve as the public backstop; stablecoins will dominate payments and cross-border liquidity; tokenized treasuries will anchor yield and collateral.
The question that remains is not technical but moral:

Who do we trust to define money — the state, the market, or the algorithm?

In that sense, the future of money is the future of democracy itself.

Digital Assets Week London 2025: Lord Chris Holmes and the Future of Inclusive Innovation
[https://daweek.org/london-25/]
Digital Assets Week London, held on 8–9 October 2025 at One Great George Street in Westminster, stood as one of the defining gatherings in the digital finance calendar — a meeting point between innovation and regulation. The event convened institutional investors, asset managers, central bankers, technologists, and policymakers to discuss how blockchain infrastructure, tokenization, and digital securities are reshaping capital markets. Over two days, participants explored interoperability, regulatory clarity, digital identity, and the rapid institutionalization of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) such as government bonds and money market funds. London, with its blend of financial tradition and openness to technological change, provided a fitting stage for these conversations about the future of digital finance.
Among the leading voices was Lord Chris Holmes of Richmond, a Tory peer in the House of Lords and one of the UK's foremost advocates for accessible, ethical, and human-centred technology. A long-standing proponent of innovation that serves the public good, Holmes framed his remarks around the twin principles of trust and consensus. He argued that while blockchain offers immense potential for efficiency and transparency, its true test lies in whether it can deliver collective benefit rather than fragmenting financial systems into competing silos.

For citizens facing volatile local currencies, stablecoins are not speculation — they're survival. Yet such usage sidelines domestic policy and erodes the local banking base.
The digital divide in money, therefore, is not about access but agency — who gets to define value in the system they use.
VIII: Environmental and Energy Efficiency
As finance digitizes, sustainability enters the ledger.CBDCs and permissioned blockchains are typically energy-light, while public chains hosting stablecoins and tokenized assets face scrutiny over energy intensity.Ethereum's 2022 shift to proof-of-stake mitigated much of this, reducing its energy consumption by over 99%, but ESG-minded institutions still demand green certification for digital assets.
A “digital-green finance” framework is emerging, linking tokenization to carbon accounting and sustainable bond issuance, aligning with the EU's Green Deal and the IMF's climate finance agenda.
IX: Integration with DeFi and Capital Markets
The border between DeFi and traditional finance is dissolving.Tokenized treasuries serve as collateral in DeFi lending, and on-chain repurchase agreements (tokenized repo) are now tested by major banks.Instant T+0 settlement and 24/7 liquidity are no longer utopian — they are operational prototypes.
This creates a new hybrid system:


CeFi meets DeFi, regulated by code but supervised by compliance.


Real-World Assets (RWA) become the bridge that legitimizes decentralized finance for institutional capital.


The risk? Code errors or liquidity crunches could propagate faster through programmable markets than regulators can react.
X: The Policy Horizon — Regulation, Resilience, and Pluralism
Regulators face a trilemma: encourage innovation, preserve stability, and protect privacy.A pragmatic approach is pluralism with guardrails — multiple forms of digital money coexisting under clear, enforceable standards.
Key policy moves now taking shape:


The EU advancing legal frameworks for the digital euro and MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets).


The U.S. endorsing regulated stablecoins while rejecting a retail CBDC.


The BIS and IMF crafting global guidance for tokenized assets and interoperability.


If successful, this architecture could enable programmable finance without creating an unregulated casino or an overbearing surveillance system.
Conclusion: Trust Is the Real Currency
The CBDC, stablecoin, and tokenized-treasury triad are not binary choices but components of an emerging digital-finance ecosystem.CBDCs will serve as the public backstop; stablecoins will dominate payments and cross-border liquidity; tokenized treasuries will anchor yield and collateral.
The question that remains is not technical but moral:

Who do we trust to define money — the state, the market, or the algorithm?

In that sense, the future of money is the future of democracy itself.

Digital Assets Week London 2025: Lord Chris Holmes and the Future of Inclusive Innovation
[https://daweek.org/london-25/]
Digital Assets Week London, held on 8–9 October 2025 at One Great George Street in Westminster, stood as one of the defining gatherings in the digital finance calendar — a meeting point between innovation and regulation. The event convened institutional investors, asset managers, central bankers, technologists, and policymakers to discuss how blockchain infrastructure, tokenization, and digital securities are reshaping capital markets. Over two days, participants explored interoperability, regulatory clarity, digital identity, and the rapid institutionalization of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) such as government bonds and money market funds. London, with its blend of financial tradition and openness to technological change, provided a fitting stage for these conversations about the future of digital finance.
Among the leading voices was Lord Chris Holmes of Richmond, a Tory peer in the House of Lords and one of the UK's foremost advocates for accessible, ethical, and human-centred technology. A long-standing proponent of innovation that serves the public good, Holmes framed his remarks around the twin principles of trust and consensus. He argued that while blockchain offers immense potential for efficiency and transparency, its true test lies in whether it can deliver collective benefit rather than fragmenting financial systems into competing silos. For Holmes, the future of digital assets depends less on technological capability and more on the ability of industry, regulators, and governments to reach a shared, consensus-based vision for digital infrastructure — one that balances innovation, consumer protection, and systemic resilience.
Holmes praised the UK's evolving digital asset framework, acknowledging the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HM Treasury for their work in defining proportionate, innovation-friendly regulation. However, he warned that innovation without coordination risks confusion and exclusion. To him, the answer lies in dialogue and co-creation: policymakers, technologists, and financial institutions must build standards together rather than in isolation. Regulation, he stressed, should not be a constraint but a catalyst for trust, ensuring transparency and interoperability across jurisdictions.
He also reiterated his lifelong theme of digital inclusion, emphasizing that progress in tokenization, distributed ledger technology (DLT), and programmable finance must extend benefits beyond capital markets to citizens, small businesses, and public services. Holmes's vision — grounded in ethical innovation and consensus governance — resonated throughout the conference. His message captured the moment perfectly: the digital asset revolution will only achieve legitimacy when it is built not just on smart contracts, but on shared trust, common standards, and collective purpose.










The market momentum is striking. Platforms like BlackRock's BUIDL Fund, Franklin Templeton's OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, and Circle's integration of tokenized treasuries with stablecoin reserves demonstrate that tokenization has become more than a proof of concept — it's an evolving market infrastructure.
Critically, tokenized treasuries are not currencies; they are collateral instruments. Yet their yield and safety make them natural complements to stablecoins, which can use tokenized T-bills as backing. The result: an ecosystem where stablecoins provide payments liquidity, tokenized treasuries provide yield, and DeFi protocols combine them into programmable financial instruments.
This convergence signals a broader shift — from speculative crypto to institutional blockchain finance.
IV: Geopolitics of Digital Money
The digital currency race is no longer theoretical. It's geopolitical.


China's e-CNY is expanding through Belt and Road digital corridors, enabling cross-border settlement and reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar.


The BRICS bloc — notably Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — are experimenting with a shared settlement token for energy and commodity trade.


The Gulf states, led by the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are piloting cross-border CBDCs through the mBridge project, exploring oil trade settlement beyond SWIFT.


Meanwhile, Africa is experimenting with CBDCs for financial inclusion, from Nigeria's eNaira to Ghana's eCedi, though adoption remains tepid.


The result is a fragmenting monetary order, where competing digital rails may mirror geopolitical blocs. The contest is not just technological — it is a struggle for monetary influence in a multipolar world.
V: Infrastructure, Interoperability, and the Coming Standard War
The next global contest will not be fought over whether money becomes digital — but whose digital money can talk to whose system.
Interoperability frameworks such as SWIFT's CBDC Bridge, Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), and BIS's Project Icebreaker aim to connect different blockchain networks and CBDC systems. Meanwhile, ISO 20022-compliant blockchain protocols are becoming the lingua franca for financial messaging.
The analogy is instructive: digital currency standards in 2025 are where internet protocols were in 1995 — chaotic, fragmented, and about to consolidate. Whoever sets the dominant interoperability layer will, in effect, own the next generation of global settlement.
VI: The Ethics of Programmability and Surveillance
Programmable money introduces powerful possibilities — and risks.Governments could automate stimulus, target subsidies, or impose consumption limits. Private issuers could embed smart-contract restrictions that enforce compliance. The line between policy tool and control mechanism is thin.
This raises a broader philosophical tension:


CBDCs maximize control but risk eroding privacy.


Stablecoins maximize flexibility but risk fragility.


Tokenized assets maximize efficiency but rely on market discipline.


The question becomes: how much trust should we encode — and in whom?
VII: The Global South and the Trust Deficit
For emerging markets, the stakes are existential.CBDCs promise inclusion for the unbanked, but digital literacy, weak institutions, and low trust often blunt adoption. Nigeria's eNaira has struggled to gain traction; Kenya's pilot projects are more successful but limited in scope.
Conversely, dollar-denominated stablecoins have found natural adoption in inflation-prone economies like Argentina, Turkey, and Lebanon.

A “digital-green finance” framework is emerging, linking tokenization to carbon accounting and sustainable bond issuance, aligning with the EU's Green Deal and the IMF's climate finance agenda.
IX: Integration with DeFi and Capital Markets
The border between DeFi and traditional finance is dissolving.Tokenized treasuries serve as collateral in DeFi lending, and on-chain repurchase agreements (tokenized repo) are now tested by major banks.Instant T+0 settlement and 24/7 liquidity are no longer utopian — they are operational prototypes.
This creates a new hybrid system:


CeFi meets DeFi, regulated by code but supervised by compliance.


Real-World Assets (RWA) become the bridge that legitimizes decentralized finance for institutional capital.


The risk? Code errors or liquidity crunches could propagate faster through programmable markets than regulators can react.
X: The Policy Horizon — Regulation, Resilience, and Pluralism
Regulators face a trilemma: encourage innovation, preserve stability, and protect privacy.A pragmatic approach is pluralism with guardrails — multiple forms of digital money coexisting under clear, enforceable standards.
Key policy moves now taking shape:


The EU advancing legal frameworks for the digital euro and MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets).


The U.S. endorsing regulated stablecoins while rejecting a retail CBDC.


The BIS and IMF crafting global guidance for tokenized assets and interoperability.


If successful, this architecture could enable programmable finance without creating an unregulated casino or an overbearing surveillance system.
Conclusion: Trust Is the Real Currency
The CBDC, stablecoin, and tokenized-treasury triad are not binary choices but components of an emerging digital-finance ecosystem.CBDCs will serve as the public backstop; stablecoins will dominate payments and cross-border liquidity; tokenized treasuries will anchor yield and collateral.
The question that remains is not technical but moral:

Who do we trust to define money — the state, the market, or the algorithm?

In that sense, the future of money is the future of democracy itself.

Digital Assets Week London 2025: Lord Chris Holmes and the Future of Inclusive Innovation
[https://daweek.org/london-25/]
Digital Assets Week London, held on 8–9 October 2025 at One Great George Street in Westminster, stood as one of the defining gatherings in the digital finance calendar — a meeting point between innovation and regulation. The event convened institutional investors, asset managers, central bankers, technologists, and policymakers to discuss how blockchain infrastructure, tokenization, and digital securities are reshaping capital markets. Over two days, participants explored interoperability, regulatory clarity, digital identity, and the rapid institutionalization of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) such as government bonds and money market funds. London, with its blend of financial tradition and openness to technological change, provided a fitting stage for these conversations about the future of digital finance.
Among the leading voices was Lord Chris Holmes of Richmond, a Tory peer in the House of Lords and one of the UK's foremost advocates for accessible, ethical, and human-centred technology. A long-standing proponent of innovation that serves the public good, Holmes framed his remarks around the twin principles of trust and consensus. He argued that while blockchain offers immense potential for efficiency and transparency, its true test lies in whether it can deliver collective benefit rather than fragmenting financial systems into competing silos. For Holmes, the future of digital assets depends less on technological capability and more on the ability of industry, regulators, and governments to reach a shared, consensus-based vision for digital infrastructure — one that balances innovation, consumer protection, and systemic resilience.
Holmes praised the UK's evolving digital asset framework, acknowledging the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HM Treasury for their work in defining proportionate, innovation-friendly regulation. However, he warned that innovation without coordination risks confusion and exclusion. To him, the answer lies in dialogue and co-creation: policymakers, technologists, and financial institutions must build standards together rather than in isolation. Regulation, he stressed, should not be a constraint but a catalyst for trust, ensuring transparency and interoperability across jurisdictions.
He also reiterated his lifelong theme of digital inclusion, emphasizing that progress in tokenization, distributed ledger technology (DLT), and programmable finance must extend benefits beyond capital markets to citizens, small businesses, and public services. Holmes's vision — grounded in ethical innovation and consensus governance — resonated throughout the conference. His message captured the moment perfectly: the digital asset revolution will only achieve legitimacy when it is built not just on smart contracts, but on shared trust, common standards, and collective purpose.










China's e-CNY is expanding through Belt and Road digital corridors, enabling cross-border settlement and reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar.


The BRICS bloc — notably Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — are experimenting with a shared settlement token for energy and commodity trade.


The Gulf states, led by the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are piloting cross-border CBDCs through the mBridge project, exploring oil trade settlement beyond SWIFT.


Meanwhile, Africa is experimenting with CBDCs for financial inclusion, from Nigeria's eNaira to Ghana's eCedi, though adoption remains tepid.


The result is a fragmenting monetary order, where competing digital rails may mirror geopolitical blocs. The contest is not just technological — it is a struggle for monetary influence in a multipolar world.
V: Infrastructure, Interoperability, and the Coming Standard War
The next global contest will not be fought over whether money becomes digital — but whose digital money can talk to whose system.
Interoperability frameworks such as SWIFT's CBDC Bridge, Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), and BIS's Project Icebreaker aim to connect different blockchain networks and CBDC systems. Meanwhile, ISO 20022-compliant blockchain protocols are becoming the lingua franca for financial messaging.
The analogy is instructive: digital currency standards in 2025 are where internet protocols were in 1995 — chaotic, fragmented, and about to consolidate. Whoever sets the dominant interoperability layer will, in effect, own the next generation of global settlement.
VI: The Ethics of Programmability and Surveillance
Programmable money introduces powerful possibilities — and risks.Governments could automate stimulus, target subsidies, or impose consumption limits. Private issuers could embed smart-contract restrictions that enforce compliance. The line between policy tool and control mechanism is thin.
This raises a broader philosophical tension:


CBDCs maximize control but risk eroding privacy.


Stablecoins maximize flexibility but risk fragility.


Tokenized assets maximize efficiency but rely on market discipline.


The question becomes: how much trust should we encode — and in whom?
VII: The Global South and the Trust Deficit
For emerging markets, the stakes are existential.CBDCs promise inclusion for the unbanked, but digital literacy, weak institutions, and low trust often blunt adoption. Nigeria's eNaira has struggled to gain traction; Kenya's pilot projects are more successful but limited in scope.
Conversely, dollar-denominated stablecoins have found natural adoption in inflation-prone economies like Argentina, Turkey, and Lebanon. For citizens facing volatile local currencies, stablecoins are not speculation — they're survival. Yet such usage sidelines domestic policy and erodes the local banking base.
The digital divide in money, therefore, is not about access but agency — who gets to define value in the system they use.
VIII: Environmental and Energy Efficiency
As finance digitizes, sustainability enters the ledger.CBDCs and permissioned blockchains are typically energy-light, while public chains hosting stablecoins and tokenized assets face scrutiny over energy intensity.Ethereum's 2022 shift to proof-of-stake mitigated much of this, reducing its energy consumption by over 99%, but ESG-minded institutions still demand green certification for digital assets.

Holmes's vision — grounded in ethical innovation and consensus governance — resonated throughout the conference. His message captured the moment perfectly: the digital asset revolution will only achieve legitimacy when it is built not just on smart contracts, but on shared trust, common standards, and collective purpose.










Programmable money introduces powerful possibilities — and risks.Governments could automate stimulus, target subsidies, or impose consumption limits. Private issuers could embed smart-contract restrictions that enforce compliance. The line between policy tool and control mechanism is thin.
This raises a broader philosophical tension:


CBDCs maximize control but risk eroding privacy.


Stablecoins maximize flexibility but risk fragility.


Tokenized assets maximize efficiency but rely on market discipline.


The question becomes: how much trust should we encode — and in whom?
VII: The Global South and the Trust Deficit
For emerging markets, the stakes are existential.CBDCs promise inclusion for the unbanked, but digital literacy, weak institutions, and low trust often blunt adoption. Nigeria's eNaira has struggled to gain traction; Kenya's pilot projects are more successful but limited in scope.
Conversely, dollar-denominated stablecoins have found natural adoption in inflation-prone economies like Argentina, Turkey, and Lebanon. For citizens facing volatile local currencies, stablecoins are not speculation — they're survival. Yet such usage sidelines domestic policy and erodes the local banking base.
The digital divide in money, therefore, is not about access but agency — who gets to define value in the system they use.
VIII: Environmental and Energy Efficiency
As finance digitizes, sustainability enters the ledger.CBDCs and permissioned blockchains are typically energy-light, while public chains hosting stablecoins and tokenized assets face scrutiny over energy intensity.Ethereum's 2022 shift to proof-of-stake mitigated much of this, reducing its energy consumption by over 99%, but ESG-minded institutions still demand green certification for digital assets.
A “digital-green finance” framework is emerging, linking tokenization to carbon accounting and sustainable bond issuance, aligning with the EU's Green Deal and the IMF's climate finance agenda.
IX: Integration with DeFi and Capital Markets
The border between DeFi and traditional finance is dissolving.Tokenized treasuries serve as collateral in DeFi lending, and on-chain repurchase agreements (tokenized repo) are now tested by major banks.Instant T+0 settlement and 24/7 liquidity are no longer utopian — they are operational prototypes.
This creates a new hybrid system:


CeFi meets DeFi, regulated by code but supervised by compliance.


Real-World Assets (RWA) become the bridge that legitimizes decentralized finance for institutional capital.


The risk? Code errors or liquidity crunches could propagate faster through programmable markets than regulators can react.
X: The Policy Horizon — Regulation, Resilience, and Pluralism
Regulators face a trilemma: encourage innovation, preserve stability, and protect privacy.A pragmatic approach is pluralism with guardrails — multiple forms of digital money coexisting under clear, enforceable standards.
Key policy moves now taking shape:


The EU advancing legal frameworks for the digital euro and MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets).


The U.S. endorsing regulated stablecoins while rejecting a retail CBDC.


The BIS and IMF crafting global guidance for tokenized assets and interoperability.


If successful, this architecture could enable programmable finance without creating an unregulated casino or an overbearing surveillance system.
Conclusion: Trust Is the Real Currency
The CBDC, stablecoin, and tokenized-treasury triad are not binary choices but components of an emerging digital-finance ecosystem.CBDCs will serve as the public backstop; stablecoins will dominate payments and cross-border liquidity; tokenized treasuries will anchor yield and collateral.
The question that remains is not technical but moral:

Who do we trust to define money — the state, the market, or the algorithm?

In that sense, the future of money is the future of democracy itself.

Digital Assets Week London 2025: Lord Chris Holmes and the Future of Inclusive Innovation
[https://daweek.org/london-25/]
Digital Assets Week London, held on 8–9 October 2025 at One Great George Street in Westminster, stood as one of the defining gatherings in the digital finance calendar — a meeting point between innovation and regulation. The event convened institutional investors, asset managers, central bankers, technologists, and policymakers to discuss how blockchain infrastructure, tokenization, and digital securities are reshaping capital markets. Over two days, participants explored interoperability, regulatory clarity, digital identity, and the rapid institutionalization of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) such as government bonds and money market funds. London, with its blend of financial tradition and openness to technological change, provided a fitting stage for these conversations about the future of digital finance.
Among the leading voices was Lord Chris Holmes of Richmond, a Tory peer in the House of Lords and one of the UK's foremost advocates for accessible, ethical, and human-centred technology. A long-standing proponent of innovation that serves the public good, Holmes framed his remarks around the twin principles of trust and consensus. He argued that while blockchain offers immense potential for efficiency and transparency, its true test lies in whether it can deliver collective benefit rather than fragmenting financial systems into competing silos. For Holmes, the future of digital assets depends less on technological capability and more on the ability of industry, regulators, and governments to reach a shared, consensus-based vision for digital infrastructure — one that balances innovation, consumer protection, and systemic resilience.
Holmes praised the UK's evolving digital asset framework, acknowledging the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HM Treasury for their work in defining proportionate, innovation-friendly regulation. However, he warned that innovation without coordination risks confusion and exclusion. To him, the answer lies in dialogue and co-creation: policymakers, technologists, and financial institutions must build standards together rather than in isolation. Regulation, he stressed, should not be a constraint but a catalyst for trust, ensuring transparency and interoperability across jurisdictions.
He also reiterated his lifelong theme of digital inclusion, emphasizing that progress in tokenization, distributed ledger technology (DLT), and programmable finance must extend benefits beyond capital markets to citizens, small businesses, and public services. Holmes's vision — grounded in ethical innovation and consensus governance — resonated throughout the conference. His message captured the moment perfectly: the digital asset revolution will only achieve legitimacy when it is built not just on smart contracts, but on shared trust, common standards, and collective purpose.

The event convened institutional investors, asset managers, central bankers, technologists, and policymakers to discuss how blockchain infrastructure, tokenization, and digital securities are reshaping capital markets. Over two days, participants explored interoperability, regulatory clarity, digital identity, and the rapid institutionalization of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) such as government bonds and money market funds. London, with its blend of financial tradition and openness to technological change, provided a fitting stage for these conversations about the future of digital finance.
Among the leading voices was Lord Chris Holmes of Richmond, a Tory peer in the House of Lords and one of the UK's foremost advocates for accessible, ethical, and human-centred technology. A long-standing proponent of innovation that serves the public good, Holmes framed his remarks around the twin principles of trust and consensus. He argued that while blockchain offers immense potential for efficiency and transparency, its true test lies in whether it can deliver collective benefit rather than fragmenting financial systems into competing silos. For Holmes, the future of digital assets depends less on technological capability and more on the ability of industry, regulators, and governments to reach a shared, consensus-based vision for digital infrastructure — one that balances innovation, consumer protection, and systemic resilience.
Holmes praised the UK's evolving digital asset framework, acknowledging the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HM Treasury for their work in defining proportionate, innovation-friendly regulation. However, he warned that innovation without coordination risks confusion and exclusion. To him, the answer lies in dialogue and co-creation: policymakers, technologists, and financial institutions must build standards together rather than in isolation. Regulation, he stressed, should not be a constraint but a catalyst for trust, ensuring transparency and interoperability across jurisdictions.
He also reiterated his lifelong theme of digital inclusion, emphasizing that progress in tokenization, distributed ledger technology (DLT), and programmable finance must extend benefits beyond capital markets to citizens, small businesses, and public services. Holmes's vision — grounded in ethical innovation and consensus governance — resonated throughout the conference. His message captured the moment perfectly: the digital asset revolution will only achieve legitimacy when it is built not just on smart contracts, but on shared trust, common standards, and collective purpose.










As finance digitizes, sustainability enters the ledger.CBDCs and permissioned blockchains are typically energy-light, while public chains hosting stablecoins and tokenized assets face scrutiny over energy intensity.Ethereum's 2022 shift to proof-of-stake mitigated much of this, reducing its energy consumption by over 99%, but ESG-minded institutions still demand green certification for digital assets.
A “digital-green finance” framework is emerging, linking tokenization to carbon accounting and sustainable bond issuance, aligning with the EU's Green Deal and the IMF's climate finance agenda.
IX: Integration with DeFi and Capital Markets
The border between DeFi and traditional finance is dissolving.Tokenized treasuries serve as collateral in DeFi lending, and on-chain repurchase agreements (tokenized repo) are now tested by major banks.Instant T+0 settlement and 24/7 liquidity are no longer utopian — they are operational prototypes.
This creates a new hybrid system:


CeFi meets DeFi, regulated by code but supervised by compliance.


Real-World Assets (RWA) become the bridge that legitimizes decentralized finance for institutional capital.


The risk? Code errors or liquidity crunches could propagate faster through programmable markets than regulators can react.
X: The Policy Horizon — Regulation, Resilience, and Pluralism
Regulators face a trilemma: encourage innovation, preserve stability, and protect privacy.A pragmatic approach is pluralism with guardrails — multiple forms of digital money coexisting under clear, enforceable standards.
Key policy moves now taking shape:


The EU advancing legal frameworks for the digital euro and MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets).


The U.S. endorsing regulated stablecoins while rejecting a retail CBDC.


The BIS and IMF crafting global guidance for tokenized assets and interoperability.


If successful, this architecture could enable programmable finance without creating an unregulated casino or an overbearing surveillance system.
Conclusion: Trust Is the Real Currency
The CBDC, stablecoin, and tokenized-treasury triad are not binary choices but components of an emerging digital-finance ecosystem.CBDCs will serve as the public backstop; stablecoins will dominate payments and cross-border liquidity; tokenized treasuries will anchor yield and collateral.
The question that remains is not technical but moral:

Who do we trust to define money — the state, the market, or the algorithm?

In that sense, the future of money is the future of democracy itself.

The BIS and IMF crafting global guidance for tokenized assets and interoperability.


If successful, this architecture could enable programmable finance without creating an unregulated casino or an overbearing surveillance system.
Conclusion: Trust Is the Real Currency
The CBDC, stablecoin, and tokenized-treasury triad are not binary choices but components of an emerging digital-finance ecosystem.CBDCs will serve as the public backstop; stablecoins will dominate payments and cross-border liquidity; tokenized treasuries will anchor yield and collateral.
The question that remains is not technical but moral:

Who do we trust to define money — the state, the market, or the algorithm?

In that sense, the future of money is the future of democracy itself.

Digital Assets Week London 2025: Lord Chris Holmes and the Future of Inclusive Innovation
[https://daweek.org/london-25/]
Digital Assets Week London, held on 8–9 October 2025 at One Great George Street in Westminster, stood as one of the defining gatherings in the digital finance calendar — a meeting point between innovation and regulation. The event convened institutional investors, asset managers, central bankers, technologists, and policymakers to discuss how blockchain infrastructure, tokenization, and digital securities are reshaping capital markets. Over two days, participants explored interoperability, regulatory clarity, digital identity, and the rapid institutionalization of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) such as government bonds and money market funds. London, with its blend of financial tradition and openness to technological change, provided a fitting stage for these conversations about the future of digital finance.
Among the leading voices was Lord Chris Holmes of Richmond, a Tory peer in the House of Lords and one of the UK's foremost advocates for accessible, ethical, and human-centred technology. A long-standing proponent of innovation that serves the public good, Holmes framed his remarks around the twin principles of trust and consensus. He argued that while blockchain offers immense potential for efficiency and transparency, its true test lies in whether it can deliver collective benefit rather than fragmenting financial systems into competing silos. For Holmes, the future of digital assets depends less on technological capability and more on the ability of industry, regulators, and governments to reach a shared, consensus-based vision for digital infrastructure — one that balances innovation, consumer protection, and systemic resilience.
Holmes praised the UK's evolving digital asset framework, acknowledging the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HM Treasury for their work in defining proportionate, innovation-friendly regulation. However, he warned that innovation without coordination risks confusion and exclusion. To him, the answer lies in dialogue and co-creation: policymakers, technologists, and financial institutions must build standards together rather than in isolation. Regulation, he stressed, should not be a constraint but a catalyst for trust, ensuring transparency and interoperability across jurisdictions.
He also reiterated his lifelong theme of digital inclusion, emphasizing that progress in tokenization, distributed ledger technology (DLT), and programmable finance must extend benefits beyond capital markets to citizens, small businesses, and public services. Holmes's vision — grounded in ethical innovation and consensus governance — resonated throughout the conference. His message captured the moment perfectly: the digital asset revolution will only achieve legitimacy when it is built not just on smart contracts, but on shared trust, common standards, and collective purpose.

Friday's sell-off triggered what Bitwise portfolio manager Jonathan Man called the worst liquidation event in crypto history, with more than $20 billion wiped out as liquidity vanished and forced deleveraging took hold, in an article on X published Saturday.

Perpetual futures — “perps” in trading shorthand — are cash-settled contracts with no expiry that mirror spot via funding payments, not delivery. Profits and losses net against a shared margin pool, which is why, in stress, venues may need to reallocate exposure quickly to keep books balanced.

Man, who is the lead portfolio manager of the Bitwise Multi-Strategy Alpha Fund, said bitcoin fell 13% from peak to trough in a single hour, while losses in long-tail tokens were far steeper — he added that ATOM “fell to virtually zero” on some venues before rebounding. 

He estimated roughly $65 billion in open interest was erased, resetting positioning to levels last seen in July. The headline numbers, he argued, mattered less than the plumbing: when uncertainty spikes, liquidity providers widen quotes or step back to manage inventory and capital, organic liquidations stop clearing at bankruptcy prices, and venues turn to emergency tools.

According to Man, exchanges in that situation leaned on safety valves. 

He said auto-deleveraging kicked in at some venues, forcibly closing part of profitable counter-positions when there was not enough cash on the losing side to pay winners. 

He also pointed to liquidity vaults that absorb distressed flow — Hyperliquid's HLP “had an extremely profitable day,” he said, buying at deep discounts and selling into spikes.

Man said centralized venues saw the most dramatic dislocations as order books thinned, which is why long-tail tokens broke harder than bitcoin and ether. 

By contrast, he said DeFi liquidations were muted for two reasons: major lending protocols tend to accept blue-chip collateral such as BTC and ETH, and Aave and Morpho “hardcoded USDe's price to $1,” limiting cascade risk. 

Although USDe remained solvent, he said it traded around $0.65 on centralized exchanges amid illiquidity — leaving users who posted it as margin on those venues vulnerable to liquidation.

Beyond directional traders, Man highlighted hidden exposures for market-neutral funds. He said the real risks on days like Friday are operational — algorithms running, exchanges staying up, accurate marks, the ability to move margin and execute hedges on time.

He checked in with several managers who reported they were fine, but said he would not be surprised if “some c-tier trading teams got carried out.”

Man also described unusually wide dispersion across venues, citing $300-plus spreads at times between Binance and Hyperliquid on ETH-USD. 

Prices recovered from extreme lows, he said, and positioning flushes created opportunities for traders with dry powder. Man also mentioned that with open interest down sharply, markets entered the weekend on firmer footing than the day before.

$83 billion has just been sitting there underground this whole time.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A deposit of gold ore recently discovered in China isn't just giant. It's supergiant. So much so, in fact, that Chinese experts claim it could be the largest deposit of any precious metal—not just gold ore—in existence today. 

How big is the “supergiant” deposit located under the Wangu gold field in the Hunan province? Experts estimate it at 1,100 tons. 

According to Chinese state media, a team of geologists detected over 40 gold veins of roughly 330 tons of gold ore dipping 6,600 feet deep under Pingjiang County's Wangu gold field. But 3D modeling blows that number out of the water, showing there could be as much as 1,100 tons as deep as 9,800 feet. If the models are accurate, the deposit in its entirely could be worth roughly $83 billion. 

Adding some more heft to the already weighty (literally) find was the report that the new discovery features 138 grams of gold per metric ton of ore, a valuable rate not often found in gold mining. “Many drilled rock cores showed visible gold,” said Chen Rulin, an ore-prospecting expert at China's Hunan Province's Geological Bureau, according to Chinese state media. 

If the 1,100-ton figure holds up, that makes this new find the largest gold mine in the world, even outpacing South Africa's South Deep gold mine with its 1,025 tons of gold, according to Mining Technology. Mines in Indonesia, Russia, New Guinea, and Chile round out the top-five gold mines in the world. The Carlin Trend and Cortez gold mines, both in Nevada, are ranked sixth and 10th worldwide. 

Historically, the world has mined 233,000 tons of gold, all of it still around in some form, and two-thirds of that mining has occurred since 1950. 

Already the world's top gold producer with about 10 percent of global production, China is heavily dependent on the metal, using about three times more gold than it mines annually. A rate that high requires the country to purchase so much gold from other countries that it's also the world's top importer of the valuable metal. This new discovery has put the world's gold markets on notice, enough so that the price of gold rose to $2,700 per ounce, according to CCN.com. 

And the gold news may not stop there. According to Liu Yongjun, vice head of the bureau, additional gold ore was found when drilling around the site's peripheral areas.

Once connected stretches of land, now hidden beneath the sea, may have given early humans a way to move between what is today Türkiye and Europe, according to groundbreaking new research in this little-studied region.

The study, recently published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology, reveals the first evidence of Paleolithic activity in Ayvalık and may reshape how scientists understand our species' journey into Europe.

For decades, experts believed that Homo sapiens reached Europe mainly by traveling through the Balkans and the Levant, moving from Africa into the Middle East.

However, the discovery of 138 stone tools spread across 10 sites within a 200 km² area suggests a different possibility. Long before Ayvalık became known for its olive groves and seaside scenery, this part of the northeastern Aegean coast (now in Turkey) may have served as another key passageway for ancient humans exploring a shifting prehistoric world.

"Our archaeological discovery has unveiled that this now-idyllic region once potentially offered a vital land bridge for human movement during the Pleistocene era -- when sea levels dropped and the now-submerged landscape was briefly exposed," explains Dr. Göknur Karahan, from the Department of Archaeology-Prehistory, at Hacettepe University, in Turkey, who was part of a fully female team of expert archaeologists from the country.

"We are very excited and delighted with this discovery. These findings mark Ayvalık as a potential new frontier in the story of human evolution, placing it firmly on the map of human prehistory -- opening up a new possibility for how early humans may have entered Europe.

"It feels like we are adding an entirely new page to the story of human dispersal. Our research raises exciting possibilities for future exploration, and we hope it emerges as a body of work that will shift the approach of Pleistocene archaeology for decades to come."

How were these findings possible? 

During the Ice Age, sea levels dropped more than 100 meters, revealing vast coastal plains that are now underwater. At that time, the modern islands and peninsulas of Ayvalık would have formed a single stretch of land, creating a natural bridge that linked Anatolia to Europe.

The artifacts found in the new study were discovered along the present-day coastline, providing evidence that people once lived and traveled across these now-submerged landscapes.

Until now, environmental conditions and deep sediment layers had made it difficult to detect or preserve traces of early human activity in the region.

"In all these periods, the present-day islands and peninsulas of Ayvalık would have formed interior zones within an expansive terrestrial environment," explains co-author Professor Kadriye Özçelik, from Ankara University.

"These paleogeographic reconstructions underscore the importance of the region for understanding hominin dispersals across the northeastern Aegean during the Pleistocene."

What was found? 

The region's shifting geology and active coastlines in the North Aegean made preservation difficult and the number of items uncovered "limited," however this research team managed to uncover Levallois technologies from various Paleolithic periods, as well as handaxes and cleavers.

Among the most significant finds include Levallois-style flake tools, sophisticated implements linked to the Middle Paleolithic Mousterian tradition -- these are often associated with Neanderthals and early Homosapiens.

"These large cutting tools are among the most iconic artifacts of the Paleolithic and are instantly recognizable even today, so are a very important find," explains Dr. Karahan.

"The presence of these objects in Ayvalık is particularly significant, as they provide direct evidence that the region was part of wider technological traditions shared across Africa, Asia, and Europe."

Describing the initial discovery of the 131 items, Dr. Karahan adds: "It was a truly unforgettable moment for us. Holding the first tools in our hands was both emotional and inspiring.

"And each find from there on was a moment of excitement for the whole team.

"Holding these objects -- after walking across landscapes where no one had ever documented Paleolithic remains before -- was unforgettable."

What does this discovery tell us about early humans? 

The experts' key argument hinges on the potential of Ayvalık as a dynamic site for interaction and exchange, facilitating early human movement between the Anatolia peninsula and Europe.

Exploring how Anatolia, with specific focus on Ayvalık, and Europe were linked during glacial sea-level low stands offers alternative pathways for how early humans moved around the region beyond dominantly emphasized northern mainland-centered routes.

Addressing a gap in the scholarship, the authors' work provides a new foundation for examining resources and migration routes in which Ayvalık may have featured as part of a mobility corridor.

The survey's yield of tools demonstrates a "consistent use of Levallois technology and flake production… and a diversified toolkit," whilst all artefacts together offer what the team state are "valuable insights into early human presence, raw material preferences, and technological variability."

"The findings paint a vivid picture of early human adaptation, innovation, and mobility along the Aegean," Dr. Karahan explains.

"The results confirmed that Ayvalık -- which had never before been studied for its Paleolithic potential -- holds vital traces of early human activity."

Incredible recoveries, hundreds of thousands of years later 

As this was a survey (carried out across a two-week period in June 2022) rather than an excavation, the team could not be certain of what they would find when they set off. They knew from the region's geology and paleogeography that there was potential. They explored -- often muddy, (particularly in lowland basins and coastal plains) -- sites by foot.

What followed was a "discovery of such a diverse and well-preserved set of artifacts, which exceeded our expectations," Dr. Karahan says.

Although these recovery efforts were not without challenges, the authors explore what both the challenges and findings reveal in the paper. They state: "The widespread, muddy cover was considered a limiting factor for the preservation and detectability of Paleolithic materials.

"However, despite these constraints, high-quality raw material sources, such as flint and chalcedony, were identified in multiple locations, including areas affected by alluvial deposition."

Future potential 

Fellow author Dr. Hande Bulut, from Düzce University, adds: "Ultimately the results underline Ayvalık's potential as a long-term hominin habitat and a key area for understanding Paleolithic technological features in the eastern Aegean.

"While preliminary, the current findings underscore the region's potential to contribute to broader debates on Aegean connectivity and technological evolution during the Pleistocene.

"Excitingly, the region between the North Aegean and the Anatolian mainland, may still hold valuable clues to early occupation despite the challenges posed by active geomorphological processes."

The team recommends future research uses a multidisciplinary approach to outline absolute dating, stratigraphic excavation, and paleoenvironmental reconstruction, which they describe as "essential to clarify the temporal depth and functional character of the Ayvalık assemblage."

Picture diving deep into the quantum realm, where unimaginably small particles can exist and interact in more than a trillion possible ways at the same time.

It's as complex as it sounds. To understand these mind-bending systems and their countless configurations, physicists usually turn to powerful supercomputers or artificial intelligence for help.

But what if many of those same problems could be handled by a regular laptop?

Scientists have long believed this was theoretically possible, yet actually achieving it has proven far more difficult.

Researchers at the University at Buffalo have now taken a major step forward. They have expanded a cost-effective computational technique known as the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), a kind of physics shortcut that simplifies quantum mathematics, so it can handle systems once thought to demand enormous computing power.

Just as significant, their approach -- outlined in a study published in September in PRX Quantum, a journal of the American Physical Society -- offers a practical, easy-to-use TWA framework that lets researchers input their data and obtain meaningful results within hours.

"Our approach offers a significantly lower computational cost and a much simpler formulation of the dynamical equations," says the study's corresponding author, Jamir Marino, PhD, assistant professor of physics in the UB College of Arts and Sciences. "We think this method could, in the near future, become the primary tool for exploring these kinds of quantum dynamics on consumer-grade computers."

Marino, who joined UB this fall, began this work while at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany. His co-authors include two of his former students there, Hossein Hosseinabadi and Oksana Chelpanova, the latter now a postdoctoral researcher in Marino's lab at UB.

The research received support from the National Science Foundation, the German Research Foundation, and the European Union.

Taking a semiclassical approach

Not every quantum system can be solved exactly. Doing so would be impractical, as the required computing power grows exponentially as the system becomes more complex.

Instead, physicists often turn to what's known as semiclassical physics -- a middle-ground approach that keeps just enough quantum behavior to stay accurate, while discarding details that have little effect on the outcome.

TWA is one such semiclassical approach that dates back to the 1970s, but is limited to isolated, idealized quantum systems where no energy is gained or lost.

So Marino's team expanded TWA to the messier systems found in the real world, where particles are constantly pushed and pulled by outside forces and leak energy into their surroundings, otherwise known as dissipative spin dynamics.

"Plenty of groups have tried to do this before us. It's known that certain complicated quantum systems could be solved efficiently with a semiclassical approach," Marino says. "However, the real challenge has been to make it accessible and easy to do."

Making quantum dynamics easy

In the past, researchers looking to use TWA faced a wall of complexity. They had to re-derive the math from scratch each time they applied the method to a new quantum problem.

So, Marino's team turned what used to be pages of dense, nearly impenetrable math into a straightforward conversion table that translates a quantum problem into solvable equations.

"Physicists can essentially learn this method in one day, and by about the third day, they are running some of the most complex problems we present in the study," Chelpanova says.

Saving supercomputers for the big problems

The hope is that the new method will save supercomputing clusters and AI models for the truly complicated quantum systems. These are systems that can't be solved with a semiclassical approach. Systems with not just a trillion possible states, but more states than there are atoms in the universe.

"A lot of what appears complicated isn't actually complicated," Marino says. "Physicists can use supercomputing resources on the systems that need a full-fledged quantum approach and solve the rest quickly with our approach."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-term autoimmune condition that affects over 2.9 million people around the world. In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath, a protective layer that insulates nerve fibers. This damage interrupts communication between the brain and body, leading to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, vision problems, and paralysis.

Although existing treatments can help reduce inflammation, there are still no approved therapies that protect neurons or rebuild the damaged myelin sheath. Scientists have now made significant progress toward that goal with support from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Their work has led to the discovery of two compounds capable of promoting remyelination, the process of repairing the myelin coating on nerve fibers.

The study, published in Scientific Reports, was led by Seema Tiwari-Woodruff, a professor of biomedical sciences at the University of California, Riverside, School of Medicine, and John Katzenellenbogen, a professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The research was funded through two National MS Society initiatives: a standard investigator-initiated grant and the organization's Fast Forward program, which accelerates commercialization of promising research.

"Our work represents more than a decade of collaboration, with the last four years focused on identifying and optimizing new drug candidates that show strong potential to treat MS and possibly other neurological diseases involving demyelination," Tiwari-Woodruff said.

With this support, the team launched a drug development program that has since been licensed by Cadenza Bio, Inc. Backed by investor funding, the company has continued advancing the research and is preparing for clinical testing of what could become a first-of-its-kind treatment for people with MS.

From discovery to development

This new work builds on earlier studies involving a compound called indazole chloride, which had shown promise in promoting myelin repair and regulating immune responses in mouse models of MS. However, indazole chloride lacked the chemical properties and patent potential required for clinical and commercial use, Tiwari-Woodruff explained.

Working with UIUC chemists Katzenellenbogen and Sung Hoon Kim, who created new versions of the molecule, Tiwari-Woodruff's group, led by recent UC Riverside graduate Micah Feri, screened more than 60 analogs of indazole chloride. From this effort, they identified two standout candidates, K102 and K110. Both showed better safety, efficacy, and drug-like characteristics in tests using mice and human cells.

Among the two, K102 emerged as the leading candidate. It not only stimulated myelin repair but also helped regulate immune activity, a critical balance for MS therapies. The compound also performed well in human oligodendrocytes -- cells responsible for producing myelin -- derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, suggesting the results could translate effectively from animal studies to human disease.

Normally, oligodendrocyte precursor cells develop into mature myelin-producing cells that repair nerve insulation. In MS, this repair process often breaks down, leading to lasting nerve damage. A compound like K102 that can restore myelin could help improve nerve signal transmission and potentially limit long-term disability.

"K110 is also a strong candidate," Tiwari-Woodruff said. "It has slightly different central nervous system effects and may be better suited for other conditions like spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury, so we're keeping it in the pipeline."

From bench to biotech

Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen credit the National MS Society's Fast Forward program as a turning point. Fast Forward accelerates the commercialization of promising therapies by promoting academic-industry partnerships. The highly competitive grant enabled Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen to generate sufficient data to license the rights to Cadenza Bio to develop K102 and K110. The patents are jointly held by UCR and UIUC, with an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement in place between the universities and Cadenza Bio.

"This project has been a good example of how long-standing academic collaborations can lead to real-world applications," Katzenellenbogen said. "Our shared goal was always to take a promising idea and develop it into a therapy that could help people with MS. We're finally getting close to that reality."

Initially, UCR's Office of Technology Partnerships collaborated with UIUC to seek patent protection. Grace Yee, assistant director of technology commercialization at UCR, said the joint efforts of UCR, UIUC, and the National MS Society advocated for and promoted the technology to investors and industry for commercial development.

"Our entrepreneurs-in-residence also helped advise the project, so the team was able to develop materials and messaging to highlight the project's commercial value," she said. "When investors expressed interest in the technology, UCR and UIUC helped them understand how the technology addresses an unmet need in treating MS. These efforts led to the licensing agreement with Cadenza Bio."

Elaine Hamm, chief operating officer at Cadenza Bio, said she and Carol Curtis, cofounder of Cadenza Bio, were impressed by the possibility of moving from slowing axon damage to repairing axon damage.

"This is the future we want to build," Hamm said. "It is why we licensed the technology, and why we are excited to move it forward to patients in need."

More than a decade in the making

Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen have worked together for more than 12 years. Tiwari-Woodruff's move from UCLA to UCR in 2014, she said, turned out to be a pivotal decision.

"The support from UCR -- from leadership to infrastructure -- has been extraordinary," Tiwari-Woodruff said. "None of this would've been possible without that backing. Funding for academic labs like mine and John's is crucial. This is selfless work, driven by a deep love of science and commitment to human health."

Though the initial focus is MS, the team believes K102 and K110 could eventually be applied to other diseases involving neuronal damage, including stroke and neurodegeneration.

Cadenza Bio is now advancing K102 through the necessary non-clinical studies required to support first-in-human clinical trials.

"We're hopeful that clinical trials can begin soon," said Tiwari-Woodruff. "It's been a long journey -- but this is what translational science is all about: turning discovery into real-world impact."

The research was also supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health and Cadenza Bio.

Tiwari-Woodruff, Katzenellenbogen, Kim, and Feri were joined in the research by Flavio D. Cardenas, Alyssa M. Anderson, Brandon T. Poole, Devang Deshpande, Shane Desfor, Kelley C. Atkinson, Stephanie R. Peterson, Moyinoluwa T. Ajayi, Fernando Beltran, Julio Tapia, and Martin I. Garcia-Castro of UCR; Kendall W. Nettles and Jerome C. Nwachukwu of The Scripps Research Institute, Florida; and David E. Martin and Curtis of Cadenza Bio, Oklahoma.

Another massive problem is if Meta has a fit with your organization, they can ban you from using WhatsApp for Business. All these Latam countries should and must pass regulations to avoid this kind of behavior. Free market all you want but if you captured market, it's the nation's responsibility to ensure their people can get the best service even if these companies are hating each other.

High stakes trade war set to escalate, but there's still time before the November 1 deadline.

China has responded to President Donald Trump's threats of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, plus a ban on critical software, because of its expanded rare-earth export controls. According to Newsweek, China is ready to face Washington's ultimatums, urging it to resolve the issue at the negotiating table instead of making statements on social media.

“If the U.S. persists in acting unilaterally, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China said in a statement. “Our position on a tariff war remains consistent — we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one.”

The current trade war with China kicked off in April of this year, when Trump pushed tariffs on all the U.S.'s trade partners, including a 54% total tariff on Chinese goods. It responded to this with counter-tariffs of its own, plus restrictions on some rare-earth exports that threaten global chipmaking supply chains. Things have seemingly settled down in the past months as both parties negotiated over trade, but China's recent expansion of rare-earth controls threatens advanced semiconductors up to 14nm, which were first released in 2014.

China is the leading supplier of rare-earth minerals, with the country supplying 70% of the raw materials needed to produce them and 90% of the processing capability across the globe. Because of this, it can potentially strangle the global chip-making supply chain, especially as many companies that make chips are based in the U.S. or in countries that are closely aligned with it.

Interestingly, China used the same language that the U.S. used to block exports to the country in its rare-earth export controls, saying that the restrictions are meant to “safeguard national security” and prevent their use by foreign militaries. However, you can also see that it's using this as a bargaining chip, as Beijing has previously shown in July 2025, when it eased some of the restrictions in exchange for Washington lifting the export ban on EDA software.

Trump said on his social media platform that he will put the tariff into effect on November 1, meaning the U.S. and China still have some time to talk things through. China likely enacted the expansion of its rare-earth export controls to get something out of the U.S. in negotiations, but we will only know this if it lifts or reduces restrictions after getting a concession from the White House.

"Steer by wire" means there is nothing but copper signal wires between your steering wheel and the front wheels. Your steering wheel is essentially a video game controller.This has nothing to do with the car's mode of propulsion though, and both EVs and ICE cars can have steer by wire controls. So far, it's only the cybertruck that has this paradigm, all other EV's all have normal power steering.For normal power steering systems there are two types: hydraulic and electric. Both types have a solid steel shaft between your steering wheel and the front wheels. You can remove the engine/motor completely, and you'll still be able to steer the car. The hydraulic or electric motor merely helps you turn the wheel, nothing more. Hydraulic is being phased out for electric in both EVs and ICE vehicles.

The Infinity Q50, QX50, QX55 and QX60 (with backup that connects upon electric failure).Without backup, but triple redundancy, can be found in the Tesla Cybertruck. But I'd take that redundancy with a grain of salt as they don't have the best track record telling you the truth.That said, I really with companies would go back to the good old hydraulic steering. I don't need self-parking. But self-parking needs at least electric steering (with our without steering column).

reply

Even if the owner gave permission to install the update, I would strongly wager that they did not give concurrent permission for the update to change the behavior of the vehicle.Of course, I sincerely doubt the EULA offers any way to separate those permissions; you are all in, or you are all out. Assuming that you even have an option to opt out.And that's exactly why these cars can never be trusted under any circumstances, ever.

Most people have a variety of things they are looking for in a car they want to purchase, and other factors are more important to them than this one, which they figure probably won't happen anyway. There may be few options that aren't updateable over the air, and those options don't meet their other criteria -- if they even get that deep into considering it, which they probably don't, they just aren't really thinking about it. But even if they did. you don't have the option of buying your perfect fantasy car.

I've had some pretty nasty brickings of devices, like overwriting the bootloader, that I've been able to recover from by getting it into some barely documented system on chip mode with a special cable, booting a new bootloader into RAM via the cable, and reflashing that way. One could go to the extreme and say any flash storage chip where all software bits are directly writable by a factory tool is technically unbrickable. But the customers won't see it that way.

Being strict about the word "bricked" and limiting it to the truly unrecoverable situations just makes it nigh-on useless.Very few things can make a modern system truly unrecoverable if one is willing to pour unreasonable resources into them. It's incredibly common to be in a situation where a system is unrecoverable by you though. There's no practical difference between these two except that one depends on the surrounding context.

Anything else than words that already have existing meanings. With that motivation, they could have said "... update that exploded all ..." since it's a really severe situation, but obviously we/they should use words that has the right meaning instead.

Manufacturers should feel free to offer updates. If the user feels the tradeoffs make sense, then they should be free to accept updates. But this business where the manufacturer thinks they are somehow entitled to mess around with a product you've already purchased from them has got to end. It's not their product anymore, it's yours.

Even better, a "right to modify everything you own, in any way you like". Don't you like the micro-controller installed by the manufacturer? Buy another one, with the correct firmware programmed from scratch, and swap it off.We are already well into a new era of software, in which software can be programmed by itself, especially Rust. What is missing is money transactions for software companies and their employees located everywhere in the world."Devices with no surprises". Retail shops in conjuction with electronics engineers put new controllers in everything and re-sell it.

I live in a city so I don't need a car, but if I had to buy one, "it should not have a network interface" would be my most important requirement. "It should not have a video display" would be a secondary one. If I had to buy a car with a network interface, I would do my best to neutralize it to make sure it stays 100% offline.

reply

Whereas the problem is that cars have had computers for a long time (eg ECU, ABS, entertainment), then those started getting connected together locally via CAN, then finally they added an Internet connection for surveillance and control. So the centralizing proprietary software tentacles go deep into the car in a way that's not easy to remove or replace.There is the black box approach of disabling network interfaces, but I could even see that going away - cannot contact network -> car cannot be sure that warranty recalls have been done in a timely fashion -> disable itself after a month until you "take it to a dealer" (or reconnect the cell backhaul).

My suspicion is that this was either a CAN saturation issue (ie - infotainment started sending a high priority message which could reach powertrain CAN) or a state management issue (ie - infotainment sent a “put modules to sleep” or “wake modules” message which was not handled correctly and caused one or more modules to transition to an invalid state for driving).

You can build your own PC. It isn't that hard. The time commitment may be too much for some people, but the end result is normally more compelling since you know what went into it and what may inevitably be upgraded. Custom PC makers like Maingear have to dig up some compelling reasons to sell a more expensive tower. You can already tell by the photo above there's a big reason you might opt for the Maingear Apex Rush before another PC. Your ultra-expensive tower could look like a piece of art, as long as you treat it right.

The last Maingear desktop I reviewed, the MG-1, was a conscientiously built, customizable PC that looked too much like something I could have pieced together, at least judging from the exterior. Inside, the tower was far better than that thanks to its screw-in GPU bracket and cable management that would leave even the most demanding IT professionals nodding in approval. The interior was inlaid with a strip of RGB lights that offered a subtle internal glow. It was the kind of slapdash DIY project anybody building their own PC could have easily accomplished.

Maingear Apex Rush Artist Series

You could spend way less just by building a PC yourself, but I doubt it would be nearly as pretty and well-put together as a Maingear Apex Rush

Pros

Cons

When Maingear first announced its Rush PCs at CES 2025, the company's CEO, Wallace Santos, told Gizmodo they attempted to create a desktop that truly looked unique, hence the special “Artist Series” designs that push a unique case while offering an internal design with everything gamers have come to expect. This design doesn't come cheap. My review unit, packed with the top-end AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU, 32GB of RAM, 2TB storage, and all the special cooling apparatus blaring RGB lights in and around the case, costs $4,325. That's $1,000 more than the previous generation MG-1 which contained a high-end Intel 14th-gen CPU and an Nvidia RTX 4080 Super. GPU The Artist Series costs an extra premium above the units without the unique art.

If I try and create a very similar PC using ordered parts, I can build something for closer to $2,600, and that's without seeking discounts. You're paying Maingear for the hassle-free experience. At that price, the Apex Rush should be the last PC—for gaming or not—you'd buy for a long, long while. The MSI Pro B850-P motherboard has enough RAM and PCI-E slots to make upgrading easy. But then, you can find many other, far cheaper desktops with similar components for under $3,000, like a specced-out version of the Cyberpower PC Gamer Supreme. Will the beauty of your case last that long? Depends on whether you're willing to shield your case from any blunt instruments or cats who would use your PC as a launchpad for your windowsill.

Just look at this thing. The Grand Theft Auto: Vice City vibes are almost enough to get me in the gaming mood by themselves. The fishbowl sides on the front and left of the tower are coated with a vinyl artwork and ringed with RGB LED strips. There are three different artworks to chose from, including a cyberpunk-esque “Machina” version and a pan-Asian “Good Fortune” edition, though I found the “Night Drive” version I got to review fit the internal glow of the RGB fans, RGB RAM sticks, and RGB liquid cooling CPU unit much even better. The only thing marring the visage is the overt “gamer” neon signage on the front. Its also bears a giant “Maingear” logo that's more distracting than fun.

Maingear is so confident about its build quality, it ships its units without foam inserts inside the case itself. The GPU is held tight with a printed bracket screwed into the case. The Apex Rush is a heavy unit, as you may expect from a mid-sized desktop tower full of high-end PCs. It's probably a good thing you're not dragging the unit from room to room, since the artwork painted on the glass is liable to get chewed up if you graze it during transit. I've hung onto the Apex Rush for long enough; I've had to move it from desk to desk, and in that time, I've managed to scratch the paint on the top part of the glass and on the lip of the desktop's top panel. The case's metal parts fare much better. Still, you're better off treating the Apex Rush with more care than your normal black aluminum towers.

Too many PC towers stick their front ports on top of the unit. This not only looks ugly with the tumors of several peripheral dongles sticking out, it means you need to plug wired connections up and over the PC if, for instance, you need to connect a headset or mouse. The Apex Rush sets its front I/O right next to the right-hand tower foot. You'll have access to just one USB-C, two USB-A, and a headphone jack. I would have preferred more USB-C and perhaps placing it on the side closer to the user.

As for the rear, there's a similar lack of USB-C, something I appreciated about Alienware's utterly massive Area-51 desktop tower. There's an HDMI port, four USB-A 2.0 ports, plus the two USB-C 10G sockets. With the number of peripherals I'm regularly plugging into my desktop, I quickly ran out of USB.

Inside, the Apex Rush's motherboard isn't capped with any covers to make the components look “clean.” I'm in the camp that would rather a PC look like a PC. There's a unique elegance to soldered silicon on a mainboard surrounded by heatsinks and wires. Maingear's versions look more elegant than other PCs I've used thanks to their expert eye with component selection and cable management. All the motherboard, CPU, and GPU wiring exits stage right through several hatchways just behind the mainboard. If you remove the Apex Rush's back panel, you'll find all the cabling running in neat packs down to the side-mounted PSU, or power supply unit. Behind a metal panel set on a hinge, you'll find all the wires are bundled up with velcro strips that make it easy to find the right component connected to the power supply. You won't have to do any finger gymnastics to reach each port.

My review case came with the 850W MSI MAG A850GL, which is enough juice for the RTX 5080 GPU but is barely enough wattage if you ever wanted to plug in an RTX 5090. It's not an overly large unit that will offer more upgrade paths, but there is one 16 PIN PCIe connection for the Nvidia GPU and enough connection options if you ever want to turn to an AMD in some apocalyptic future where the RTX 5080 doesn't cut it anymore.

If Alienware's absolutely ginormous Area-51 desktop PC was all about girth while offering expected performance, the Apex Rush pre-built lineup offers a more subtle beauty without the promise of getting the most out of every possible game.

AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D is considered one of the top-end CPUs for a reason. In benchmarks against an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, AMD's chip is simply better for gaming purposes. Intel's Arrow Lake CPUs got a bad rap on release with poor performance even compared to the top-end 14th-gen consumer chips. Intel dropped numerous fixes over the months to push gaming performance back to expected levels, but it wasn't enough to make a case against Intel's top-end chip. AMD's X3D chips use a special layered cache for extended memory within the CPU. This mainly benefits gaming scenarios, and it's why gamers seek out these chips first and foremost while Intel's Arrow Lake fell by the wayside.

It's been long enough since the RTX 50-series launch that Nvidia's drivers have cleared the way to eke a few more frames from most games compared to months before. I first tested the RTX 5080 Founders Edition on an Origin PC Neuron 3500X build, and after many moons I can say the platform is relatively bug-free and stable enough to enjoy your games without the hassle of reinstalling drivers or messing with your BIOS. With AMD's top gaming CPU, I can blow past older systems in 3DMark Speedway tests by a little more than 200 points. In 3DMark Steel Nomad, the difference is closer to 500 points. Gaming scenarios can look like I can get around five more average frames in Cyberpunk 2077 benchmarks running with ray tracing on and DLSS balanced settings on Maingear's build than I could on the Neuron 3500X's Core Ultra 9 285K with the same GPU. CPU-heavy games like Total War: Warhammer III benefit even more.

You really can't expect the world from a PC like this, despite its price. If you have any hope of topping out games without any AI upscaling like Nvidia's deep learning super sampling (DLSS), you'll need to opt for a RTX 5090 and spend even more. Even then, you'll come away disappointed. I'm still of the opinion that the RTX 5080 is what a demanding player will need for 4K gaming. If you want an Apex Rush with the highest-end GPU, you may end up spending more than $7,000.

The premium price on top of an already expensive PC is hard to swallow. Again, building a PC yourself can be less expensive and more fun. However, Maingear promises lifetime product support and free repairs. The company doesn't funnel the PC full of bloatware you need to delete. The build quality on the Apex Rush is, per usual, on point.

Researchers at Fudan University have created a working memory chip just a few atoms thick.

For the first time, scientists have successfully built a fully functional memory chip using two-dimensional materials and integrated it directly onto a conventional silicon die — a milestone that could change how future semiconductors are made. The research, led by Chunsen Liu and colleagues at Fudan University in Shanghai, was published on October 9 in the journal Nature.

The research may mark a turning point for 2D electronics, which have long promised atomic-scale performance and efficiency but struggled to move beyond lab demonstrations. Using a process the team calls ATOM2CHIP, the researchers grew a layer of molybdenum disulfide just a few atoms thick directly on top of a conventional 0.13-micrometer CMOS silicon chip. The result is a hybrid chip that combines a 2D NOR flash memory array with a standard CMOS controller, effectively bridging the gap between experimental nanomaterials and industry-standard fabrication.

The Fudan team reports a 94.34% yield from full-chip testing — a figure that rivals commercial silicon production — and operational speeds up to five megahertz. Each bit consumes just 0.644 picojoules, far below the energy draw of today's silicon flash cells. The memory demonstrated fast 20-nanosecond programming and erasing, ten-year data retention, and endurance of over 100,000 write cycles.

 




To achieve this, the researchers had to overcome the challenge of surface roughness. Silicon chips, even after polishing, have uneven terrain at the nanometer scale that can tear or stress atomic-thin layers. The ATOM2CHIP method introduced a conformal adhesion process that allows the 2D material to “flow” over the contours of the underlying circuits without breaking, while a 2D-friendly packaging system guards against heat and electrostatic damage.

Equally crucial was the team's “cross-platform system design,” a custom interface ensuring the 2D layer could communicate seamlessly with the CMOS control logic. This design enables instruction-driven operations, 32-bit parallelism, and random access, or, in other words, a full-featured memory chip.

In their paper, the authors describe the result as “an important milestone in extending the superiority of 2D electronics to real-world applications.” The implications go well beyond flash storage. If scaled, such hybrid architectures could drastically reduce power use and increase density in next-generation processors and AI processors, effectively continuing Moore's Law at the atomic limit. While mass production is still years away, this is the closest 2D materials have come to commercial relevance.

You know that panicky feeling when your phone hits 10% battery and you're nowhere near an outlet? Or worse, you're on a road trip, camping or dealing with a power outage and everyone's devices are dying at once? A massive power bank solves this exact problem by giving you days of backup power in your backpack.

The Maivoz 56,800mAh power bank is currently available for just $34, down from its typical $159 price tag. This is one of the leftover Prime Day deals that Amazon has kept alive for a few more days and it's hitting an all-time low while sitting among the top-selling power banks on the platform. With nearly 530 reviews averaging 4.9 stars, this thing delivers on its promise of keeping your devices alive when you need them most.

See at Amazon

The 56,800mAh capacity is seriously huge and puts this power bank in a different league than the 10,000mAh pocket powerhouses everyone carries. Put another way, an iPhone 17 has about a 3,692mAh battery so this power bank can recharge your phone 15 times completely before requiring a recharge itself. For an iPad with a standard 8,000mAh battery, you'll get 7 full recharging cycles. This type of capacity changes the way you think about battery panic since you can go days without concern about getting to an outlet.

The 22.5W Power Delivery fast charging feature means that you're not sitting around indefinitely to recharge your devices. This power is capable of bringing an iPhone up to 50% from dead in about 30 minutes and this really does make a difference if you need a fast power top up just prior to leaving. The new charging technology supplies stable output at all times across all attached devices, avoiding the power drops and slowdowns that are common on lower-quality power banks.

Triple-device charging configuration features two USB-A ports and a USB-C port, allowing you to charge three devices at a time. This is more than we'd have you think it matters because that means you, your spouse, and your child can each charge phones during a long road trip at the same time. Or your phone, tablet, and wireless earbuds can charge at the same time without having to plug and switch cords. Smart current control recognizes what each device requires and supplies the perfect charging speed, so your phone enjoys fast charging and your earbuds a soft trickle that preserves their tiny batteries.

The digital LED display displays actual battery percentage instead of cryptic indicator lights, so you can see at a glance just how much power is available. This gives you that extra information needed to prioritize charging and make choices about whether or not to recharge the power bank itself. Overvoltage, short circuits, overheating, and overcurrent are prevented by the power bank's self-protections, something that is critical when there is this amount of stored power involved.

For $34 down from $159, days-of-backup power are yours for less than the cost of dinner, and that shoots this one into that mythical realm of bargains where the discount can't possibly be true.

Beijing's latest export controls skip silicon but tighten pressure on niche metals essential to PC hardware.

Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs says the island's chip sector will see “no significant impact” from China's newly expanded rare-earth export controls, in comments first reported by Reuters on October 12. Those reassuring words come just days after Beijing added a fresh batch of heavy rare earths to its licensing regime — including holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium — and widened the scope to cover associated materials and processing tech.

Officials in Taipei were quick to note that these specific metals aren't used by TSMC in wafer production, and that Taiwan already sources most of its rare-earth derivatives from allies in Europe, Japan, and the United States.

But while fabs like TSMC may not rely on holmium or thulium, rare-earth elements remain deeply embedded in the wider tech stack, particularly in high-performance magnets. That's where the ripple effects could begin to show, even if the core fab process escapes unscathed.

The new rules, which took effect on October 9, are part of an ongoing campaign to tighten China's grip on rare-earth supply chains. Beijing's Ministry of Commerce said the controls are designed to safeguard national security and interests, but the language mirrors past moves aimed at weaponizing materials dominance in retaliation for U.S. export restrictions.

Unlike previous rounds of restrictions that focused on neodymium and dysprosium, this wave targets elements with niche but strategic uses. Europium, for instance, is still used in some high-efficiency display phosphors. Others, like ytterbium, play a role in specialty lasers and cooling systems.

More importantly, the new licensing rules can apply not just to raw exports, but to any derivative products or technical documentation, and to any end use flagged as sensitive. That includes AI chips, quantum tech, and advanced defense hardware. And while China says licenses will still be granted, the added paperwork and discretionary enforcement slow things down.

Taiwan's economic ministry isn't wrong to downplay the threat to semiconductor front-ends. But the PC space runs on more than silicon. Hard drives, for example, depend on voice-coil actuators and spindle motors built around high-performance magnets. Those magnets often rely on heavy rare-earth dopants to retain coercivity at elevated temperatures. The more China turns the screws on exports, the more likely it is that HDD and component vendors begin feeling the squeeze.

So, while there's no immediate sign that fabs in Taiwan will suffer under this specific round of Chinese export controls, China doesn't need to hit chipmakers directly to shake up supply chains. As licensing delays accumulate and enforcement expands, friction will continue to build downstream.

Finding bugs can make you a millionaire.

Apple announced at Hexacon 2025, the top global offensive security conference, that it will double its highest security bounty to $2 million. This makes Cupertino the most generous company that offers an award for unearthing vulnerabilities, and it's even offering top-up bonuses that can see security experts earning more than $5 million for uncovering exploits. According to Apple's Security Research blog, it has already awarded over $35 million to more than 800 security researchers since 2020, bringing the average award to $43,750. It even claimed that multiple individuals have received $500,000 in rewards.

The top $2-million award is reserved for those who discover sophisticated exploit chains similar to what mercenary spyware attacks exploit. Beyond that, there's also a bonus system for those who can break Apple's Lockdown Mode secure environment and vulnerabilities in its beta software, bringing the potential payout to over $5 million. There are also smaller awards, like $1 million for those who can crack broad iCloud security and those who can create a wireless proximity attack using radio, up to $300,000 to anyone who develops a one-click WebKit sandbox escape mechanism, and $100,000 to those who can bypass Gatekeeper on macOS.

 




This isn't the only bug bounty program anyone can participate in. AMD announced its own program last year, with a payout of up to $30,000, while Intel offers a maximum of $100,000. Microsoft's maximum award at the moment is $250,000, and it has even lowered its age limit to 13 because of this high school junior who filed over 20 security vulnerability reports last summer. Meta launched a bug bounty program in 2011 and now offers a maximum bug bounty of $300,000 (with $25,000,000 awarded to date). And last, but not least, Google began its Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) in 2010. The search giant's rewards vary from a few hundred dollars to a million dollars for the most serious vulnerabilities on its Titan M security chip. The company paid $11.8 million in 2024 to 660 researchers, bringing the average award to $17,800 per head.

These awards can make finding bugs a lucrative field, especially for talented security researchers. And while it might seem like an expensive proposition for companies, it's far cheaper for them to pay out these bounties instead of having a bad actor discover it and disseminate it under their noses, resulting in reputational and financial damages for the corporation. Moreover, software mistakes can potentially cost lives, as state actors and other third parties are increasingly using sophisticated means to target specific personalities.

The S-Works Levo 4 is so sophisticated that it would take the number of words in War and Peace (587,287) to describe each component and how they all work together in perfect harmony to create a bike that rides like a silky magic carpet on steroids.

From the proprietary new Specialized 3.1 motor with 720 watts and metal gears that crank out 111 newton-meters of torque to the carbon frame with adjustable geometry and a companion app that can precision-tune the ride, there is no detail that Specialized overlooked on its second-most expensive Levo 4. (The S-Works Turbo Levo 4 LTD is $20,000.)

My interest in the electric Turbo Levo 4, which debuted a decade after its original iteration and seven years after I reviewed the Turbo Levo Comp, piqued at a party in May where I had a conversation with a friend who had been sideswiped by a car while road cycling many years ago. The accident left Greg with such debilitating back pain that riding a bike was barely possible, until he recently bought a new Levo 4.

The electric mountain bike's substantial cushioning; its powerful, intuitive motor; and lightweight and comfortable carbon frame was so much easier and less painful to ride that it allowed him to keep up with his friends again, leaving him as giddy as a kid and giving him a second chance at a sport he loved. “You are not going to believe this bike,” he told me. “It's so intuitive. It feels like an extension of your own body.”

A few months later I picked up the S-Works model from The Ski Hut, the Duluth, Minnesota, Specialized dealer. A step above Greg's bike and a step below the most expensive LTD, the S-Works Turbo Levo 4 leaves nothing to be desired.

You can adjust the headset angle on the frame to change how the bike steers, and Specialized has its proprietary SWAT (Storage, Water, Air, Tools) storage above the battery on the bike's down-tube. The fork can accommodate 180 mm of travel. The bike comes with a front Fox Float 38 fork that has 160 mm of travel, and the rear fork has 150 mm of travel.

It has beefy SRAM Maven Ultimate four-piston caliper front and rear brakes, which skillfully help you stop (a tricky feat with the bike's increased power), and the SRAM XX Eagle Transmission derailleur combined with easy-to-toggle SRAM AXS POD Ultimate Shift levers made for seamless shifting. The 840-watt-hour integrated battery can be augmented with a 280-watt-hour range extender that fits into the water bottle cage, for a total ride time of up to five hours, depending on the mode.

The bike itself is a mullet, with a larger 29-inch tire in the front for rolling over boulders and a 27.5-inch tire in the back for better maneuverability.

I rode it home, climbing the steep city streets to a singletrack traverse that follows Duluth's ridgeline. It was Monday afternoon, and I had the trail to myself until I crept up so stealthily on a mountain biker that he was surprised to see me at the top of an exposed rocky climb overlooking the city. That's how quiet the motor is.

Specialized S-Works Turbo Levo 4

The next ride was on singletrack from my house to Spirit Mountain, Duluth's downhill lift-accessed park with 24 trails ranging from easy to expert. Lacking a full-face helmet and the landing skills to tackle double-black runs like the one called Calculated Risk, I instead rode Candyland. The machine-built flow trail has some nice high, snaky berms where the bike's chunky tires kept me upright and stable. I had so much fun tooling around in the bike park, riding up steep inclines like The Puker to get one last flowy downhill ride in, that I had to hurry home for dinner in the dusk.

On the way home, I chickened out while riding a chunky, steep, and extended rock bridge in Trail mode and experienced the only moment of fear in my entire 50-plus miles of testing thus far—I had already committed to forward momentum but chickened out at the last second, so the bike surged forward while I bailed sideways into the bushes. It was more user lack of confidence than bike glitch, but also a good reminder of two things: how powerful the bike is and how it's only as competent as its rider.

At home, I checked the Specialized app and found that I had climbed 3,451 feet over 22 miles in about two hours, primarily in the bike's Auto mode. I still had 44 percent battery power and energy in my legs.

After subsequent rides, what stands out the most about the Turbo Levo 4 is how intuitive it is. The bike's high-performance torque sensors can instantly “feel” the rider's output and amplify it, while maintaining control, traction, and precision at higher speeds. This is especially evident in Auto mode, which is the most natural feeling of the four Eco, Auto, Trail, and Turbo modes, all of which are easy to read on the bike's Master Mind computer on the top tube.

I was a little on the fence about the Turbo Levo's ability to jump from a Class I to a Class III electric mountain bike. On US versions of the bike, riders can tweak the speed limit by toggling through Master Mind and upping the Class I limit of 20 mph to the Class III 28 mph limit. It's an easy process designed for mountain bikers who ride along city streets to the trails.

But it also raises a question: What ripper is going to want to toggle back down to a Class I bike—the max limit on most trails throughout the US—unless the speed police are in hot pursuit? By allowing this work-around into a higher speed-limit category, Specialized puts the onus on the rider to follow the rules, which opens a Pandora's box—especially on trails inhabited by mostly nonmotorized mountain bikers where safety is a greater concern.

Other than the ethical conundrum, my one small beef with the S-Works Turbo Levo 4 is that it's so much fun that it suspends time. I'm so in the flow that I forget to go home and make dinner.

Core Ultra 9 285K and RTX 5080, mounted on a floating motherboard, are the system's engine and turbocharger.

Many consider cars to be the most exciting thing out there. Those adrenaline-pumping feats of engineering, harmonizing cutting-edge hardware and software to push the boundaries of physics. A lot of people, though, are equally enthusiastic about PCs and how they contribute to the world of racing. After all, a car is technically just a computer on wheels, so why not combine the two to birth something truly unique that honors both cultures?

That's exactly what Nvidia did, in its latest episode of GeForce Garage, where it partnered up with modder JCustom (Justin Chu) to fit an entire gaming PC inside a wheel of a Porsche 911. The build also has a real key fob to turn it on or restart it, wirelessly.

Our journey begins with an HRE FF21 wheel (not acually Porsche, we know) that alone starts at $750 and that's before the custom paint job on top. See, this rig is being built for someone very special that we'll reveal at the end; they have a Porsche 911 Turbo S in the Python Green colorway, so our modder Justin decided to color-match the entire build to that. That meant power-coating the sides (barrel) of the wheel to be the same green, and even updating the silver to resemble what Porsche uses from factory.

 




The main PC is placed right behind the spokes and appears like it's floating because the custom-built motherboard tray is mounted directly to the wheel's barrel, with the help of some tabs that extend into the tray. You can see how that looks in the next set of pictures after this. The end-result is flawless, but achieving such elegance was only possible after Justin put the wheel inside CAD to iron out all the details and create the necessary parts himself.

 




Speaking of, the motherboard tray is what houses most of the cabling as it's actually quite thick — from the pictures, we can estimate ~3 inches. The tray is suspended from four sides via metal beams that provide rigidity, and to advance this magical appearance, Justin used a back-connect motherboard. This way all the wires would conveniently route through this tray compartment, and the motherboard assembly itself would be the only thing visible on the outside.

The tray includes an SFF power supply, too, and sleeved PCIe cables for the GPU, which is a Founder's Edition RTX 5080. Back-connect graphics cards have existed for a while, so it's interesting to see Justin stick with a classic choice here. You can check out the full specs of the PC in the table at the end to see what else he paired up with this GPU. Lastly, the tray also has little LED diffusers placed across the perimeter to provide a subtle ambient glow to the wheel, almost like underglow on a real car.

To cool the entire system, Justin separated the custom liquid-cooling into its own apparatus, sitting beneath the wheel assembly. This compartment fits the pump, reservoir, radiator and all the tubing for the loop, which is connected to the CPU and GPU via quick-disconnects at the back of the wheel. This is where you can also see that the rearside is entirely flush, implying that the PC can even be wall-mounted in the future.

If you look closely, the water block on the CPU is tubeless, which means the water actually flows through the block's mounts itself. You can also see a miniaturized version of the aforementioned Porsche 911 floating inside it, further paying tribute to the petrolhead this PC's owner is. The GPU block, on the other hand, is made by Modern Cafe and showcases a small trophy on one side (more on what that is later), along with a spinning wheel on the other side that doubles as a flow meter.

The cooling system essentially becomes a display stand for the wheel, complimenting each other both functionally and aesthetically. The build is finished off with a Python Green paint job on the stand as well, and Alcantara is glued onto the sides to simulate the luxurious feel of a Porsche's interior. A Porsche Knight badge is placed in the middle of this stand, while the wheel's center cap is upgraded with a screen for displaying telemetry data (playing what seems like custom animations), accompanied with a small GeForce Garage pin underneath.

Given how powerful the specs are, it was kind of surprising to see Nvidia test two games with multi-frame gen enabled. In Borderlands at 4K with max settings and DLSS set to performance, the PC achieved 160-180 FPS. Over in Cyberpunk 2077 with max settings, along with path tracing, we saw 160-170 FPS. Forza Horizon 5 maxed out with ray tracing set to high netted around 200 FPS; DLSS was set to high but no MFG.

So, who's the lucky recipient of this technological marvel? Well, that would be up-and-coming actor Micheal Rainey Jr., who recently won an NAACP award for his role in the Starz's Power franchise, where he plays Tariq. The mini version of that exact trophy is what was enclosed inside the 5080, highlighting Michael's accolades. When he's not winning over judges, though, you can find him obsessively playing videogames, like Call of Duty.

 




Interestingly, prolific filmmaker Steven Spielberg — the guy who made Saving Private Ryan — wanted to direct a COD movie but Activision turned him down; instead, selling the film rights to Paramount. It would be destiny's calling to see Paramount just hire Spielberg after all, where he ultimately casts Michael as a tank driver, bridging together his acting and gaming journeys in the most poetic way possible.

Coal use up 20% in 2025, and will likely continue to be in demand for another couple of years.

U.S. datacenters are increasingly relying on coal-fired electricity as expanding AI infrastructure drives up power needs and makes natural gas less affordable, reports The Register. However, in states with nuclear power plants, coal, slate, and oil are used to smooth peaks and lows of power, not to address the needs of prominent tech giants. Let us try to figure it out.

A report from Jefferies shows coal generation rising nearly 20% and there are projections that it will stay high through 2027. The combination of fast-growing electricity demand and unfavorable gas prices has pushed operators to revive the use of the dirtiest fuel in the mix. But it is not only about the waste, it is about a power grid that has to be available to everyone.

A nuclear power plant is almost perfectly suited to supply a mass of power to an AI training datacenter because its steady, high-capacity output matches the data center's continuous and predictable demand profile. Well, almost. During a training run, checkpoint intervals — when models are saved to storage — cause a major drop in GPU utilization as data is written and synchronized, these fluctuations are minor compared with the total load.

Meanwhile, as the nuclear plant's generation does not vary, so grid operators must compensate for sudden drops or spikes of usage, which is where coal and renewables come into play. Without them, the power flows steadily through high-voltage lines to transformers, which are meant to maintain stable voltage in homes and industry, but are not to handle massive loads.

In essence, nuclear energy provides the power that keeps multi-week training runs uninterrupted, but when the cards are down, coal and renewables do their job for the other consumers.

Things are different for inference, a stage where a trained model is put to use, generating outputs from new inputs rather than learning from data. AI inference consumes power in short, intense bursts as the system processes large chunks of forward computations at unpredictable intervals.

Each request — whether it is generating text, recognizing an image, or serving a recommendation — triggers thousands of matrix multiplications across AI accelerators, drawing a surge of electricity for a fraction of a second. When millions of requests arrive simultaneously, the combined load can climb sharply, stressing both the local power distribution and the cooling systems. Inference creates spiky, rapidly fluctuating power patterns that must be met with responsive grid supply or on-site energy storage. The power grid has to be rigid enough to support all types of customers, which is again where renewables and coal or slate come in.

As AI datacenters drive up U.S. electricity demand, coal generation has surged nearly 20%, according to Jefferies cited by The Register, though the role of coal is mostly to stabilize the grid rather than directly power AI clusters.

Nuclear plants provide the steady output ideal for multi-week AI training runs, while coal and renewables help balance fluctuations caused by checkpoints and other loads. During inference, when millions of user requests arrive unpredictably, the grid relies on flexible sources — including fossil fuels — to handle the short, sharp bursts of power demand that even advanced datacenters can't smooth alone.

Fall means cooler weather and leaves turning and pumpkins and all that fun stuff. It also means mud, those leaves stuck to shoes or your dog's paws, Halloween and Thanksgiving foot traffic, and generally a more challenging time keeping your floors and carpets clean. If there was ever a time to upgrade your floor cleaning game, it's now, and Dreame's superstar robot vacuum and mop combo, the X50 Ultra (Complete), is 29% off at Amazon. Plus, you can save an extra 5% at Amazon with the code DMGMPD5OFF for an even better deal.

Dreame's awesome Prime Day sale is still in effect, with enormous price breaks on their finest cleaning machines for your floors and your air. Between the hot deals on the Dreame L50 Ultra and the X50 Ultra (Complete), there's a programmable, self-cleaning, highly intelligent robot floor machine ready to tackle all of the mess, dirt, pet hair, and more, while taking the lion's share of the work away from you once and for all.

One of the new tech features that dropped jaws at CES 2025 was Dreame's ProLeap System, which gives the X50 Ultra (Complete) the ability to actually scale steps and thresholds up to 2.36 inches in height. If you know the sound of a robot vacuum that's hung up on a threshold between rooms, you know it means you need to get up and give it an assist. The Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete) eliminates that frustrating situation, and also eliminates previously unreachable dirt that hides in corners with its MopExtend RoboSwing tech that reaches over an inch and a half into those elusive spots.

Dirty corners and threshold obstacles aren't the only common robot vacuum shortcomings solved by the Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete). The innovative HyperStream Detangling Duo Brush eradicates those hair tangles that bring the rollers of lesser robot vacs to a complete standstill. It allows the X50 Ultra (Complete) to pick up a full 100% of large particles and hair, with no tangles snarling the rollers. VersaLift Navigation with advanced LiDAR and AI continuously map its path in real time to avoid obstacles, and even determining which pieces of furniture it can successfully go under for optimal cleaning without getting stuck or, worse, lost.

The Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete) is better at taking care of itself than any robot floor cleaner we've seen, whether it's self-emptying dirt in its Intelligent PowerDock, or using the AceClean DryBoard system that hits the mop pads with 20 streams of hot, cleansing water, and then dries them with hot air to prevent those bad, damp smells. The mop is clean and ready to go again without any work on your part. The X50 Ultra (Complete) also toggles seamlessly between hard floors and carpets, with five tailored modes that protect your carpets from the mop, boost the suction for thicker carpets, and more.

The Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete) is well-named. It gets your hard floors and carpets ultra clean, does a complete job including hard-to-reach corners and beneath some furniture items, and completely takes the drudgery of vacuuming and even more taxing mopping jobs out of your hands — which sounds like a dream scenario to us, but it's very real. The 29% off deal at Amazon wipes $500 from the price of the Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete), making it a $1,200 investment in years of effortlessly clean floors and hundreds of hours back that you previously spent cleaning. Don't forget to use the code DMGMPD5OFF at Amazon to snag an extra 5%.

Like it or loathe it, we live in a subscription economy. Music, movies, meal boxes, and more are no longer things you buy once. They're a constant draw on your wallet. Gaming is no exception, and while every major player in the sector has some form of sub for players—from PlayStation Plus and Nintendo Switch Online for consoles to Apple Arcade on phones—none of them offered quite as much for a modest monthly fee as Xbox Game Pass.

Depending on the subscription tier, the service gave players access to a significant library of titles and was available on Xbox consoles, PC, or via cloud gaming. While most of its competitors focused on back-catalog titles for their gaming subscriptions, Game Pass stood apart by including major first-party titles on their day of release for subscribers to its Ultimate tier.

Microsoft long claimed it was “the best deal in gaming,” and with new releases costing upwards of $70 per title versus a $19.99 monthly price tag on Game Pass Ultimate, it was hard to argue. Recent changes to the service, however—including some hefty price rises—have upset users in a big way, sending so many people rushing to cancel their subscriptions that the membership site crashed.

On October 1, Microsoft revamped the entire structure of Game Pass. Previously, and following an earlier rejig in September 2024, players had essentially four options—Game Pass for PC, Game Pass Core, Game Pass Standard, and Game Pass Ultimate. Going forward, Core is replaced with Essential, and Standard is replaced with Premium, while Ultimate retains its name. All tiers are now accessible on PC, although a dedicated PC-only plan remains available.

It's not the rebrand that's had people canceling, though—it's the hefty price hikes that have come with the upper tiers. While Essential keeps the almost totemic $9.99-per-month pricing of Core, Premium jumps to $14.99 from Standard's $11.99 (a 25 percent increase), and the PC-only offering goes from $11.99 to $16.49 (a 38 percent increase). It's Game Pass Ultimate that's proven the most contentious, leaping from $19.99 to $29.99. Price increases on subscription services routinely boil the frog and creep up in price slowly—just look at what you used to pay for Netflix—but a massive 50 percent spike overnight, the equivalent of $120 more a year, has caught many off guard.

It doesn't help that it follows two price hikes on Xbox consoles themselves in the span of less than a year, at least in the US. In May 2025, the 512-GB Xbox Series S went from $299.99 to $379.99, the 1-TB Xbox Series X from $499.99 to $599.99, and the 2-TB Series X from $599.99 to $729.99. These prices rose globally, with prices reflected in each territory. But then, in September, prices rose again for buyers in America, taking those same models to $399.99, $649.99, and $799.99, respectively. Microsoft cited the increases being “due to changes in the macroeconomic environment”—read: tariffs—but the combined effect on pricing across the whole Xbox ecosystem really challenges that “best deal in gaming” idea.

The Xbox Series X has had two price increases in the past year.

The Game Pass price increases aren't without their benefits, as an attempt to justify the rises in cost. Cloud gaming is now available on all tiers, after previously being restricted it to Ultimate, while the offerings at each level have been rethought.

Core used to be the basic entry-level option, mostly serving as a maintenance fee to allow online multiplayer features, but also throwing in a minimal library of 25 rotating titles in the Game Pass library. The new Essential tier that replaces it ups that library to “50+ games playable on both console and PC,” along with “in-game benefits in some of the biggest games like League of Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Overwatch 2” (although what those benefits are is unspecified and presumably subject to change).

Premium, replacing Standard, enjoys a larger library still, with Microsoft promising “200+ games” for subscribers, up from around 50. The big change at this tier is the access to new release titles. Well, newish—Premium subscribers will now get access to “new Xbox-published games within a year of their launch,” although this excludes Call of Duty titles.

Ultimate gets the biggest overhaul, to try to justify that massive 50 percent spike. Alongside a 400-plus game library, it remains the only tier with day one availability for new releases. Here, Microsoft promises subscribers will get “75+ day-one games a year,” and that does include Call of Duty. It also now includes access to the Ubisoft+ Classics and EA Play catalogs, which were previously separate subscriptions, and from November 18, adds access to Fortnite Crew, providing in-game bonuses to players of Epic's enduringly popular game-slash-platform. Ultimate also offers cloud gaming at higher quality than the lower tiers, up to 1440p resolution, with prioritized access and shorter load times.

At all tiers, Microsoft emphasizes the ability to earn credit (up to $25 annually for Essential, $50 for Premium, and $100 for Ultimate) through the Microsoft Rewards programs, just by playing games. That might take some of the sting out of the price increases, although many users are also complaining that the Rewards scheme as a whole has been “nerfed” and offers less return for their time.

The big question is whether the changes to Game Pass mean the service is still worth subscribing to. That's going to vary between users, but affected players have a few options to consider.

First is to check whether you're actually affected by the Game Pass price increases in the first place. Depending on where you are in the world, you may not be, at least not yet. As reported by The Verge, subscribers in some countries have received emails informing them that they won't see their fees changing so long as they maintain their subscription.

Microsoft emailed subscribers in unaffected countries, saying, “You may have heard about changes to the price of Xbox Game Pass Subscriptions. At this time, these increases will only affect new purchases and will not affect your current subscription for the market in which you reside, as long as you are on an auto-recurring plan. Should you choose to cancel your plan and repurchase, you will be charged at the new current rate.”

There doesn't seem to be a common link between the countries exempted—users from EU countries such as Poland, Germany, and Ireland have reported getting the emails saying they won't pay more, leading to some speculation it was down to better consumer protections across the European Union, but so have others in India and South Korea. Either way, if you're an existing Game Pass subscriber in these territories and you're happy with the service, it's probably worth letting your sub roll on for now.

If you are getting hit—and players in the US and UK definitely are—then it's a great time to reevaluate the tier you're subscribed to, particularly if your gaming habits have changed since you last looked into it.

If you're not desperate to play any new releases immediately, dropping down to Premium will still provide access to a sizable library of titles to play, and bringing those newer games to Premium within a year will still be a draw. At $14.99 a month, it's half the price of the new Ultimate tier and represents a saving of $180 a year by comparison.

If you are keen to play the latest and greatest games as soon as they arrive, Ultimate does remain a great deal. If you see yourself playing more than five new releases a year at launch, then even $30 per month represents a saving, and that's before you get to the other benefits of the package. That 50 percent hike may feel like a bitter pill to swallow, but if you're craving the latest AAA Xbox titles month after month, the pricey new Ultimate tier still represents a saving, even at $360 per year.

Conversely though, consider whether you're being tempted by something you won't really benefit from in its entirety. For example, if you're a keen Fortnite player, getting Fortnite Crew bundled into Ultimate may sound like a good deal, but if you don't play much else outside of that game, you won't be getting much bang for your buck.

The big risk for Microsoft is that the price hikes for Xbox consoles and Game Pass alike drive players elsewhere. Against a backdrop of sluggish hardware sales, rising prices on that hardware, and its decision to bring more of its first-party exclusive titles to rival platforms—Forza Horizon 5, Gears of War: Reloaded, and Sea of Thieves are among the previous Xbox exclusives now available on PS5—the Game Pass price spike could see users abandon Xbox as a native platform entirely.

For instance, a PS5 Pro retails at $749.99—add a year of PlayStation Plus Premium at $159.99, and you're looking at 2 cents shy of $910. Sure, the library offered by PlayStation Plus isn't as vast as Game Pass, but that's almost $250 less than the Xbox equivalent ($1,160 for the 2-TB Xbox Series X and Game Pass Ultimate). The lack of availability for day-one titles on PS Plus is the big difference in value, but that saving goes a long way to buying a few games outright.

Forza Horizon 5 is one of the once exclusive games on Xbox now available on PS5.

The big downside to this option is that if you're heavily invested in Xbox as a platform, then your purchases and progress won't transfer. Bought a bunch of Xbox games outright? Then buy 'em again. Already spent hundreds of hours racing around Mexico in Forza Horizon 5? Too bad, start from scratch. It's not just Forza either—all of the first-party games Microsoft is bringing to other platforms are looking like they'll need to be bought again and generally don't look to be included in those platforms' own subscription services, so it could be pricier to move than to stay.

If you're at the point where you're considering jumping platforms, though, you might want to just go back to buying your games outright anyway. Subscriptions are an inversion of the old “teach a man to fish” idiom—sell someone a game and they pay once; sell someone a subscription to the game and they pay forever. Maybe for you, the best option is to break the cycle. Be free!

There's a cost calculation here, though, especially for new release titles, but this option's best for those who see themselves buying five or fewer new-release games per year. Accounting for an average launch price of $70 per title (and not counting deluxe editions, season passes, or other added DLC), that's a $10 saving on a year of Game Pass Ultimate. A caveat: If you enjoy online multiplayer, you'll need at the least the Game Pass Essential subscription, so you'll have to factor in that $120 per year.

Buying your games may seem pricier on a case-by-case basis, but you actually own them—or at least an ostensibly perpetual license to them, if bought digitally. Your access doesn't disappear when you stop subscribing, and you can wait for sales to pick up some keepers for cheap.

Physical media purchases are best of all but not without their own hurdles. The ballooning size of games has outpaced the capacities of physical media, meaning some releases, such as Doom: The Dark Ages, have only an installer on the disc. If a title is ever removed from servers, or those servers are turned off, you won't be able to play it in future—even if you still have the disc. Thankfully, these are—for now—niche cases.

Whichever route you choose, the important part is to do the math and ensure you're getting the most for your money. There's definitely still value to be found in Xbox Game Pass, but if you're not a hardcore user of all its features at the highest tier, it just became that bit harder to find.

A fan cheers USMNT's draw against Ecuador in Austin. David Buono/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images

In the 68th minute on Friday night, with the U.S. men's national team trailing Ecuador, the pace of the game was starting to slow.

It's typical of friendlies. Substitutions start to come on to the field en masse. The rhythm of the game is disrupted. It was somewhat disappointing, though, in that the U.S. started the game so brightly. It deserved a goal. If the level were to drop and the result stayed the same, it had the potential to look like a missed opportunity rather than something off of which to build.

As Tim Ream stood on the ball just on the top of the center circle in his own half, however, the crowd in Austin started to chant.

In the stadium, you could see the energy from the stands start to influence the pace of the game. The U.S. team started to move the ball with more urgency. Players were sprinting into space. It led to a spell of possession that ended with a Diego Luna shot, but the buzz in the stadium didn't drop.

Two minutes later, Tim Weah had a look at goal on a left-footed shot that sizzled well over the goal. Seconds after that, the U.S. forced a turnover deep in Ecuador's end, Tanner Tessmann found Malik Tillman, and his square pass was finished off by Folarin Balogun for the equalizer. It set off a celebration at Q2 Stadium. The supporters deserved an assist.

“The fans were amazing and how important it (was) when they started chanting, ‘USA, USA,'” head coach Mauricio Pochettino said. “This energy, that is very welcome from the players, from the team, helped us to give the energy to keep pushing.”

If this U.S. team starts to turn things around, if they start to sustain a decent level of soccer and a string of positive results, that moment in the 68th minute in Austin will feel like a turning point. It's why Tuesday's friendly against Australia now feels a bit bigger than it should. The U.S. needs to carry forward this momentum.

There is risk, no doubt, in overblowing a 1-1 draw with Ecuador in a friendly eight months before the World Cup. But I think there's a reason for the positivity coming out of Friday's result. Let's be honest: The U.S. team hasn't given the fans much to cheer about over the last year-plus. Positive results against non-CONCACAF opponents have been rare, and there haven't been a lot of moments where the team has had a pro-U.S. crowd that influenced the result.

The positivity around Friday's draw is representative of where things stand with this national team. Fans want to believe in this team. They just haven't had much reason to believe.

Part of what has made this World Cup cycle so frustrating is that this group was supposed to be different. Fans looked at the clubs where its young players were signing and started calling it a golden generation. A positive showing at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar felt like a marker on the path toward something more.

Since leaving Qatar, however, there has been more chaos around this team than progress.

This 2026 cycle was supposed to be about taking the potential of a young U.S. group and growing up into something more meaningful. The core of players that got the U.S. back to the World Cup after the 2018 disaster were going to be four years older and four years more experienced than they were in Qatar. They were supposed to take the next steps at their clubs and that would translate to the national team.

That hasn't exactly gone to plan.

Instead, the last year with the national team under Pochettino has been about “destroying the things that we need to destroy and start(ing) to build the house from the ground up,” he said on Thursday.

It's why the 1-1 draw with a good Ecuador side was something worth feeling good about. Consecutive performances in which the U.S. team looked purposeful is allowing people to peek their heads out and wonder whether they can start to believe again. If the first phase of Pochettino's era was a teardown, the 2-0 win over Japan in September and the draw against Ecuador are signs that maybe the second phase is now underway.

Pochettino is, as he said, building things back up.

For that to be true, the U.S. will need another positive performance and another positive result on Tuesday. And they'll need it again in November against Paraguay and Uruguay.

People want to believe. As we race toward next summer's World Cup, it's on this U.S. team to give them a reason.

Otherwise, that moment in Austin — one that feels like it could be a turning point — might just be a meaningless blip in a fall friendly that we're overblowing months before a World Cup.

Austria was the last team to beat Romania in a competitive matchup and will look to repeat the feat in World Cup qualifying on Sunday.

A thrilling weekend of 2026 World Cup qualification action will come to a close on Sunday when Romania hosts Austria in a bid to inject some much-needed life into its group campaign. Austria currently leads UEFA qualifying Group H by two points with only three games to play, while Romania is wallowing in third and six points off the top two.

That means anything but a win for the host in Bucharest could effectively mean an end to Romania's chances of reaching next year's tournament in North America. The Tricolours have failed to qualify for the finals of a World Cup since France 1998, which also happens to be the last time Austria featured in a World Cup.

Romania has lost back-to-back meetings with Das Team for the first time in its history and is on the verge of a dreaded third in a row. However, with so much at stake, manager Mircea Lucescu will hope his side has something up their sleeve as they stand on the precipice of elimination from the running.

Former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has sent out a strong message to Reds fans about new signing Florian Wirtz following the German midfielder's slow start to life at Anfield. Wirtz moved to Merseyside on a blockbuster £116 million ($156m) transfer from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer, but the star player is yet to deliver with a goal or an assist in the Premier League and Champions League.

The Netherlands will aim to place one foot in the 2026 World Cup's list of qualified teams as it seeks a fifth qualifying win at home to Finland on Sunday.

The Netherlands will bring the curtain down on its international break when it hosts Finland on Sunday hoping to extend its three-point lead at the top of UEFA Group G. De Oranje already sits clear at the head of its pool, but Finland can cause a stir in Amsterdam as it sits third in the pecking order and just three points off the peak.

Ronald Koeman's hosts will feel upbeat about their chances of a third straight qualifying win given they beat Finland 2-0 in Helsinki four months ago. That marked a fifth straight defeat to the Dutch in their head-to-head, and it's now been 75 years since Finland's only win over the Netherlands to date.

Memphis Depay's injury-time finish in Thursday's 4-0 win over Malta took him two goals clear of Robin van Persie as the Netherlands' all-time top scorer, with 52 goals to his name. The Corinthians attacker doesn't appear to have lost his sheen since moving to Brazil and will be out for blood after scoring in the win over Finland earlier this year, with five goals to his name in qualifying thus far.

Chile will host an all-South American semi-final at the youth football tournament, with the corresponding final four clash to be confirmed on Sunday (12 October).

The South American party continues at the 2025 FIFA men's U-20 World Cup (27 September - 19 October) in Chile.

Into the final week of the youth men's football tournament, the road to crown the latest under-20 world champions is reaching its climax. The quarter-finals conclude this Sunday (12 October) ahead of the semi-finals kicking off on Wednesday (15 October).

Colombia and Argentina are the first nations to book their spots in the final four, making for an enticing all-South American matchup and guaranteeing CONMEBOL representation in the final on 19 October.

The Colombians came through a thrilling quarter-final clash by winning 3-2 against Spain, the top-ranked men's senior side and reigning Olympic champions.

Neyser Villareal put them ahead in the first half, before a quickfire Spanish double from Jan Virgili and Rayane Belaid turned the game on its head shy of the hour mark. Up stepped Neyser, Millonarios' talismanic striker, to equalise before securing his hat-trick with an 89th minute winner to send Colombia through.

In the other quarter-final, Argentina dispatched Mexico 2-0 at Santiago's Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos. Maher Carrizo broke the deadlock inside 10 minutes for the Albiceleste, an advantage they maintained going into the break.

Soon after the restart, Mateo Silvetti pounced on a loose ball to slot home to double the Argentine advantage. Mexico had no answer and ended the affair with nine men, after Diego Ochoa and Tahiel Jiménez were given their marching orders.

The semi-final lineup will be set in stone on Sunday (12 October), where 2026 men's World Cup hosts USA take on Africa's remaining representatives Morocco. They will play the winners of the last final four clash, an all-European tie between Norway and France in Valparaíso.

The Faroe Islands host the Czech Republic in the latest leg of 2026 World Cup qualifying on Sunday, hoping to close the gap on the top two in Group L.

The Czech Republic has defeated the Faroe Islands in their last seven straight matchups as the two teams reunite in World Cup qualifying on Sunday. However, Eyðun Klakstein's side are in the midst of a particularly fruitful period after winning three of their last four games.

Such a return is unheard of for the Scandinavian side, who can move within one point of the Czech Republic in second with a first-ever win over The Representatives. That's after romping to a 4-0 win at home to Montenegro on Thursday, cementing a new personal best of three wins in a World Cup qualifying campaign.

The Czechs, meanwhile, managed to hold Group L leader Croatia to a 0-0 stalemate in Prague, though the latter's game in hand keeps it firmly in the driving seat for top spot. With just two matches to play in qualifying, nothing but a win over the Czech Republic will do for the Faroe Islands if it's to finish among the top two, while victory would guarantee the guests at least second place.

Legendary striker Robert Lewandowski could be set to leave Barcelona when his contract expires next summer, as the Catalan giants are not expected to offer a new contract to the 37-year-old ahead of the expiry of his current deal in June 2026. Lewandowski has struck four times in seven La Liga appearances so far this season, but has often been limited to substitute appearances and the club reportedly believe now is the time to seek his successor.

Chelsea owner Todd Boehly has made it his mission to bring some of the top young players to his clubs since investing, and now one of the top talents in the United States is reportedly on their radar.

The Blues have spent big money on bringing in wonderkids to both Chelsea and Strasbourg, and Chelsea are finally starting to reap the rewards of this strategy.

Estevao Willian is the most high-profile addition the club have made so far, and he announced himself to the Stamford Bridge faithful with a dramatic winning goal against Liverpool.

Despite a plethora of talent already on their books, they are continuing to analyse around the world for top players they can bring in to either BlueCo club.

One of those who is standing out right now is Seattle Sounders star Obed Vargas, who was recently voted as number one on the MLS' list of 22 under 22.

The Mexican has been a regular in the high-flying side for a number of years now, and the Chelsea owners have registered interest in a deal.

According to The Telegraph, he is on the radar of BlueCo, who own both of Chelsea and Strasbourg.

The Ligue 1 side are very much being used as a feeder club for the Blues at the moment, with a number of their top performers set for long careers in West London.

Kendry Paez, Mike Penders, Mamadou Sarr and Emanuel Emegha are all currently owned by the Blues, however will remain with Strasbourg for this season at least.

Seattle Sounders didn't make it out of the group stage at the Club World Cup, however there was time for Vargas to make his mark.

He left the tournament as one of the most promising young players, who has gained the attention of a number of clubs around Europe as a result.

Vargas impressed against both Atletico Madrid and PSG, with the latter being decimated by the Blues in the final of the competition.

BlueCo have already signed Julio Enciso, who has a chance of making it at Stamford Bridge, and the same could be on the cards for Vargas if he does move to Strasbourg.

Inter Milan wingback Federico Dimarco and striker Francesco Pio Esposito were among the stars in Italy's win over Estonia.

This is the view in today's print edition of Turin-based newspaper Tuttosport, via FCInterNews. They also argue that Nerazzurri duo Nicolo Barella and Alessandro Bastoni were also solid.

Italy got a hugely significant win over Estonia yesterday evening.

The Azzurri have been at risk of missing out on a third straight World Cup. They had already failed to qualify for the 2018 and 2022 editions of the tournament, and did not get their qualification off to the best of starts this time around.

However, Italy secured a convincing 3-1 win over Estonia in a World Cup qualifying victory yesterday.

In the view of Tuttosport, two of Italy's top performers were Inter wingback Federico Dimarco and striker Francesco Pio Esposito.

Wingback Dimarco started the match. He assisted Moise Kean's opening goal within the first few minutes.

Overall, Dimarco had a strong match, Tuttosport argue, continuing his bright start to the season with Inter.

Meanwhile, Francesco Pio Esposito came on as a substitute for Kean after the Fiorentina striker suffered an injury.

In the view of Tuttosport, Pio Esposito's display was outstanding. Then, the 20-year-old Nerazzurri striker capped it off with the third goal of the match in the second half.

In the view of Tuttosport, meanwhile, Inter midfielder Nicolo Barella and defender Alessandro Bastoni enjoyed solid matches.

Tuchel is 'fully expected' to see through his contract to after the 2026 World Cup, while the German was 'unimpressed' with the Red Devils' hiring process when he was previously contacted as a potential replacement for Erik ten Hag.

Inter Milan striker Francesco Pio Esposito has been named as the “MVP” for Italy in yesterday's World Cup qualifying win over Estonia.

Today's print edition of Milan-based newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, via FCInterNews, highlight the 20-year-old's sparkling display. The newspaper also praises Nerazzurri duo Nicolo Barella and Federico Dimarco.

Italy secured a hugely important victory over Estonia yesterday.

At risk of missing out on a third consecutive World Cup, the EURO 2020 winners needed to take three points.

Italy got off to just the right start. Fiorentina striker Moise Kean put the Azzurri ahead in the fourth minute. This courtesy of an assist from Inter wingback Federico Dimarco.

Then, Mateo Retegui doubled Italy's advantage a few minutes before halftime.

Italy conceded a second half goal that introduced some major doubts. However, Inter striker Francesco Pio Esposito came off the bench and scored his first ever goal for the national team to wrap up the victory.

In the view of the Gazzetta dello Sport, Pio Esposito was Italy's outstanding performer.

The 20-year-old's performance was more than just his vital goal.

Pio Esposito gave the Azzurri a boost with his energy and physicality as soon as he stepped out onto the pitch.

However, Pio Esposito is not the only Inter player to receive praise from the Gazzetta.

The newspaper also highlight the performance of Nerazzurri midfielder Nicolo Barella. The 28-year-old was in firm control of the central battle.

Furthermore, with Dimarco's assist, the Gazzetta also name the 27-year-old as one of Italy's top performers on the night.

England can secure their qualification for the 2026 World Cup with two matches to spare if they beat Latvia on Tuesday, with Thomas Tuchel's side taking the trip at Daugava Stadium boasting a 100% record in their qualifying campaign thus far. Victory would secure the Three Lions' place at the tournament in North America next summer, while a draw would all-but seal qualification due to a superior goal difference over second-placed Albania.

It was friends-turned-foes Sunday in Wuhan, as former doubles partners Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula faced off in a WTA final for the first time in their careers. In the end, it was Gauff getting the better of her fellow American, winning 6-4, 7-5 in 1 hour and 42 minutes to claim her third WTA 1000 title.

Two years after sharing the WTA 1000 doubles title in Miami, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula stood on stage side by side again Sunday, this time as singles finalists at the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open.

But unlike their shared triumph in 2023, only one could lift the winner's trophy on this occasion. In the end, it was Gauff defeating her fellow American and former doubles partner in straight sets, 6-4, 7-5, to claim the title in 1 hour and 42 minutes.

It was the first time the friends had met in a WTA final.

During the trophy presentation, Gauff thanked Pegula for her support early on in her career.

“When I came on tour, you were one of the first people to be nice to me and welcome me with open arms,” Gauff said. “That really went a long way, so I appreciate you. It's great to finally play in the final against you, and I hope for many more. So, congratulations and thank you.”

The win marked Gauff's 11th career WTA singles title and her second of 2025, following her French Open victory. Of those titles, two are Grand Slams and three are WTA 1000s. She also owns 10 doubles titles, including one Grand Slam and four WTA 1000s.

She became the first player in history to go 9-0 in hard-court finals. All three of her career finals' losses have come on clay.

Here's how she got it done:

Winners, winners: Gauff hit 24 winners, 11 more than Pegula and two more than her unforced errors count. But it wasn't just the volume, but the timing that made these winners count, as the 21-year-old consistently delivered in the biggest moments, starting with the very first point.

The match began with a 15-shot rally, one Gauff finished with a forehand winner down the line. It was the first of six straight points as she raced out to a 3-0, then 4-1 lead.

Pegula responded with three consecutive games to level the set at 4-all, but Gauff held firm. A cross-court backhand for Gauff, winner helped her survive a tense service game to go up 5-4, allowing her to break Pegula the following game to take the set

In the second set, Pegula surged ahead 3-0, putting Gauff on the defensive. Facing a potential 4-0 deficit, Gauff dug in. She came to the net to finish an eight-shot rally with a smash winner, then reeled off three straight games to tie the set at 3-3.

Down 5-4 with Pegula serving for the set, Gauff broke again. After winning the first point of the game, she outlasted Pegula in a 12-shot rally, finishing with a backhand down the line to seal the penultimate break.

Gauff would capture her fourth break of the set in the final game, closing the match with her fourth straight game -- and one final forehand winner.

No sets dropped: With her straight sets win in the final, Gauff became the first player to win the Wuhan Open without dropping a set since the tournament's inception in 2014. She also lost just 25 games en route to the title -- the fewest by any champion in tournament history.

Her run began with a second-round win over Moyuka Uchijima, dropping just one game in 51 minutes. She needed only an hour to get past Zhang Shuai in the third round, then lost three games to Laura Siegemund in the quarterfinals.

The competition stiffened in the semifinals against Jasmine Paolini, who had beaten Gauff three times in 2025 and was fresh off a dominant win over Iga Swiatek. But Gauff dismissed the Italian in short order to reach the final.

Pegula, meanwhile, entered the match having played eight consecutive three-setters, winning seven and holding match points in all eight.

Gauff knew she couldn't let it go the distance.

“You're the three-set queen,” she said to Pegula during the ceremony. “So, I was determined not to let you get there today, because it felt like the odds would be in your favor in the third set.”

All the love for the support in China 🫶@CocoGauff | #WuhanOpen pic.twitter.com/WgOecbU4SM

What it means: Gauff leaves Wuhan with another title, as well as bragging rights over her friend -- even though she still trails Pegula 4-3 in their head-to-head.

By completing the sweep of China's two WTA 1000 tournaments, following her China Open title last year, Gauff becomes just the second player to win both events, joining Caroline Garcia, who accomplished the feat in 2017.

She remains No.3 in the PIF WTA Rankings, but widened the gap over her nearest competitor, Amanda Anisimova, to nearly 2,000 points. She also reclaimed the No. 3 spot in the Race, overtaking Anisimova.

Looking ahead, Gauff and Pegula will both have one more opportunity to capture a big title this season at the WTA Finals in Riyadh in November.

If Gauff wins, she'll not only defend her title from last year, but also end the season with at least one Grand Slam, one WTA 1000 singles title, one WTA 1000 doubles title and a win at the WTA Finals.

The No. 6 seed found her timing to build a 3-0 double break advantage. Even after the 21-year-old erased the deficit, Pegula regained the break with a terrific re-drop and consolidated for 5-3.With all of her previous Wuhan matches going the distance, one could have easily expected this to follow the pattern when Pegula served for the set. Gauff had other ideas.The 21-year-old went on a 10-point run, continuing to frustrate Pegula with a mix of high spins, slices and selective aggression. At 5-6, 30-30, Pegula knifed a superb backhand volley on her approach only to miss the open court on her forehand volley follow-up. She came in again facing match point and was passed by her countrywoman with a forehand to end the encounter.Gauff improved to 11-3 in tour-level singles finals. The Delray Beach, Fla. resident did not drop a set en route to picking up her third career WTA 1000 title.

There was not a dry eye in the house at the Rolex Shanghai Masters after cousins Arthur Rinderknech and Valentin Vacherot took the mic during the trophy ceremony.The Frenchman went first after finishing runner-up Sunday evening in a three-setter. After beginning in English, he switched to French to address Vacherot.

Rinderknech soon naturally choked up, causing the Monegasque to also fight back tears.“Two cousins are stronger than one. You won today, congratulations,” said Rinderknech.

The 30-year-old also paid tribute to countryman Lucas Pouille, who began working with Rinderknech after suffering a ruptured achilles tendon, for inspiring him to carry on with the grind of tour life.“Thank you to Lucas, at home. We started when I was below the floor. Five months ago, I was thinking about stopping tennis at some point cause I wasn't seeing the point anymore,” revealed Rinderknech. “You believed in me, you gave me my chance, you trusted in me. We started, we moved forward and now here we are, Top 30. I hope it's only the beginning. I cannot thank you enough.”

“Thank you to Lucas, at home. We started when I was below the floor. Five months ago, I was thinking about stopping tennis at some point cause I wasn't seeing the point anymore,” revealed Rinderknech. “You believed in me, you gave me my chance, you trusted in me. We started, we moved forward and now here we are, Top 30. I hope it's only the beginning. I cannot thank you enough.”

Storm Hunter won her first title since returning to the Hologic WTA Tour following Achilles surgery, claiming the trophy alongside Katerina Siniakova, as the duo defeated Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic 6-3, 6-2 in 69 minutes to win the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open.

In April 2024, Storm Hunter stood atop the doubles' world.

She had reached world No. 1 for the first time just months earlier and was holding steady at No. 3. Fresh off her fourth WTA 1000 doubles title in Dubai with partner Katerina Siniakova, the duo had also reached the final in Indian Wells.

Then misfortune struck. While practicing ahead of Australia's Billie Jean King Cup qualifier against Mexico, Hunter ruptured her Achilles tendon. Surgery followed, sidelining her for nearly 12 months.

Her comeback has produced steady results, seeing her climbing from No. 1502 in the PIF WTA Doubles Rankings, but wins had eluded her.

Until now.

This week, Hunter reached out to Siniakova in hopes of reuniting in Wuhan. In their first tournament together in 19 months, they picked up where they left off in Indian Wells, although this time around they did one better. The pair defeated Anna Danilina and Aleksandra Krunic 6-3, 6-2 in 69 minutes to win the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open.

“Thank you, Kat, for saying yes to playing with me,” Hunter said during the trophy presentation. “I was really happy to play together again after such a long time. You're an amazing player. You're world No. 1 for a reason, but also a good friend. I had so much fun on the court with you this week, so thank you for saying yes. I can't believe we won the title.”

Hunter also thanked those who supported her through her injury and recovery.

“Thank you to my husband and my team back home -- my coach, physio, fitness trainer and my family,” she said. “Last year was a really hard time for me, and they helped me day by day through some hard moments. This win is for them as much as it's for me. Thank you for believing in me, pushing me and supporting me. I wouldn't be here without you.”

The title is Hunter's first since returning from injury and the ninth WTA doubles title of her career, including five WTA 1000s. She also won the 2022 US Open mixed doubles title with fellow Australian John Peers and was a Wimbledon finalist in 2023 with Elise Mertens.

For Siniakova, it marks her second WTA 1000 title of the season, having won Dubai earlier this year with Taylor Townsend. It's her fourth title of 2025, overall.

The win adds to an already decorated career for the current world No. 1. Siniakova now holds 32 WTA doubles titles, including 10 Grand Slams, six WTA 1000s, a gold medal and a WTA Finals. She also owns a Wimbledon mixed doubles title with Sem Verbeek from earlier this year, another gold medal in mixed doubles and five singles titles.

Siniakova's success in China: The Wuhan title adds to Siniakova's strong track record on Chinese soil. It's her third doubles title in China, where she's reached four finals. She also owns two singles titles there, including her most recent one in 2023.

China has been the site of all three of her WTA 1000 singles quarterfinals, including this year's run in Wuhan, where she lost to eventual finalist Jessica Pegula in three sets.

Over the past three years, Siniakova ranks second in WTA singles wins in China with 18, trailing only Coco Gauff's 21.

“I love coming back here,” Siniakova said during the trophy presentation. “I do a great job here, so I really enjoy it every time. Thank you to everyone who makes it feel like home.”

Rankings watch: Following their title, Siniakova extends her lead over Townsend in the race for world No. 1, now holding a nearly 800-point advantage. The duo has already clinched a spot in the WTA Finals in Riyadh this November.

Hunter, who had fallen outside the top 1500, will jump to No. 39 when the updated rankings are released Monday.

Wuhan doubles title sealed 💌@stormsanders94/@K_Siniakova get it done 6-3, 6-2 against Danilina/Krunic 🏆#WuhanOpen pic.twitter.com/N0fp2JaYFR

Danilina, a finalist in Wuhan for the second straight year, drops one spot to No. 13 after failing to defend her title. Meanwhile, her new partner, Krunic, will climb to a career-best No. 23 in the rankings.

Path to the title: Hunter and Siniakova dominated from the start of the week, opening with a 6-1, 6-0 win over the Americans, Pegula and Ashlyn Krueger. They advanced to the quarterfinals via walkover after the No. 2 seeds Mertens and Veronika Kudermetova withdrew.

They dropped just nine games between the quarters and semis, including a 6-3, 6-0 win over Tereza Mihalikova and Olivia Nicholls to reach the final.

In the final, the result was never truly in doubt, as Hunter and Siniakova broke early for a 2-1 lead and closed out the first set in just over 30 minutes.

Danilina and Krunic briefly rallied to go up 2-0 in the second set, but it wasn't meant to be for the duo on this particular occasion, as Hunter and Siniakova stormed back to win the final six games and capture their third trophy together.

🖥️📲 The Match in 15 Minutes: Vacherot vs. Rinderknech, ShanghaiAs the world No. 204 coming into this event, Vacherot is now the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 champion in history. Borna Coric, ranked No. 152 at 2022 Cincinnati, held the previous mark.With his sensational run that included victories over Novak Djokovic, Holger Rune and Alexander Bublik, Vacherot will climb to No. 40 in Monday's rankings. Rinderknech is set to crack the Top 30 for the first time at No. 28.Two forehand unforced errors from Vacherot handed Rinderknech the first break point of the match in the third game. The Frenchman struck a lob with enough arc to draw a netted overhead—and that would be all he'd need to ride out a one-set lead while throwing an array of shot-making his cousin's way.

After seven clean holds to start the second set, Vacherot made his move. Rinderknech saved the first break point he faced with an ace out wide, but after the Monegasque denied him a game point with a stella return, Vacherot produced the loudest winner of the night with a backhand down the line to turn the tide for 5-3. A hold at 15 sent the match into a decider.Rinderknech immediately fell behind 0-40, and on his third chance to strike, Vacherot curled a sublime backhand pass to seize the break. The 30-year-old avoided falling behind a double break in his next two service games, masterfully saving a combined seven break points.He couldn't make any dent on return, though, as Vacherot won his first 15 points at the line in the final set. At 3-5, Vacherot delivered a pair of blows to open 0-30 and secured the storybook ending on his second championship point with one final forehand winner. The two cousins shared a lengthy embrace, before Vacherot soaked up his winning moment.“Tried to be the guy on the other side of the net. Tried to put it on the side that it's my cousin, the guy that I've been training (and) growing up with. It was really tough,” Vacherot said.“He did a better job than me in the first set with cooperating with the pressure and everything, he played way better than me. Just found a way to turn that around and then make the match a little bit (about) myself at the end.”

Valentin Vacherot and Arthur Rinderknech's remarkable respective runs at the Rolex Shanghai Masters came to a fairytale close on Sunday, when Vacherot rallied to defeat his cousin and former college teammate 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 and capture his maiden tour-level title. In doing so, the Monegasque World No. 204 became the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 champion in history (since 1990).

“It is unreal what just happened. I have no idea what is happening right now. I am not even dreaming, it is just crazy,” Vacherot said. “I am just so happy with my performances the past two weeks. I just want to thank everyone who has helped with my career since the beginning. There has to be one loser but I think there is two winners today, one family that won. And I think for the sport of tennis, the story is unreal."

Competing in front of a packed Stadium Court at one of the biggest events on the ATP Tour, the setting for the final could not have been further removed from the pair's Texas A&M University days, where they played side by side in 2018.

Fast forward seven years and their paths have diverged. Rinderknech arrived in Shanghai with a career-high of No. 42 in the PIF ATP Rankings, with his best result a final run at the ATP 250 in Adelaide in 2022. He had never progressed beyond the third round at a Masters 1000 event until this week.

Vacherot's rise, however, proved even more improbable. The 26-year-old entered the tournament with just one tour-level win to his name, earned earlier this year in Monte-Carlo. He became the lowest-ranked finalist in Masters 1000 history (since 1990), and over the course of two unforgettable weeks, rewrote the trajectory of his career.

After battling through qualifying, the 26-year-old notched wins against Laslo Djere, Alexander Bublik, Tomas Machac, and Tallon Griekspoor to become the first player representing Monaco to reach a Masters 1000 quarter-final. He then stunned Holger Rune and four-time Shanghai champion Novak Djokovic to reach the title match.

In a compelling final, Vacherot once again showcased his resilience. He rallied from a set down for the sixth time this tournament, including qualifying, to become the first player representing Monaco to win a tour-level title in the Open Era. He is also just the third qualifier to win a Masters 1000 crown, joining Roberto Carretero (Hamburg 1996) and Albert Portas (Hamburg 2001).

“I feel when I am down, I have no choice and need to bring my A-game," Vacherot said on his impressive record of coming from behind. "In the first set I didn't do that and he was playing better than me. I took my first chance to break in the second set and from that the crowd got more involved and we put on more of a show in the second part of the match.”

From alternate to MASTERS 1000 CHAMPION 🏆

The Monegasque is the eighth first-time champion on Tour this season and just the fifth man in ATP Masters 1000 history to claim his maiden tour-level title at this level, following Jakub Mensik, who achieved the feat earlier this year in Miami.

Vacherot leaves Shanghai up 164 spots to No. 40 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is set to crack the Top 100 and Top 50 for the first time on Monday. He also takes $1,124,380 in prize money with him, having earned $594,077 for his whole career before this fortnight.

“I was just trying to beat the guy on the other side of the net,” Vacherot said on the dynamics of facing Rinderknech. “[I tried] to put on the side that it is my cousin and the guy I have been training with and growing up with. It was very tough and he did a better job than me in the first set, coping with the pressure. But I just found a way to turn it around.”



Throughout the fortnight, Rinderknech and Vacherot supported each other from the sidelines, cheering one another on and sharing words of encouragement both in person and through their family group chat.

Vacherot had a front-row seat for Rinderknech's standout run, which included wins against Top 20 opponents Alexander Zverev, Jiri Lehecka, Felix Auger-Aliassime, and Daniil Medvedev. On Sunday, he experienced first-hand just how tough his cousin can be to beat.

Rinderknech struck 12 winners and committed just two unforced errors in an impressive opening-set display. The 30-year-old took the ball early to rush Vacherot and gained the decisive break of the first set in the third game to lead in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash.

Vacherot responded in the second set. The 26-year-old kept Rinderknech deep behind the baseline, gaining the first strike in the exchanges to dictate the tempo. From 3-3 in the second set, Vacherot broke Rinderknech in consecutive games to lead by a break in the third set. From there, he continued to play aggressively, taking large cuts at the ball to dominate. He won 92 per cent of his first-serve points in the decider, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and hit just one unforced error in the third set to capture the biggest win of his life after two hours and 11 minutes.

Rinderknech is up 26 places to No. 28 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will rise to a career high on Monday. The 30-year-old recorded his 100th tour-level win in the semi-finals to become the ninth French Masters 1000 finalist in series history.

Did You Know?
Rinderknech's meeting with Vacherot was just the third all-unseeded Masters 1000 final in series history.

In 2018 the Texas A&M University men's tennis team suffered a heartbreaking 4-3 loss in the semi-finals of the NCAA Championships to Wake Forest University. Arthur Rinderknech played No. 2 singles for A&M while his cousin, Valentin Vacherot, competed at No. 4 singles. Their matches were side by side on that difficult day, which marked the end of Rinderknech's accomplished college tennis career.

Head coach Steve Denton, the two-time Australian Open finalist, still remembers what Rinderknech said to him in the aftermath of that loss.

“When Arthur left to go out to try to go play [professionally], I remember him saying to me, ‘Steve, make sure that you take care of my cousin like you took care of me'," Denton told ATPTour.com. “I said, ‘Absolutely, I'll do that'.” 

Denton has maintained his relationship with the cousins, who on Sunday will meet for ATP Masters 1000 glory in the final of the Rolex Shanghai Masters. They each defeated a former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings — Rinderknech ousted Daniil Medvedev and Vacherot beat Novak Djokovic — in the semi-finals.

“This is a dream come true for these two guys,” Denton said. “They've taken the road maybe not traveled as much, obviously, and unless you're a freak like a [Jannik] Sinner and [Carlos] Alcaraz, a lot of players have to go through all these things in order to get to where they are.”

The college coach has been waking up in the middle of the night to watch his former players playing in China. It has been a thrilling experience for Denton, who wanted to travel to Shanghai for the final. However, by the time the former Aggies reached the championship match, there were no flights that would arrive on time.

“I went to sleep last night and it was very improbable that Valentin Vacherot was going to beat Novak Djokovic,” Denton said. “Arthur has been playing really well, and he's very confident, but still, Medvedev is a former number one player in the world and for Arthur to be able to win that match and then get to play each other in the finals is just an amazing story.”

Denton traveled to France when Rinderknech was still a junior to watch three or four players and gauge his interest in them. After watching Arthur for two minutes, the former singles World No. 12 and doubles World No. 2 knew which player he wanted.

When Rinderknech first arrived on campus at Texas A&M, the Frenchman was unable to compete for a year because he was ineligible. The character he showed that year stuck with the longtime coach.

“He suffered watching the other guys play,” Denton said. “And I think that suffering that he went through really helped him in a lot of respects, molded him into being this selfless leader.”

It was all about the team for Rinderknech in an individual sport. Fast forward to Saturday when he lost the first set in the semi-finals against Medvedev. A career-best run was nearing an end against the 2019 Shanghai champion and in the moment, the 30-year-old was not fully focused on winning the match, but trying to help wear down Medvedev so he would be exhausted Sunday in the final against his cousin.

“That's the kind of kid he is. He's always been a team player for us,” Denton said. “He was a team player, and he kind of hung in there in that match thinking, ‘Well, if I can't win, maybe I can take Medvedev's legs away from him a little bit by staying out here and giving Val a better chance'. And they both think that way. They both have a lot of humility. They both are very team oriented and clearly even more so than that, they are family oriented.”

That is a big reason why Vacherot ended up playing at Texas A&M, even if Denton had no idea Rinderknech had a cousin — let alone such a good tennis player — early on. 

“After the first year and me having a good relationship with him and him loving it here, I think he thought, ‘Okay, this is a good spot for my cousin, I'm going to look out for him and I'm going to make sure he comes here',” Denton said. “And that's what happened.”

A post shared by ATP Tour (@atptour)

The pair overlapped for two seasons and helped take the programme to its greatest heights. Rinderknech was more confident and outgoing compared to Vacherot, who was “pretty reserved”. But both proved great leaders, just in their own style. It has been special to watch their dramatic breakthrough from afar.

“You tell young players and their families that you're going to take care of them and that you're going to help them to try to go play pro tennis,” Denton said. “And so by doing that, you have to continue to stay involved in their game. And I've been involved with their game from the beginning, and as long as they want me to help them, I'm happy to do it.” 

Although Denton will not be in Shanghai, he is eager to turn on the match in the early hours of Sunday morning in Texas to watch his Aggies battle in just the second ATP Masters 1000 final between former college tennis players in series history (since 1990). Mikael Pernfors (Georgia) beat Todd Martin (Northwestern) in the 1993 Canada final.

“There are lots of exciting stories about tennis, but this story, at this time, is I think as good as any this year,” Denton said. “And what I'm excited about is these two guys have basically told the rest of the world that college tennis is a definite pathway to the Tour.”

Iconic Carlos Sainz onboards

Ella Lloyd reflects on her season so far in F1 Academy

While Formula 1 drivers are celebrated for their talents on track, many have surprising skills away from the cockpit. From singing to magic, DJing to martial arts, these athletes reveal sides of themselves fans rarely see. Here's a glimpse at the hidden skills and creative pursuits of the 2025 F1 grid.

They're famously known as the fastest of the fast and some of the most fearless competitors on earth. There is no doubt that the current crop of Formula 1 drivers are bursting with talent on track, but did you know the world's best racers have plenty of off track tricks up their sleeves too?

From concert pianos to DJ decks, judo mats to magic tricks, and even a host of musicians, the 2025 grid hides a wealth of unexpected skills that fans might not ever see. Here are six of the best examples of drivers who shine just as brightly away from the track.

It's clear that Yuki Tsunoda has a serious knack for cooking, once even stating that once even stating that it would be a dream to open his own restaurant. However, what might be less well known is his other self-proclaimed talent, which thankfully pairs pretty neatly with his love of food.

In an interview with Talking Bull (Red Bull Racing's official podcast), Tsunoda was proud to reveal some hidden lore – that he has a noticeably sharp sense of smell – something his team often teases him about. It's easy to see how that ties into his passion for cooking, where he relies on aroma as an element of taste.

Maybe it's that sharp nose that makes him such a good cook – or perhaps he just likes knowing what everyone's having for lunch.

It's no secret that seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton is a man with many talents. His creativity runs deeper than his record-breaking F1 career may suggest, from designing his own fashion collections to advocating for social and environmental causes.

But music has always held a special place in his life. The Brit has spent years exploring singing, songwriting, and production, even contributing uncredited vocals to Christina Aguilera's track “Pipe” under the alias XNDA.

However, Hamilton has made it clear that creating music is more than a hobby – it is instead a way to step away from the stress of racing and the demands of touring the world. Timing, emotion, and flow matter just as much in a song as they do on the track, making it easy to see why he's drawn to both worlds. Music gives him a creative outlet that's entirely for himself, a space to reflect and experiment with his creativity.

With his father being a quantum physicist, Isack Hadjar has admitted in interviews he might have followed a similar path if racing hadn't taken off – even saying he “would have ended up studying physics or engineering” instead. His love and talent for maths and science runs deep enough that he's decorated his racing helmets with equations, a small nod to his dad and respect for the specialism.

Alongside this, the French-Algerian driver developed the sense of calm and physical focus needed for driving that was shaped by years of judo training. Hadjar rose through the ranks all the way up to achieving the coveted brown belt as a kid before dedicating himself fully to racing, it's clear the skills have stayed with him. Together, they make him one of the most talented rookies on the grid, having already achieved his first podium in Zandvoort this year.

Carlos Sainz has always been serious about a variety of sports, but he has a niche skill away from the sporting arena – predicting the weather...

During a media activity with ex-McLaren team mate Lando Norris, the Spaniard claimed he has been known as the ‘Shepherd' due to his ability to predict weather changes. This unusual skill could likely be attributed to his extensive outdoor activities such as racing, cycling, and plenty of golf.

And while it may be a light-hearted claim, you can imagine how that intuition might just come in handy on a race weekend.

Liam Lawson has a deep connection with music that goes beyond casual listening or having assembled the perfect race weekend playlist. The Kiwi plays guitar, sings, and has even been known to cover acoustic hits in the studio, having shared clips online well before he reached F1.

In interviews, Lawson has revealed that music is a way to focus and recharge, a hobby that balances the intensity of racing. He's admitted that if motorsport hadn't worked out, he could have pursued music full-time.

If you've ever seen Fernando Alonso pull off a daring overtake or a mind-boggling strategy on track, it might not be a surprise to many to learn that he's got a bit of a magician's touch... literally. The two-time World Champion has long enjoyed performing card tricks and sleight-of-hand illusions, where he's often kept teammates and crew entertained in the paddock.

The Spaniard's love of magic goes back years, learning the basics from his grandfather when he was little and quickly became hooked. In interviews, Alonso has revealed that he's drawn to tricks that are simple but spectacular, and claimed that he approaches them the same way he does racing: with careful preparation and total concentration.

He's been filmed amazing people with tricks during his stint in endurance racing, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans, where even drivers were gobsmacked by some of his tricks. However, we'd argue that it's not just the cards, as we're sure there have been countless times during his 24 years in F1 where his competitors were left thinking El Nano had a little magic in him.

Despite stating in interviews that his “DJ career has come to an end,” it was clear from that short stint that Lando Norris has a real ear for music. He once even mixed business with pleasure, with the Brit playing a set at the official afterparty following the 2022 Singapore Grand Prix.

Lando has made plenty of appearances behind the decks of Zedd and Martin Garrix at festivals and performances, perhaps picking up a few skills from the pro DJ's themselves. Although he's adamant that he's given up his side hustle, we'll still be holding out for that EP drop Lando!

The pop superstar's 12th album is already shattering multiple sales records.


													By
												

	Mitchell Peters



Good Morning America is teasing a big reveal involving Taylor Swift.


	On Sunday (Oct. 12), the ABC morning show shared a “huge new exclusive announcement” on social media, hinting at news tied to the 35-year-old pop superstar's 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl.


	“TOMORROW: We're keep it 💯 with an exclusive Taylor Swift announcement! Tune in ONLY on GMA!” the show wrote on Instagram.


	The post includes a clip from Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” video, accompanied by a voiceover that says, “She's at it again. Taylor Swift shattering records with the biggest album debut in history with over four million units. And now tomorrow morning, GMA has a huge new exclusive announcement on Taylor. So what's next for her? Find out on Good Morning America.”


	It was unclear at press time whether Swift herself will appear during Monday's episode of GMA.

	











The Life of a Showgirl is off to a record-breaking start following its release on Oct. 3. After setting the single-week modern-era consumption record for an album, the project has also broken the modern-era record for the most albums sold in a week in the United States, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate.




Showgirls‘ full final first-week consumption figure (equivalent album units, which includes pure sales, streams and track sales) and pure album sales figure are both still being tabulated by Luminate. But the album already has more than 3.4 million in pure album sales (physical and digital purchases), marking the largest sales week for any album since Luminate began electronically tracking music data in 1991, when the modern era of weekly music tabulation began.


	The previous record for modern-era record for single-week sales of an album was held by Adele's 25, which moved 3.378 million copies in its opening week in November 2015.


	As for whether a The Life of a Showgirl tour is on the horizon, Swift recently shut down that speculation. “No,” the singer told BBC Radio 1 on Oct. 3. “I'm going to be really honest with you — I am so tired.” 


	“Like, when I think about doing it again …,” she continued. “Because I would want to do it really well again.”


	Her exhaustion is understandable. Swift's blockbuster Eras Tour ran from March 2023 through December 2024, spanning 149 shows across five continents. It ultimately became the highest-grossing tour of all time, earning over $2 billion and selling more than 10 million tickets, according to Billboard Boxscore.


Good Morning America airs weekdays from 7-9 a.m. ET on ABC. Check out the show's Swift teaser on Instagram below.

Punches are thrown, cars explode and romantic sparks fly as Peacock's espionage thriller gets set to premiere on Dec. 27.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Simu Liu and Melissa Barrera play dangerous spy games in the teaser trailer for Peacock's upcoming espionage thriller The Copenhagen Test, which dropped on Sunday.


	Liu plays first-generation Chinese-American intelligence analyst Alexander Hale, who discovers his brain has been hacked. That allows access to everything he sees and hears, which makes Hale an open book to his hidden puppet masters.




	“I don't know who I can trust anymore,” Hale says at one point as he's caught between his shadowy agency and unseen hackers. Enter Barrera as Michelle, a mysterious siren who trades both punches and steamy kisses with Hale, judging by the series' first-look footage, as he desperately tries to uncover the identity of his hackers.

	Meanwhile Hale must continue to act normal to flush out who's responsible for the hacking and prove where his allegiance lies.  “If they suspect you're compromised, you're dead,” Hale is warned as he goes down a rabbit hole in the sci-fi spy thriller.


The Copenhagen Test is set to premiere Dec. 27 on Peacock, and the release of the teaser coincides with co-star Liu touting the eight-parter during a New York Comic Con panel. The series, set five minutes in the future, also stars Sinclair Daniel, Brian D'Arcy James, Mark O'Brien and Kathleen Chalfant.


The Copenhagen Test was created by Thomas Brandon, who also showruns, writes and executive produces the series alongside Jennifer Yale. Also sharing executive producer credits are James Wan, Liu, Michael Clear, Rob Hackett, Mark Winemaker and Jet Wilkinson.

The pop star took the stage at Brookside at the Rose Bowl in L.A. on Oct. 10–11.

Chappell Roan is facing criticism from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security following comments she made during a recent concert in Los Angeles.


	During the first of two performances at Brookside at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Friday (Oct. 11), the 27-year-old pop star paused her hit-filled set to reflect on her appreciation for her adopted hometown.


	“L.A.'s my favorite city in the world, to be honest,” Roan told the crowd, according to Variety. “I've been living here nine years. I'm originally from Missouri and I had a really, really tough time the first five years.”


	She went on to speak about the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area and the community's response.

	











	“I'm not gonna be eloquent about this,” she continued. “I loved L.A. more than ever than when I saw how the community came together in Altadena to help, same with the Palisades, I just realized that I'm so lucky to be able to live here and to play here, and the city has taken care of me, and it's my duty to take care of it back.”


	She then concluded her remarks with a pointed political statement. “F—k ICE forever,” the singer said. Roan repeated the phrase, prompting members of the crowd to chant along.




	The Department of Homeland Security quickly responded. “‘Pink Pony Club' is good. Pedophiles are bad. That's who we're getting off of our streets. Get a grip,” DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin told TMZ.


	Roan's comments come at a particularly tense moment for immigrant communities in the U.S., who have increasingly found themselves the target of aggressive ICE operations. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker recently described them as “military-style” raids. President Donald Trump has made mass deportations a central part of his second term.

Refresh for latest…: Riding in lower than pre-weekend projections, Disney's Tron: Ares cycled to a $60.5M worldwide debut, including $27M from the international box office. 


	While the team was out and about on an overseas promotional tour, the latest in the 43-year-old cyber saga just didn't pop wheelies at turnstiles. Still, critical and audience scores on the Joachim Rønning-directed/Jared Leto-fronted pic are better in some areas (France, for example) than the previous Tron movie.


	Some bright spots: Latin America leaned in with No. 1s across the region; both Brazil and Mexico opened ahead of Tron: Legacy and Alien: Romulus. Other notable No. 1s were seen in Spain, UK, Australia and Hong Kong. In some markets, like Germany and Korea, local titles are dominating.

	Two men were arrested on suspicion of murder in the death of Ian Watkins, the Lostprophets singer and convicted pedophile who was stabbed and killed in prison Saturday.


	The BBC reports that two men, aged 25 and 43, were arrested in connection to Watkins' death, and that a murder investigation is currently underway. The suspects' identities were not revealed by police, and authorities had no further comment pending the investigation.


	Watkins was killed at the age of 48 on Saturday at West Yorkshire, England's HMP Wakefield prison, where the former singer was serving a 29-year sentence after pleading guilty to 13 charges, including the attempted rape of a fan's baby and making child pornography.


	Watkins was previously attacked at the jail in August 2023 by three other prisoners, an incident that left him with neck injuries which required hospital treatment. England's HMP Wakefield is considered one of the country's most notorious prisons, and dubbed the “Monster Mansion” as its residents include serial killers, murderers and pedophiles.

	As the BBC notes, Watkins' stabbing death comes just weeks after a chief inspector of prisons' report that revealed attacks at HMP Wakefield had “increased markedly.” “Many prisoners told us they felt unsafe, particularly older men convicted of sexual offenses who increasingly shared the prison with a growing cohort of younger prisoners,” the report found.


	In 2019, Watkins was given 10 additional months in prison after a mobile phone was found in his possession; he argued that he was forced by other prisoners to hold onto the phone. While fighting the charges, Watkins refrained from revealing which prisoners gave him the phone out of fear, saying he was locked up with “murderers, mass murderers, rapists, pedophiles, serial killers – the worst of the worst.”

Ellen DeGeneres is remembering her longtime friend and favorite guest, Diane Keaton. The comedian and former talk show host shared an emotional Instagram tribute after news broke that the Oscar-winning actress had died at age 79 on October 11.

“Diane Keaton was an icon, a hero of mine growing up,” DeGeneres wrote. “To be able to connect with her on my show over the years was so much fun. She was one of my all-time favorite guests. Always a surprise. Always fun. She was one of a kind.”

DeGeneres and Keaton shared countless memorable moments on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show”, where the Annie Hall star's quirky humor and spontaneous personality often stole the spotlight. Fans adored their chemistry, whether they were laughing about Keaton's love of wine or her offbeat stories from Hollywood.

Over the years, DeGeneres often spoke about her admiration for Keaton, both as an artist and as a person. The pair developed a genuine friendship filled with laughter and respect.

Keaton's unpredictable energy became one of the hallmarks of her appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Viewers loved her carefree charm and ability to make DeGeneres laugh uncontrollably.

Following Keaton's passing, clips of her interviews with DeGeneres resurfaced online, showing the actress dancing, joking, and making the audience roar with laughter.

Fans filled social media with memories of her appearances, calling the duo's friendship “pure joy” and “TV magic.” Many said watching Keaton's spontaneity on the show always “made their day.”

As tributes continue to pour in from across Hollywood, DeGeneres's words capture the lasting impact Diane Keaton had not only as an actress but as a woman who radiated warmth, humor, and genuine authenticity.

“Diane was truly one of a kind,” DeGeneres wrote. “Always a surprise. Always fun.”

Her laughter, light, and fearless spirit continue to shine through the memories she created on screen, on stage, and in the hearts of everyone who loved her.

Beloved actress Diane Keaton passed away on Saturday, October 11, at the age of 79. The Oscar winner, celebrated for her unforgettable performances in “Annie Hall,” “Something's Gotta Give,” and “The Family Stone,” died unexpectedly, according to those close to her.

“She declined very suddenly, which was heartbreaking for everyone who loved her,” a friend told People. “It was so unexpected, especially for someone with such strength and spirit.”

The source added that in her final months, Keaton surrounded herself only with her closest family, who chose to keep her condition private. “Even longtime friends weren't fully aware of what was happening,” the insider said.

No official cause of death has been released. Just months before her passing, Keaton made headlines when she listed her beloved Los Angeles estate, her “dream home,” for $29 million. The five-bedroom, seven-bathroom property was an actual labor of love.

Keaton, a lifelong architecture enthusiast, moved into the home in 2017 and spent eight years renovating it. Her passion for design inspired her to publish The House That Pinterest Built, a coffee-table book that chronicled her creative process and unique vision for the space.

The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola paid tribute to Diane Keaton Sunday following news of the legendary actress' death.


	“Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful,” the filmmaker wrote of the actress who portrayed Kay Adams in the Godfather saga.

A post shared by Francis Ford Coppola (@francisfordcoppola)


	“From her earliest performances in ‘Hair' and throughout her amazing career, she was an extraordinary actor. I saw her in the film ‘Lovers and Other Strangers' and knew I had to have her play Kay in The Godfather, (which she told me she based on my wife Ellie) and her wonderful work in ‘Annie Hall' while simultaneously setting a new fashion trend. Everything about Diane was creativity personified.”

	Jane Fonda, Steve Martin, Leonardo DiCaprio and Mandy Moore were among Keaton's Hollywood peers and co-stars to remember the Oscar-winning actress following news of her death Saturday at the age of 79, while Keaton's First Wives Club co-stars Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn also paid tribute. 

	











	“Some actors play emotions. Diane Keaton lived inside them,” the Academy — which awarded a Best Actress Oscar to Keaton for Annie Hall — wrote on social media. “Diane Keaton embodied the contradictions of being human: funny and fragile, bright and bruised, always achingly honest. For decades, she filled every frame with warmth, wit, and wonder. A Best Actress Oscar winner and four-time nominee, her presence shaped generations of storytelling. Her spirit will live forever on screen, and in the hearts of all who saw themselves in her.”

Mae Martin is not into chit-chat. After the soul-baring series Feel Good, the Netflix stand-up special Mae Martin: SAP, and hit podcast Handsome, fans think they know the real Mae and want to dive straight in. “People come up and trauma dump — and I'm into it,” they say. “I'm not good with small talk anyway, I want to get deep.”


	Martin speaks with a mix of humor, warmth and livewire energy. Their work has dealt with, and often found the funny within, life's awkward or existential moments. “With stand-up, it was such a huge turning point in my career when I started talking about real stuff — my life and addiction and pain,” they say. “People were suddenly totally engaged and laughing more. It's really gratifying and validating to say the things that you're embarrassed about and then have other people say, ‘Yeah, me too.'”

	Deadline talks to Martin in Toronto where they grew up, and it's a full circle moment. Years before, they were filming outside the movie premieres at the Toronto International Film Festival with a camcorder, or they were getting autographs from stars such as Liev Schreiber. This time Martin was on the other side of the barrier at the festival for the world premiere of Wayward, the Netflix series they created, exec produced and starred in. “We filmed the show here,” Martin says. “It's really about adolescence and I associate Toronto with my teens. That was the backdrop for all my misadventures.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The limited series is about the multi-billion-dollar troubled teens industry, and specifically the Wayward Pines Academy in the town of Tall Pines. It is an institution that promises “to solve the problem of adolescence.” Donning some formidable glasses, Evelyn (Toni Collette) runs the school and, it transpires, maybe the whole town. The viewers' entry point is through Abbie (Sydney Topliffe), whose parents send her to the school, and Leila (Alyvia Alyn Lind), her best friend who attempts to rescue her; as well as via Alex (Martin), a newly arrived cop, and his heavily pregnant wife, Laura (Sarah Gadon).

	











	The Abbie-Leila relationship is modeled on that of Martin and their childhood best friend, who was taken to a school for troubled teens. The memory served as inspiration for the series. Martin describes Wayward as “at heart a love letter to teen friendship.”


	The school's origins are cultish, an area that fascinates Martin. “Cults are a useful metaphor for the complicity that we all have and what we're willing to turn a blind eye to in order to have a comfortable life.”


	Martin's previous series Feel Good, for Netflix and Channel 4, was semi-autobiographical and over two seasons traced the relationship between Mae and George, played by Ghosts star Charlotte Ritchie. It also delved into Mae's past and their own teen years. If Feel Good was comedy with a powerful dramatic arc, Wayward turns that formula on its head and is largely a drama with some lighter moments along the way.


	“I was keen to properly build tension,” Martin says about that radical gear-shift. “I really wanted to make sure that the funny moments were character-driven and truthful, and that any horror and pain was really earned.”


	Given Martin has had a successful career as a stand-up comic and comedy writer, was it hard to reel in the laughs for Wayward?“I feel like my inner clown is very close to the surface,” they say. “As I get older, I think, ‘Is it just a series of coping mechanisms? Am I funny really, or is that just a way of interfacing with the world?' I'm still figuring that out.”


Action Points


	When pressed on their dream role, Martin says they want to be the next James Bond. Maybe the clues were there all along. In Feel Good, Martin's character tells their agent: “I've always wanted to be John Wick.” In Wayward, a pumped-up Martin plays cop Alex Dempsey, who cracks some heads and is seriously deep in the action. “I'm clearly living out some fantasy and I don't know who keeps letting me do it,” they say. “I have perpetual imposter syndrome about acting, but I really fell in love with it making this show and getting to work with Toni Collette, Sarah Gadon and the cast. I gave myself license to really go for it. It was really fun to get out some aggression and to play that character with all his flaws.”


	Martin was urged to dye their hair darker so that Alex could be taken more seriously. And that character is a serious one. He has a darkness and yet also yearns for a happy family home in a picture-perfect setting, which Tall Pines, ultimately, is not. For Martin, this role felt like more of a traditional acting gig where they are inhabiting a fictional character, as opposed to Feel Good where they played a version of themselves.


	Martin pinpoints a crucial scene just over halfway through the season. “It's a sex scene between a trans cop [Alex] and his eight-months pregnant wife [Laura]. That representation would have meant a lot to me when I was young. It's such a different thing to see: An eight-months pregnant woman who's fully clothed and this trans guy.”


	For Martin, the fact that Alex was a trans man and “that wasn't the most interesting or important thing about his character” in the series, was significant. “What that means is that, if you're not preaching, or making it such a linchpin of the show, you can actually be more subversive. Narratively, there is so much going on in this scene.”

	











	Martin shares a chunk of screentime with Collette, who serves up a masterclass in chilling villainy as a school and community leader who majors in manipulation. In the wrong hands, Evelyn could have been a pantomime baddie, but Collette delivers something more complex. “She really got the assignment,” says Martin. “Where it could have been a sort of mustache-twirling villain, I think you feel that Evelyn really believes in what she's doing and just lacks self-awareness and is some kind of narcissist.”


Wayward Adolescence


Feel Good and Wayward are both produced by Objective Fiction. A creative through-line from those shows, via the SAP stand-up special, is a focus on teenage years and their legacy. “In Feel Good there was an adult processing their teens and then with SAP I was similarly driven by nostalgia and trying to make sense of it all,” says Martin. “I'm trying to make sense of how visceral those years were for me; all of those firsts are so intense. In your teens everyone is a mess, but you also know who you are.”


	With Wayward, Martin is hopeful that audiences will reflect on their own adolescence. “I'd like people to think about their own teens. We should absolutely be listening to young people more. I don't think we've ever really known what to do with teenagers. We sexualize them, we market to them, we deride them, we treat them like children, but we expect them to be adults.We so desperately need that next generation to save the planet that it'd be good to empower them a little bit.”


	For Martin, it was important that the young cast of Wayward such as Topliffe, Lind and others felt empowered amongst seasoned performers such as Collette, Gadon and Patrick J. Adams. 


	“We were already editing the show when I watched [Netflix's U.K. drama] Adolescence. There is an episode with around 200 kids in that school, but if you give them that responsibility, or trust people with their characters and their intuition, then they really step up. It was important to me, that [the young cast] felt like they had ownership over the emotional worlds of their characters.”


Next Steps


	Post-Wayward, Martin has a stand-up tour in the offing and projects with Feel Good co-creator Joe Hampson in the works. “I miss working with him and we've got a couple of things in development that we're pitching because we're desperate to write something funny again,” they say. “We have some good ideas and I'm just trying to lure him out to LA.”


	Martin is also eyeing roles in work created by other writers. “I've never been in a movie and I'd love to act in someone else's thing and to play someone really different.”


	They continue: “I'd love to do an Elliott Smith biopic and play him or even play River Phoenix. I'd also love to play a villain or do a kids' movie.” That might be called keeping your options open, but considering Martin has written comedy and now drama, releases music, writes books, co-hosts a popular podcast and has also started selling their artwork, these ambitions don't feel lofty. Maybe Bond isn't such a stretch.

This looks awesome

Who cares we want a real movie sequel not a re-make again and actually the next one would be part 10 because part 5 was just a copycat killer Freddy vs Jason wasn't a real Friday sequel the re-make either.

Bette Midler, Francis Ford Coppola, Kate Hudson, Steve Martin, Jane Fonda, Octavia Spencer and more stars are sharing their condolences for the Oscar-winning actress who died on Saturday.


							By 

	Lexi Carson


Associate Editor


	Hollywood is mourning the loss of Diane Keaton.


	The Oscar-winning actress — known for her roles in Annie Hall, the Godfather trilogy, Father of the Bride, Something's Gotta Give and The First Wives Club — died on Saturday in California at the age of 79. Her cause of death is not yet available.




	Following the news of her death, many of her former co-stars, industry figures and stars took to social media to share tributes.


	Robert De Niro shared a statement with The Hollywood Reporter, which reads: “I am very sad to hear of Diane's passing. I was very fond of her and the news of her leaving us has taken me totally by surprise. I was not expecting her to leave us. She will be missed. May she rest in peace.”

					Diane Keaton, Oscar-Winning Star of 'Annie Hall,' Dies at 79		
			









	Bette Midler, who starred alongside Keaton and Goldie Hawn in 1996's The First Wives Club, took to Instagram to write: “The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!”


	Additionally, Hawn's daughter and actress Kate Hudson shared a clip of three women in the film with the caption, “We love you so much Diane.”


	Francis Ford Coppola, Keaton's director on The Godfather films, posted a tribute on Instagram. “Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful. From her earliest performances in Hair and throughout her amazing career, she was an extraordinary actor,” he wrote. “I saw her in the film Lovers and Other Strangers and knew I had to have her play Kay in The Godfather, (which she told me she based on my wife Ellie) and her wonderful work in Annie Hall while simultaneously setting a new fashion trend. Everything about Diane was creativity personified.”

	











	Steve Martin, whom she starred alongside in 1991's Father of the Bride, shared a clip of a 2021 interview she did with Martin Short for Interview magazine, in which Short asks Keaton, “Who's sexier, me or Steve Martin?,” and Keaton replies, “I mean, you're both idiots.” Martin captioned the post: “Don't know who first posted this, but it sums up our delightful relationship with Diane.”


	Keaton's Book Club co-star Candice Bergen said in a statement to THR, “This is a huge loss both personally and for all of us. Diane was a true artist — tremendously gifted and uniquely talented in so many disciplines yet also modest and wonderfully eccentric. I will miss her terribly.” Mary Steenburgen also shared a statement with THR, which read, “Diane was magic. There was no one, nor will there ever be, anyone like her. I loved her and felt blessed to be her friend. My love to her family. What a wonder she was!!!”


	Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Keaton's nephew in Marvin's Room (where she earned one of her four Oscar noms), posted a tribute on his Instagram Stories. “Diane Keaton was one of a kind. Brilliant, funny, and unapologetically herself,” he wrote alongside a photo of himself and Keaton. “A legend, an icon, and a truly kind human being. I had the honor of working with her at 18. She will be deeply missed.”


	Below, see all of the tributes (so far) that stars have made.

	Singer-songwriter Role Model debuted as Saturday Night Live musical guest with two songs from the deluxe edition of Kansas Anymore, his second studio album, which he released in February.


	After an introduction from SNL host Amy Poehler, the 28-year-old Maine native opened with “Sally, When the Wine Runs Out.” In live performances of the indie pop hit, Role Model has often invited a fan, another musician, or some other special guest to play the part of Sally. Here, it was Charli XCX.


	The British pop singer—SNL‘s musical guest last November—received wild screams of approval from the audience. After dancing and swirling her hair to the song's bridge, she slid her sunglasses onto Role Model's face, blew him a kiss, then strutted away.

	Role Model's second performance was of the more mellow “Some Protector.”


	The artist, whose real name is Tucker Pillsbury, has said his latest album, which follows 2022's Rx, is a big step forward.

	











	“I think the one thing I wanted to prove when I first put it out was my growth — my songwriting and my taste in music had matured, and I had also matured as a person,” he told Rolling Stone in a revealing April interview. “It felt like a big shift in the way I would talk about things and write about them, and a big part of that was just me getting to a place on guitar where I could play well enough that I could write songs by myself on it.”

	Role Model, who opened for Gracie Abrams last year and then headlined his No Place Like Tour this spring, will be one of the four artists at Rolling Stone‘s Musicians on Musicians live event Oct. 23 at New York's Beacon Theatre. He will be paired with María Zardoya of the Marias, while Jack Antonoff will join Hayley Williams with Bleachers, for conversations and collaborative performances on stage. SNL‘s James Austin Johnson will host.


	Role Model begins a stretch of European shows next month.

The Grammy winner served as the singer's "Sally girl," making a surprise appearance while he performed his track "Sally, When The Wine Runs Out." 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Charli XCX wasn't supposed to be Saturday Night Live‘s musical guest, but that didn't stop her from making a surprise appearance on the late night show Saturday night.


Role Model, who served as the official musical guest of the second episode of season 51, hit the stage where he performed a rendition of his track, “Sally, When The Wine Runs Out.” When performing the song at his live shows, the artist typically brings out a special guest of his own, known better to fans as the “Sally girl.”




	In the past, Role Model has chosen artists like Conan Gray and Charli XCX's dear friend and Sweat Tour co-headliner Troye Sivan to serve the role. The two have taken joking jabs at one another on social media due to faux “Sally girl” drama, which included Role Model featuring the “Rush” singer during one of his shows.

	However, it appeared Charli XCX and Role Model officially worked it out on the remix (or SNL stage) as she delivered a surprise cameo during his performance of the beloved song. Eagle-eyed fans also pointed out that the “360” singer wore the same shirt Role Model had on during promo shots that were released earlier this week for the episode. The shirt read, “max's kansas city.”

	The “Look At That Woman” singer made his SNL debut on Saturday night, where he was joined by host Amy Poehler. The second episode of season 51 proved to be a star-studded night in terms of appearances, as former cast members Tina Fey and Seth Meyers also made unanticipated cameos. 


	Charli XCX hosted SNL for the first time last year, where she also doubled as musical guest. The Grammy winner is known to spotlight fans and (sometimes) surprise celebrities during special segments of her concerts. Set to her track “Apple,” Charli XCX regularly picks a concertgoer or public figure to be platformed on the big screen of her shows, where they often recite the popular TikTok dance to the tune of her song. 

	











	Her SNL appearance comes amid speculation of an alleged feud with Taylor Swift. The latter singer's latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, featured a track entitled “Actually Romantic,” which some fans believe is a response to Charli XCX's 2024 track “Sympathy is a knife.”

	Among the topics Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update took on were Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s latest unscientific comments and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem‘s odd attempt to blame Democrats for the government shutdown. 


	“Health secretary RFK Jr., seen here trying to cure cancer with his mind, said this week that men who were circumcised are more likely to be autistic,” co-anchor Colin Jost said of the proponent of vaccine misinformation, who has claimed that Tylenol is linked to autism. “—Which isn't surprising coming from a man who looks like he's made out of foreskin.”


	Jost then addressed how Noem is subjecting airline passengers in line at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints to a video of her insisting that the government shutdown, which is occurring under a GOP-controlled Senate, House and a Republican president, is actually all Democrats' fault. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Jost then played a portion of the video—which turned out to be the first line of fictional serial killer Jigsaw's videotaped message to his tortured victims: “I want to play a game.”

	











	Weekend Update also addressed a recent development—of questionable legality—in the U.S. Treasury.


	That department, Michael Che announced, “is planning to release a silver dollar with President Trump's face on it. And then on the other side, he has Harriet Tubman in a head lock.”


	Tubman, the abolitionist and slave rescuer, would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said way back in 2016. But it's looking like that may not come about until at least 2030.

	











	Jost also called out Trump for proclaiming an end to Indigenous People's Day and labeling Christopher Columbus “original American hero.”

	“So while Trump is rounding up people with ICE, he is praising Columbus, a guy who literally brought boat loads of Hispanics to America,” Jost said.


	Weekend Update concluded with a joke off between Jost, Che, and former anchors Tina Fey, Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler, who was SNL‘s host Saturday.

The trio previously spent half a decade together as part of the cast of the late night series. Earlier in the night, Fey made her first unexpected cameo during the episode's cold open. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Amy Poehler served as a brief guest anchor on Saturday Night Live‘s “Weekend Update,” and she was joined by two familiar faces — and that's not including Colin Jost and Michael Che. 


	After making a surprise cameo during the cold open, Tina Fey made a second appearance during the infamous SNL bit. But that's not all: they were also joined by fellow alumni Seth Meyers. 




	The segment kicked off with Poehler criticizing one of Jost's jokes, to which they decided to settle their beef with “a good old fashioned ‘Weekend Update' joke off.” The crowd then erupted in applause as Fey and Meyers entered the shot.

	“Oh, did somebody say ‘Weekend Update' joke off?” Fey asked. The Good Hang podcast host quickly introduced the two, noting, “My first wife and second wife, everybody!” 


	Jost then went on to set up the joke, saying, “A woman in Tennessee broke a hospital record after giving birth to a 13 pound baby, and go!” 


	Poehler replied with her own shot at creating the best joke, noting, “A woman gave birth to a 13 pound baby which was so big he slapped the doctor on his ass.” Fey then took her shot, saying, “A woman gave birth to a 13 pound baby, and the new baby's name is Ahhhhh!”


	Meyers continued the joke off: “A woman gave birth to a 13 pound baby, damn, did she give birth to it, or did it drive out?” They traded several jokes with Jost and Che, until Poehler affirmed, “We won!”

	Poehler, Fey and Meyers' spent years working on SNL amongst one another. As a trio, they served five years together as cast members on the show. The Mean Girls star exited the series in 2006, leaving Poehler and the Late Night host with two additional years together before Poehler left in 2008.


	Poehler returned to SNL for her third time as host on Saturday night, where she was joined by musical guest Role Model. He even brought out his own special cameo in Grammy Award-winner Charli XCX.


	Earlier in the night, Poehler and Fey portrayed Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem, respectively, in the cold open.


	The Parks and Recreation star utilized her opening monologue to commemorate the official 50th anniversary of SNL, noting that the first episode of the show debuted exactly 50 years on Oct. 11, 1975. However, she also took time to criticize AI actress Tilly Norwood who made headlines after her studio revealed they were searching for her own representation. 


	“I remember watching the show in the '70s, sitting in my house in Burlington, Massachusetts thinking, ‘I wanna be an actress someday, at least until they invent an AI actress who's funnier and willing to do full frontal,'” Poehler said.


	She later added, “I know it can feel like times are very tough right now, and in some ways they always have been and they always will be, so I'll just say this — if there's a place that feels like home that you can go back to and laugh with your friends, consider yourself lucky, and I do. And to that little AI robot watching TV right now who wants to be on this stage someday, I say to you, ‘Beep boop beep boop.' Which translates to, ‘You'll never be able to write a joke, you stupid robot.'”

Aubrey Plaza played the new girl in SNL's send-up of Netflix's hit drama The Hunting Wives, which the late-night show described as a “straight but lesbian, horny Republican murder drama.”


	Amy Poehler assumed the role of Malin Akerman's Margo by flashing her tatas to Chloe Fineman, who took over as Brittany Snow's Sophie. In this so-called Season 2 of the drama, Fineman's Sophie is back from prison and ready to canoodle with her brunette Texas hottie.


	“All your faves are back and they're as naughty as ever,” the narrator declares. “Thighs will be squeezed, guns will be drawn.”

	











	As scenes of Poehler caressing a rifle-toting Fineman flash by, the narrator says, “People Magazine writes, it's like ‘Call Me By Your Name' for women who shop at Bass Pro Shop.” There's also reference to wigs “that are doing their best” on the show and those teens who hooked up with Snow's randy character.

	Plaza shows up as the “new new girl who joins the group,” having just moved from California. The women lose their cool, however, when they discover Plaza is actually a lesbian. That prompts them to pull out their rifles.

Saturday Night Live host Amy Poehler and fellow ex-SNL cast member Tina Fey parodied Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a congressional hearing, cutting a pro-ICE advertisement along the way. 


	Poehler's portrayal of the attorney general was of an evasive Trump loyalist who loves to play the victim and insult senators.


	After refusing to tell the truth during her swearing-in, the Trump appointee was asked whether her boss directed her to prosecute his political opponents, as a mistakenly public Truth Social post by the president intended for Bondi makes clear.


	“Before I don't answer, I would like to insult you personally: Senator Blumenthal, look at this honky. Even people in Connecticut go, ‘Damn, that guy is white as hell,'” she said to the lawmaker (Mikey Day.) “That is just one of the many roast-style burns I have here on this paper. Don't make me use them.”


	When questioned about whether the FBI found photos of Trump with half-naked young women when they raided sex offender and former Trump pal Jeffrey Epstein‘s property, she replied: “Sir, I'm not even going to dignify that question with a lie.”

	Poehler's character added later: “I tried reading the Epstein files but I got really bored. It's so repetitive. Trump this, Trump that. Yawn!”


	A question about Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations caused her  to refer questions to the Homeland Security Secretary. Fey then entered to rock music, tossing her semiautomatic weapon aside.

	











	“I'm the rarest type of person in Washington, D.C: a brunette that Donald Trump listens to,” she boasted. “I'm here to tell you that this Democrat government shutdown needs to end now.”


	After Day said Democrats “are even more eager to end this shutdown than our Republican colleagues,” Fey remarked: “That makes me laugh more than the end of Old Yeller.”


	In her 2024 memoir, Noem recalled shooting and killing her puppy and goat—an admission that also killed her chances of being Trump's running mate.


	The duo then defended ICE agents, and cut an advertisement to recruit more: 


Fey: Do you need a job now?


Poehler: Yeah


Fey: Are you a big, tough guy?


Poehler: Yeah.


Fey: Tough enough for the army or police? 


Poehler: No.


Fey: But do you take supplements that you bought at the gas station?


Poehler: Daily.


Fey: Do you like to use zip ties beacuse people in your life don't trust you with keys?

	On the day that Oscar winner and New York icon Diane Keaton died, Saturday Night Live went for a traditional political cold open tonight with a Not Ready for Primetime Players legends reunion


	Specifically, SNL pulled in many of its current cast as various befuddled senators questioning MAGA Attorney General Pam Bondi and gun-carrying Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The two Donald Trump cabinet members were played by tonight's host Amy Poehler and her partner-in-comedy-crime of many years ago Tina Fey, respectively.


	“Before I don't answer, I'd like to insult you personally,” Poehler's all attitude Bondi tossed out at the top while bragging of “many of the roast-style burns” she had on hand for her testimony.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Actual testimony did take place on Capitol Hill this past week, with the former Sunshine State AG repeatedly rebuffing Democratic senators over citizen-accosting ICE and American troops in U.S. cities, Jeffrey Epstein, the indictment of ex-FBI director James Comey and the current shutdown. Or, as Poehler said in tonight's opener, “the DOJ has many ongoing operations, and we're moving like Kash Patel's eyeballs very quickly in multiple directions at once.”


	In one of the fastest-moving and leanest cold opens in many an SNL, Fey's Noem exclaimed, after she tossed her machine gun aside: “I'm the rarest type of person in Washington D.C., a brunette that Donald Trump listens to.”


	Harking back to Noem's memoir referencing dog killing that likely saw ex-South Dakota governor dropped from Trump's VP short list last year, tonight's skit saw Fey declaring that the idea Democrats want the shutdown over “makes me laugh more than the end of Old Yeller.”

	











	Or put another way: “Dogs don't just get shot. Heroes shoot them.”


	See Fey's entrance on the nostalgic hot cold open above.


	Keaton, who never hosted nor appeared on stage at SNL over its five-decade run, died this morning in Los Angeles at the age of 79, her family made public today. Starring in all three Godfather films, the Academy Award winner for 1977's Annie Hall had a career that spanned from 1970-2024.


	For Keaton's lack of SNL experience, tonight's show was a true blast from the past besides the reunion, with former cast member Poehler back for her third stint as host. Those appearances come on top of Poehler's “Weekend Update” co-anchor role with Fey and many others, including a punchy Hillary Clinton alongside Fey's career-defining Sarah Palin while on SNL from 2001-2008.


	Along with Poehler's return as host, Role Model makes his SNL debut as the musical guest this week. 


	Next week sees another one of those rare-ish SNL occasions when the host and the musical guest are one and the same — in this case Sabrina Carpenter. The “Espresso” singer was previously on the NBC late-nighter for the last episode of Season 49 on May 18, 2024. Carpenter also appeared on February's SNL50 anniversary special singing “Homeward Bound” with multiple SNL host and guest Paul Simon.


	A good pairing, but no Amy Poehler and Tina Fey.

The Oscar-winning star of ‘Annie Hall,' ‘Manhattan,' all three ‘Godfather' movies, ‘Reds' and ‘The First Wives Club' was a one-of-a-kind screen presence.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	There's a very funny scene in Ron Howard's frothy 1984 interspecies rom-com, Splash, in which Daryl Hannah, playing a mermaid in Manhattan who swaps her tail for legs, skips out to buy suitable land attire. Given that she emerged from the sea naked, she throws together an outfit from the Tom Hanks character's closet.


	The “fish out of water” turns up on a Bloomingdale's womenswear floor in a men's black suit, white shirt, black leather derbies and what looks like a school tie. The ensemble instantly brings a horrified saleslady scurrying over: “Oh my God, darling, darling, darling! That outfit is to die from! What happened, you saw Annie Hall a hundred times? That look is over.”

					Diane Keaton, Oscar-Winning Star of 'Annie Hall,' Dies at 79		
			









	That was seven years after the release of Annie Hall and the imprint on fashion and popular culture of Diane Keaton's iconic looks as the title character remained an instantly identifiable reference.


	Even more than Marlene Dietrich had done in white tie and tuxedo ensembles in the 1930s, Keaton in Annie Hall kickstarted a wave of genderless dressing with her men's shirts and wide ties, slouchy trousers and oversized jackets, button-up vests and fedoras.


	What made the layered wardrobe trend resonate — and continue to be seen on stylish women today — was how effortlessly cool it looked on Keaton. Her outfits were eccentric but unfussy, tomboyish but distinctly feminine. They made her character appear confident, even at her most insecure. And while the costumes mostly came from shopping expeditions to Ralph Lauren and other menswear emporiums, they were 100 percent reflective of Keaton's personal style off-camera.

	











	The misconception that comedy is easy — and that Keaton was essentially playing a version of herself — caused some quiet ripples of discontent when she beat out competition that included Anne Bancroft, Jane Fonda and Shirley MacLaine in dramatic roles to take home the best actress Oscar in 1977.


	But Keaton's justly honored performance in Annie Hall endures for reasons that go far beyond the synthesis of her on- and offscreen personas. She essentially reinvented the classic screwball heroine for a more socially evolved age. Annie might have come off to a casual observer as a kooky ditz, but she was clever, witty, talented, a sponge for knowledge and, eventually, an assertive voice for her own independence.


	She emerged with a wave of actresses in the 1970s and early ‘80s that defied traditional standards of silver-screen glamour by being utterly natural, among them Karen Allen, Brooke Adams, JoBeth Williams, Jill Clayburgh and Margot Kidder. And yet Keaton was very much an original, never part of any pack.


	The announcement of her unexpected death at 79, less than a month after Robert Redford's passing, represents another stinging loss to the pantheon of New Hollywood in the decades before the major studios largely stepped away from making movies for grownups.


	Irrespective of your views on the now-controversial figure of Woody Allen, the films he made with Keaton, both during and after their romantic involvement, remain among her most outstanding screen work — Annie Hall and Manhattan in particular.

	











	That's at least partly because while Keaton's characters might have been amused by the brainy verbosity and self-effacing neuroses of Allen's alter egos, she was never intimidated or outmatched by them. She challenged her writer-director and co-star in ways that few other women in his movies ever have.


	Keaton's innate radiance and verve made her born to play comedy, but she was no less gifted a dramatic actor. The women in Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather trilogy are generally submissive. But Keaton made Kay Adams-Corleone — an initially naïve outsider, favoring love over clarity as she agrees to marry Al Pacino's Michael Corleone — the moral tether to the outside world, beyond the vicious criminal enterprises of the Mafia dynasty. She stands up to Michael and walks away, as few others get to do.


	The same year Annie Hall was released, Keaton took on a risky role for a rising-star actress in Looking for Mr. Goodbar. In a fearless performance, she played Theresa Dunn, a dedicated schoolteacher whose repressive Catholic upbringing and history of childhood illness become fuel for her defiant sexuality. After feeling used and disrespected in her first experiences with men, Theresa throws herself into an increasingly dark spiral of sleazy pickup bars and hookups with strangers, ultimately with fatal results.


	With a lesser interpreter, the movie might have been just a sensationalistic shocker, but Keaton brought integrity and emotional candor to Theresa's messy search to define herself. That made it a rare example for its time of a character study that explored a modern woman's erotic desires without shame.

	











	Keaton was tough, impassioned and ultimately heartbreaking as feminist journalist and Russian Revolution sympathizer Louise Bryant, starring opposite writer-director (and offscreen partner at the time) Warren Beatty as Bohemian communist activist John Reed in his 1981 historical epic, Reds.


	But her crowning dramatic achievement came arguably the following year in Alan Parker's raw, unflinching depiction of marital breakdown Shoot the Moon, starring opposite Albert Finney. In an ecstatic New Yorker review, Pauline Kael described their characters as torn from inside the writer, director and the two stars. Faith Dunlop was a role that allowed Keaton to embrace both depression and steadfast self-possession, refusing to endure more pain from the man she married, even at the cost of great distress to their children.


	“Diane Keaton acts on a different plane from her previous film roles,” wrote Kael. “She brings the character a full measure of dread and awareness, and does it in a special, intuitive way that's right for screen acting. Nothing looks rehearsed, yet it's all fully created.”


	Aside from Paolo Sorrentino, who gave Keaton red meat to chew on as the formidable American nun and spiritual consigliere in the HBO series The Young Pope, it's disappointing that in the later years of her six-decade career, directors mostly stopped challenging Keaton.


	More often they leaned on her signature quirks and mannerisms, at times pushing her to the point of self-caricature. But Keaton could shine even in humdrum material and there are gems among the many cute comedies she could do with her hands tied behind her back.

	











	One such keeper is The First Wives Club, an effervescent feminist revenge comedy in which Keaton, Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler play women pushed aside for younger models who turn the tables on their philandering husbands. Another is the role that landed Keaton her fourth Oscar nomination, in Nancy Meyers' advanced-age romantic comedy, Something's Gotta Give. She stars as a whip-smart playwright who's much more than a foil to Jack Nicholson's smug playboy, who prides himself on dating only women under 30.


	With her sheer, undiminished magnetism alone, Keaton remained a feisty rebuke to that kind of ageism in Hollywood. Her vitality was unextinguishable. We are fortunate to have shared so much of her life.

Paramount+'s new Star Trek series, Starfleet Academy, has not been shy about leveraging its big-name talent, whether that means giving fans a good, hard look at “Holly Hunter, Space Principal,” or Paul Giamatti living out his dreams of being a cackling alien villain with tons of crap glued to his face. (To say nothing of franchise return guests like Tig Notaro, Mary Wiseman, and Robert Picardo.) Still, we'll admit they managed to surprise us with the cameo appearance the show rolled out at New York Comic-Con this week, as they played a clip of CBS talk show host (and certified geek) Stephen Colbert, announcing he's joining the series in a voice role.



Of course, observers of the pop culture ecosystem know that Colbert is probably on the hunt for a few side gigs to shore up the ol' resumé lately, what with CBS announcing his series will be ending next year. (Not too long from when Starfleet Academy will be having its January 15, 2026 premiere.) But given that we've always thought of him as way more of a fantasy dork than a space nerd, it's still interesting to hear that he's going to be picking up work as the “digital dean” of the Academy, delivering announcements to the students. (Joking, in a video clip filmed from his Late Show desk, that it's all the fun of being on the show without having to spend four hours a day getting Giamatti'd up.)

﻿

Long-time fans of Colbert's career will know that he used to hop in the voice booth pretty often, lending his sharp, Stentorian tones to cartoons like Harvey Birdman: Attorney At Law and The Venture Bros.. If you were on the fence about Starfleet Academy—which also got a non-Colbert trailer today, featuring what looks like a pretty enjoyably pulpy blend of teen angst, smooching, and grown-ups like Hunter and Giamatti hamming it up—though, it's always possible that having Colbert delivering funny announcements in the background while all the drama's going on might be a deciding factor for you. (If nothing else, it's nice to know the guy can still book a gig, despite all.)

Just weeks before her passing, Diane Keaton quietly listed her beloved Los Angeles home for sale — a place she had once called her “dream home.” The decision came as her health began to decline, marking a poignant final gesture from the Oscar-winning actress known for her authenticity, creativity, and timeless sense of style.

In March 2025, Keaton made a decision that surprised many: she listed her beloved Los Angeles home for sale, despite previously saying she planned to live there indefinitely. The move came during a period when her health had quietly begun to decline. Friends later shared that the decision reflected a sense of practicality and peace — a final act of letting go from the actress who had spent her life creating beauty in everything she touched.

The Brentwood estate, a five-bedroom, seven-bath residence, was listed for around $29 million. The home wasn't just another luxury property; it was the culmination of Keaton's lifelong passion for architecture, design, and restoration. Every wall, tile, and brick had her touch. Her choice to sell it shortly before her passing now feels like a meaningful chapter in her story — one that blended creativity, reflection, and grace.

Keaton purchased the home in 2017 and spent years transforming it into a warm, light-filled masterpiece. Inspired by her love of craftsmanship and her childhood fascination with brick homes, she designed it to feel timeless and grounded. She often said she admired the durability and character of brick — something that reflected her own spirit.

Her approach to design was hands-on and visionary. She didn't just decorate; she rebuilt. Every project she took on blended her artistic instincts with her sharp eye for storytelling. The home became a symbol of her creativity, serving as both sanctuary and expression.

Keaton even chronicled her design philosophy in her book “The House That Pinterest Built,” where she celebrated her love for curated spaces and bold, personal aesthetics. The Brentwood property perfectly embodied that vision — rustic yet refined, personal yet inviting. It was her dream home in every sense, filled with character and the comfort of a life well-lived.

As her health declined, Keaton began stepping back from public life. Those who lived nearby noticed her quiet absence from daily walks with her dog, Reggie, around the neighborhood. Listing her home seemed to mark a subtle farewell — a sign she was preparing for change with her usual sense of dignity and calm.

For a woman who built her legacy on authenticity, the sale wasn't about money or status. It was about simplicity and closure. In her final months, Keaton showed the same grace she carried throughout her career — whether starring in “Annie Hall,” “Father of the Bride,” or “Something's Gotta Give.” The decision to sell her dream home was more than a real estate move; it was a final act of reflection from a woman who always knew how to turn life into art.

	Hollywood is paying tribute to Diane Keaton.


	News of the beloved Oscar winner's death at the age of 79 was reported on Saturday, and many stars including her co-stars — who are friends and fans alike — are honoring her life and career on social media.


	“The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me,” Bette Midler, who co-starred with Keaton along with Goldie Hawn in The First Wives Club, wrote in a heartfelt tribute on Instagram. “She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!”


	Hawn also shared a tribute to Keaton. “You stole the hearts of the world and shared your genius with millions, making films that made us laugh and cry in ways only you could,” she wrote on Instagram. “I was blessed to make First Wives Club with you, our days starting with coffee in the makeup trailer, laughing and joking, right through to the very last day of filming. It was a roller coaster of love.”Steve Martin, who portrayed Keaton's husband in 1991's Father of the Bride and the sequel, paid tribute with a good-natured joke. In an Instagram post, he shared a clip from Interview Magazine, which has Martin Short asking Keaton, “Who's sexier, me or Steve Martin?” Her reply: “I mean, you're both idiots.” In a caption, Martin said, “it sums up our delightful relationship with Diane.”

	Kimberly Williams-Paisley, who played Keaton's daughter in Father of the Bride and its sequel, said that working with Keaton “will always be one of the highlights of my life.” Her Instagram post includes photos of the pair in the film. “You are one of a kind, and it was thrilling to be in your orbit for a time. Thank you for your kindness, your generosity, your talent, and above all, your laughter,” Williams-Paisley wrote.

	“They say don't meet your heros but I got to work with one of mine and even call her ‘mom' for a few months. An honor of a lifetime,” Moore wrote. “What an incandescent human Di is and was. I am so sad she's gone for all the reasons but also because it felt like she'd be here forever, dazzling us with her talent and charm (and her style, c'mon)!!! One of the very best to ever do it. All my love to her children and loved ones.”


Jane Fonda, who co-starred with Keaton in Book Club and its sequel Book Club: The Next Chapter, shared a photo of a smiling Keaton on Instagram. “It's hard to believe…or accept…that Diane has passed,” Fonda wrote. “She was always a spark of life and light, constantly giggling at her own foibles, being limitlessly creative…in her acting, her wardrobe, her books, her friends, her homes, her library, her world view. Unique is what she was. And, though she didn't know it or wouldn't admit it, man she was a fine actress!

Cynthia Nixon reflected on her “absolute idol” in a touching tribute. The pair co-starred in the 2014 film 5 Flights Up. “I loved her acting. I loved her vibe. I loved her everything,” Nixon wrote on Instagram, along with sharing a carousel of photos she took with Keaton and also one with their co-star Morgan Freeman. “Starting with when I was 12, I tried to dress like her. I wore my hair long.

	“I sported men's hats and vests and (even though my eyes were fine) I wore bookish glasses because I thought they made me look more like her,” Nixon continued. “A little more than a decade ago I got to be in a movie called Five Flights Up with her and it was like a dream come true. I was very shy around her, but I think she liked me and that meant everything to me.”

NEW YORK – Nicholas Sparks is telling me a ghost story.

It's not the conversation I thought I'd have with the bestselling author of romantic stories that make you swoon, not scared. But it's quiet enough to hear a pin drop in USA TODAY's New York studios as he relays the tale, elements of which he used in “Remain,” his new novel and upcoming movie adaptation developed with filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan.

“Remain” is a supernatural love story set on Cape Cod, following New York architect Tate Donovan (Jake Gyllenhaal will portray in the movie), who hopes to make a fresh start after a psychiatric facility stay. He's saddled with grief after losing his sister, who told him on her deathbed she could see spirits “still tethered to the living world.” That, plus meeting a beautiful woman (Phoebe Dynevor) at the bed and breakfast he's living at, challenges everything he thought he knew. The book publishes Oct. 14 from Random House, and the Shyamalan-led movie will release next year. 

Yes, Sparks believes in ghosts. His own story goes something like this: Sparks and his family were staying with their longtime family friends, Olympic athlete Billy Mills and his wife. Mills, who is Native American and has a substantial Indigenous artifacts collection in his home, had recently been gifted an eagle bone whistle, Sparks says. It wasn't too long before Sparks started noticing fluttering light from the corner of his eye. Then, at night, his wife woke up to the sound of drums. In the morning, Sparks approached the Mills jokingly and told them they had a ghost. 

“They're like, ‘Oh, you mean George?” Sparks says. “Then they start telling us other stories, flickering lights and doors that slam and weird smells in the house and unexplained cold breezes. Eventually they realized all these things came with the arrival of this whistle.” 

If you read “Remain,” you'll catch little bits of this. But even outside of his own experiences, Sparks has been a longtime scare junky. The first novel he wrote – which remains unpublished – was a horror novel. He loves Stephen King and his dad was a “big horror movie nut.” Working with Shyamalan was an opportunity to lean into that. 

It isn't Sparks' first time working on a manuscript and screenplay simultaneously – he had to write the screenplay for “The Last Song” before the novel because of Miley Cyrus' schedule, he says. What was different with “Remain” was that Shyamalan approached him with the original idea and the pair fleshed it out together. It filmed in Rhode Island, and Sparks visited the set to see the story come to life with Gyllenhaal as the protagonist. 

“Jake is a terrific, professional actor,” Sparks says. “He's there on set, he knows his lines, he knows what to do. He takes good direction from (Shyamalan), and at the same time brings his own element in, and it is really a lot of fun to watch it work.”

Having sold over 130 million copies worldwide, Sparks is known for so many beloved stories – “The Notebook,” “Dear John,” “A Walk to Remember” – that “Nicholas Sparks” has nearly become a subgenre of romance literature itself.

Over the decades, each love story still feels meaningful. But Sparks doesn't necessarily agree with the sentiment that asking an author to pick a favorite book is like asking them to pick a favorite kid: "They're like irritating kids. You gave me a lot of heck when I was working on you," Sparks says, faking a conversation with his bestsellers. "Now that I'm done with you, now that you're an adult, you're OK. But man, you were tough when you were growing up."

The movie adaptations also take on a life of their own. “The Notebook” musical is now touring after months of making Broadway goers weep into show-branded tissues in New York.

“There is a rumor that there are some sad elements to ‘The Notebook,'” Sparks says. “I'm neither confirming nor denying.” 

And while “Remain” may differ in that it will give you goosebumps, like with any Nicholas Sparks novel, you know you're in for a love story.

“I personally believe that all the great things in the world come from love,” Sparks says. “The things you do for your kids, things you do for your pets, your job, people, your siblings, your parents, your friends, and of course romantic love. What better topic? It's all the good stuff in the world. The world is filled with vehicles for the bad stuff − news, social media. OK, I accept that. I don't want to write it. I want to write where the good stuff comes from. And the beautiful part about that genre is, because it's an emotion that everyone experiences in some way in their lives, you're allowed to add elements of other genres into it to make it original.”

Self-proclaimed psychic Uri Geller has warned US President Donald Trump ahead of his trip to the Middle East, suggesting that his own security personnel could pose a danger.

The Israeli-British illusionist referenced the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who, Geller said, was killed by "one of his own" during a parade. The attack was reportedly carried out by a group of Egyptian soldiers led by Lieutenant Khalid Al-Islambuli, affiliated with the terrorist group Egyptian Islamic Jihad.

He urged Trump to "hand-pick bodyguards" and to be very vigilant during his visit.

"Listen to me, Donald Trump," he wrote on X, "Do NOT go to Sharm el-Sheikh, I have a TERRIBLE feeling there might be an attempt on your life! I am getting BAD signals. This is a GOLDEN opportunity for Islamic terrorists - you are the biggest prize in the WORLD for them! Remember Sadat was killed by one of his own security forces. No-one can be 100% protected, not even you. Double your security cordon and hand-pick your bodyguards. Do not move ANYWHERE without a ring of steel."

Listen to me @realDonaldTrump - do NOT go to Sharm el-Sheikh, I have a TERRIBLE feeling there might be an attempt on your life! I am getting BAD signals. This is a GOLDEN opportunity for Islamic terrorists - you are the biggest prize in the WORLD for them! Remember Sadat was… pic.twitter.com/YFEZC05KOE

In a video, Geller said, "I'm just very concerned. Very concerned...I say, don't go there. Don't go to Sharam and Shek. But if you do, make sure that you're protected, super protected, all around you. Don't let anyone close to you, and be careful. Be very careful, especially in Sharam and Shek."

Uri Geller's credibility as a psychic has long been questioned, and many of his previous predictions have failed to materialise. During his 1973 appearance on The Tonight Show, host Johnny Carson, a former magician, provided untouched props, and Geller failed to demonstrate any psychic powers, as per The NYT.

Famous for allegedly bending spoons with his mind, Geller's feats have been repeatedly explained by magicians and sceptics as sleight of hand. He has described himself as a "mystifier" and "showman."

His other predictions have also failed. In 2019, he claimed he could stop Brexit using telepathy, but the UK left the EU in 2021.

He has also incorrectly predicted football match outcomes and claimed in 2021 he could free the Ever Given from the Suez Canal, which was ultimately dislodged by tugboats.

Donald Trump will visit the Middle East starting with a brief stop in Israel on Monday, October 13. During his four-hour stay, he will address the Knesset and meet families of Israeli hostages recently released under a ceasefire agreement. Following Israel, Trump will travel to Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to co-chair a summit with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, aiming to finalise a peace agreement to end the war on Gaza with over 20 global leaders attending. He is expected to return to Washington, DC, on October 14 to present the Presidential Medal of Freedom to conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Holly Bishop | Sunday 12 October 2025 07:21 BST

Jesse Plemons has revealed how he researched the world of conspiracy theories for his role as Teddy in Bugonia. 

Speaking on the red carpet at the London Film Festival on Friday (10 October), the actor, who plays a conspiracist beekeeper who kidnaps Emma Stone's character as he believes she is an alien trying to take down the world, said it doesn't take “too much digging” and that there is a “lot right at your fingertips”.

He also shared that one of his best friends is an “alien aficionado who knows every theory out there”, so they became his “guide”.

Plemons said his research helped his mind work in a “completely different way” and allowed him to view the characters in the film in a more sympathetic light. “The reality is that people are lured into these places,” he said.

The 2025 Women's Ironman World Championship turned from a test of endurance into a battle of attrition that ultimately went to rookie Solveig Løvseth of Norway – competing for the first time in Kailua-Kona and ending up the last woman standing at the end of a brutal day, which claimed more than one prominent victim.

Løvseth captured the title in her first-ever attempt, defeating Kat Matthews of Great Britain by just 35 seconds in the third-closest world championship finish in the sport's history – men or women.

“It still feels weird,” Løvseth said during the post-race press conference, noting that she hadn't stopped smiling since crossing the finish line roughly three hours before.

But the story of the day was less about the 8:28:27 time Løvseth posted (55:40 swim, 4:31:54 bike, 2:55:47 run splits), and more about her ability to cross the finish line at all. That was because two competitors who were swimming, cycling and running ahead of her for most of the day succumbed to the rigorous conditions on Hawai‘i Island and failed to complete the full course. 

Lucy Charles-Barclay of Great Britain, the 2023 champion, built a 90-second lead after the ocean leg and held a first-place margin of some type for much of the bike ride up and back down the Kohala Coast. However, an unintentional littering infraction cost her a one-minute penalty, during which American Taylor Knibb grabbed the advantage. 

Charles-Barclay clawed through the remainder of the ride and the early portion of the marathon to catch up to Knibb and eventually recapture the lead. But signs of potential overexertion began to show roughly halfway through the run, as Charles-Barclay took to walking through multiple aid stations and appeared unstable on her feet. A little more than halfway through the marathon, her husband met her on the course and convinced her to resign from the competition. 

At that point, Knibb had retaken first place and built a lead of over two minutes. But with approximately two miles to go, she also slowed down, eventually stopped and took a seat on the asphalt — her day over, as she was unable to continue. 

“I actually saw both of them stopping in front of me, with Lucy first. And obviously, it's heartbreaking to see someone collapse that way,” Løvseth said. “When I also saw Taylor stop running in front of me, I was just like, ‘What is going on now? Is it me that just, like, has some powers now?'”

“It was like not the way I wanted to overtake people,” she continued. “At the same time, I was just like, ‘I'm in the lead now.'”

But Løvseth's advantage wasn't safe, despite how long she spent running alone on the marathon course — no one close on her heels and the island claiming the two competitors in front of her one by one. 

And as the race neared its end, Matthews began to close the gap. 

“It was maybe at sort of six or seven [kilometers], [my race adviser] was like, ‘You're gonna finish about 90 seconds behind Solveig, if you could try a bit harder,'” Matthews said during the press conference to a chorus of laughs. 

Matthews ended up clocking the fastest marathon split in the history of the Kailua-Kona track, logging a time of 2:47:23 over the 26.2-mile gallop. And she found an even stronger pace as the finish line approached, and victory appeared potentially within reach.

“The last two-kilometer pace probably suggested I had more to give,” Matthews said, “but I definitely feel that was my best triathlon performance I could give today.”

Løvseth admitted after the race that if there were but a few more kilometers to run, Matthews likely would have caught her. Instead, Matthews finished in second place at an Ironman World Championship for the third time in her storied career. 

Given how close Matthews came to catching Løvseth, and how the elements brought down Charles-Barclay and Knibb in front of the eventual winner, the 2025 Women's Ironman World Champion could sum up the day with only one word: “supernatural.”

Final results/top five:

1. Solveig Løvseth (Norway) / 8:28:27

2. Kat Matthews (Great Britain) / 8:29:02

3. Laura Philipp (Germany) / 8:37:28

4. Hannah Berry (New Zealand) / 8:46:25

5. Lisa Perterer (Austria) / 8:48:08
