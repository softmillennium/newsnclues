AMD's RDNA 4 lineup of GPUs has been a heaven-sent for gamers seeking premium performance without breaking the bank, well, relatively. Just like Nvidia, even the Red Team's offerings have been plagued with stock issues, forcing people to buy even basic models at over MSRP. Fortunately, sales often alleviate such dilemmas, and we've hunted down an amazing deal for you today — Sapphire's top-tier RX 9070 XT can be yours for just $729, the cheapest it's ever been. If you don't insist on Nvidia's particular feature-set, AMD's RDNA 4 lineup is perhaps the best thing that happened to the GPU market. Now, arguably its best variant is available for a record-low. Sapphire originally priced the Nitro+ at $729, but it never actually sold at that rate; just three months ago, it hit its lowest price ever of $769, so this course correction has long been due. As for the GPU itself, it doesn't really need a sales pitch. It performs almost identically to the RTX 5070 Ti overall while costing a lot less, and even matches the RTX 4070 Ti in ray tracing performance. Sapphire has included a magnetic backplate, too, which is made out of metal, so it feels really high-quality, and there's an RGB header present on-board as well for lighting sync. In our review, we praised the card for its superior value proposition, but knocked a few points for Nvidia's comparatively stronger driver suite. If creature comforts like RTX HDR, multi-frame gen and Nvidia Broadcast don't really matter to you, AMD's offering is a clear winner, especially now that power consumption for multi-monitor setups has been fixed, and the card in general has a modest TDP of 330W. We haven't even mentioned FSR 4, which has worked extensively to close the gap with DLSS and only looks to get better with Redstone.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. China has responded to President Donald Trump's threats of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, plus a ban on critical software, because of its expanded rare-earth export controls. The current trade war with China kicked off in April of this year, when Trump pushed tariffs on all the U.S.'s trade partners, including a 54% total tariff on Chinese goods. It responded to this with counter-tariffs of its own, plus restrictions on some rare-earth exports that threaten global chipmaking supply chains. Things have seemingly settled down in the past months as both parties negotiated over trade, but China's recent expansion of rare-earth controls threatens advanced semiconductors up to 14nm, which were first released in 2014. Because of this, it can potentially strangle the global chip-making supply chain, especially as many companies that make chips are based in the U.S. or in countries that are closely aligned with it. However, you can also see that it's using this as a bargaining chip, as Beijing has previously shown in July 2025, when it eased some of the restrictions in exchange for Washington lifting the export ban on EDA software. Trump said on his social media platform that he will put the tariff into effect on November 1, meaning the U.S. and China still have some time to talk things through. China likely enacted the expansion of its rare-earth export controls to get something out of the U.S. in negotiations, but we will only know this if it lifts or reduces restrictions after getting a concession from the White House.

There may be few options that aren't updateable over the air, and those options don't meet their other criteria -- if they even get that deep into considering it, which they probably don't, they just aren't really thinking about it. you don't have the option of buying your perfect fantasy car. I'd like to buy a car with manual mechanical controls instead of touch screen controls, but there aren't that many options for that either, and they may not meet my other needs.

Most people push button, aim steering wheel, and voila. One answer to this I would presume is: there are no other new cars for sale without this flaw.Why there aren't regulations or forced options in the market without these functions (as well as with physical control knobs instead of touch surfaces) is a good question too. There is huge demand for cars without most of this nonsense, yet I don't see that demand being met.I doubt anyone wants a car whose infotainment system can be improperly updated to cause catastrophic power and engine failure while driving, if given this information and a choice to avoid it.

Jeep has already confirmed they've pushed out a fix. I've had some pretty nasty brickings of devices, like overwriting the bootloader, that I've been able to recover from by getting it into some barely documented system on chip mode with a special cable, booting a new bootloader into RAM via the cable, and reflashing that way. One could go to the extreme and say any flash storage chip where all software bits are directly writable by a factory tool is technically unbrickable. But the customers won't see it that way. Being strict about the word "bricked" and limiting it to the truly unrecoverable situations just makes it nigh-on useless.Very few things can make a modern system truly unrecoverable if one is willing to pour unreasonable resources into them. There's no practical difference between these two except that one depends on the surrounding context.

Also, adding features on its own is great, but obviously stuff like what happened here can't be allowed to happen, and those Samsung or LG smart fridges that became advertising boards is obviously also not acceptable...Easy to call the bullshit out, hard to actually define the responsibilities of a manufacturer in a law. I live in a city so I don't need a car, but if I had to buy one, "it should not have a network interface" would be my most important requirement. Whereas the problem is that cars have had computers for a long time (eg ECU, ABS, entertainment), then those started getting connected together locally via CAN, then finally they added an Internet connection for surveillance and control. So the centralizing proprietary software tentacles go deep into the car in a way that's not easy to remove or replace.There is the black box approach of disabling network interfaces, but I could even see that going away - cannot contact network -> car cannot be sure that warranty recalls have been done in a timely fashion -> disable itself after a month until you "take it to a dealer" (or reconnect the cell backhaul).

"we will assist" - a guarantee so lukewarm, you could put it in an icebox to keep your food fresh for a week. Consumers tend to heavily underestimate the point in time from which cars started absolutely relying on modern electronics. I drove my 2011 model until earlier this year without any major problems. Unless vehicle tracking is intended as something other than a safety feature? Now when there is an update they either change the UI (for certain people to remain relevant), or they add more ads.

My suspicion is that this was either a CAN saturation issue (ie - infotainment started sending a high priority message which could reach powertrain CAN) or a state management issue (ie - infotainment sent a “put modules to sleep” or “wake modules” message which was not handled correctly and caused one or more modules to transition to an invalid state for driving). What I really think: my car shouldn't have any bullshit "modes" to select from. Tune it once at the factory to some reasonable compromise, and perhaps make certain settings writable through the OBD port, and that will be it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The time commitment may be too much for some people, but the end result is normally more compelling since you know what went into it and what may inevitably be upgraded. You can already tell by the photo above there's a big reason you might opt for the Maingear Apex Rush before another PC. The last Maingear desktop I reviewed, the MG-1, was a conscientiously built, customizable PC that looked too much like something I could have pieced together, at least judging from the exterior. Inside, the tower was far better than that thanks to its screw-in GPU bracket and cable management that would leave even the most demanding IT professionals nodding in approval. It was the kind of slapdash DIY project anybody building their own PC could have easily accomplished. You could spend way less just by building a PC yourself, but I doubt it would be nearly as pretty and well-put together as a Maingear Apex Rush When Maingear first announced its Rush PCs at CES 2025, the company's CEO, Wallace Santos, told Gizmodo they attempted to create a desktop that truly looked unique, hence the special “Artist Series” designs that push a unique case while offering an internal design with everything gamers have come to expect. That's $1,000 more than the previous generation MG-1 which contained a high-end Intel 14th-gen CPU and an Nvidia RTX 4080 Super. If I try and create a very similar PC using ordered parts, I can build something for closer to $2,600, and that's without seeking discounts. At that price, the Apex Rush should be the last PC—for gaming or not—you'd buy for a long, long while. The MSI Pro B850-P motherboard has enough RAM and PCI-E slots to make upgrading easy. But then, you can find many other, far cheaper desktops with similar components for under $3,000, like a specced-out version of the Cyberpower PC Gamer Supreme. Will the beauty of your case last that long? The Grand Theft Auto: Vice City vibes are almost enough to get me in the gaming mood by themselves. There are three different artworks to chose from, including a cyberpunk-esque “Machina” version and a pan-Asian “Good Fortune” edition, though I found the “Night Drive” version I got to review fit the internal glow of the RGB fans, RGB RAM sticks, and RGB liquid cooling CPU unit much even better. Its also bears a giant “Maingear” logo that's more distracting than fun. Maingear is so confident about its build quality, it ships its units without foam inserts inside the case itself. The Apex Rush is a heavy unit, as you may expect from a mid-sized desktop tower full of high-end PCs. It's probably a good thing you're not dragging the unit from room to room, since the artwork painted on the glass is liable to get chewed up if you graze it during transit. Still, you're better off treating the Apex Rush with more care than your normal black aluminum towers. Too many PC towers stick their front ports on top of the unit. This not only looks ugly with the tumors of several peripheral dongles sticking out, it means you need to plug wired connections up and over the PC if, for instance, you need to connect a headset or mouse. You'll have access to just one USB-C, two USB-A, and a headphone jack. As for the rear, there's a similar lack of USB-C, something I appreciated about Alienware's utterly massive Area-51 desktop tower. There's an HDMI port, four USB-A 2.0 ports, plus the two USB-C 10G sockets. Inside, the Apex Rush's motherboard isn't capped with any covers to make the components look “clean.” I'm in the camp that would rather a PC look like a PC. Maingear's versions look more elegant than other PCs I've used thanks to their expert eye with component selection and cable management. Behind a metal panel set on a hinge, you'll find all the wires are bundled up with velcro strips that make it easy to find the right component connected to the power supply. My review case came with the 850W MSI MAG A850GL, which is enough juice for the RTX 5080 GPU but is barely enough wattage if you ever wanted to plug in an RTX 5090. It's not an overly large unit that will offer more upgrade paths, but there is one 16 PIN PCIe connection for the Nvidia GPU and enough connection options if you ever want to turn to an AMD in some apocalyptic future where the RTX 5080 doesn't cut it anymore. If Alienware's absolutely ginormous Area-51 desktop PC was all about girth while offering expected performance, the Apex Rush pre-built lineup offers a more subtle beauty without the promise of getting the most out of every possible game. AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D is considered one of the top-end CPUs for a reason. In benchmarks against an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, AMD's chip is simply better for gaming purposes. Intel's Arrow Lake CPUs got a bad rap on release with poor performance even compared to the top-end 14th-gen consumer chips. AMD's X3D chips use a special layered cache for extended memory within the CPU. This mainly benefits gaming scenarios, and it's why gamers seek out these chips first and foremost while Intel's Arrow Lake fell by the wayside. It's been long enough since the RTX 50-series launch that Nvidia's drivers have cleared the way to eke a few more frames from most games compared to months before. I first tested the RTX 5080 Founders Edition on an Origin PC Neuron 3500X build, and after many moons I can say the platform is relatively bug-free and stable enough to enjoy your games without the hassle of reinstalling drivers or messing with your BIOS. With AMD's top gaming CPU, I can blow past older systems in 3DMark Speedway tests by a little more than 200 points. In 3DMark Steel Nomad, the difference is closer to 500 points. Gaming scenarios can look like I can get around five more average frames in Cyberpunk 2077 benchmarks running with ray tracing on and DLSS balanced settings on Maingear's build than I could on the Neuron 3500X's Core Ultra 9 285K with the same GPU. CPU-heavy games like Total War: Warhammer III benefit even more. You really can't expect the world from a PC like this, despite its price. If you have any hope of topping out games without any AI upscaling like Nvidia's deep learning super sampling (DLSS), you'll need to opt for a RTX 5090 and spend even more. The premium price on top of an already expensive PC is hard to swallow. Again, building a PC yourself can be less expensive and more fun.

For the first time, scientists have successfully built a fully functional memory chip using two-dimensional materials and integrated it directly onto a conventional silicon die — a milestone that could change how future semiconductors are made. The research, led by Chunsen Liu and colleagues at Fudan University in Shanghai, was published on October 9 in the journal Nature. The research may mark a turning point for 2D electronics, which have long promised atomic-scale performance and efficiency but struggled to move beyond lab demonstrations. The result is a hybrid chip that combines a 2D NOR flash memory array with a standard CMOS controller, effectively bridging the gap between experimental nanomaterials and industry-standard fabrication. The Fudan team reports a 94.34% yield from full-chip testing — a figure that rivals commercial silicon production — and operational speeds up to five megahertz. Each bit consumes just 0.644 picojoules, far below the energy draw of today's silicon flash cells. Silicon chips, even after polishing, have uneven terrain at the nanometer scale that can tear or stress atomic-thin layers. This design enables instruction-driven operations, 32-bit parallelism, and random access, or, in other words, a full-featured memory chip. If scaled, such hybrid architectures could drastically reduce power use and increase density in next-generation processors and AI processors, effectively continuing Moore's Law at the atomic limit.

With nearly 530 reviews averaging 4.9 stars, this thing delivers on its promise of keeping your devices alive when you need them most. Put another way, an iPhone 17 has about a 3,692mAh battery so this power bank can recharge your phone 15 times completely before requiring a recharge itself. For an iPad with a standard 8,000mAh battery, you'll get 7 full recharging cycles. This type of capacity changes the way you think about battery panic since you can go days without concern about getting to an outlet. The 22.5W Power Delivery fast charging feature means that you're not sitting around indefinitely to recharge your devices. This power is capable of bringing an iPhone up to 50% from dead in about 30 minutes and this really does make a difference if you need a fast power top up just prior to leaving. The new charging technology supplies stable output at all times across all attached devices, avoiding the power drops and slowdowns that are common on lower-quality power banks. This is more than we'd have you think it matters because that means you, your spouse, and your child can each charge phones during a long road trip at the same time. Smart current control recognizes what each device requires and supplies the perfect charging speed, so your phone enjoys fast charging and your earbuds a soft trickle that preserves their tiny batteries. The digital LED display displays actual battery percentage instead of cryptic indicator lights, so you can see at a glance just how much power is available. This gives you that extra information needed to prioritize charging and make choices about whether or not to recharge the power bank itself. Overvoltage, short circuits, overheating, and overcurrent are prevented by the power bank's self-protections, something that is critical when there is this amount of stored power involved. For $34 down from $159, days-of-backup power are yours for less than the cost of dinner, and that shoots this one into that mythical realm of bargains where the discount can't possibly be true.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beijing's latest export controls skip silicon but tighten pressure on niche metals essential to PC hardware. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs says the island's chip sector will see “no significant impact” from China's newly expanded rare-earth export controls, in comments first reported by Reuters on October 12. Those reassuring words come just days after Beijing added a fresh batch of heavy rare earths to its licensing regime — including holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium — and widened the scope to cover associated materials and processing tech. Officials in Taipei were quick to note that these specific metals aren't used by TSMC in wafer production, and that Taiwan already sources most of its rare-earth derivatives from allies in Europe, Japan, and the United States. But while fabs like TSMC may not rely on holmium or thulium, rare-earth elements remain deeply embedded in the wider tech stack, particularly in high-performance magnets. Beijing's Ministry of Commerce said the controls are designed to safeguard national security and interests, but the language mirrors past moves aimed at weaponizing materials dominance in retaliation for U.S. export restrictions. Unlike previous rounds of restrictions that focused on neodymium and dysprosium, this wave targets elements with niche but strategic uses. Europium, for instance, is still used in some high-efficiency display phosphors. Others, like ytterbium, play a role in specialty lasers and cooling systems. That includes AI chips, quantum tech, and advanced defense hardware. Hard drives, for example, depend on voice-coil actuators and spindle motors built around high-performance magnets. Those magnets often rely on heavy rare-earth dopants to retain coercivity at elevated temperatures. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. So, while there's no immediate sign that fabs in Taiwan will suffer under this specific round of Chinese export controls, China doesn't need to hit chipmakers directly to shake up supply chains. As licensing delays accumulate and enforcement expands, friction will continue to build downstream.

This makes Cupertino the most generous company that offers an award for unearthing vulnerabilities, and it's even offering top-up bonuses that can see security experts earning more than $5 million for uncovering exploits. It even claimed that multiple individuals have received $500,000 in rewards. Beyond that, there's also a bonus system for those who can break Apple's Lockdown Mode secure environment and vulnerabilities in its beta software, bringing the potential payout to over $5 million. There are also smaller awards, like $1 million for those who can crack broad iCloud security and those who can create a wireless proximity attack using radio, up to $300,000 to anyone who develops a one-click WebKit sandbox escape mechanism, and $100,000 to those who can bypass Gatekeeper on macOS. This isn't the only bug bounty program anyone can participate in. Microsoft's maximum award at the moment is $250,000, and it has even lowered its age limit to 13 because of this high school junior who filed over 20 security vulnerability reports last summer. And last, but not least, Google began its Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) in 2010. The search giant's rewards vary from a few hundred dollars to a million dollars for the most serious vulnerabilities on its Titan M security chip. These awards can make finding bugs a lucrative field, especially for talented security researchers. And while it might seem like an expensive proposition for companies, it's far cheaper for them to pay out these bounties instead of having a bad actor discover it and disseminate it under their noses, resulting in reputational and financial damages for the corporation. Moreover, software mistakes can potentially cost lives, as state actors and other third parties are increasingly using sophisticated means to target specific personalities.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. The S-Works Levo 4 is so sophisticated that it would take the number of words in War and Peace (587,287) to describe each component and how they all work together in perfect harmony to create a bike that rides like a silky magic carpet on steroids. From the proprietary new Specialized 3.1 motor with 720 watts and metal gears that crank out 111 newton-meters of torque to the carbon frame with adjustable geometry and a companion app that can precision-tune the ride, there is no detail that Specialized overlooked on its second-most expensive Levo 4. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. My interest in the electric Turbo Levo 4, which debuted a decade after its original iteration and seven years after I reviewed the Turbo Levo Comp, piqued at a party in May where I had a conversation with a friend who had been sideswiped by a car while road cycling many years ago. The accident left Greg with such debilitating back pain that riding a bike was barely possible, until he recently bought a new Levo 4. The electric mountain bike's substantial cushioning; its powerful, intuitive motor; and lightweight and comfortable carbon frame was so much easier and less painful to ride that it allowed him to keep up with his friends again, leaving him as giddy as a kid and giving him a second chance at a sport he loved. “You are not going to believe this bike,” he told me. It feels like an extension of your own body.” A step above Greg's bike and a step below the most expensive LTD, the S-Works Turbo Levo 4 leaves nothing to be desired. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The bike comes with a front Fox Float 38 fork that has 160 mm of travel, and the rear fork has 150 mm of travel. It has beefy SRAM Maven Ultimate four-piston caliper front and rear brakes, which skillfully help you stop (a tricky feat with the bike's increased power), and the SRAM XX Eagle Transmission derailleur combined with easy-to-toggle SRAM AXS POD Ultimate Shift levers made for seamless shifting. The 840-watt-hour integrated battery can be augmented with a 280-watt-hour range extender that fits into the water bottle cage, for a total ride time of up to five hours, depending on the mode. I rode it home, climbing the steep city streets to a singletrack traverse that follows Duluth's ridgeline. It was Monday afternoon, and I had the trail to myself until I crept up so stealthily on a mountain biker that he was surprised to see me at the top of an exposed rocky climb overlooking the city. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The next ride was on singletrack from my house to Spirit Mountain, Duluth's downhill lift-accessed park with 24 trails ranging from easy to expert. Lacking a full-face helmet and the landing skills to tackle double-black runs like the one called Calculated Risk, I instead rode Candyland. The machine-built flow trail has some nice high, snaky berms where the bike's chunky tires kept me upright and stable. I had so much fun tooling around in the bike park, riding up steep inclines like The Puker to get one last flowy downhill ride in, that I had to hurry home for dinner in the dusk. On the way home, I chickened out while riding a chunky, steep, and extended rock bridge in Trail mode and experienced the only moment of fear in my entire 50-plus miles of testing thus far—I had already committed to forward momentum but chickened out at the last second, so the bike surged forward while I bailed sideways into the bushes. It was more user lack of confidence than bike glitch, but also a good reminder of two things: how powerful the bike is and how it's only as competent as its rider. At home, I checked the Specialized app and found that I had climbed 3,451 feet over 22 miles in about two hours, primarily in the bike's Auto mode. I still had 44 percent battery power and energy in my legs. The bike's high-performance torque sensors can instantly “feel” the rider's output and amplify it, while maintaining control, traction, and precision at higher speeds. It's an easy process designed for mountain bikers who ride along city streets to the trails. But it also raises a question: What ripper is going to want to toggle back down to a Class I bike—the max limit on most trails throughout the US—unless the speed police are in hot pursuit? By allowing this work-around into a higher speed-limit category, Specialized puts the onus on the rider to follow the rules, which opens a Pandora's box—especially on trails inhabited by mostly nonmotorized mountain bikers where safety is a greater concern. Other than the ethical conundrum, my one small beef with the S-Works Turbo Levo 4 is that it's so much fun that it suspends time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If there was ever a time to upgrade your floor cleaning game, it's now, and Dreame's superstar robot vacuum and mop combo, the X50 Ultra (Complete), is 29% off at Amazon. Dreame's awesome Prime Day sale is still in effect, with enormous price breaks on their finest cleaning machines for your floors and your air. One of the new tech features that dropped jaws at CES 2025 was Dreame's ProLeap System, which gives the X50 Ultra (Complete) the ability to actually scale steps and thresholds up to 2.36 inches in height. If you know the sound of a robot vacuum that's hung up on a threshold between rooms, you know it means you need to get up and give it an assist. The Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete) eliminates that frustrating situation, and also eliminates previously unreachable dirt that hides in corners with its MopExtend RoboSwing tech that reaches over an inch and a half into those elusive spots. Dirty corners and threshold obstacles aren't the only common robot vacuum shortcomings solved by the Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete). The innovative HyperStream Detangling Duo Brush eradicates those hair tangles that bring the rollers of lesser robot vacs to a complete standstill. It allows the X50 Ultra (Complete) to pick up a full 100% of large particles and hair, with no tangles snarling the rollers. VersaLift Navigation with advanced LiDAR and AI continuously map its path in real time to avoid obstacles, and even determining which pieces of furniture it can successfully go under for optimal cleaning without getting stuck or, worse, lost. The Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete) is better at taking care of itself than any robot floor cleaner we've seen, whether it's self-emptying dirt in its Intelligent PowerDock, or using the AceClean DryBoard system that hits the mop pads with 20 streams of hot, cleansing water, and then dries them with hot air to prevent those bad, damp smells. The mop is clean and ready to go again without any work on your part. The X50 Ultra (Complete) also toggles seamlessly between hard floors and carpets, with five tailored modes that protect your carpets from the mop, boost the suction for thicker carpets, and more. It gets your hard floors and carpets ultra clean, does a complete job including hard-to-reach corners and beneath some furniture items, and completely takes the drudgery of vacuuming and even more taxing mopping jobs out of your hands — which sounds like a dream scenario to us, but it's very real. The 29% off deal at Amazon wipes $500 from the price of the Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete), making it a $1,200 investment in years of effortlessly clean floors and hundreds of hours back that you previously spent cleaning.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Music, movies, meal boxes, and more are no longer things you buy once. Gaming is no exception, and while every major player in the sector has some form of sub for players—from PlayStation Plus and Nintendo Switch Online for consoles to Apple Arcade on phones—none of them offered quite as much for a modest monthly fee as Xbox Game Pass. Depending on the subscription tier, the service gave players access to a significant library of titles and was available on Xbox consoles, PC, or via cloud gaming. While most of its competitors focused on back-catalog titles for their gaming subscriptions, Game Pass stood apart by including major first-party titles on their day of release for subscribers to its Ultimate tier. Microsoft long claimed it was “the best deal in gaming,” and with new releases costing upwards of $70 per title versus a $19.99 monthly price tag on Game Pass Ultimate, it was hard to argue. Recent changes to the service, however—including some hefty price rises—have upset users in a big way, sending so many people rushing to cancel their subscriptions that the membership site crashed. On October 1, Microsoft revamped the entire structure of Game Pass. Going forward, Core is replaced with Essential, and Standard is replaced with Premium, while Ultimate retains its name. All tiers are now accessible on PC, although a dedicated PC-only plan remains available. While Essential keeps the almost totemic $9.99-per-month pricing of Core, Premium jumps to $14.99 from Standard's $11.99 (a 25 percent increase), and the PC-only offering goes from $11.99 to $16.49 (a 38 percent increase). It's Game Pass Ultimate that's proven the most contentious, leaping from $19.99 to $29.99. Price increases on subscription services routinely boil the frog and creep up in price slowly—just look at what you used to pay for Netflix—but a massive 50 percent spike overnight, the equivalent of $120 more a year, has caught many off guard. It doesn't help that it follows two price hikes on Xbox consoles themselves in the span of less than a year, at least in the US. The Game Pass price increases aren't without their benefits, as an attempt to justify the rises in cost. Cloud gaming is now available on all tiers, after previously being restricted it to Ultimate, while the offerings at each level have been rethought. Core used to be the basic entry-level option, mostly serving as a maintenance fee to allow online multiplayer features, but also throwing in a minimal library of 25 rotating titles in the Game Pass library. The new Essential tier that replaces it ups that library to “50+ games playable on both console and PC,” along with “in-game benefits in some of the biggest games like League of Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Overwatch 2” (although what those benefits are is unspecified and presumably subject to change). Premium, replacing Standard, enjoys a larger library still, with Microsoft promising “200+ games” for subscribers, up from around 50. Well, newish—Premium subscribers will now get access to “new Xbox-published games within a year of their launch,” although this excludes Call of Duty titles. Alongside a 400-plus game library, it remains the only tier with day one availability for new releases. Here, Microsoft promises subscribers will get “75+ day-one games a year,” and that does include Call of Duty. It also now includes access to the Ubisoft+ Classics and EA Play catalogs, which were previously separate subscriptions, and from November 18, adds access to Fortnite Crew, providing in-game bonuses to players of Epic's enduringly popular game-slash-platform. Ultimate also offers cloud gaming at higher quality than the lower tiers, up to 1440p resolution, with prioritized access and shorter load times. That might take some of the sting out of the price increases, although many users are also complaining that the Rewards scheme as a whole has been “nerfed” and offers less return for their time. As reported by The Verge, subscribers in some countries have received emails informing them that they won't see their fees changing so long as they maintain their subscription. Microsoft emailed subscribers in unaffected countries, saying, “You may have heard about changes to the price of Xbox Game Pass Subscriptions. At this time, these increases will only affect new purchases and will not affect your current subscription for the market in which you reside, as long as you are on an auto-recurring plan. There doesn't seem to be a common link between the countries exempted—users from EU countries such as Poland, Germany, and Ireland have reported getting the emails saying they won't pay more, leading to some speculation it was down to better consumer protections across the European Union, but so have others in India and South Korea. Either way, if you're an existing Game Pass subscriber in these territories and you're happy with the service, it's probably worth letting your sub roll on for now. If you are getting hit—and players in the US and UK definitely are—then it's a great time to reevaluate the tier you're subscribed to, particularly if your gaming habits have changed since you last looked into it. If you are keen to play the latest and greatest games as soon as they arrive, Ultimate does remain a great deal. If you see yourself playing more than five new releases a year at launch, then even $30 per month represents a saving, and that's before you get to the other benefits of the package. That 50 percent hike may feel like a bitter pill to swallow, but if you're craving the latest AAA Xbox titles month after month, the pricey new Ultimate tier still represents a saving, even at $360 per year. For example, if you're a keen Fortnite player, getting Fortnite Crew bundled into Ultimate may sound like a good deal, but if you don't play much else outside of that game, you won't be getting much bang for your buck. The big risk for Microsoft is that the price hikes for Xbox consoles and Game Pass alike drive players elsewhere. Against a backdrop of sluggish hardware sales, rising prices on that hardware, and its decision to bring more of its first-party exclusive titles to rival platforms—Forza Horizon 5, Gears of War: Reloaded, and Sea of Thieves are among the previous Xbox exclusives now available on PS5—the Game Pass price spike could see users abandon Xbox as a native platform entirely. Sure, the library offered by PlayStation Plus isn't as vast as Game Pass, but that's almost $250 less than the Xbox equivalent ($1,160 for the 2-TB Xbox Series X and Game Pass Ultimate). The lack of availability for day-one titles on PS Plus is the big difference in value, but that saving goes a long way to buying a few games outright. The big downside to this option is that if you're heavily invested in Xbox as a platform, then your purchases and progress won't transfer. Already spent hundreds of hours racing around Mexico in Forza Horizon 5? Subscriptions are an inversion of the old “teach a man to fish” idiom—sell someone a game and they pay once; sell someone a subscription to the game and they pay forever. There's a cost calculation here, though, especially for new release titles, but this option's best for those who see themselves buying five or fewer new-release games per year. Accounting for an average launch price of $70 per title (and not counting deluxe editions, season passes, or other added DLC), that's a $10 saving on a year of Game Pass Ultimate. Buying your games may seem pricier on a case-by-case basis, but you actually own them—or at least an ostensibly perpetual license to them, if bought digitally. Your access doesn't disappear when you stop subscribing, and you can wait for sales to pick up some keepers for cheap. Physical media purchases are best of all but not without their own hurdles. If a title is ever removed from servers, or those servers are turned off, you won't be able to play it in future—even if you still have the disc. There's definitely still value to be found in Xbox Game Pass, but if you're not a hardcore user of all its features at the highest tier, it just became that bit harder to find.
