In Germany many things go over FAX or mail, totally unencrypted… In Germany many things go over FAX or mail, totally unencrypted… Another massive problem is if Meta has a fit with your organization, they can ban you from using WhatsApp for Business.

After putting it into park and pressing the brake and start button it started back up and I could drive it normally for a little bit, but it happened two more times on my 1.5 mi drive home.If that happened on the highway I could easily see people being killed.

"Steer by wire" means there is nothing but copper signal wires between your steering wheel and the front wheels. Your steering wheel is essentially a video game controller.This has nothing to do with the car's mode of propulsion though, and both EVs and ICE cars can have steer by wire controls. So far, it's only the cybertruck that has this paradigm, all other EV's all have normal power steering.For normal power steering systems there are two types: hydraulic and electric. Both types have a solid steel shaft between your steering wheel and the front wheels. Hydraulic is being phased out for electric in both EVs and ICE vehicles.

I would be worried about getting rear-ended and / or causing a pile-up. I guess you could argue that it wasn't a reasonably well constructed car. It's amazing how much more reliable cars have gotten. You used to be always on the alert for some critical function to fail spontaneously, and also listening for warning signs. In general, this wasn't especially hazardous, since I rarely needed to move the wheel very far while moving at very low speed in a place where other cars could be a hazard. So can someone who owns a modern car please help me understand why you would buy a car that has the mere capability to be remotely shut off?A vehicle is a personal safety device, that allows for independent travel away from bad things and towards safe things. That is one of the most critical aspects of a vehicle.Assuming that one of the most critical times you might need a vehicle is fleeing oppression, having a remote switch off as a possible vector to impede your escape is an existential threat and basically makes one of the core reasons to have a vehicle moot.My assumption is that most people are not thinking about their vehicle as one of the most critical tools for freedom.Having traveled the world and lived in war zones, vehicles are life savers and it's insane to me that anyone would allow a possibility for someone else, specifically corporations and governments with major power levers, to even have the ability to stop that remotely.

In practice, getting t-boned at an intersection where I have the right of way is a much greater risk to me than my car getting shut off, so it makes sense to optimize for safety in the former case.

These cars are not being intentionally shut down remotely. Instead, a software update for some computerized components of the car was pushed down to the cars and installed with the owners permissions, but that update apparently has severe bugs that should have been caught by QA. Assuming that you even have an option to opt out.And that's exactly why these cars can never be trusted under any circumstances, ever.

Or, other parodies, "Just say MAYBE LATER to drugs" Most people have a variety of things they are looking for in a car they want to purchase, and other factors are more important to them than this one, which they figure probably won't happen anyway. There may be few options that aren't updateable over the air, and those options don't meet their other criteria -- if they even get that deep into considering it, which they probably don't, they just aren't really thinking about it. you don't have the option of buying your perfect fantasy car. I'd like to buy a car with manual mechanical controls instead of touch screen controls, but there aren't that many options for that either, and they may not meet my other needs. Because afaik, all the modern cars have this as a 'feature', but there's lots of other nice features they have.The best of both worlds right now is an earlier modern car where the 2g/3g modem can no longer connect to the outside world. Even better if you can pull the modem, but they're usually up behind a lot of trim. Even better if you can pull the modem, but they're usually up behind a lot of trim. Most people push button, aim steering wheel, and voila. One answer to this I would presume is: there are no other new cars for sale without this flaw.Why there aren't regulations or forced options in the market without these functions (as well as with physical control knobs instead of touch surfaces) is a good question too. There is huge demand for cars without most of this nonsense, yet I don't see that demand being met.I doubt anyone wants a car whose infotainment system can be improperly updated to cause catastrophic power and engine failure while driving, if given this information and a choice to avoid it.

Jeep has already confirmed they've pushed out a fix. I've had some pretty nasty brickings of devices, like overwriting the bootloader, that I've been able to recover from by getting it into some barely documented system on chip mode with a special cable, booting a new bootloader into RAM via the cable, and reflashing that way. One could go to the extreme and say any flash storage chip where all software bits are directly writable by a factory tool is technically unbrickable. But the customers won't see it that way. Being strict about the word "bricked" and limiting it to the truly unrecoverable situations just makes it nigh-on useless.Very few things can make a modern system truly unrecoverable if one is willing to pour unreasonable resources into them. There's no practical difference between these two except that one depends on the surrounding context.

Basically me when talking about cars I'll buy.

Also, adding features on its own is great, but obviously stuff like what happened here can't be allowed to happen, and those Samsung or LG smart fridges that became advertising boards is obviously also not acceptable...Easy to call the bullshit out, hard to actually define the responsibilities of a manufacturer in a law. I live in a city so I don't need a car, but if I had to buy one, "it should not have a network interface" would be my most important requirement. Whereas the problem is that cars have had computers for a long time (eg ECU, ABS, entertainment), then those started getting connected together locally via CAN, then finally they added an Internet connection for surveillance and control. So the centralizing proprietary software tentacles go deep into the car in a way that's not easy to remove or replace.There is the black box approach of disabling network interfaces, but I could even see that going away - cannot contact network -> car cannot be sure that warranty recalls have been done in a timely fashion -> disable itself after a month until you "take it to a dealer" (or reconnect the cell backhaul).

It's just a crutch for manufacturers to ship half-baked products, and an attack vector for the next generation of shitty engineers they hire to damage my property. "we will assist" - a guarantee so lukewarm, you could put it in an icebox to keep your food fresh for a week. Consumers tend to heavily underestimate the point in time from which cars started absolutely relying on modern electronics. I drove my 2011 model until earlier this year without any major problems. Unless vehicle tracking is intended as something other than a safety feature? Now when there is an update they either change the UI (for certain people to remain relevant), or they add more ads. Yet somehow, they're finding a way to ruin even that. I drove a CJ for many years until it rusted out from under me and the engine seized, but I thought it was great, I went everywhere with it.I would like to have a wrangler but it is too expensive, too many bells and whistles and to large, I would never get one.Now I an driving an 18 year auto and hope to keep it going for another 18 :) I would like to have a wrangler but it is too expensive, too many bells and whistles and to large, I would never get one.Now I an driving an 18 year auto and hope to keep it going for another 18 :) In the case of this Jeep bug causing engine shutoff and power failure, it was an update to the infotainment system! The safety implications in this case really drive that home. The Twitter OP cannot put links into his main tweet because the algorithm will downrank him.Isn't it just great? https://www.4xeforums.com/threads/wrangler-4xe-ota-update-10...Any problem with this evidence, or are you just a HN complainer?

Will Jeep reimburse me if I get a loaner while my car is at the dealership? My dealership doesn't provide loaner vehiclesDoes anyone know what's going on? My suspicion is that this was either a CAN saturation issue (ie - infotainment started sending a high priority message which could reach powertrain CAN) or a state management issue (ie - infotainment sent a “put modules to sleep” or “wake modules” message which was not handled correctly and caused one or more modules to transition to an invalid state for driving). What I really think: my car shouldn't have any bullshit "modes" to select from. Tune it once at the factory to some reasonable compromise, and perhaps make certain settings writable through the OBD port, and that will be it.</p>

For the first time, scientists have successfully built a fully functional memory chip using two-dimensional materials and integrated it directly onto a conventional silicon die — a milestone that could change how future semiconductors are made. The research, led by Chunsen Liu and colleagues at Fudan University in Shanghai, was published on October 9 in the journal Nature. The research may mark a turning point for 2D electronics, which have long promised atomic-scale performance and efficiency but struggled to move beyond lab demonstrations. The result is a hybrid chip that combines a 2D NOR flash memory array with a standard CMOS controller, effectively bridging the gap between experimental nanomaterials and industry-standard fabrication. The Fudan team reports a 94.34% yield from full-chip testing — a figure that rivals commercial silicon production — and operational speeds up to five megahertz. Each bit consumes just 0.644 picojoules, far below the energy draw of today's silicon flash cells. Silicon chips, even after polishing, have uneven terrain at the nanometer scale that can tear or stress atomic-thin layers. This design enables instruction-driven operations, 32-bit parallelism, and random access, or, in other words, a full-featured memory chip. If scaled, such hybrid architectures could drastically reduce power use and increase density in next-generation processors and AI processors, effectively continuing Moore's Law at the atomic limit.

This makes Cupertino the most generous company that offers an award for unearthing vulnerabilities, and it's even offering top-up bonuses that can see security experts earning more than $5 million for uncovering exploits. It even claimed that multiple individuals have received $500,000 in rewards. Beyond that, there's also a bonus system for those who can break Apple's Lockdown Mode secure environment and vulnerabilities in its beta software, bringing the potential payout to over $5 million. There are also smaller awards, like $1 million for those who can crack broad iCloud security and those who can create a wireless proximity attack using radio, up to $300,000 to anyone who develops a one-click WebKit sandbox escape mechanism, and $100,000 to those who can bypass Gatekeeper on macOS. This isn't the only bug bounty program anyone can participate in. Microsoft's maximum award at the moment is $250,000, and it has even lowered its age limit to 13 because of this high school junior who filed over 20 security vulnerability reports last summer. Meta launched a bug bounty program in 2011 and now offers a maximum bug bounty of $300,000 (with $25,000,000 awarded to date). And last, but not least, Google began its Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) in 2010. The search giant's rewards vary from a few hundred dollars to a million dollars for the most serious vulnerabilities on its Titan M security chip. These awards can make finding bugs a lucrative field, especially for talented security researchers. Moreover, software mistakes can potentially cost lives, as state actors and other third parties are increasingly using sophisticated means to target specific personalities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If there was ever a time to upgrade your floor cleaning game, it's now, and Dreame's superstar robot vacuum and mop combo, the X50 Ultra (Complete), is 29% off at Amazon. Dreame's awesome Prime Day sale is still in effect, with enormous price breaks on their finest cleaning machines for your floors and your air. One of the new tech features that dropped jaws at CES 2025 was Dreame's ProLeap System, which gives the X50 Ultra (Complete) the ability to actually scale steps and thresholds up to 2.36 inches in height. If you know the sound of a robot vacuum that's hung up on a threshold between rooms, you know it means you need to get up and give it an assist. The Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete) eliminates that frustrating situation, and also eliminates previously unreachable dirt that hides in corners with its MopExtend RoboSwing tech that reaches over an inch and a half into those elusive spots. Dirty corners and threshold obstacles aren't the only common robot vacuum shortcomings solved by the Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete). The innovative HyperStream Detangling Duo Brush eradicates those hair tangles that bring the rollers of lesser robot vacs to a complete standstill. It allows the X50 Ultra (Complete) to pick up a full 100% of large particles and hair, with no tangles snarling the rollers. VersaLift Navigation with advanced LiDAR and AI continuously map its path in real time to avoid obstacles, and even determining which pieces of furniture it can successfully go under for optimal cleaning without getting stuck or, worse, lost. The Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete) is better at taking care of itself than any robot floor cleaner we've seen, whether it's self-emptying dirt in its Intelligent PowerDock, or using the AceClean DryBoard system that hits the mop pads with 20 streams of hot, cleansing water, and then dries them with hot air to prevent those bad, damp smells. The mop is clean and ready to go again without any work on your part. The X50 Ultra (Complete) also toggles seamlessly between hard floors and carpets, with five tailored modes that protect your carpets from the mop, boost the suction for thicker carpets, and more. It gets your hard floors and carpets ultra clean, does a complete job including hard-to-reach corners and beneath some furniture items, and completely takes the drudgery of vacuuming and even more taxing mopping jobs out of your hands — which sounds like a dream scenario to us, but it's very real. The 29% off deal at Amazon wipes $500 from the price of the Dreame X50 Ultra (Complete), making it a $1,200 investment in years of effortlessly clean floors and hundreds of hours back that you previously spent cleaning.</p>
