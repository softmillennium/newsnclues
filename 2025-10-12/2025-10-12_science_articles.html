                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>$83 billion has just been sitting there underground this whole time. A deposit of gold ore recently discovered in China isn't just giant. So much so, in fact, that Chinese experts claim it could be the largest deposit of any precious metal—not just gold ore—in existence today. Adding some more heft to the already weighty (literally) find was the report that the new discovery features 138 grams of gold per metric ton of ore, a valuable rate not often found in gold mining. “Many drilled rock cores showed visible gold,” said Chen Rulin, an ore-prospecting expert at China's Hunan Province's Geological Bureau, according to Chinese state media. If the 1,100-ton figure holds up, that makes this new find the largest gold mine in the world, even outpacing South Africa's South Deep gold mine with its 1,025 tons of gold, according to Mining Technology. Already the world's top gold producer with about 10 percent of global production, China is heavily dependent on the metal, using about three times more gold than it mines annually. This new discovery has put the world's gold markets on notice, enough so that the price of gold rose to $2,700 per ounce, according to CCN.com. And the gold news may not stop there. According to Liu Yongjun, vice head of the bureau, additional gold ore was found when drilling around the site's peripheral areas. Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Once connected stretches of land, now hidden beneath the sea, may have given early humans a way to move between what is today Türkiye and Europe, according to groundbreaking new research in this little-studied region. Long before Ayvalık became known for its olive groves and seaside scenery, this part of the northeastern Aegean coast (now in Turkey) may have served as another key passageway for ancient humans exploring a shifting prehistoric world. "Our archaeological discovery has unveiled that this now-idyllic region once potentially offered a vital land bridge for human movement during the Pleistocene era -- when sea levels dropped and the now-submerged landscape was briefly exposed," explains Dr. Göknur Karahan, from the Department of Archaeology-Prehistory, at Hacettepe University, in Turkey, who was part of a fully female team of expert archaeologists from the country. These findings mark Ayvalık as a potential new frontier in the story of human evolution, placing it firmly on the map of human prehistory -- opening up a new possibility for how early humans may have entered Europe. "It feels like we are adding an entirely new page to the story of human dispersal. Our research raises exciting possibilities for future exploration, and we hope it emerges as a body of work that will shift the approach of Pleistocene archaeology for decades to come." During the Ice Age, sea levels dropped more than 100 meters, revealing vast coastal plains that are now underwater. At that time, the modern islands and peninsulas of Ayvalık would have formed a single stretch of land, creating a natural bridge that linked Anatolia to Europe. Until now, environmental conditions and deep sediment layers had made it difficult to detect or preserve traces of early human activity in the region. "In all these periods, the present-day islands and peninsulas of Ayvalık would have formed interior zones within an expansive terrestrial environment," explains co-author Professor Kadriye Özçelik, from Ankara University. The region's shifting geology and active coastlines in the North Aegean made preservation difficult and the number of items uncovered "limited," however this research team managed to uncover Levallois technologies from various Paleolithic periods, as well as handaxes and cleavers. Among the most significant finds include Levallois-style flake tools, sophisticated implements linked to the Middle Paleolithic Mousterian tradition -- these are often associated with Neanderthals and early Homosapiens. "The presence of these objects in Ayvalık is particularly significant, as they provide direct evidence that the region was part of wider technological traditions shared across Africa, Asia, and Europe." Holding the first tools in our hands was both emotional and inspiring. "And each find from there on was a moment of excitement for the whole team. "Holding these objects -- after walking across landscapes where no one had ever documented Paleolithic remains before -- was unforgettable." What does this discovery tell us about early humans? Exploring how Anatolia, with specific focus on Ayvalık, and Europe were linked during glacial sea-level low stands offers alternative pathways for how early humans moved around the region beyond dominantly emphasized northern mainland-centered routes. The survey's yield of tools demonstrates a "consistent use of Levallois technology and flake production… and a diversified toolkit," whilst all artefacts together offer what the team state are "valuable insights into early human presence, raw material preferences, and technological variability." "The results confirmed that Ayvalık -- which had never before been studied for its Paleolithic potential -- holds vital traces of early human activity." As this was a survey (carried out across a two-week period in June 2022) rather than an excavation, the team could not be certain of what they would find when they set off. They knew from the region's geology and paleogeography that there was potential. They explored -- often muddy, (particularly in lowland basins and coastal plains) -- sites by foot. "However, despite these constraints, high-quality raw material sources, such as flint and chalcedony, were identified in multiple locations, including areas affected by alluvial deposition." Fellow author Dr. Hande Bulut, from Düzce University, adds: "Ultimately the results underline Ayvalık's potential as a long-term hominin habitat and a key area for understanding Paleolithic technological features in the eastern Aegean.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Picture diving deep into the quantum realm, where unimaginably small particles can exist and interact in more than a trillion possible ways at the same time. But what if many of those same problems could be handled by a regular laptop? Scientists have long believed this was theoretically possible, yet actually achieving it has proven far more difficult. They have expanded a cost-effective computational technique known as the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), a kind of physics shortcut that simplifies quantum mathematics, so it can handle systems once thought to demand enormous computing power. Just as significant, their approach -- outlined in a study published in September in PRX Quantum, a journal of the American Physical Society -- offers a practical, easy-to-use TWA framework that lets researchers input their data and obtain meaningful results within hours. "Our approach offers a significantly lower computational cost and a much simpler formulation of the dynamical equations," says the study's corresponding author, Jamir Marino, PhD, assistant professor of physics in the UB College of Arts and Sciences. "We think this method could, in the near future, become the primary tool for exploring these kinds of quantum dynamics on consumer-grade computers." His co-authors include two of his former students there, Hossein Hosseinabadi and Oksana Chelpanova, the latter now a postdoctoral researcher in Marino's lab at UB. Instead, physicists often turn to what's known as semiclassical physics -- a middle-ground approach that keeps just enough quantum behavior to stay accurate, while discarding details that have little effect on the outcome. So Marino's team expanded TWA to the messier systems found in the real world, where particles are constantly pushed and pulled by outside forces and leak energy into their surroundings, otherwise known as dissipative spin dynamics. "Plenty of groups have tried to do this before us. It's known that certain complicated quantum systems could be solved efficiently with a semiclassical approach," Marino says. In the past, researchers looking to use TWA faced a wall of complexity. So, Marino's team turned what used to be pages of dense, nearly impenetrable math into a straightforward conversion table that translates a quantum problem into solvable equations. These are systems that can't be solved with a semiclassical approach. "Physicists can use supercomputing resources on the systems that need a full-fledged quantum approach and solve the rest quickly with our approach."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-term autoimmune condition that affects over 2.9 million people around the world. Although existing treatments can help reduce inflammation, there are still no approved therapies that protect neurons or rebuild the damaged myelin sheath. Scientists have now made significant progress toward that goal with support from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The research was funded through two National MS Society initiatives: a standard investigator-initiated grant and the organization's Fast Forward program, which accelerates commercialization of promising research. "Our work represents more than a decade of collaboration, with the last four years focused on identifying and optimizing new drug candidates that show strong potential to treat MS and possibly other neurological diseases involving demyelination," Tiwari-Woodruff said. With this support, the team launched a drug development program that has since been licensed by Cadenza Bio, Inc. Backed by investor funding, the company has continued advancing the research and is preparing for clinical testing of what could become a first-of-its-kind treatment for people with MS. This new work builds on earlier studies involving a compound called indazole chloride, which had shown promise in promoting myelin repair and regulating immune responses in mouse models of MS. Working with UIUC chemists Katzenellenbogen and Sung Hoon Kim, who created new versions of the molecule, Tiwari-Woodruff's group, led by recent UC Riverside graduate Micah Feri, screened more than 60 analogs of indazole chloride. It not only stimulated myelin repair but also helped regulate immune activity, a critical balance for MS therapies. The compound also performed well in human oligodendrocytes -- cells responsible for producing myelin -- derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, suggesting the results could translate effectively from animal studies to human disease. In MS, this repair process often breaks down, leading to lasting nerve damage. A compound like K102 that can restore myelin could help improve nerve signal transmission and potentially limit long-term disability. "It has slightly different central nervous system effects and may be better suited for other conditions like spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury, so we're keeping it in the pipeline." Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen credit the National MS Society's Fast Forward program as a turning point. Fast Forward accelerates the commercialization of promising therapies by promoting academic-industry partnerships. The patents are jointly held by UCR and UIUC, with an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement in place between the universities and Cadenza Bio. "This project has been a good example of how long-standing academic collaborations can lead to real-world applications," Katzenellenbogen said. "Our shared goal was always to take a promising idea and develop it into a therapy that could help people with MS. We're finally getting close to that reality." Initially, UCR's Office of Technology Partnerships collaborated with UIUC to seek patent protection. Grace Yee, assistant director of technology commercialization at UCR, said the joint efforts of UCR, UIUC, and the National MS Society advocated for and promoted the technology to investors and industry for commercial development. "When investors expressed interest in the technology, UCR and UIUC helped them understand how the technology addresses an unmet need in treating MS. These efforts led to the licensing agreement with Cadenza Bio." Elaine Hamm, chief operating officer at Cadenza Bio, said she and Carol Curtis, cofounder of Cadenza Bio, were impressed by the possibility of moving from slowing axon damage to repairing axon damage. "This is the future we want to build," Hamm said. Tiwari-Woodruff and Katzenellenbogen have worked together for more than 12 years. Funding for academic labs like mine and John's is crucial. This is selfless work, driven by a deep love of science and commitment to human health." Though the initial focus is MS, the team believes K102 and K110 could eventually be applied to other diseases involving neuronal damage, including stroke and neurodegeneration. Cadenza Bio is now advancing K102 through the necessary non-clinical studies required to support first-in-human clinical trials. "We're hopeful that clinical trials can begin soon," said Tiwari-Woodruff. Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.
