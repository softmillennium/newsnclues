A protester interrupted Microsoft's Copilot-focused keynote Friday afternoon, calling attention to the company's reported dealings with the Israeli military. 

“Shame on you,” the protester said. “You claim that you care about using AI for good, but Microsoft sells AI weapons to the Israeli military […] All of Microsoft has blood on its hands.” 

Microsoft Head of Consumer AI Mustafa Sulyman, whose portion of the keynote was interrupted by the protester, several times responded, “I hear your protest, thank you.”

In February, The Associated Press reported that sophisticated AI models from Microsoft and OpenAI, Microsoft's close collaborator, had been used as part of an Israeli military program to select bombing targets during the recent wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Reportedly, one errant bombing led to the death of several young girls and their grandmother.

Several protests have been staged over Microsoft's alleged involvement, including by the company's own employees.

Updated 12:20 p.m. Pacific: A second protester interrupted a panel discussion involving CEO Satya Nadella and former CEOs Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates later in the keynote. The Verge reports that both protests were coordinated by No Azure for Apartheid, a long-running movement among some employees at Microsoft.

It's China's turn to impose a ban.

This week, President Donald Trump imposed at least 54% tariffs on nearly all imported Chinese goods, and Beijing hit back with 34% duties for goods from the U.S. In addition to these taxes, Bloomberg reported that China is restricting the export of seven rare earth metals as part of its move against Washington.

The Ministry of Commerce for the People's Republic of China is sanctioning the following materials: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium. Although these resources aren't widely known to the public, they're crucial for producing some of our most advanced technologies. For example, some of these materials are used in the magnets found in the motors of electric vehicles, while others are used for creating superconductors. Some are also used in storage media to improve efficiency and performance, and several more are found in nuclear reactors.

This announcement occurred several days before the additional levies Trump announced would take effect on April 9. China usually announces retaliatory actions against the U.S. after these taxes are already being charged on imports, giving the White House a chance to back down. However, it seems the country also made this countermove just one day before the April 5 deadline for TikTok to find an American buyer or face a ban in the U.S. It's speculated that China made this move so it can have some aces up its sleeve during subsequent bilateral negotiations between the two companies.

Computer chips and copper are exempt from the newly announced tariffs, at least for now, which is great news for PC manufacturers. However, these levies affect the equipment and materials required for American-made processors, making building chips in the U.S. more expensive. When combined with China's ban on rare earth metals that companies use, many chip makers will have to increase their prices as they scramble to find alternative sources (which are likely more expensive).

China's average tariff rate on U.S. goods before this announcement was 17.8%, which is significantly less than the 32.8% rate it applies. However, Trump justified the jump in tariff rates for China as an answer to the non-tariff barriers it allegedly places on U.S. goods. We can only watch from the sidelines as almost all imports into the U.S., including silicon semiconductors, become more expensive due to these taxes. Hopefully, these companies and their customers can adjust to this new reality to ensure their survival.

Nintendo is officially pushing the preorder date for Switch 2 customers in the U.S. The company cited uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs as the main cause for the delay, though the legacy Japanese game maker promised the June 5 launch date is still in effect.

In a statement sent to Gizmodo, Nintendo said “Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025, in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”

Nintendo shared all the details about the $450 Switch 2's features, price, and launch date during the official Switch 2 Direct on April 2, the same day that Trump announced sweeping tariffs hitting practically every country in the world, including Nintendo's reported hardware manufacturing bases of Cambodia and Vietnam, as identified by The Financial Times. Some analysts who spoke to Gizmodo previously said Nintendo likely calculated the cost of tariffs into its Switch 2 price point. Still, the company was hit hard by Trump's arbitrary import tax scheme. President Donald Trump put a 46% tariff on Vietnam and a 49% tariff on Cambodia.

Nintendo has repeatedly promised investors it has prepared its manufacturing to have enough Switch 2 units to beat scalpers. The new question is if it needs to adjust pricing to make up for the absolute skyrocketing price of shipping units to the U.S. Some analysts claimed Nintendo has brought close to 400,000 units to the U.S. before the tariffs hit, but preorder numbers could easily eclipse that, and just in the U.S. alone.

Nintendo sold 13.4 million original Switch systems globally during its release year in 2017, according to Omdia data. The analytics firm forecasted the company would sell 14.7 million Switch 2s this year, though that wasn't accounting for the impact of tariffs.

This story is ongoing, and we will be updating this page as we learn more.

The Asus ROG Strix X870E-E Gaming Wifi is an upper-mid-range offering you can find on Asus' webstore (at the time of this writing) for $499.99, which is also the launch price. You know if it says ROG Strix, it will pack a lot of features, along with a signature premium appearance. The latest E Gaming model introduces an additional M.2 socket, faster networking, various AI and DIY-friendly “Q” features, and a refreshed aesthetic compared to the X670E version, enhancing or updating elements almost universally.

For under $500, Asus offers a variety of AI features, including AI Overclocking (an easy performance upgrade), AI Cooling II (one-click fan tuning), and AI Networking II (optimize network performance) to maximize the potential of the installed hardware. A multitude of EZ PC DIY functionality is also included, covering the M.2 sockets (Q-Release/Slide/Latch), troubleshooting (Q-LED/Code), Wi-Fi (Q-Antenna), and the slim PCIe Slot Q-Release.

Asus has improved its design, refining an already high-end aesthetic. The large VRM heatsinks enhance the look with a dot-matrix-like RGB-backlit ROG symbol and an Asus tagline on top. While it's not significantly different from the previous generation, the design looks less busy, and better supports warm-running PCIe 5.0 M.2 devices.

In terms of connectivity and pwerr, there's also a lot to like. With 13 USB ports on the rear I/O (10 Type-A and 4 Type-C), five M.2 sockets (3 PCIe 5.0), robust power delivery, and fast networking, there isn't much that could improve speed without spending significantly more money. Performance of the ROG Strix X870E-E across our testing suite with default settings was average in most tests. It also proved to be a competent gaming option, demonstrating its all-around capability against the other motherboards we've evaluated on this platform.

Asus includes several accessories to help ease your building experience. From SATA cables to Wi-Fi antennas, it's enough to get you going without a trip to the store. Below is a complete list of the extras.

The board's overall design doesn't change considerably from the previous version. However, it still exudes premium vibes and fits the profile of a premium motherboard. On the all-black, 8-layer PCB, oversized heatpipe-connected VRM heatsinks display an RGB ROG symbol shining through. Three larger heatsinks are positioned over the three PCIe 5.0 M.2 drives at the bottom. A plate-style heatsink with diagonal slats and hints of brushed aluminum covers the remaining M.2s, along with the chipset heatsink. A second RGB lighting strip concealed below illuminates the bottom of the board. Once again, we appreciate the enhancements over the previous generation, and there's no doubt this setup will look impressive inside almost any chassis.



In the left corner, we see the two Dual Procool II 8-pin EPS connectors powering the CPU. The oversized VRM heatsinks have no issues keeping the powerful VRMs below in spec. The ROG Symbol design splits up the dual-finished (matte and smooth aluminum) cover top, along with the “For Those Who Dare” branding that you'll find on both parts of the heatsink.

Moving right, we run into the Nitropath-equipped DRAM slots with locking mechanisms on both sides. Asus lists capacity up to 256GB with DDR5-8400+(OC) speeds for 8000 series APUs, while 7/9000 series desktop processors are slightly lower at DDR5-8000+(OC). Our DDR5-8000 kit didn't work out of the box (ut wasb;t ib the QVL), but our Team Group DDR5-7200 kit worked without issue. The board also features Asus' AEMP feature that helps get the most out of memory kits without XMP profiles.

Above the DRAM slots, we find the first four of the seven 4-pin fan headers. Each header supports PWM- and DC-controlled devices, with a total output across all headers of 1A/12W. Although this is low compared to other motherboards, which typically offer at least one 2/3A header, you would only need to worry if you carelessly piggyback a couple of fans on the same header. Control over these devices is managed through Armory Create and AI Cooling II, which includes one-click fan tuning via a proprietary Asus algorithm.

Next are a couple of LED displays to aid in troubleshooting. At the top is the Q-Code LED, which shows more detailed codes, while the simpler Q-LED display is below. Both features function during the POST process, indicating the specific area (Q-LED - CPU, DRAM, VGA, BOOT) where the issue lies, and providing additional information (via Q-Code). These are always beneficial when problems arise, and especially important if you enjoy tweaking and pushing your system.

We encounter the first (of three) 3-pin ARGB headers along the right edge. Control over any integrated devices and those connected to the headers is managed through the Aura Sync software, which can be accessed via the Armory Crate. Below is the start button and the Flex Key (reset), which you can configure for quick access features like Safe Boot or toggling the LEDs on and off with the button. Next, there is the 24-pin ATX connector to power the board, a front panel USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20 Gbps) Type-C header, and finally a 19-pin front panel USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) header.



Power delivery on the X870E-E Gaming features 22 phases, 18 dedicated to Vcore. Power flows from the EPS connector(s) to a Digi+ ASP2205 PWM controller. Next are 18 Vishay Sic850A 110A SPS MOSFETs utilizing Asus' “teamed” power configuration we're used to seeing these days. The available 1,980 Amps can easily support overclocked flagship-class processors, even with sub-ambient overclocking methods. Ultimately, the only limitation is CPU cooling on such a well-built board. If this sounds familiar, it's the same solution on the more expensive ROG Maximus X870E Hero.



Hiding under the SupremeFX shield at the bottom left corner is the current-generation Realtek ALC4080 audio codec. Helping things out are several premium dedicated audio capacitors (yellow), audio line shielding, and a Savitech SV3H712 Amp. Most users will be pleased with the audio solution.

In the middle of the board are two PCIe slots: The top one is CPU-connected and runs at PCIe 5.0 x16 speeds, while the bottom one, through the chipset, runs at PCIe 4.0 x4. Both slots are reinforced, with the top slot featuring Q-Release Slim technology for easily extracting your graphics card without needing a button. The card is secured with a standard (perhaps broader) clip that is spring-loaded and remains open by default, locking in place when the GPU is pushed down. As long as your graphics card is secured to the PC case, there's no risk of it coming loose. To remove it, pull it up on the IO side of the card to dislodge it from the front (left) part of the slot. Additionally, the top slot can bifurcate and supports up to four x4 M.2s (or x4/x4/x8) using an add-in card.

Mixed in among the PCIe slots are five M.2 sockets. The top three sockets, M.2_1/2/3, are all CPU-connected and operate on PCIe 5.0 x4 (128 Gbps), supporting devices up to 80mm (M.2_3 supports 110mm). The bottom two slots accommodate 80mm modules but connect through the chipset, running at PCIe 4.0 x4 (64 Gbps). You have plenty of speed and sockets available. The first socket also has a multi-size connector for easier installation. There is lane sharing; when M.2_2 and M.2_3 are enabled, the primary PCIe slot reduces to x8. The E Gaming supports NVMe RAID0/1/5/10 with 9000 series processors.

Along the right edge, past the chipset, are four horizontal SATA ports (also supporting RAID0/1/5/10) and another 19-pin USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) header.

Across the bottom of the board are several exposed headers. You'll find the typical stuff here, including additional USB ports, RGB headers, and more. Below is a complete list, from left to right.

The rear IO on the X870E-EGaming is extremely busy with 14 total USB ports, dominating the space. Starting on the left is the HDMI video output followed by two USB4 (40 Gbps) Type-C ports. Two more Type-C ports line the bottom edge, and between those are the Clear CMOS and BIOS Flashback buttons. Above all of that are 10 USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) ports and the Realtek RTL8126 5 GbE. On the right are the Wi-Fi 7 module, the quick connect Q-Antenna, and the 2-plug plus SPDIF audio stack.

Our hierarchy says Newegg's $210 RX 6600 makes a lot more sense if you need something right now.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia's most affordable RTX 40-series desktop graphics card is starting to push toward $500 at U.S. retailers. Yet, despite its horrific pricing, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 currently tops the best seller GPU chart on Newegg US, with an MSI Ventus model listed at $460 (and it "ships from Hong Kong"). Further down the chart, the only other RTX 4060 model in the top 20 is a triple-fan Gigabyte Eagle model at $455 (which ships from the US). These prices seem ridiculously high, but Newegg is still seeing enough demand to make this MSI model its best seller.Of course, it's likely more of a statement on the lack of GPU supply rather than high demand for these graphics cards. The Blackwell RTX 50-series GPUs, along with AMD's RDNA 4 RX 9000-series and Intel's Battlemage Arc B-series, have all been rather difficult to find at anything approaching MSRPs. Inventory on the previous generation graphics cards also dried up late last year, with only the lower tier cards like the RTX 4060, RX 7600, Arc A750, and RX 6600 still remaining in stock at reasonable prices. We can scratch the 4060 off the "reasonable" list now, however.



When the RTX 4060 was launched at $299 in June 2023, it was panned by reviewers and enthusiasts for its significant compromises. Benchmarks showed that the intergenerational performance increase wasn't exciting, and its 8GB VRAM and 128-bit interface meant the RTX 4060 suffered a significant VRAM and bus width deficit vs the previous 12GB RTX 3060. (Of course, Nvidia also released an RTX 3060 8GB late in the Ampere life cycle that perhaps made the 4060 look a little less terrible.)

Normally, when Nvidia is due to unleash the next-generation replacements for a graphics card family, consumers have a chance at a rare bargain. This is not the case in 2025, as the launch date for the RTX 5060-class GPUs approaches. Leaks and indications of a lift in 60-class pricing don't help exert downward pressure on the RTX 4060 series. For example, Chinese etailers recently listed RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti graphics cards for between $463 and $528 (prices converted for Chinese Yuan and minus local sales tax).

Another reason the RTX 4060 desktop price seems so high is that you can grab full gaming laptop systems featuring the RTX 4060 laptop GPU for bargain prices. Of course a mobile variant isn't equivalent to a desktop PC model, but a couple of weeks ago we spotted an RTX 4060 packing MSI Thin A15 for $729. That's just $270 more than the desktop GPU alone, and if you were starting out in PC gaming, that bargain laptop features a powerful Ryzen 9 8945HS processor, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage, as well as the laptop screen, keyboard etc. – in a portable form factor.That's not a direct substitute for a desktop graphics card if that's what you want/need, but it illustrates the silly desktop card pricing. We must also comment that, unlike other Nvidia desktop/laptop GPU comparisons, the RTX 4060 laptop GPU actually offers relatively similar performance — the only major differences are clocks speeds and power limits.

The law of supply and demand is a very powerful force in economics, and we frequently see this reflected in the PC components market. In the graphics card arena, the supply/demand balance has been unfortunate for PC DIYers and enthusiasts for several months now, chiefly due to AI, and we've seen similar issues in the past (e.g. due to cryptomining and Covid). It's not looking like things will be rectified shortly.Having said that, we do feel that these RTX 4060 prices can't be sustained. Nvidia and AMD are preparing to fill this market with new gen ‘60' cards shortly, and they are usually supplied in good quantities, as they are mainstream mass-market products. Faced with RTX 4060 cards approaching $500, we would definitely suggest waiting a few weeks for the next-gen 4060/9060, with potential replenishments and restocks of ‘70' series GPUs helping out, too.

If you're in a pinch, check out our graphics card hierarchy for the comparative performance of lesser-known GPUs from AMD and Intel. Perhaps, for your intended purposes, an AMD Radeon RX 7600/XT or Arc B580, B570, A770, or A750 might be a satisfactory substitute for an RTX 4060. Check our reviews and see how alternatives work in your favorite games and apps. As a stopgap, the Newegg fourth place AMD Radeon RX 6600, at $210, isn't a terrible choice, either.

Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, is ostensibly a tech company that operates a middling social media platform. In practice, it's something closer to a way for opportunistic investors to suck up to the President. But it appears Trump may be ready to cash out. According to the Financial Times, a recent filing by the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission indicates that the trust Trump stashed his shares in is now permitted to sell his stake. According to the filing, the mix of shares will be sold off “from time to time in one or more offerings.”

Trump holds nearly 115 million shares of TMTG, which accounts for about 53% of the total shares in the company. With the stock hovering between $18 and $19 a share—frankly, an absurd share price for a company that basically just runs a social media platform designed to receive posts from Trump—the President's stake is worth more than $2 billion. Following the 2024 election, Trump shifted those shares into the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, theoretically taking control out of his hands… except the trust is controlled by Donald Trump Jr., who is not exactly an independent operator.

The President has also insisted on multiple occasions that he won't sell his shares in the company, which he's technically been allowed to do since September of last year. Fears that he'll sell have historically sent the stock into a tailspin because the real value of the company seems to be the ability to cozy up to Trump. Experts have warned that the publicly traded company offers easy avenues for special interests and foreign investors to do some unofficial favor trading. There is really no rational reason to invest in TMTG other than being a Trump bud or fanatic. The tech sucks and it reported a loss of more than $400 million last year.

Whether any outside sources have tried to use the stock to manipulate anyone or not, it has certainly been a place where Trump loyalists have come to profit. Attorney General Pam Bondi owns about $2 million worth of shares in TMTG. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon serves as director of TMTG and was gifted $826,000 worth of shares in January 2025. FBI Director Kash Patel got his own “gift” of $826,000 worth of shares at the start of the year, too—after he filed his financial disclosures to the government. Intelligence Board nominee Devin Nunes is currently the CEO of TMTG and is sitting on more than $20 million worth of stock holdings—plus, he gets a salary and bonus from the company, which netted him $1.6 million last year.

TMTG argued that its recent filing, which also shows that Bondi and Nunes are looking to sell some of their stake in the company, was just a routine filing and that “Legacy media outlets are spreading a fake story suggesting that a TMTG filing today is paving the way for the Trump trust to sell its shares in TMTG…In fact, there currently is no open window for any affiliate to sell shares.”  But odds are some of these folks are going to want to turn their theoretical cash into the real stuff at some point.

Screenwriter Jonathan Tropper assures us all that Shawn Levy's Star Wars movie is still happening. Jurassic World Rebirth teases its big new mutant dino. Plus, what's coming on Yolo: Rainbow Trinity. To me, my spoilers!



According to Deadline, Meryl Streep is “in talks” to play a gender-swapped version of Aslan the Great Lion in Greta Gerwig's The Chronicles of Narnia, but parties involved are “not quite at the offer stage yet.”

During his recent appearance on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, when asked about the potential for a Spider-Man/Kingpin showdown, Vincent D'Onofrio confirmed that due to legal reasons, Wilson Fisk can only appear on television for the time being.

The only thing I know is not positive, it's a very hard thing to do for Marvel to use my character. It's a very hard thing to do because of ownership and stuff. Right now, I'm only usable for television series, different kinds of series, whatever it is, but not even a one-off Fisk movie or anything like that. It's all caught up in rights and stuff. I don't know when that would work out, or if it would ever work out at all, actually, really…

Speaking with Collider, screenwriter Jonathan Tropper confirmed Shawn Levy's Star Wars movie is still in development.

That gig is something I've dreamed about my whole life. We're still working on it. For various reasons, I can't say anything about it. But we're working on it.

As reported by Variety, Jurassic World Rebirth footage recently screened at CinemaCon saw Scarlett Johansson and company attempting to steal Quetzalcoatlus eggs before being attacked by a mosasaur and “some kind of mutated dinosaur that basically looks like a steroidal T-Rex.”

Footage from The Black Phone 2 screened at Cinema Con (via Screen Rant) also revealed the Grabber returns from beyond the grave as a Freddy Krueger-esque phantom able to “target kids after his death.”

According to Bloody-Disgusting, Bring Her Back has been rated “R” for “strong disturbing bloody violent content, some grisly images, graphic nudity, underage drinking and language.”

Likewise, David F. Sandberg's Until Dawn has also been rated “R” for “bloody horror violence, gore and language throughout.” [Bloody-Disgusting]

A woman awakens a “supernatural beast” after killing her husband in the trailer for The Severed Sun, a new folk horror movie starring Emma Appleton and Toby Stephens.

 

Finally, murder is afoot in a clip from this Sunday's episode of YOLO: Rainbow Trinity.

As President Trump pushes his massive global tariffs into effect, America's former trading partners are designing their own, retaliatory tariffs, that are sure to have a walloping effect on Americans' pocketbooks.

On Thursday, the recently elected prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, announced a new 25 percent tariff on American-made automobiles. The tariffs will apply to all vehicles that do not comply with the USMCA, the trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. that was signed into law several years ago. However, the tariffs don't apply to car parts. Carney said he thought Canada would earn approximately $5.7 billion from the new measures.

The U.S. has already levied multiple tariffs against Canada, including on the nation's steel and aluminum, and on Canadian exports. Canada and Mexico were exempted from the far-reaching tariffs that Trump announced this week (dubbed “reciprocal” tariffs) which were aimed at dozens of countries all over the world—though the previous measures remain.

“Our response to these latest tariffs is to fight, to protect, and to build,” Carney said, during a press conference. “We will fight the U.S. tariffs with retaliatory trade actions of our own that will have maximum impact in the United States and minimum impacts here in Canada.”

“We take these measures reluctantly,” Mr. Carney told reporters. He went on: “We can do better than the United States. Exactly where that comes out depends on how much damage they do to their economy.”

Carney took the opportunity to point out that Trump was effectively violating the trade agreement that his own administration had negotiated during his first term in office. Indeed, the USMCA was put into place in 2020, towards the end of Trump's first tenure at the White House. Carney also pointed out that Trump's trade war would ultimately hurt many Americans and that he, therefore, believed the tariffs would be rescinded eventually.

“Given the prospective damage to their own people, the American administration should eventually change course,” Carney said. “Although their policy will hurt American families until that pain becomes impossible to ignore, I do not believe they will change direction, so the road to that point may indeed be long. And will be hard on Canadians just as it will be on other partners of the United States.”

Carney also spoke pessimistically about U.S.-Canadian relations: “The global economy is fundamentally different today than it was yesterday. The system of global trade anchored on the United States… is over. Our old relationship of steadily deepening integration with the United States is over. The 80-year period when the United States embraced the mantle of economic leadership…is over.”

“This is a tragedy,” he added. “It is also the new reality. We must respond with both purpose and force.”

High-speed 64GB RAM modules are finally here.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Today, G.Skill announced two new high-speed and high-capacity DDR5 memory kits to compete against the best RAM. Tailored toward enthusiasts under the Trident Z5 RGB and Z5 Royal Neo series, the latest offerings include what G.Skill claims is the world's first 128GB (64GBx2) memory kit running at DDR5-8000 speeds alongside a 64GB (32GBx2) DDR5-9000 offering for those prioritizing speed. There's no word on pricing and availability, though we expect more details to be unwrapped in the future.

128GB memory kits, typically configured as 64GBx2 for optimal speed, are widely available with speeds ranging from DDR5-5600 to DDR5-6000. G.Skill's latest Trident Z5 Royal Neo 64GB modules fill this gap in the market. They are advertised to hit DDR5-8000 speeds when overclocked.

The "Neo" designation indicates that this memory kit is designed and optimized for AMD's AM5 platform. Likewise, the 32GB DDR5-9000 modules are intended for Intel's Arrow Lake platform. However, the press release doesn't specify if these kits are CUDIMM-based.

G.Skill prepped a test bench featuring an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X on an Asus ROG Crosshair X870E Apex motherboard. The attached validation screenshot shows the 128GB Trident Z5 Royal kit running at DDR5-8000 CL44-58-58 speeds. If tighter timings are your priority, G.Skill recently introduced a 96GB DDR5-6400 kit with CL30 latency. However, they haven't explicitly stated support for AMD's EXPO technology.

Moving over to the Intel setup that was outfitted with the Core Ultra 7 265K and the Asus ROG Maximus Z890 Apex, the 64GB Trident Z5 RGB counterpart operates at an impressive 9000 MT/s with CL48-64-64 timings under MemtestPro 4.0. Intel's Arrow Lake processors officially support DDR5-5600 for standard DIMMs and DDR5-6400 for CUDIMM. Anything above that is out of JEDEC specifications and might require some tuning to ensure stability.

Likewise, Raphael and Granite Ridge work best at DDR5-6000 and DDR5-6400 speeds, respectively. Achieving DDR5-8000 on AM5 typically requires a 1:2 ratio, with the UCLK running at half the MCLK frequency. Your mileage may vary depending on your motherboard and CPU's memory controller, but these are impressive results. When purchasing high-end kits, ensure your motherboard is on the Qualified Vendor List of your RAM kit for compatibility. Keeping your BIOS up to date can also enhance stability.

It's all too easy to lose time on the internet. Scrolling through social media, falling down algorithm-led rabbit holes on YouTube, and clicking on bad news story after bad news story. We know too much screen time is bad for us, but acknowledging the problem and doing something about it are two different things.

Browser maker Opera has an idea for cultivating a healthier relationship with the web and our computers, and it's a new browser called Opera Air. Now available for Windows and macOS, its reason for being is to “actively improve your well-being” by encouraging breaks, exercises, and meditations.

When it comes to improving your user experience, Opera Air starts with the basic building blocks of the browser interface: It's all round corners and frosted glass effects, and Opera itself describes it as a "minimalist Scandinavian design." (Opera is headquartered in Oslo, Norway.) It's all designed to be as relaxing and as gentle as possible—though the amount of relaxation you'll feel does still to some extent depend on the sites you choose to look at.

"The web is beautiful, but it can be chaotic and overwhelming," says Mohamed Salah, the senior director of product at Opera. "We decided to look at science-backed ways to help our users navigate it in a way that makes them feel and function better."

Even the wallpaper inside the browser is designed to be calming.

To that end you've got a choice of background sounds and a choice of exercises to work with, both easily accessible from the main browsing screen. You can also set up reminders to take a break at regular intervals, and it's likely Opera will add more over time—the current version of the browser is labeled “early access.”

To research the need for a calming tool like Opera Air, the company conducted a survey of 7,000 people across seven countries. It found that 58 percent of respondents “sometimes feel overwhelmed or stressed while browsing the web,” while 83 percent of respondents said they would like a “web browser made them feel better as they went about their day.”

The initial setup for Opera Air won't take you long to work through. You'll need to choose a wallpaper backdrop, and there are a variety of soothing images and looping videos to pick from. You're also able to import data such as bookmarks and browsing history from another browser.

After that, you get to the Speed Dial quick links page borrowed from the main Opera browser. If you've used Opera before, you'll notice some of the browser's distinctive features: The choice of workspaces on the left, for example, where you can separate groups of tabs, and the integrations with the Aria AI, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp.

Boosts are customized sounds to help you work.

The two key well-being tools in Opera Air are on the left sidebar. Explore Boosts (the flower icon) leads you to a series of binaural background beats, with names like Emotional Navigation, Focused Calm, and Creativity Boost. Pick the one that matches the mood you're looking for.

For each selection, you can click the three dots to tweak the mix. You're able to choose the frequency of the beats, the ambient sound, and the music track that all work together to produce the sounds you're listening to. (There are a multitude of combinations to go through.) You can also set a fixed time for the boost audio before clicking Start.

Breaks are guided exercises you can use regularly.

The other main feature here is Take a Break, which is the icon that looks like three wavy lines. You've got four options: Breathing, Neck Exercise, Meditation, and Full Body Scan (which "tunes you into your body and surroundings"). You'll be talked through each step of each exercise, and they take between three and 15 minutes to complete.

Click the three dots to the top right of the Take a Break screen and you can pick the voice you want to use for the narration. You can also turn break reminders on or off; Opera Air can nudge you to take some time away from the web at regular intervals of between 45 and 180 minutes. What's more, if you have a webcam, there's the option to use it for some of the exercises to make sure you're stretching correctly. Opera doesn't make any specific reference to a privacy policy when it comes to this feature, but we can't see any indication that any kind of permanent recordings are made, and generally speaking, Opera is a privacy-focused browser.

Digital notebooks is a category that still divides opinion. For those who use them, they couldn't be without them. For those that don't, the idea of using an electronic device to re-create the experience of writing on paper only brings up one question—why not just use actual paper?

Well, there are a few compelling reasons. For one thing, digital tablets generally offer some kind of syncing, meaning you can write something down on your digital tablet and then easily pull it up later on your computer or phone. And then there's handwriting recognition, which allows you to turn your written notes into text you can copy into digital documents. All of these are compelling features, which we pointed out while reviewing the reMarkable 2 Tablet and its color upgrade reMarkable Paper Pro.

But there's another, perhaps underappreciated, reason: the ability to use any kind of paper you want without having to keep that paper in stock. Want lined paper? Sure thing. Need graphing paper for some math problems? You've got that too, along with dotted paper and even blank sheets if that's your thing.

Which brings me back to reMarkable. My main problem with its devices has been that it really doesn't offer that many kinds of digital paper. Search the internet for “reMarkable templates” and you'll find all sorts of third parties trying to fill this niche, some free and some for a fee. Most of these are PDF files, while some require you to jailbreak your device to add them as templates. I've used some of these workarounds, and their existence points to how many people are looking for more kinds of paper out of their reMarkable tablet.

Thankfully, it seems someone at reMarkable is paying attention. Recently the company launched reMarkable Methods, which is now part of the reMarkable Connect subscription. This offers a collection of both templates for reMarkable notebooks and purpose-built PDF files. To get started you need only head to the website and browse.

The collection offers 14 PDF workbooks and 27 templates, all of which you can install to your device in just one click. Workbooks will show up in My Files while templates are offered when you create a new notebook—or switch templates in an existing notebook—under the new rM Methods section.

The templates offer much nicer day and week planners than those that came included, as well as dedicated templates for keeping track of tasks. There's one for the Eisenhower method, for example, allowing you to sort tasks based on their relative urgency and importance. There's also a simple kanban template, allowing you to sort tasks in columns. And there are multiple templates for taking notes, all with a different methodology in mind.

The PDF workbooks are more like the purpose-built journals or planners you can buy and vary from full calendars to an official Bullet Journal built by the team at BulletJournal.com.

The new calendar template is a good example of how this format can work. It includes a yearly calendar overview and focused pages that split this down by month, week, and day, with handy links on each page that make it easy to jump between views. This means it is easy to open this week's calendar, jot down your priorities, then tap the current day so you can fill in hourly details on a timeline.

These templates and notebooks aren't going to be useful for everyone, and it's unlikely to make anyone on the fence about these kinds of devices finally go out and buy one. But if you've already got a reMarkable tablet (and the required reMarkable Connect subscription), they're a nice addition worth checking out that will make your device even better.

A major hit on domestic chipmakers?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Although the new import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration do not tax semiconductor imports, they do tax imports of wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) made outside of the U.S. and used by American chipmakers. As a result, companies like Intel, GlobalFoundries, Samsung Foundry, and TSMC will have to pay at least 20% more for chipmaking tools in the U.S. than they do in other countries, which will likely affect the prices of chips made in America.

Although the U.S.-based Applied Materials, KLA, and Lam Research control about 50% of the chipmaking tool market, producers of fab tools from China, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan command the remaining 50%. U.S.-based chipmakers hardly use tools made in China, but they certainly use lithography, etching, and deposition equipment produced in the EU, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Starting from April 9, they will have to pay a 20% to 32% import tax (depending on the origin of the equipment) when buying semiconductor production equipment from companies in these countries, which will inevitably affect their costs in the U.S.

Given that equipment costs determine the costs of chips more than anything else, expect a tangible increase in production costs in America. Then again, if the Trump administration imposes additional tariffs on chips made elsewhere, this will somewhat level the costs of chips produced overseas and domestically. However, this will not make chips made in the U.S. more competitive on the global market.

The 20% import tax on lithography tools made by ASML will probably have the biggest impact on American chipmakers as ASML does not really have U.S.-based rivals when it comes to advanced immersion DUV litho tools as well as Low-NA EUV and High-NA EUV litho machines. While a 20% rate seems modest compared to the 54% tariffs on Chinese imports, they apply to extremely costly equipment.

ASML's advanced immersion DUV (ArF) machines used for sub-10nm fabrication processes cost $82.5 million per unit on average (based on the company's Q4 FY2024 results), a Low-NA EUV system is priced around $235 million depending on configuration, and its upcoming High-NA EUV tool is expected to cost $380 million. With the new import duties, those same tools will cost American chipmakers $99 million per Twinscan NXT:2000i-series DUV machine, $282 million per Twinscan NXE:3800E Low-NA EUV system, and $456 million for next-generation Twinscan EXE:5000-series High-NA EUV tool.

It is noteworthy that ASML produces not only lithography scanners but also metrology and inspection tools, which will also become more expensive for American chipmakers. In fact, some of ASML's HMI eScan e-beam tools are assembled in Taiwan, and they will be 32% more expensive for American buyers. The good news is that ASML can expand the production of HMI tools in San Jose, California.

In addition, there are other European fab equipment makers, such as ASM International, which makes atomic layer deposition (ALD) and epitaxy tools, and Aixtron, which makes deposition equipment for compound semiconductors (GaN, SiC, etc.), which are also produced in the U.S. (by companies like Macom and X-Fab).

Speaking of cleaning, coating, deposition, and etching tools, tools from Japan-based companies like Tokyo Electron and Screen Holdings are quite popular on the market, and they are set to get 24% more expensive for American companies.

Given that wafer fab equipment from Europe and Asia has just gotten 20% to 32% more expensive for American buyers, a natural question is whether these tools can be replaced with ones produced in the U.S.

ASML has only two big rivals — Canon and Nikon — and they are based in Japan and do not produce EUV systems or advanced DUV scanners anyway, so American fabs will have to pay 20% extra for ASML tools in the foreseeable future. The actual impact of ASML's tools on production costs will be determined by whether a particular product is more lithography intensive (DRAM, logic), or etching and deposition intensive (3D NAND).

As for cleaning, coating, deposition, and etching tools, Applied Materials, KLA, and Lam Research build world-class machines for these steps. However, if a particular process technology and production flow already integrates a certain system from Tokyo Electron, then switching to a different tool is extremely complicated and takes time. Also, some tools are unique and are designed for a very specific process or flow, which makes their replacement even more complicated.

In general, this sudden increase undermines the significant capital investment plans of companies like Intel, TSMC, and Samsung Foundry, all of which are building or expanding advanced fabs that cost tens of billions of dollars in the U.S. The impact will not be limited to leading-edge nodes. Companies using mature and specialty manufacturing technologies, including GlobalFoundries and Texas Instruments, will also pay more for their needed equipment. In the end, the added costs will push up the price of chips produced domestically.

7/10

In my 17 years of being married to my husband, I have learned that it's wise to take a few precautions. First, always wear sensible shoes. Second, always have a full water bottle and some snacks—even if we're supposedly just walking the dogs for an hour. Third, panicking never helps. You might not know what's going to happen or how you got here, but we're going to figure it out.

Unfortunately, my daughter has only lived with my husband for 10 years, compared to my 17. On a recent spring break trip, we were off-roading up a steep hill in our Toyota Tundra when we started sliding backwards in a slippery mix of snow and mud. Immediately, high-pitched shrieks erupted from the back seat. “Babe! Panicking never helps!” I reached into the glove box and pulled out an Anker power bank, a USB-C cable, and the HMD OffGrid. “We can always call someone. It's going to be OK!”

She calmed down, giving my husband and me enough time to figure out how to get out of this mess. (It will surprise no one who has gone overlanding that it involved a combination of 4WD, chains, and a lot of rocking back and forth.) Back at the cabin, I opened my computer and subscribed to the Overwatch X Rescue 24/7 emergency SOS service. My husband made fun of me, but I'm not the one plowing us into melting 2-foot snow berms for fun.

The US is a big country, and cell service is woefully inadequate. In 2019, the Federal Communications Commission reported that most service providers did not meet the minimum service provided in coverage maps. Coverage is even worse if you recreate outdoors, and especially in the American West. My family and I spent the week in the Washington Cascades, and while Verizon's coverage map shows that we were supposed to get service, we did not. Not a single bar until we drove into town.

There are a lot of satellite messengers, but most people don't want to spend through the nose on a dedicated device, plus subscriptions, for something they'd only use a few times a year. The HMD OffGrid addresses that gap. It's tiny, durable, and relatively affordable. Most of all, the OffGrid's yearly subscription fee is reasonably priced and includes Overwatch X Rescue. It doesn't do you very much good to have a satellite communicator with SOS if it doesn't summon some people to rescue you.

Overwatch X Rescue provides end-to-end crisis response management. Most importantly, a subscription covers the costs of the response for only $80 per year. This is insanely affordable for a fully funded service that covers everything from search and rescue to transportation of your dependent children if you're injured.

In contrast, something like the Garmin inReach messenger ($250) is more expensive and requires both a minimum $15 per month inReach satellite subscription to trigger the SOS, as well as $40 per year search and rescue (SAR) insurance to pay for the costs involved in extracting you from whatever mess you're in. Let's be honest: If you love high-risk outdoor sports and need a rescue, this would be a bargain. But most of the time, you won't.

I tried the review unit of the OffGrid on my family's spring break. (Don't worry, I didn't make my kids suffer—at least, not for work. We made these plans long before I got the OffGrid to test.) The device is palm-sized, 3.7 inches high, and weighs less than 3 ounces. It looks a lot like the Motorola Defy. There's a hole at the top for a lanyard, which I didn't have, but it easily fit in my pants pocket.

It charges via USB-C and is compatible with Android and iOS. It's not a stand-alone device, so you'll need a smartphone to use it. It's simple to operate, as any device you use to call for help in the backcountry should be—just two buttons, a power button, and an exposed yellow SOS button. It feels like it might be too easy to trigger, but you have to hold the SOS down firmly for a few seconds, which makes an accidental press less likely. (Yes, I did push the SOS button and text Overwatch. I told them to stand down. I did it for you, and yes, it was embarrassing.)

The activation process is quick—you turn it on, charge it, and download the HMD OffGrid app on your phone. Once connected, the app walks you through the settings. I charged it for about an hour to get it to 100 percent, and the battery lasted from Monday through Thursday and got to about 35 percent. However, none of our outdoor excursions lasted longer than four hours, so the OffGrid probably doesn't have enough battery life to live-track a weekend backpacking trip. (Then again, your phone doesn't either.)

The OffGrid has a few different capabilities, along with the aforementioned SOS service and live tracking. You can text via satellite messaging and check in on the HMD OffGrid app. In the Washington Cascades, it took about eight minutes to connect to satellites under tree cover, but it was a lot quicker from a lakeshore under clear skies.

It's IP68-rated and has been tested to military specs, which means you can treat it with a reasonable amount of abuse. I did kick it around in and out of bags and dropped it in an alpine lake, and it continued working.

The device uses the same L-band frequencies that all GPS systems use to triangulate your position as you crawl about the surface of planet Earth. But while Garmin uses the Iridium satellite network for telecommunications, HMD has partnered with Skylo and Viasat, which does make me a little nervous. Most satellite messengers I've tested use Iridium, and Skylo and Viasat seem less reliable. However, my texts to my dad and location tracking with my husband went back and forth with reasonable promptness.

For a long time, if you wanted to go off-grid, your choices were Garmin or nothing. Now options are abundant, even within this specific niche—someone who recreates in the backcountry frequently but is never really that far from an outlet or a power bank to keep their phone and the device charged.

The OffGrid is far from your only choice. The Motorola Defy is cheaper, but it's less hardy and doesn't have Overwatch X Rescue. If you want better battery life for a whole week or weekend, stick with a Garmin. Or get a personal locator beacon ($380), which doesn't require a subscription and has a battery that will last 5 years or until you have to use it.

The main value proposition offered by the OffGrid is that the subscription plan is ridiculously cheap and includes Overwatch X Rescue. However, it's worth noting here that Overwatch X Rescue does have a stand-alone app that works with newer iPhones and Android devices with satellite capabilities.

If you have a newer phone, you might want to skip getting the OffGrid altogether. But if you're not someone who upgrades your phone constantly—and many people who like to vacation in the backcountry don't—then HMD is a useful, affordable, and possibly lifesaving satellite communicator.

When the audience was handed 3D glasses as we walked into the final presentation at CinemaCon 2025, it could only mean one thing: we were going back to Pandora. And, sure enough, Disney presented the first footage ever from Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third film in James Cameron's epic fantasy franchise.

Cameron wasn't there in person, but he put the presentation in the capable hands of Neytiri herself, Zoe Saldaña. The footage began with the water tribe, the Metkayina, as characters swim through some kind of wreckage (maybe from the end of the last movie?), followed by scenes of the kids like Lo'ak, Kiri, Tsireya hanging about.

“The strength of your ancestors is here,” Tsireya says to Lo'ak as she touches his chest.

The Wind Traders show up, and all of the Metkayina are excited. It's friendly. People are cheering, and some of the younger characters like Kiri and even Spider are riding with them. Cameron films these scenes with a real love for these people. These are basically flying pirate ships with sails made up of almost translucent material. Members of the tribe bark out orders around the ship like you'd see in an old pirate movie but the ships just keep gliding along. This is peaceful. This is beautiful. This is nice.

The ships slowly float through the mountains with some other Na'vi, like Neytiri, riding alongside on her Ikran. Spider playfully dangles his foot off the side. Again, everything is quiet and calm. But not for long. Neytiri spots something watching them from the sky and screams for Jake. It's the Ash tribe and they have a much more menacing presence than the Na'vi people we know, thanks in large part to the bright red war paint they wear and the sparks coming off the back of their Ikrans.

The Ash tribe swoops down and attacks our heroes in a massive midair battle. Jake fires his gun. Neytiri fires her bow and arrow. But the Ash tribe shoots arrows with fire, which start to burn down the Wind tribe's ships.

We see Jake seemingly trekking across Pandora by himself, walking by massive volcanoes and eventually arriving at what looks like the gate of the Ash tribe with his hands in the air, giving himself up. He and Neytiri are having problems with Lo'ak and tell him, “You can't live in hate!” They hug him.

Tonowari, leader of the water tribe, says that they can't defeat enemies that come from the stars. We then see the Ash tribe seemingly teaming up with Quaritch and the rest of the human army.

Neytiri is in the hospital and screams for her children. A raid is happening. There's a quick shot of the eye of a Tulkun. Things end with a massive battle that's happening on what looks like floating rocks. They seem to be in the middle of some kind of floating wreckage from a battle that's still happening. Neytiri and the leader of the Ash tribe, who we've seen throughout the trailer, are fighting but Neytiri's snarls come up against her flame thrower type weapon. “Your goddess has no dominion here,” the Ash woman says, confirming they don't believe in Ewa. And that's the end.

So you have the serenity of the Wind tribe, the kinetic energy of the Ash tribe and in the middle, the water people, which now includes the Sully family. We have a feeling not everyone is going to make it out alive.

Avatar: Fire and Ash opens December 19, and Cameron is still working on it.
