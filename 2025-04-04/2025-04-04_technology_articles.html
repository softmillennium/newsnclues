                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“You claim that you care about using AI for good, but Microsoft sells AI weapons to the Israeli military […] All of Microsoft has blood on its hands.” Microsoft Head of Consumer AI Mustafa Sulyman, whose portion of the keynote was interrupted by the protester, several times responded, “I hear your protest, thank you.” In February, The Associated Press reported that sophisticated AI models from Microsoft and OpenAI, Microsoft's close collaborator, had been used as part of an Israeli military program to select bombing targets during the recent wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Reportedly, one errant bombing led to the death of several young girls and their grandmother. Several protests have been staged over Microsoft's alleged involvement, including by the company's own employees. The Verge reports that both protests were coordinated by No Azure for Apartheid, a long-running movement among some employees at Microsoft.

This week, President Donald Trump imposed at least 54% tariffs on nearly all imported Chinese goods, and Beijing hit back with 34% duties for goods from the U.S. In addition to these taxes, Bloomberg reported that China is restricting the export of seven rare earth metals as part of its move against Washington. Although these resources aren't widely known to the public, they're crucial for producing some of our most advanced technologies. For example, some of these materials are used in the magnets found in the motors of electric vehicles, while others are used for creating superconductors. This announcement occurred several days before the additional levies Trump announced would take effect on April 9. China usually announces retaliatory actions against the U.S. after these taxes are already being charged on imports, giving the White House a chance to back down. It's speculated that China made this move so it can have some aces up its sleeve during subsequent bilateral negotiations between the two companies. Computer chips and copper are exempt from the newly announced tariffs, at least for now, which is great news for PC manufacturers. When combined with China's ban on rare earth metals that companies use, many chip makers will have to increase their prices as they scramble to find alternative sources (which are likely more expensive). However, Trump justified the jump in tariff rates for China as an answer to the non-tariff barriers it allegedly places on U.S. goods. We can only watch from the sidelines as almost all imports into the U.S., including silicon semiconductors, become more expensive due to these taxes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a statement sent to Gizmodo, Nintendo said “Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025, in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.” Some analysts who spoke to Gizmodo previously said Nintendo likely calculated the cost of tariffs into its Switch 2 price point. Still, the company was hit hard by Trump's arbitrary import tax scheme. Nintendo has repeatedly promised investors it has prepared its manufacturing to have enough Switch 2 units to beat scalpers. Some analysts claimed Nintendo has brought close to 400,000 units to the U.S. before the tariffs hit, but preorder numbers could easily eclipse that, and just in the U.S. alone. Nintendo sold 13.4 million original Switch systems globally during its release year in 2017, according to Omdia data. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The ROG Strix X870E-E Gaming Wifi is a well-rounded solution packed with AI and DIY features, robust, plentiful, and fast hardware, in a sub-$500 package. Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. You know if it says ROG Strix, it will pack a lot of features, along with a signature premium appearance. The latest E Gaming model introduces an additional M.2 socket, faster networking, various AI and DIY-friendly “Q” features, and a refreshed aesthetic compared to the X670E version, enhancing or updating elements almost universally. A multitude of EZ PC DIY functionality is also included, covering the M.2 sockets (Q-Release/Slide/Latch), troubleshooting (Q-LED/Code), Wi-Fi (Q-Antenna), and the slim PCIe Slot Q-Release. Asus has improved its design, refining an already high-end aesthetic. The large VRM heatsinks enhance the look with a dot-matrix-like RGB-backlit ROG symbol and an Asus tagline on top. While it's not significantly different from the previous generation, the design looks less busy, and better supports warm-running PCIe 5.0 M.2 devices. In terms of connectivity and pwerr, there's also a lot to like. With 13 USB ports on the rear I/O (10 Type-A and 4 Type-C), five M.2 sockets (3 PCIe 5.0), robust power delivery, and fast networking, there isn't much that could improve speed without spending significantly more money. Performance of the ROG Strix X870E-E across our testing suite with default settings was average in most tests. It also proved to be a competent gaming option, demonstrating its all-around capability against the other motherboards we've evaluated on this platform. Below, we'll examine the board's details and determine whether it deserves a spot on our Best Motherboards list. Asus includes several accessories to help ease your building experience. Below is a complete list of the extras. On the all-black, 8-layer PCB, oversized heatpipe-connected VRM heatsinks display an RGB ROG symbol shining through. A plate-style heatsink with diagonal slats and hints of brushed aluminum covers the remaining M.2s, along with the chipset heatsink. Once again, we appreciate the enhancements over the previous generation, and there's no doubt this setup will look impressive inside almost any chassis. Moving right, we run into the Nitropath-equipped DRAM slots with locking mechanisms on both sides. Asus lists capacity up to 256GB with DDR5-8400+(OC) speeds for 8000 series APUs, while 7/9000 series desktop processors are slightly lower at DDR5-8000+(OC). Our DDR5-8000 kit didn't work out of the box (ut wasb;t ib the QVL), but our Team Group DDR5-7200 kit worked without issue. Each header supports PWM- and DC-controlled devices, with a total output across all headers of 1A/12W. Although this is low compared to other motherboards, which typically offer at least one 2/3A header, you would only need to worry if you carelessly piggyback a couple of fans on the same header. Control over these devices is managed through Armory Create and AI Cooling II, which includes one-click fan tuning via a proprietary Asus algorithm. Next are a couple of LED displays to aid in troubleshooting. Next, there is the 24-pin ATX connector to power the board, a front panel USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20 Gbps) Type-C header, and finally a 19-pin front panel USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) header. Power delivery on the X870E-E Gaming features 22 phases, 18 dedicated to Vcore. Power flows from the EPS connector(s) to a Digi+ ASP2205 PWM controller. Next are 18 Vishay Sic850A 110A SPS MOSFETs utilizing Asus' “teamed” power configuration we're used to seeing these days. The available 1,980 Amps can easily support overclocked flagship-class processors, even with sub-ambient overclocking methods. Ultimately, the only limitation is CPU cooling on such a well-built board. Most users will be pleased with the audio solution. Both slots are reinforced, with the top slot featuring Q-Release Slim technology for easily extracting your graphics card without needing a button. Additionally, the top slot can bifurcate and supports up to four x4 M.2s (or x4/x4/x8) using an add-in card. Mixed in among the PCIe slots are five M.2 sockets. The top three sockets, M.2_1/2/3, are all CPU-connected and operate on PCIe 5.0 x4 (128 Gbps), supporting devices up to 80mm (M.2_3 supports 110mm). You have plenty of speed and sockets available. The first socket also has a multi-size connector for easier installation. There is lane sharing; when M.2_2 and M.2_3 are enabled, the primary PCIe slot reduces to x8. The E Gaming supports NVMe RAID0/1/5/10 with 9000 series processors. Along the right edge, past the chipset, are four horizontal SATA ports (also supporting RAID0/1/5/10) and another 19-pin USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) header. You'll find the typical stuff here, including additional USB ports, RGB headers, and more. Below is a complete list, from left to right. Two more Type-C ports line the bottom edge, and between those are the Clear CMOS and BIOS Flashback buttons. Above all of that are 10 USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) ports and the Realtek RTL8126 5 GbE.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our hierarchy says Newegg's $210 RX 6600 makes a lot more sense if you need something right now. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Nvidia's most affordable RTX 40-series desktop graphics card is starting to push toward $500 at U.S. retailers. Yet, despite its horrific pricing, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 currently tops the best seller GPU chart on Newegg US, with an MSI Ventus model listed at $460 (and it "ships from Hong Kong"). These prices seem ridiculously high, but Newegg is still seeing enough demand to make this MSI model its best seller.Of course, it's likely more of a statement on the lack of GPU supply rather than high demand for these graphics cards. The Blackwell RTX 50-series GPUs, along with AMD's RDNA 4 RX 9000-series and Intel's Battlemage Arc B-series, have all been rather difficult to find at anything approaching MSRPs. (Of course, Nvidia also released an RTX 3060 8GB late in the Ampere life cycle that perhaps made the 4060 look a little less terrible.) Leaks and indications of a lift in 60-class pricing don't help exert downward pressure on the RTX 4060 series. Another reason the RTX 4060 desktop price seems so high is that you can grab full gaming laptop systems featuring the RTX 4060 laptop GPU for bargain prices. That's just $270 more than the desktop GPU alone, and if you were starting out in PC gaming, that bargain laptop features a powerful Ryzen 9 8945HS processor, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage, as well as the laptop screen, keyboard etc. We must also comment that, unlike other Nvidia desktop/laptop GPU comparisons, the RTX 4060 laptop GPU actually offers relatively similar performance — the only major differences are clocks speeds and power limits. The law of supply and demand is a very powerful force in economics, and we frequently see this reflected in the PC components market. In the graphics card arena, the supply/demand balance has been unfortunate for PC DIYers and enthusiasts for several months now, chiefly due to AI, and we've seen similar issues in the past (e.g. due to cryptomining and Covid). It's not looking like things will be rectified shortly.Having said that, we do feel that these RTX 4060 prices can't be sustained. Faced with RTX 4060 cards approaching $500, we would definitely suggest waiting a few weeks for the next-gen 4060/9060, with potential replenishments and restocks of ‘70' series GPUs helping out, too. If you're in a pinch, check out our graphics card hierarchy for the comparative performance of lesser-known GPUs from AMD and Intel. Perhaps, for your intended purposes, an AMD Radeon RX 7600/XT or Arc B580, B570, A770, or A750 might be a satisfactory substitute for an RTX 4060.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, is ostensibly a tech company that operates a middling social media platform. But it appears Trump may be ready to cash out. According to the filing, the mix of shares will be sold off “from time to time in one or more offerings.” Trump holds nearly 115 million shares of TMTG, which accounts for about 53% of the total shares in the company. With the stock hovering between $18 and $19 a share—frankly, an absurd share price for a company that basically just runs a social media platform designed to receive posts from Trump—the President's stake is worth more than $2 billion. Following the 2024 election, Trump shifted those shares into the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, theoretically taking control out of his hands… except the trust is controlled by Donald Trump Jr., who is not exactly an independent operator. The President has also insisted on multiple occasions that he won't sell his shares in the company, which he's technically been allowed to do since September of last year. Experts have warned that the publicly traded company offers easy avenues for special interests and foreign investors to do some unofficial favor trading. There is really no rational reason to invest in TMTG other than being a Trump bud or fanatic. The tech sucks and it reported a loss of more than $400 million last year. Attorney General Pam Bondi owns about $2 million worth of shares in TMTG. Intelligence Board nominee Devin Nunes is currently the CEO of TMTG and is sitting on more than $20 million worth of stock holdings—plus, he gets a salary and bonus from the company, which netted him $1.6 million last year. TMTG argued that its recent filing, which also shows that Bondi and Nunes are looking to sell some of their stake in the company, was just a routine filing and that “Legacy media outlets are spreading a fake story suggesting that a TMTG filing today is paving the way for the Trump trust to sell its shares in TMTG…In fact, there currently is no open window for any affiliate to sell shares.”  But odds are some of these folks are going to want to turn their theoretical cash into the real stuff at some point.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Screenwriter Jonathan Tropper assures us all that Shawn Levy's Star Wars movie is still happening. Jurassic World Rebirth teases its big new mutant dino. According to Deadline, Meryl Streep is “in talks” to play a gender-swapped version of Aslan the Great Lion in Greta Gerwig's The Chronicles of Narnia, but parties involved are “not quite at the offer stage yet.” During his recent appearance on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, when asked about the potential for a Spider-Man/Kingpin showdown, Vincent D'Onofrio confirmed that due to legal reasons, Wilson Fisk can only appear on television for the time being. It's a very hard thing to do because of ownership and stuff. Right now, I'm only usable for television series, different kinds of series, whatever it is, but not even a one-off Fisk movie or anything like that. Speaking with Collider, screenwriter Jonathan Tropper confirmed Shawn Levy's Star Wars movie is still in development. That gig is something I've dreamed about my whole life. For various reasons, I can't say anything about it. As reported by Variety, Jurassic World Rebirth footage recently screened at CinemaCon saw Scarlett Johansson and company attempting to steal Quetzalcoatlus eggs before being attacked by a mosasaur and “some kind of mutated dinosaur that basically looks like a steroidal T-Rex.” According to Bloody-Disgusting, Bring Her Back has been rated “R” for “strong disturbing bloody violent content, some grisly images, graphic nudity, underage drinking and language.” Likewise, David F. Sandberg's Until Dawn has also been rated “R” for “bloody horror violence, gore and language throughout.” [Bloody-Disgusting] Finally, murder is afoot in a clip from this Sunday's episode of YOLO: Rainbow Trinity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As President Trump pushes his massive global tariffs into effect, America's former trading partners are designing their own, retaliatory tariffs, that are sure to have a walloping effect on Americans' pocketbooks. However, the tariffs don't apply to car parts. Carney said he thought Canada would earn approximately $5.7 billion from the new measures. The U.S. has already levied multiple tariffs against Canada, including on the nation's steel and aluminum, and on Canadian exports. “We will fight the U.S. tariffs with retaliatory trade actions of our own that will have maximum impact in the United States and minimum impacts here in Canada.” He went on: “We can do better than the United States. Exactly where that comes out depends on how much damage they do to their economy.” Carney took the opportunity to point out that Trump was effectively violating the trade agreement that his own administration had negotiated during his first term in office. Carney also pointed out that Trump's trade war would ultimately hurt many Americans and that he, therefore, believed the tariffs would be rescinded eventually. “Although their policy will hurt American families until that pain becomes impossible to ignore, I do not believe they will change direction, so the road to that point may indeed be long. Carney also spoke pessimistically about U.S.-Canadian relations: “The global economy is fundamentally different today than it was yesterday. Our old relationship of steadily deepening integration with the United States is over. We must respond with both purpose and force.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Today, G.Skill announced two new high-speed and high-capacity DDR5 memory kits to compete against the best RAM. There's no word on pricing and availability, though we expect more details to be unwrapped in the future. 128GB memory kits, typically configured as 64GBx2 for optimal speed, are widely available with speeds ranging from DDR5-5600 to DDR5-6000. G.Skill's latest Trident Z5 Royal Neo 64GB modules fill this gap in the market. The "Neo" designation indicates that this memory kit is designed and optimized for AMD's AM5 platform. Likewise, the 32GB DDR5-9000 modules are intended for Intel's Arrow Lake platform. However, the press release doesn't specify if these kits are CUDIMM-based. If tighter timings are your priority, G.Skill recently introduced a 96GB DDR5-6400 kit with CL30 latency. However, they haven't explicitly stated support for AMD's EXPO technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's all too easy to lose time on the internet. Scrolling through social media, falling down algorithm-led rabbit holes on YouTube, and clicking on bad news story after bad news story. We know too much screen time is bad for us, but acknowledging the problem and doing something about it are two different things. Browser maker Opera has an idea for cultivating a healthier relationship with the web and our computers, and it's a new browser called Opera Air. Now available for Windows and macOS, its reason for being is to “actively improve your well-being” by encouraging breaks, exercises, and meditations. When it comes to improving your user experience, Opera Air starts with the basic building blocks of the browser interface: It's all round corners and frosted glass effects, and Opera itself describes it as a "minimalist Scandinavian design." "We decided to look at science-backed ways to help our users navigate it in a way that makes them feel and function better." To that end you've got a choice of background sounds and a choice of exercises to work with, both easily accessible from the main browsing screen. You can also set up reminders to take a break at regular intervals, and it's likely Opera will add more over time—the current version of the browser is labeled “early access.” It found that 58 percent of respondents “sometimes feel overwhelmed or stressed while browsing the web,” while 83 percent of respondents said they would like a “web browser made them feel better as they went about their day.” The initial setup for Opera Air won't take you long to work through. You're also able to import data such as bookmarks and browsing history from another browser. Explore Boosts (the flower icon) leads you to a series of binaural background beats, with names like Emotional Navigation, Focused Calm, and Creativity Boost. (There are a multitude of combinations to go through.) You can also set a fixed time for the boost audio before clicking Start. You can also turn break reminders on or off; Opera Air can nudge you to take some time away from the web at regular intervals of between 45 and 180 minutes. What's more, if you have a webcam, there's the option to use it for some of the exercises to make sure you're stretching correctly. Opera doesn't make any specific reference to a privacy policy when it comes to this feature, but we can't see any indication that any kind of permanent recordings are made, and generally speaking, Opera is a privacy-focused browser. ‘It's a heist': Real federal auditors are horrified by DOGE The Big Story: Google's two-year frenzy to catch up with OpenAI Anyone with a credit card can turn toys into weapons of war WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

For those that don't, the idea of using an electronic device to re-create the experience of writing on paper only brings up one question—why not just use actual paper? For one thing, digital tablets generally offer some kind of syncing, meaning you can write something down on your digital tablet and then easily pull it up later on your computer or phone. And then there's handwriting recognition, which allows you to turn your written notes into text you can copy into digital documents. All of these are compelling features, which we pointed out while reviewing the reMarkable 2 Tablet and its color upgrade reMarkable Paper Pro. But there's another, perhaps underappreciated, reason: the ability to use any kind of paper you want without having to keep that paper in stock. My main problem with its devices has been that it really doesn't offer that many kinds of digital paper. Search the internet for “reMarkable templates” and you'll find all sorts of third parties trying to fill this niche, some free and some for a fee. Thankfully, it seems someone at reMarkable is paying attention. This offers a collection of both templates for reMarkable notebooks and purpose-built PDF files. The collection offers 14 PDF workbooks and 27 templates, all of which you can install to your device in just one click. Workbooks will show up in My Files while templates are offered when you create a new notebook—or switch templates in an existing notebook—under the new rM Methods section. The templates offer much nicer day and week planners than those that came included, as well as dedicated templates for keeping track of tasks. There's also a simple kanban template, allowing you to sort tasks in columns. And there are multiple templates for taking notes, all with a different methodology in mind. The new calendar template is a good example of how this format can work. It includes a yearly calendar overview and focused pages that split this down by month, week, and day, with handy links on each page that make it easy to jump between views. This means it is easy to open this week's calendar, jot down your priorities, then tap the current day so you can fill in hourly details on a timeline. These templates and notebooks aren't going to be useful for everyone, and it's unlikely to make anyone on the fence about these kinds of devices finally go out and buy one. But if you've already got a reMarkable tablet (and the required reMarkable Connect subscription), they're a nice addition worth checking out that will make your device even better.

As a result, companies like Intel, GlobalFoundries, Samsung Foundry, and TSMC will have to pay at least 20% more for chipmaking tools in the U.S. than they do in other countries, which will likely affect the prices of chips made in America. U.S.-based chipmakers hardly use tools made in China, but they certainly use lithography, etching, and deposition equipment produced in the EU, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Starting from April 9, they will have to pay a 20% to 32% import tax (depending on the origin of the equipment) when buying semiconductor production equipment from companies in these countries, which will inevitably affect their costs in the U.S. Then again, if the Trump administration imposes additional tariffs on chips made elsewhere, this will somewhat level the costs of chips produced overseas and domestically. The 20% import tax on lithography tools made by ASML will probably have the biggest impact on American chipmakers as ASML does not really have U.S.-based rivals when it comes to advanced immersion DUV litho tools as well as Low-NA EUV and High-NA EUV litho machines. ASML's advanced immersion DUV (ArF) machines used for sub-10nm fabrication processes cost $82.5 million per unit on average (based on the company's Q4 FY2024 results), a Low-NA EUV system is priced around $235 million depending on configuration, and its upcoming High-NA EUV tool is expected to cost $380 million. It is noteworthy that ASML produces not only lithography scanners but also metrology and inspection tools, which will also become more expensive for American chipmakers. In fact, some of ASML's HMI eScan e-beam tools are assembled in Taiwan, and they will be 32% more expensive for American buyers. In addition, there are other European fab equipment makers, such as ASM International, which makes atomic layer deposition (ALD) and epitaxy tools, and Aixtron, which makes deposition equipment for compound semiconductors (GaN, SiC, etc. ), which are also produced in the U.S. (by companies like Macom and X-Fab). Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Speaking of cleaning, coating, deposition, and etching tools, tools from Japan-based companies like Tokyo Electron and Screen Holdings are quite popular on the market, and they are set to get 24% more expensive for American companies. Given that wafer fab equipment from Europe and Asia has just gotten 20% to 32% more expensive for American buyers, a natural question is whether these tools can be replaced with ones produced in the U.S. ASML has only two big rivals — Canon and Nikon — and they are based in Japan and do not produce EUV systems or advanced DUV scanners anyway, so American fabs will have to pay 20% extra for ASML tools in the foreseeable future. The actual impact of ASML's tools on production costs will be determined by whether a particular product is more lithography intensive (DRAM, logic), or etching and deposition intensive (3D NAND). Also, some tools are unique and are designed for a very specific process or flow, which makes their replacement even more complicated. The impact will not be limited to leading-edge nodes.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. In my 17 years of being married to my husband, I have learned that it's wise to take a few precautions. Second, always have a full water bottle and some snacks—even if we're supposedly just walking the dogs for an hour. You might not know what's going to happen or how you got here, but we're going to figure it out. On a recent spring break trip, we were off-roading up a steep hill in our Toyota Tundra when we started sliding backwards in a slippery mix of snow and mud. Immediately, high-pitched shrieks erupted from the back seat. Panicking never helps!” I reached into the glove box and pulled out an Anker power bank, a USB-C cable, and the HMD OffGrid. She calmed down, giving my husband and me enough time to figure out how to get out of this mess. (It will surprise no one who has gone overlanding that it involved a combination of 4WD, chains, and a lot of rocking back and forth.) Back at the cabin, I opened my computer and subscribed to the Overwatch X Rescue 24/7 emergency SOS service. My husband made fun of me, but I'm not the one plowing us into melting 2-foot snow berms for fun. In 2019, the Federal Communications Commission reported that most service providers did not meet the minimum service provided in coverage maps. Coverage is even worse if you recreate outdoors, and especially in the American West. My family and I spent the week in the Washington Cascades, and while Verizon's coverage map shows that we were supposed to get service, we did not. Not a single bar until we drove into town. Most of all, the OffGrid's yearly subscription fee is reasonably priced and includes Overwatch X Rescue. It doesn't do you very much good to have a satellite communicator with SOS if it doesn't summon some people to rescue you. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Overwatch X Rescue provides end-to-end crisis response management. This is insanely affordable for a fully funded service that covers everything from search and rescue to transportation of your dependent children if you're injured. In contrast, something like the Garmin inReach messenger ($250) is more expensive and requires both a minimum $15 per month inReach satellite subscription to trigger the SOS, as well as $40 per year search and rescue (SAR) insurance to pay for the costs involved in extracting you from whatever mess you're in. Let's be honest: If you love high-risk outdoor sports and need a rescue, this would be a bargain. But most of the time, you won't. We made these plans long before I got the OffGrid to test.) The device is palm-sized, 3.7 inches high, and weighs less than 3 ounces. It looks a lot like the Motorola Defy. There's a hole at the top for a lanyard, which I didn't have, but it easily fit in my pants pocket. It's simple to operate, as any device you use to call for help in the backcountry should be—just two buttons, a power button, and an exposed yellow SOS button. It feels like it might be too easy to trigger, but you have to hold the SOS down firmly for a few seconds, which makes an accidental press less likely. (Yes, I did push the SOS button and text Overwatch. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. The activation process is quick—you turn it on, charge it, and download the HMD OffGrid app on your phone. However, none of our outdoor excursions lasted longer than four hours, so the OffGrid probably doesn't have enough battery life to live-track a weekend backpacking trip. (Then again, your phone doesn't either.) You can text via satellite messaging and check in on the HMD OffGrid app. In the Washington Cascades, it took about eight minutes to connect to satellites under tree cover, but it was a lot quicker from a lakeshore under clear skies. It's IP68-rated and has been tested to military specs, which means you can treat it with a reasonable amount of abuse. But while Garmin uses the Iridium satellite network for telecommunications, HMD has partnered with Skylo and Viasat, which does make me a little nervous. For a long time, if you wanted to go off-grid, your choices were Garmin or nothing. Now options are abundant, even within this specific niche—someone who recreates in the backcountry frequently but is never really that far from an outlet or a power bank to keep their phone and the device charged. The OffGrid is far from your only choice. The Motorola Defy is cheaper, but it's less hardy and doesn't have Overwatch X Rescue. Or get a personal locator beacon ($380), which doesn't require a subscription and has a battery that will last 5 years or until you have to use it. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. However, it's worth noting here that Overwatch X Rescue does have a stand-alone app that works with newer iPhones and Android devices with satellite capabilities. But if you're not someone who upgrades your phone constantly—and many people who like to vacation in the backcountry don't—then HMD is a useful, affordable, and possibly lifesaving satellite communicator.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the audience was handed 3D glasses as we walked into the final presentation at CinemaCon 2025, it could only mean one thing: we were going back to Pandora. And, sure enough, Disney presented the first footage ever from Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third film in James Cameron's epic fantasy franchise. Cameron wasn't there in person, but he put the presentation in the capable hands of Neytiri herself, Zoe Saldaña. ), followed by scenes of the kids like Lo'ak, Kiri, Tsireya hanging about. “The strength of your ancestors is here,” Tsireya says to Lo'ak as she touches his chest. People are cheering, and some of the younger characters like Kiri and even Spider are riding with them. These are basically flying pirate ships with sails made up of almost translucent material. Members of the tribe bark out orders around the ship like you'd see in an old pirate movie but the ships just keep gliding along. The ships slowly float through the mountains with some other Na'vi, like Neytiri, riding alongside on her Ikran. Spider playfully dangles his foot off the side. Again, everything is quiet and calm. Neytiri spots something watching them from the sky and screams for Jake. It's the Ash tribe and they have a much more menacing presence than the Na'vi people we know, thanks in large part to the bright red war paint they wear and the sparks coming off the back of their Ikrans. The Ash tribe swoops down and attacks our heroes in a massive midair battle. Neytiri fires her bow and arrow. But the Ash tribe shoots arrows with fire, which start to burn down the Wind tribe's ships. We see Jake seemingly trekking across Pandora by himself, walking by massive volcanoes and eventually arriving at what looks like the gate of the Ash tribe with his hands in the air, giving himself up. He and Neytiri are having problems with Lo'ak and tell him, “You can't live in hate!” They hug him. Tonowari, leader of the water tribe, says that they can't defeat enemies that come from the stars. Neytiri is in the hospital and screams for her children. Things end with a massive battle that's happening on what looks like floating rocks. They seem to be in the middle of some kind of floating wreckage from a battle that's still happening. Neytiri and the leader of the Ash tribe, who we've seen throughout the trailer, are fighting but Neytiri's snarls come up against her flame thrower type weapon. “Your goddess has no dominion here,” the Ash woman says, confirming they don't believe in Ewa. We have a feeling not everyone is going to make it out alive.
