                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit As the stock market continues to fall, some investors are eager to "buy the dip," or purchase assets at temporarily lower prices. Financial advisors, however, urge clients to stick with long-term investing plans amid the latest volatility. The sell-off continued Friday after China unveiled plans to impose a 34% retaliatory tariff on all goods imported from the U.S. As of Friday afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 1,700 points following a 1,679.39 drop on Thursday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid by 4.9% after plummeting 5.97% on Thursday. More from Personal Finance:'You're running out of time' to claim an IRS stimulus check, tax expert saysDisability advocates sue Social Security and DOGE to stop service cutsJean Chatzky: Amid tariff turmoil, 'you do not want to time the market' If you're looking for buying opportunities while assets are down, here are some things to consider, according to financial advisors. When asset values fall, there's often chatter in online communities like Reddit about whether to "buy the dip." While buying cheaper investments isn't a bad idea, the strategy can be tricky to execute since, of course, no one can predict stock market moves, experts say. "We never recommend timing the market, mostly because it is impossible to do without simply getting lucky," said certified financial planner Eric Roberge, CEO of Beyond Your Hammock in Boston. When buying assets during a market downturn, you need a "disciplined approach," according to CFP Jay Spector, co-chief executive officer of EverVest Financial in Scottsdale, Arizona. Waiting on the sidelines can be costly because the best returns can follow the biggest dips, according to research from Bank of America.Rather than trying to time the bottom, you should consider "dollar-cost averaging," which systematically invests your money at set intervals, Spector said. The strategy can capture lower prices while reducing risk, he said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit This is CNBC's coverage of how U.S. trade partners, industries and employers respond to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said, "Trump is using tariffs in the dumbest way possible." "Trump slapped tariffs on penguins, but not on Putin," said Schumer, D-N.Y., from the Senate floor during Friday debate of the Republican budget resolution. He sanctioned the Heard and McDonald islands, only inhabited by penguins, but he left Putin's evil Russia alone. Schumer noted that there are smart ways use tariffs but said, "Donald Trump is using tariffs in the dumbest way possible." Klarna and StubHub are delaying their long-awaited debuts on the public markets because of market turbulence, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC. Neither of the companies, which had filed their IPO prospectuses in recent weeks, have a timeline for when they will pursue an offering, the person said. The announcements are a major blow for venture capital firms, who were counting on a reinvigorated IPO market in the Trump administration after a miserable last few years for big exits. Digital physical therapy startup Hinge Health filed its IPO prospectus in March, and Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, disclosed its plans to go public earlier this week. Hyundai Motor on Friday said it will not raise prices on its current lineup of vehicles because of potential increases in costs due to tariffs as part of a new "customer assurance" program through June 2. The South Korean automaker said during the roughly two-month "protection window," the manufacturer's suggested retail price, or MSRP, of its Hyundai and Genesis vehicles will remain as they are, despite Trump's 25% auto tariffs on imported vehicles taking effect Thursday. "We know consumers are uncertain about the potential for rising prices and we want to provide them with some stability in the coming months," Hyundai CEO José Muñoz said in a statement. Stellantis is joining its Detroit rival Ford Motor in offering employee discounts on new vehicles to all consumers in the wake of auto tariffs. The owner of brands such as Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep on Friday said the employee-pricing deal will run through April 30. "This week we launched aggressive and consistent incentive and marketing support for April, including an exciting and competitive enhancement that will allow our customers 'America's Freedom of Choice' between Employee Price or current cash incentives," Stellantis said in an emailed statement. U.S. auto sales in the first quarter came in higher than expected as consumers flocked to buy cars ahead of auto tariffs taking effect, which many expect will lead to elevated vehicle prices. The employee pricing is viewed as a way to support dealers and company sales amid potential price increases and economic uncertainty due to Trump's tariffs. The White House put out a statement saying, "President Trump's Tariffs Are Already Delivering Wins for Americans," as the benchmark S&P 500 index dropped by 4.5%. "Americans are already seeing the early results of President Donald J. Trump's bold declaration earlier this week that the days of economic surrender are over," the White House said. "Nissan announced it will maintain two shifts at its Tennessee production facility — a reversal of the automaker's earlier plan to eliminate one of the shifts," the statement said. "General Motors announced it will increase truck production at its Indiana assembly plant." "Ford Motor Company and Stellantis both announced they will offer U.S. consumers employee pricing on their vehicles." Technology stocks fell for a second session Friday and the tech-heavy Nasdaq headed for its worst week in five years after Trump's tariff policy sparked global market turmoil and trade war fears. The Nasdaq is coming off its worst trading day since 2020. During Thursday's session, the Magnificent Seven stocks lost a collective $1 trillion in market value. "Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions," a Nintendo representative told CNBC. "Nintendo will update timing at a later date. It's also a sign that Trump's tariffs could cause uncertainty for consumers. Former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein believes Trump should let countries negotiate his newly announced "reciprocal" tariff rates. "The switchboard at the WH must be burning up with gov'ts trying to surrender in this trade war. Blankfein said Friday in a post on X. He added that Trump should allow the 10% baseline tariff to remain but delay the "reciprocal" tariffs by six months. The Prez said he'd make us tired of winning…I'm there now!" Building airplanes is going to get more expensive under Trump's new tariffs and additional reciprocal measures from other countries, industry members warned. The aerospace and defense industry, which helps soften the U.S. trade deficit to the tune of about $100 billion a year in exports, said it wants the Trump administration to uphold a 1980 agreement that has allowed for mostly duty-free trade for that sector. "The line is certainly long" for requests to the White House, aid Dak Hardwick, vice president of international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents Boeing, GE Aerospace, Airbus and dozens of other aerospace and defense companies. Klarna is reportedly holding off on its planned initial public offering following Trump's wide-sweeping tariff plan that has rattled financial markets over the last two trading sessions. The financial technology company has reportedly pushed off plans to start marketing shares Monday, according to a Wall Street Journal report, citing sources familiar with the matter. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday he expects Trump's tariffs to raise inflation and lower growth, creating a "highly uncertain outlook." However, Powell indicated that the central bank won't move on interest rates until it gets a clearer picture on the ultimate impacts. His comments came shortly after Trump urged the Fed to "stop playing politics" and cut interest rates because inflation is down. "Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem," Powell said in prepared remarks. It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy." Streaming now: Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaking live about interest rates and tariffs. Nike shares rose after Trump said he spoke to a key Vietnamese official about a potential agreement to reduce tariffs. The footwear and apparel giant's stock climbed about 5% in late-morning trading. Nike manufactures about 25% of its footwear in Vietnam. Its shares plummeted Thursday after Trump announced a new 46% tariff on goods from the country. Trump said in a social media post that he spoke with the head of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party about potentially cutting stiff new U.S. tariffs on imports from that country down to "zero" if the two nations can negotiate a deal. On Wednesday, Trump slapped a new tariff of 46% on goods imported from Vietnam, which is set to take effect next week. "Just had a very productive call with To Lam, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, who told me that Vietnam wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S." Trump wrote on Truth Social. "I thanked him on behalf of our Country, and said I look forward to a meeting in the near future," Trump wrote. About 25% of Nike's footwear is made in Vietnam. Gavin Newsom is trying to convince countries that announce retaliatory tariffs to exempt products that are made in California from their levies. Newsom said he's "pursuing new strategic partnerships with international trading partners." He also noted that his state has close trade ties with Mexico, Canada and China. If the index closes there, it will be 21% lower than its high in December — what Wall Street considers a bear market. Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger said Trump's global tariffs could force the media giant to slash spending, according to a report in the newsletter Status. Iger made the assessment during an unannounced stop at a daily editorial meeting at Disney-owned ABC News, as journalists discussed the market plunge sparked by Trump's trade barriers, Status reported. Iger said tariffs on steel imports could raise the cost of two Disney cruise ships currently under construction. The account offers a rare private glimpse into a major CEO's thinking about the escalating global trade conflict. Top executives have so far been hesitant to comment publicly on the turmoil. Trump arrived at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, as major stock indexes dropped by more than 3% on the second day of market fallout over his wide-ranging tariff plan. The president plans to attend a "candlelight dinner" later at his Mar-a-Lago Club. Trump earlier in the day boasted about "far better than expected" job numbers that were released. With stocks plunging again Friday as worries of a global trade war intensify, Jim Cramer warned it's not time to abandon stocks. There should never be one," Cramer wrote to his Investing Club on Friday morning. But there are things that can help the economy, such as lower interest rates. The market now sees five Fed rate cuts this year." Another silver lining: U.S. oil prices have fallen to $61 a barrel. "The Fed is torn between helping economic growth or taming inflation. The market now sees five cuts this year." Trump hit back at the Beijing administration following China's decision to impose 34% retaliatory tariffs on all U.S. goods in the wake of Washington's own sweeping levies. Trump said on the Truth social media platform. This is not the U.S. president's first altercation with Beijing, after entertaining a tenuous trade relationship with China throughout his first term in the White House. Markets continued to sink in the first few minutes of trading. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt also celebrated the strong jobs numbers. "There was also a sharp increase in transportation, construction, and warehousing employment. The Golden Age of America is on its way!" The tariffs rolled out by President Donald Trump this week have pushed the odds of a recession this year up to 60% from 40%, according to JPMorgan. "These policies, if sustained, would likely push the US and possibly global economy into recession this year," Bruce Kasman, head of global economic research, said in a note to clients late Thursday. Economic projections related to the tariffs will be something of a moving target in the coming weeks as more details emerge about both the U.S. plan and any reaction by trading partners. For example, Kasman's note was published before China's Finance Ministry announced that it would impose its own 34% tariff on U.S. imports in retaliation for the Trump administration's decision. The toy aisle is about to get more expensive. For decades, U.S. toy companies have worked with Chinese manufacturers to bring the hottest action figures, dolls and games to retail shelves. Vietnam became a solid secondary market for companies looking to diversify their factory locations amid growing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump slapped China with an additional 34% duty Wednesday, bringing the total tax on goods from the nation to 54%, and hit Vietnam with a 46% tariff. The levy is far higher than what toy companies expected and could lead to massive price hikes on toys, industry experts said. Around 77% of toys imported into the United States come from China, according to data from The Toy Association. "You could have anywhere from 35% to potentially even a point-for-point price increase on products depending upon what margin those products run at," Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of The Toy Association, told CNBC. Most toy margins are in the high single digits, he noted. So, there is very little wiggle room for companies to absorb these fees. Trump shared a social media video that defends his recent policy decisions by arguing he is deliberately crashing the stock market as a strategic play to force lower interest and mortgage rates. "Trump is crashing the stock market by 20% this month, but he's doing it on purpose," alleged the video, which Trump posted on his Truth Social account. To push cash into treasuries, which forces the Fed to slash interest rates in May, and those lower rates give the fed the ability to refinance trillions of debt very inexpensively," it says. "Now you're probably wondering, what about his tariffs? Well, I'll tell you, it's a genius play. It also forces farmers to sell more of their products here in the U.S., to bring grocery prices way down." So Trump, he's taking from the rich short term and handing it to the middle class through lower prices," it says. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Trump in a Truth Social post encouraged more foreign spending in the U.S., assuring that investors can bet on his economic agenda long term. Auto giants have responded to Trump's tariffs by announcing plans to raise prices, impose import fees, pause production and even layoff staff. The measures, which were separate to Trump's sweeping new tariffs on major trading partners, have hit the global automotive industry hard. Europe's biggest carmaker has also reportedly halted all rail shipments of vehicles built in Mexico to the U.S. Stellantis, meanwhile, announced on Thursday it will pause production at two assembly plants in Canada and Mexico. Oil prices plunged on Friday as China struck back with 34% tariffs on imported U.S. goods in response to Washington's own duties against Beijing. Oil is particularly sensitive to tensions between the two economic powerhouses, given China's status as the world's largest crude importer and the U.S. dollar's role in denominating crude commodities. The dinner is at Trump's Palm Beach club and residence, Mar-a-Lago. Trump arrived there Thursday evening after catching another dinner for the LIV golf tour at his Doral Golf Club in Miami. The manufacturing company currently has 80% of its products made in America, he said. "One of the good things about the tariffs, and I don't think there's many good things, is the fact that it puts in rather harsh perspective how hard it is to manufacture," Pinchuk said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "The government needs to celebrate manufacturing for the special American calling it's always been, rather than say it's a consolation prize," he said. Finding the best and cheapest goods can go too far, Pinchuk added, and Americans already understood that reshoring was good. "I think this could've been implemented in a much more thoughtful way, and actually, we didn't need broad tariffs," he said. He put a 34% tariff on China, though combined with preexisting tariffs, the effective rate is 54%. "China urges the United States to immediately cancel its unilateral tariff measures and resolve trade differences through consultation in an equal, respectful and mutually beneficial manner," the ministry said, according to a Google translation. The weekend is looking like a breeze for Trump — if not for stock market investors hammered by the fallout from his new tariffs. The tweet's jaunty vibe contrasted with a metaphorical bloodbath on Wall Street, where the major stock indices all suffered big drops. Nissan Motor's luxury Infiniti brand has indefinitely paused production of two Mexico-built crossovers for the U.S. in response to the newly imposed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles by Trump. In a memo to the brand's retailers, Infiniti Americas Vice President Tiago Castro said QX50 and QX55 output for the U.S. is halted "until further notice" due to the tariffs, Automotive News reported Thursday. A company spokesman confirmed the actions Thursday afternoon to CNBC and said the Japanese automaker is reviewing its "production and supply chain operations to identify optimal solutions for efficiency and sustainability." Separately, Nissan on Thursday confirmed it will maintain two shifts of production of the Nissan Rogue crossover at its Smyrna, Tennessee, plant that is free of the new auto tariffs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Trump on Friday shared an outlandish social media video that defends his recent policy decisions by arguing he is deliberately taking down the market as a strategic play to force lower interest and mortgage rates. "Trump is crashing the stock market by 20% this month, but he's doing it on purpose," alleged the video, which Trump posted on his Truth Social account. The video's narrator then falsely states, "And this is why Warren Buffett just said, 'Trump is making the best economic moves he's seen in over 50 years.'" Buffett, 94, didn't single out any specific posts, but his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway outright rejected all comments claimed to be made by him. "There are reports currently circulating on social media (including Twitter, Facebook and Tik Tok) regarding comments allegedly made by Warren E. Buffett. All such reports are false,"  the company said in a statement Friday. CNBC's Becky Quick spoke to Buffett Friday about this statement and he said he wanted to knock down misinformation in an age where false rumors can be blasted around instantaneously. Buffett told Quick that he won't make any commentary related to the markets, the economy or tariffs between now and Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3. While Buffett hasn't spoken about this week's imposition of sweeping tariffs from the Trump administration, his view on such things has pretty much always been negative. Just in March, the Berkshire CEO and chairman called tariffs "an act of war, to some degree." "Over time, they are a tax on goods. I mean, the tooth fairy doesn't pay 'em!" Buffett said in the news interview with a laugh. You always have to ask that question in economics. During Trump's first term, Buffett opined at length in 2018 and 2019 about the trade conflicts that erupted, warning that the Republican's aggressive moves could cause negative consequences globally. "A world that adjusts to something very close to free trade … more people will live better than in a world with significant tariffs and shifting tariffs over time." Buffett has been in a defensive mode over the past year as he rapidly dumped stocks and raised a record amount of cash exceeding $300 billion.

Technology stocks fell for a second session Friday and the tech-heavy Nasdaq headed for its worst week in five years after Trump's tariff policy sparked global market turmoil and trade war fears. The Nasdaq is coming off its worst trading day since 2020. During Thursday's session, the Magnificent Seven stocks lost a collective $1 trillion in market value. "Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions," a Nintendo representative told CNBC. "Nintendo will update timing at a later date. It's also a sign that Trump's tariffs could cause uncertainty for consumers. Former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein believes Trump should let countries negotiate his newly announced "reciprocal" tariff rates. "The switchboard at the WH must be burning up with gov'ts trying to surrender in this trade war. Blankfein said Friday in a post on X. He added that Trump should allow the 10% baseline tariff to remain but delay the "reciprocal" tariffs by six months. The Prez said he'd make us tired of winning…I'm there now!" Building airplanes is going to get more expensive under Trump's new tariffs and additional reciprocal measures from other countries, industry members warned. The aerospace and defense industry, which helps soften the U.S. trade deficit to the tune of about $100 billion a year in exports, said it wants the Trump administration to uphold a 1980 agreement that has allowed for mostly duty-free trade for that sector. "The line is certainly long" for requests to the White House, aid Dak Hardwick, vice president of international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents Boeing, GE Aerospace, Airbus and dozens of other aerospace and defense companies. Klarna is reportedly holding off on its planned initial public offering following Trump's wide-sweeping tariff plan that has rattled financial markets over the last two trading sessions. The financial technology company has reportedly pushed off plans to start marketing shares Monday, according to a Wall Street Journal report, citing sources familiar with the matter. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday he expects Trump's tariffs to raise inflation and lower growth, creating a "highly uncertain outlook." However, Powell indicated that the central bank won't move on interest rates until it gets a clearer picture on the ultimate impacts. His comments came shortly after Trump urged the Fed to "stop playing politics" and cut interest rates because inflation is down. "Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem," Powell said in prepared remarks. It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy." Streaming now: Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaking live about interest rates and tariffs. Nike shares rose after Trump said he spoke to a key Vietnamese official about a potential agreement to reduce tariffs. The footwear and apparel giant's stock climbed about 5% in late-morning trading. Nike manufactures about 25% of its footwear in Vietnam. Its shares plummeted Thursday after Trump announced a new 46% tariff on goods from the country. Trump said in a social media post that he spoke with the head of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party about potentially cutting stiff new U.S. tariffs on imports from that country down to "zero" if the two nations can negotiate a deal. On Wednesday, Trump slapped a new tariff of 46% on goods imported from Vietnam, which is set to take effect next week. "Just had a very productive call with To Lam, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, who told me that Vietnam wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S." Trump wrote on Truth Social. "I thanked him on behalf of our Country, and said I look forward to a meeting in the near future," Trump wrote. About 25% of Nike's footwear is made in Vietnam. Gavin Newsom is trying to convince countries that announce retaliatory tariffs to exempt products that are made in California from their levies. Newsom said he's "pursuing new strategic partnerships with international trading partners." He also noted that his state has close trade ties with Mexico, Canada and China. If the index closes there, it will be 21% lower than its high in December — what Wall Street considers a bear market. Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger said Trump's global tariffs could force the media giant to slash spending, according to a report in the newsletter Status. Iger made the assessment during an unannounced stop at a daily editorial meeting at Disney-owned ABC News, as journalists discussed the market plunge sparked by Trump's trade barriers, Status reported. Iger said tariffs on steel imports could raise the cost of two Disney cruise ships currently under construction. The account offers a rare private glimpse into a major CEO's thinking about the escalating global trade conflict. Top executives have so far been hesitant to comment publicly on the turmoil. Trump arrived at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, as major stock indexes dropped by more than 3% on the second day of market fallout over his wide-ranging tariff plan. The president plans to attend a "candlelight dinner" later at his Mar-a-Lago Club. Trump earlier in the day boasted about "far better than expected" job numbers that were released. With stocks plunging again Friday as worries of a global trade war intensify, Jim Cramer warned it's not time to abandon stocks. There should never be one," Cramer wrote to his Investing Club on Friday morning. But there are things that can help the economy, such as lower interest rates. The market now sees five Fed rate cuts this year." Another silver lining: U.S. oil prices have fallen to $61 a barrel. "The Fed is torn between helping economic growth or taming inflation. The market now sees five cuts this year." Trump hit back at the Beijing administration following China's decision to impose 34% retaliatory tariffs on all U.S. goods in the wake of Washington's own sweeping levies. Trump said on the Truth social media platform. This is not the U.S. president's first altercation with Beijing, after entertaining a tenuous trade relationship with China throughout his first term in the White House. Markets continued to sink in the first few minutes of trading. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt also celebrated the strong jobs numbers. "There was also a sharp increase in transportation, construction, and warehousing employment. The Golden Age of America is on its way!" The tariffs rolled out by President Donald Trump this week have pushed the odds of a recession this year up to 60% from 40%, according to JPMorgan. "These policies, if sustained, would likely push the US and possibly global economy into recession this year," Bruce Kasman, head of global economic research, said in a note to clients late Thursday. Economic projections related to the tariffs will be something of a moving target in the coming weeks as more details emerge about both the U.S. plan and any reaction by trading partners. For example, Kasman's note was published before China's Finance Ministry announced that it would impose its own 34% tariff on U.S. imports in retaliation for the Trump administration's decision. The toy aisle is about to get more expensive. For decades, U.S. toy companies have worked with Chinese manufacturers to bring the hottest action figures, dolls and games to retail shelves. Vietnam became a solid secondary market for companies looking to diversify their factory locations amid growing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump slapped China with an additional 34% duty Wednesday, bringing the total tax on goods from the nation to 54%, and hit Vietnam with a 46% tariff. The levy is far higher than what toy companies expected and could lead to massive price hikes on toys, industry experts said. Around 77% of toys imported into the United States come from China, according to data from The Toy Association. "You could have anywhere from 35% to potentially even a point-for-point price increase on products depending upon what margin those products run at," Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of The Toy Association, told CNBC. Most toy margins are in the high single digits, he noted. So, there is very little wiggle room for companies to absorb these fees. Trump shared a social media video that defends his recent policy decisions by arguing he is deliberately crashing the stock market as a strategic play to force lower interest and mortgage rates. "Trump is crashing the stock market by 20% this month, but he's doing it on purpose," alleged the video, which Trump posted on his Truth Social account. To push cash into treasuries, which forces the Fed to slash interest rates in May, and those lower rates give the fed the ability to refinance trillions of debt very inexpensively," it says. "Now you're probably wondering, what about his tariffs? Well, I'll tell you, it's a genius play. It also forces farmers to sell more of their products here in the U.S., to bring grocery prices way down." So Trump, he's taking from the rich short term and handing it to the middle class through lower prices," it says. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Trump in a Truth Social post encouraged more foreign spending in the U.S., assuring that investors can bet on his economic agenda long term. Auto giants have responded to Trump's tariffs by announcing plans to raise prices, impose import fees, pause production and even layoff staff. The measures, which were separate to Trump's sweeping new tariffs on major trading partners, have hit the global automotive industry hard. Europe's biggest carmaker has also reportedly halted all rail shipments of vehicles built in Mexico to the U.S. Stellantis, meanwhile, announced on Thursday it will pause production at two assembly plants in Canada and Mexico. Oil prices plunged on Friday as China struck back with 34% tariffs on imported U.S. goods in response to Washington's own duties against Beijing. Oil is particularly sensitive to tensions between the two economic powerhouses, given China's status as the world's largest crude importer and the U.S. dollar's role in denominating crude commodities. The dinner is at Trump's Palm Beach club and residence, Mar-a-Lago. Trump arrived there Thursday evening after catching another dinner for the LIV golf tour at his Doral Golf Club in Miami. The manufacturing company currently has 80% of its products made in America, he said. "One of the good things about the tariffs, and I don't think there's many good things, is the fact that it puts in rather harsh perspective how hard it is to manufacture," Pinchuk said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "The government needs to celebrate manufacturing for the special American calling it's always been, rather than say it's a consolation prize," he said. Finding the best and cheapest goods can go too far, Pinchuk added, and Americans already understood that reshoring was good. "I think this could've been implemented in a much more thoughtful way, and actually, we didn't need broad tariffs," he said. He put a 34% tariff on China, though combined with preexisting tariffs, the effective rate is 54%. "China urges the United States to immediately cancel its unilateral tariff measures and resolve trade differences through consultation in an equal, respectful and mutually beneficial manner," the ministry said, according to a Google translation. The weekend is looking like a breeze for Trump — if not for stock market investors hammered by the fallout from his new tariffs. The tweet's jaunty vibe contrasted with a metaphorical bloodbath on Wall Street, where the major stock indices all suffered big drops. Nissan Motor's luxury Infiniti brand has indefinitely paused production of two Mexico-built crossovers for the U.S. in response to the newly imposed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles by Trump. In a memo to the brand's retailers, Infiniti Americas Vice President Tiago Castro said QX50 and QX55 output for the U.S. is halted "until further notice" due to the tariffs, Automotive News reported Thursday. A company spokesman confirmed the actions Thursday afternoon to CNBC and said the Japanese automaker is reviewing its "production and supply chain operations to identify optimal solutions for efficiency and sustainability." Separately, Nissan on Thursday confirmed it will maintain two shifts of production of the Nissan Rogue crossover at its Smyrna, Tennessee, plant that is free of the new auto tariffs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nintendo has blamed Trump's tariffs for a delay in when Americans can preorder its highly anticipated Switch 2 game console. The company is pushing back preorders from April and will announce the new preorder date "at a later date," per a company statement shared with Business Insider. "Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions," the statement read. "Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged." Previously, Nintendo said that North American customers would be able to preorder from "participating retailers" on April 9. The company also had plans to allow preorders directly from its website starting May 8, but the statement didn't say whether this date was also subject to change. Nintendo said it still plans to launch the Switch 2 on June 5, with a price of $449.99. The company previously moved some production of its original Switch from China to Vietnam due to economic tensions between China and the US. This week, Vietnam was hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff, while China saw a 34% reciprocal tariff.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that he expects President Donald Trump's tariffs to raise inflation and lower growth, and indicated that the central bank won't move on interest rates until it gets a clearer picture on the ultimate impacts. "Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem," Powell said in prepared remarks. It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy." The remarks came shortly after Trump called on Powell to "stop playing politics" and cut interest rates because inflation is down. Powell noted that the announced tariffs were "significantly larger than expected." "The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth," he said. "The size and duration of these effects remain uncertain." While Powell was circumspect about how the Fed will react to the changes, markets are pricing in an aggressive set of interest rate cuts starting in June, with a rising likelihood that the central bank will slice at least a full percentage point off its key borrowing rate by the end of the year, according to CME Group data. Powell stressed that meeting the inflation side of its mandate will require keeping inflation expectations in check, something that might not be easy to do with Trump lobbing tariffs at U.S. trading partners, some of whom already have announced retaliatory measures. A greater focus on inflation also would be likely to deter the Fed from easing policy until it assesses what longer-term impact tariffs will have on prices. Typically, policymakers view tariffs as just a temporary rise in prices and not a fundamental inflation driver, but the broad nature of Trump's move could change that perspective. "While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent," Powell said. "Avoiding that outcome would depend on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, on the size of the effects, and on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices." Core inflation ran at a 2.8% annual rate in February, part of a general moderating pattern that is nonetheless still well above the Fed's 2% target. In spite of the elevated anxiety over tariffs, Powell said the economy for now "is still in a good place," with a solid labor market. However, he mentioned recent consumer surveys showing rising concerns about inflation and dimming expectations for future growth, pointing out that longer-term inflation expectations are still in line with the Fed's objectives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Friday called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates, even as his tariff blitz roiled markets and raised fears of a rebound in inflation. "This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates. He is always 'late,' but he could now change his image, and quickly," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Trump's post comes as global equity markets are selling off sharply. The president's new tariff policy, unveiled Wednesday, has raised concerns about a global economic slowdown. The central bank has paused its rate cuts in recent meetings, in part because progress on reducing inflation appeared to have plateaued. The new tariffs could lead to a widespread rise in prices, at least temporarily, that further complicates the inflation picture. On Friday, Powell told business journalists in Arlington, Virginia, that the Fed was "well positioned to wait for greater clarity" before making changes like rate reductions. He also said that the tariffs announced were "significantly larger than expected." Market-based interest rates have already fallen sharply this week, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield now below 4%. Treasury yields often fall when investors are worried about a potential recession. At a meeting last month, central bankers projected just two rate reductions. Trump has downplayed concerns about this week's market volatility, at one point comparing the reaction to a patient who undergoes surgery. Trump regularly commented on central bank policy during his first term as president and was often at odds with Powell. That has led to speculation that he might look to remove the Fed chair before his term ends next year. Trump said in December that he does not intend to fire Powell, and the Fed chair has said he doesn't think the president is legally allowed to do so. The Fed has two main goals in promoting price stability and maximizing employment. The March nonfarm payrolls report released Friday showed a slight increase in unemployment to 4.2%, but the rise of 228,000 jobs was more than expected. Friday's jobs report does not reflect any impact of the tariffs announced this week. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Melanie Moroz now has enough makeup, skincare, and hair care products to last two years. Moroz told Business Insider that while she's been stocking up for a couple of months, efforts by the White House to dismantle the Department of Education put her into "hyper-gear stockpiling mode" because she's fearful she could lose a teaching job she's held for about 25 years. Moroz, who lives in Morgantown, West Virginia, said she's now saving funds that once went to DoorDash, shopping, and dining out. Moroz isn't alone in thinking about what she might alternatively accumulate or cut back on amid fears that tariffs will make much of what Americans buy more expensive. (If you're interested in what BI reporters and editors are choosing to spend on and why, you can read about that here.) While President Donald Trump has repeatedly flip-flopped in his tariff announcements, he signed an executive order Wednesday to impose a 10% baseline tariff on all countries that would go into effect on Saturday. Following the news, Mark Cuban advised Americans to "buy lots of consumables now." Some US consumers, worried about the economy's prospects and experiencing flashbacks to pandemic-era supply-chain kinks, are wasting no time. For months, Elizabeth Blackstock and her husband have been "keeping an eye on" price changes resulting from tariffs. Following Wednesday's announcement, though, their priority is stocking up on food and medication for their six rescue cats, some of whom, Blackstock said, require special diets because of illnesses. Beyond that, the couple is looking to grab extras of everyday items like hair products and meat they could store in their deep freezer. Blackstock, who lives in San Antonio, said that even though they're doubling down on essentials, she still feels unsettled because of seesawing tariff announcements. "It was like, 'Is that going to be heavily tariffed now?' Felix Tintelnot, an associate professor of economics at Duke University, told BI that if you're in a secure position, it doesn't hurt to stock up on goods likely to become more expensive. In 2024, the US imported $7.59 billion worth of beauty goods, including makeup and skincare products, according to government figures. Tintelnot said worries that the economy will falter under the new trade rules might prompt more people to focus on saving. He also said if a recession does happen, not everyone would be hit equally, in part because job security differs across industries. Some people are already preparing for bumps and discussing their moves online in forums such as Reddit. One Reddit user who said he lives in Illinois told BI that much of his spending would come to "a complete standstill" for things that aren't essential. Items the US imports, like fruit, avocados, and tea, "are all a luxury now," he said, adding that he plans to switch to canned fruits to satisfy his "sweet cravings" or buy fresh fruit when it's in season from local vendors. But now, tariffs combined with international shipping rates could stop that. "I just can't afford an additional $100 in fees," he said. Another Reddit poster, who said they live in Florida, messaged BI that they plan to buy a variety of spices, basmati and jasmine rice, dry beans, and olive oil "to ride this out and have a buffer." That's another reason to collect what they can, the person said. "If prices are going to jump 10-30%, that's a better ROI than the stock market," they wrote. A Reddit user who said they live in Arkansas told BI that between the tariffs and what could happen with gas prices, they're stocking up on shelf-stable goods like freeze-dried fruit to have snacks their kids will eat on hand. The person said they've often heard that companies will stop raising prices when customers can't afford to pay them. "That has never been my experience as an Arkansan," they wrote.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JPMorgan's chief global economist has a bleak outlook on President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policy: "There will be blood." In a research note to clients published on Thursday, JPMorgan's Bruce Kasman, along with several other company economists, warned that the risk of the global economy falling into a recession has increased from 40% to 60% in response to Wednesday's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement. Trump on Wednesday announced sweeping 10% tariffs on goods from any country imported into the United States, and even higher tariffs for 60 trading partners with a persistent trade deficit with the US. The wide-reaching "Liberation Day" tariffs impact countries including China and Japan, as well as the European Union, and territories near Antarctica inhabited only by penguins. They are in addition to existing tariffs against the United States' top trade partners, Canada and Mexico. "The latest news reinforces our fears as US trade policy has turned decisively less business-friendly than we had anticipated." The banking giant's economists describe tariffs "at a basic level" as a functional tax increase on US household and business purchases of imported goods. Its effects could be magnified "through retaliation, a slide in US business sentiment, and supply chain disruptions." "We thus emphasize that these policies, if sustained, would likely push the US and possibly global economy into recession this year. "Beyond the obvious point that policy actions may be changed in the coming weeks, we continue to emphasize that the US and global expansions stand on solid ground and should be able to withstand a modest-sized shock." For now, though, the note indicates JPMorgan's economists "view the full implementation of announced policies as a substantial macroeconomic shock" — one not easily recovered from, should Trump's policies persist.</p>
