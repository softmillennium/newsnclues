Oops, something went wrong

Some of the biggest bosses on Wall Street aren't hitting the panic button on President Trump's policies this week despite the recent gyration in markets, even as they acknowledge some new concerns from the business world.

Blackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman said earlier this week that US tariffs will produce more manufacturing in the United States “at the end of the day," and "given the size of the US, that tends to be a good thing for the world.”

Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon said Wednesday, "I think the business community understands what the president is trying to do with tariffs," even if executives do want "lower tariffs everywhere."

BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink said Wednesday that while he does hear from CEOs that "the economy is weakening as we speak," he predicts that "if we are able to unlock private capital ... that will restart and rekindle the next wave of a bull market."

Wall Street certainly has a lot riding on Trump 2.0. At the beginning of the year, bankers were wildly optimistic that the Trump administration's pro-growth agenda and deregulatory stance would unleash the market's animal spirits and spur a flurry of US deals.

But the uncertainty surrounding the administration's trade policies is roiling markets and raising new concerns about the direction of the US economy and inflation.

That is making it more challenging for bankers and executives to know how trade changes could affect their supply chains or if they should pull the trigger on a public listing or a merger.

At the beginning of this week, Goldman Sachs (GS) became the first major Wall Street firm to lower its year-end price target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), after the major index tumbled into near-correction territory and the firm reduced its outlook for GDP.

Though less bullish than the major bank initially expected, the new forecast is still optimistic — it's 11% higher than the index's all-time high set in February.

Solomon said Wednesday on Fox Business Network's "Mornings with Maria" that he still expects a pickup in certain deals this year.

"The level of uncertainty is a little bit higher, and that has kept some possible transactions on the sidelines, but the overall level of dialogue, as people are thinking strategically about where they want to drive their businesses, is certainly increasing."

"There is potential, especially if we got more specific actions on the regulatory front, to unleash more animal spirits," he added.

Trump did make an effort this week to speak directly to Solomon and some of the other top CEOs at a meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, D.C.

"There's a renewed spirit," the president told the executives, adding that "the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country."

During a portion of the meeting closed to the press, Trump laid out other parts of his agenda — including extending the corporate tax cuts, speeding up approvals on environmental projects, and bringing more jobs and plants back to the US, according to a person familiar with the remarks.

The next day, one attendee, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, downplayed the effect tariffs thus far may be having on consumer sentiment.

"I don't think the average American consumer who wakes up in the morning and goes to work, which there are like 175 million of them, changes what they're going to do because they read about tariffs," Dimon said in an interview with a Semafor reporter at a Washington, D.C., event hosted by BlackRock and the Bipartisan Policy Center.

"But," he added, in a nod to some unease in the business world, "I do think companies might. Uncertainty is not a good thing."

Since Trump took office, Dimon has, in some measure, applauded the Trump administration's efforts to cut down on Washington, D.C.'s bureaucracy and publicly rebuked tariff worries without delivering an outright judgment on whether the cost-cutting efforts or trade policies have gone too far.

Days into Trump's second term, Dimon said of tariffs, "If it's a little inflationary, but it's good for national security, so be it. I mean, get over it," while speaking with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

He made similar points on March 7 during a talk at Stanford University, calling the current impact of tariffs "very modestly inflationary" and said the effect on that part of the economic picture was being "blown out of proportion."

However, he acknowledged scenarios where the impact could be bigger. "Now, if you put 25% tariffs on all imports, okay, that's a lot more. That could be, in my viewpoint, recessionary and inflationary," Dimon added.

Fink, who runs the world's largest money manager, has already shown that his company's moves can align with the priorities of the Trump administration.

It came last week when a BlackRock-led coalition struck a $22.8 billion deal with Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison that included taking control of two ports located on either end of the Panama Canal.

The move gave Trump what he asked for on his first day in office — a larger American presence in a crucial shipping lane where he had alleged Chinese interference.

Fink himself cleared the deal with Trump and other White House officials, according to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.

This week, Fink offered optimism even amid some uncertainty. "The world economies, over a long cycle, are going to be fine," Fink said Monday at an event in Houston.

On Tuesday he told CNN: "Could we have one quarter or two quarters of a flattening of our economy as we try to reset the economy? Absolutely."

But, he added, Trump's policies, including tariffs, "can be very productive for the United States" in the long run. As for market losses this week, he said "there's nothing wrong with a market pullback."

"I look at that as a buying opportunity because I'm very bullish on America."

Laura and Francisco Gonzalez and two of their children stand in front of their third Javi's Chicken and Churros restaurant at 1520 N. Fourth Ave. in Pasco. It is their first restaurant in Tri-Cities. They have two other locations in Grandview and Sunnyside and a food truck coming soon in Yakima.

The building once home to Pasco's longest continuously operating restaurant is now serving up cuisine from another continent.

The Chinese food once dished up at 1520 N. Fourth Ave. has given way to south of the border and Southern California favorites, such as loaded carne asada (lime-marinated steak) fries, birria (goat or beef cooked in broth), pollo loco (fire-grilled chicken) and, of course, deep-fried cinnamon encrusted churros with a variety of sauces and sweet toppings.

Javi's Chicken and Churros opened in November 2024. The owners, Francisco and Laura Gonzalez of Sunnyside, operate two other restaurants under the same name in Grandview and Sunnyside.

They named the business after their first son, Javi, who was about 4 years old when it opened.

The couple say they are excited that the Pasco Javi's provides an opportunity to offer a bigger food and drink menu.

At its heart, Francisco Gonzalez said Javi's menu is a coming-together of many unique regional Mexican cuisines, but with a focus on the border town food his family enjoyed living in Southern California.

“In a border town, you get people who migrate there from all corners of Mexico, so you find everything there,” he said.

Francisco Gonzalez recalled that when his family moved to Washington eight years ago, he noticed that a lot of foods they were used to seeing – like birria and flame-broiled chicken – weren't often on local menus.

He said there is a heavy focus among area Mexican restaurants on carnitas, chicharrones and other styles from other regions.

His parents are from Jalisco where birria is said to derive from, so with his mom's help finetuning the recipes, he made that the center of several headlining dishes.

“Our signature dish would be our birria tacos: doraditas,” he said. Doraditas, per Javi's menu, are crunchy tacos with birria meat topped with melted cheese, onion, cilantro and guacamole.

“We also sell a lot of our fajitas, molcajetes, as well as (seafood) and prime cuts of meat like steaks, rib eye and New York cuts,” he said.

Everything is cooked fresh daily. “Rice, beans, all our meats … a lot is cooked to order. We notice from a lot of restaurants that they'll cook off certain items for the whole week and have them frozen to reheat as they go, but we don't do that here.”

Like many businesses that started in the last several years, a defining moment for Javi's was the Covid-19 pandemic, which occurred a little over a year after it opened.

“After Covid hit, we started doing even better (business). People were staying local and we were just doing to-go orders,” Francisco Gonzalez said, adding that the uptick enabled him and his wife to pursue their second location in Sunnyside, which is similar in size to the Pasco restaurant and caters more toward nightlife as it features a bar, lounge, pool tables, darts and more, as well as regular live music offerings.

“It kind of came at a perfect time because when we were a month away from opening, they had massive layoffs at my job. Then, a week after we opened the (second) restaurant it ended up getting busy enough that my wife had to quit her job, too, as a schoolteacher,” he said.

His wife is now a stay-at-home mom and ongoing partner in the business along with several of their family members, including both of his parents, his brother, who manages the Pasco location, his sister and several cousins.

Riding on the success and revenue from their first two businesses, Tri-Cities was the next place to go given the large Latino community.

The previous restaurant building owners prided themselves on maintaining the retro restaurant appearance, but beneath the decor there was a lot in need of updating.

In April 2022, the Tri-Cities Area Journal of Business announced the retirement of Chinese Gardens' longtime owners, Ted and Amy Wong.

The Wongs put the building up for sale shortly thereafter and sold it to the Gonzalezes for $700,000 in 2023, according to the property records.

Francisco Gonzalez said they have invested more than $200,000 in renovations, including replacing the HVAC system, fumigation, new hard floors throughout the 8,052-square-foot facility, new bar and kitchen equipment, reupholstering seating, new lighting, repainting inside and out and all new decor, among others.

“We're still not done,” he noted.

One novelty diners may recognize from the restaurant's former life is the collection of 325 vintage Jim Beam whiskey decanters. However, Francisco Gonzalez said they probably won't stay in favor of decor that celebrates the culture of the restaurant and its cuisine.

Francisco Gonzalez said he looks forward to being able to host more events such as DJ nights, live music, karaoke, a “speakeasy” themed night and more at the new Pasco location like the Sunnyside Javi's is able to.

However, he's run up against code roadblocks with the city of Pasco as other downtown businesses occupying older buildings have likewise encountered.

He said the biggest is “they want older buildings to retrofit sprinkler systems ... which would cost us $60,000,” Francisco Gonzalez said.

He described Pasco's building code as very stringent to the point “of thinking about just selling the place” and relocating elsewhere in Tri-Cities.

For now, he's sticking it out.

“We're here to serve the community,” he said. “We're grateful for all our customers and the community that's been supporting us and keeping us busy.”

In just a few weeks, they will be opening a Javi's Chicken and Churros food truck, which will be permanently parked at Single Hill Brewery in Yakima.

“We're going to do birria, tacos, a more basic menu but also some really good vegetarian options over there,” Francisco Gonzalez said.

Javi's also offers catering and online ordering.

Reflecting on the busy past seven years, he and Laura are proud to have a Javi's location to pass down to each of their children, which was one of their business aspirations from the onset.

With three restaurants and a food truck under their belt, one might wonder where they plan to go next, but Francisco Gonzalez said, “This is kind of where I want to stop. I want to be able to dedicate more time to my kids right now while they're little.”

Hours are 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday to Thursday, 10 a.m. to 1 a.m. Friday to Sunday, closed Mondays.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European markets closed lower Thursday as further threats from U.S. President Donald Trump pressured global trading relationships.

Wine and spirits firms Pernod Ricard, Rémy Cointreau and Davide Campari were all more than 3% lower after Trump threatened on social media to place a 200% tariff on wines, champagnes and alcoholic products coming out of France and other countries in the European Union. Trump said he was responding to the EU's own new 50% tariff on whiskey out on the U.S.

Drinks giant Diageo, owner of brands including Johnnie Walker and Guinness, was just 0.2% lower, while luxury conglomerate LVMH — parent firm of Moët & Chandon and Hennessy — closed 1.1% lower.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 ended the session 0.15% lower with sectors diverging. Autos were the biggest laggards down 1.7%, as traders continued to assess the impact of the latest U.S. tariffs as well as counter-tariffs from the European Union, Canada and beyond on the industry.

Pharma giant Novo Nordisk was among the top performers, rebounding from Tuesday losses tied to disappointing weight loss drug trial results, to trade 4% higher. Analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux on Thursday upgraded the stock to buy from hold, citing priced-in risks and expected higher sales of its Wegovy treatment.

The Stoxx 600 snapped a four-session losing streak on Wednesday amid optimism about a ceasefire in the Ukraine-Russia war and lower-than-expected U.S. inflation.

The inflation figures bolstered optimism about the direction of the economy — amid growing concerns about a U.S. recession — although economists warn that tariffs are likely to quickly lead to higher prices for consumers.

However, U.S. stocks opened lower Thursday amid the latest trade volatility.

Thursday marks the second and final day of CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE event in Singapore, where business leaders, investors and policymakers are discussing the brewing global trade war. Follow CNBC's live coverage from event here.

Shares of LVMH, which trade in France, shed 1% on Thursday.

The luxury stock, which owns brands such as Hennessy and Moet & Chandon, slipped on more trade war fears after President Donald Trump threatened to levy a 200% tariff on wine and champagne exported from the European Union. LVMH is now on pace for its ninth straight negative day, which would mark its longest losing streak since August 2021.

Gold's April-dated futures were last trading near 2,963.3, near their highs of the session. They were closing in on their record high of 2,974 from Feb. 24.

Gold has gained 1.6% week to date, pacing for their second weekly gain. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX), which encompasses both gold and silver miners, rose 2% and was on pace for its third straight day of gains.

The S&P 500 opened lower on Thursday, giving up some of its Wednesday gains

The market benchmark shed 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 85 points, or 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4%.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday he plans to put a 200% tariff on alcohol from France and other European nations in the latest escalation of global trade tensions.

The U.S. tariff comes after the European Union moved to reinstate an import tax on American whiskey.

"The European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% Tariff on Whisky. If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.," Trump said on Truth Social.

The producer price index, a measure of wholesale inflation, was flat in February — another potential sign that inflation pressures may be ebbing. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a month-over-month increase of 0.3%.

Shares of British food delivery firm Deliveroo were down 6.9% on Thursday morning after the company said it expected slower growth this year.

The company reported net profit of £2.9 million ($3.7 million) in 2024, compared with a £31.8 million loss incurred during the previous year, marking the food company's first time making a profit since it was founded in 2013.

Its gross transaction value per order was £25.1 million in 2024, up 3% from 2023, and its orders increased 2% year-on-year to 296 million in 2024. Revenue also rose 2% to £2.07 billion.

The company cited reduced cost of living pressures during the year in some of its major markets and increased demand for its grocery business, for its growth.

Will Shu, Deliveroo's founder and CEO, said the company's first full-year profit and positive free cash flows indicate that its strategy is working.

For 2025, the company expects GTV to be in the high-single digits percentage growth while adjusted is forecast to come in lower than in 2024 as the company makes "focused investments to drive further growth opportunities."

Deliveroo now also sees its margin growth to hit 4% from 2026, compared with a previous forecast of reaching that objective by the timeline.

Deutsche Bank flagged autos as a "growing risk" for its portfolio that is being "monitored closely given the challenging economic environment in Europe, Electric Vehicles (EV) transition and competition in China," Germany's largest lender said in its annual report out Thursday. 

Europe's auto sector now faces further pressures from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and separate duties on goods from countries in which several carmakers have production lines. 

Deutsche Bank noted the industry outlook "remains subdued," while also warning of the impact of "U.S. import tariffs affecting sales in the key market U.S., competition from China and persistent excess capacities around the globe."

— Ruxandra Iordache

Hugo Boss on Thursday posted fourth-quarter sales in line with expectations, but provided a tepid growth forecast for the year, citing "macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility" and continued weakness in China.

The German fashion house recorded revenues of 1.25 billion euros [$1.35 billion] in the three-month period, just marginally ahead of the 1.2 billion euros forecast by LSEG analysts. Net income came in at 126 million euros, just shy of the 128 million euros anticipated.

Full year sales increased 3% to total 4.3 billion euros, also in line with forecast. Operating income fell 12% over the period to 361 million euros, after the company lowered its full-year outlook in July on challenging macroeconomic factors.

The company said it expected those challenges to persist into 2025, forecasting group sales to increase or decline by up to 2% over the year. Asia-Pacific sales were cited as a particular laggard amid "ongoing uncertainties regarding the further recovery of industry development in China."

"Subdued consumer sentiment and muted store traffic have been weighing on business performance since the beginning of the year, with the overall market environment remaining uncertain also going forward," the company said in a statement.

The chief executive of Ferrari on Thursday said the company was prepared for potential U.S. tariffs on European automakers.

"We are ready with some countermeasures," Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna told CNBC's Robert Frank at CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore on Thursday.

"We are watching what's going to happen in the next month, next weeks ... we are on the same boat in terms of tariffs," he added.

European automakers have been grappling with trade policy uncertainty in recent months, with the threat of U.S. import tariffs raising alarm bells among many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

Prospects for a broad deal between the U.S. and China have improved following Donald Trump's election as president, two former diplomats said during a panel discussion at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE.

David Adelman, former U.S. ambassador to Singapore, said Trump's tough stance on trade put him in a stronger position to overcome domestic opposition when negotiating with Beijing, much like when former U.S. President Richard Nixon reestablished ties with China in the 1970s.

"No one can accuse Trump of being soft on China," he said.

Kishore Mahbubani, a prominent former Singapore diplomat, said both the U.S. and China know there will be no winners in a conflict between the two giants.

The private equity market is likely to experience a shake-up, with some fund managers unable to raise cash amid difficulty in monetizing current investments.

Serena Tan, CEO of Gaia Investment Partners, a Malaysian fund of funds manager, said exits from existing private equity funds are still challenging because of lackluster activity in the initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions markets. This meant there was less cash to recycle into new private equity investments, she said.

Many private equity funds may have raised their last funds, Tan added.

Spirit Airlines is out of bankruptcy, hitting its target to emerge in the first quarter, after a crippling few years. CEO Ted Christie says the carrier is leaner and ready to take on competitors, including rival Southwest Airlines.

Earlier this week, Southwest shocked customers by announcing it will start charging for checked bags for the first time in its half-century of flying, a huge strategy move for the largest domestic U.S. carrier. (There are some exceptions to Southwest new bag rules, which take effect in late May.)

"I think it's going to be painful for a little bit as they find their footing, and we're going to take advantage of that," Spirit's Christie said in an interview Thursday.

Southwest had been a standout in the U.S. by offering all customers two free checked bags, a perk that has endured recessions, spikes in fuel prices and other crises while most rivals introduced bag fees and raised them every few years.

Spirit Airlines, on the other hand, made a la carte pricing common in the U.S., with fees for seat assignments, checked bags and other add-ons. It's a strategy most large airlines, except for Southwest, have copied in one form or another.

As Southwest starts charging for bags and introduces its first basic economy class, which doesn't include a seat assignment or allow free changes, Spirit could possibly win over customers, Christie said.

Southwest said it would get rid of its single-class open seating model last year.

"There at least was an audience of people who were intentionally selecting and flying Southwest because they felt that it was easy. They knew they were going to get two bags," Christie said. "Now that that's no longer the case, it's easy to say that they're going to widen their aperture and they're now going to look around."

Spirit is far smaller than Southwest and even smaller than it was last year, but it competes with the airline in cities like Kansas City, Missouri; Nashville, Columbus, Ohio; and Milwaukee. If customers look on travel sites like Expedia, where Southwest is a new entrant, Spirit's tickets could be cheaper and appear higher in results, Christie said.

Other airline executives have also said they expect to win over some Southwest customers.

Delta Air Lines President Glen Hauenstein said at a JPMorgan industry conference Tuesday that there are consumers who choose Southwest based on its free-bag perk "and now those customers are up for grabs."

Spirit, for its part, has recently been offering more ticket bundles that include things like seat assignments and luggage.

The carrier is now focused on returning to profitability. It posted a net loss of more than $1.2 billion last year, more than double its loss in 2023 as it grappled with grounded jets because of a Pratt & Whitney engine recall, higher costs, more domestic competition and a failed acquisition by JetBlue Airways.

Spirit has rejected multiple recent merger attempts by fellow budget carrier Frontier Airlines. Christie said Thursday that nothing is "off the table" and that a fifth-largest airline as a low cost carrier in the U.S. makes sense, but that the airline is focused on stabilizing itself after bankruptcy.

Through its restructuring process, which started in November, Spirit said it reduced its debt by about $795 million. The transaction converted debt into equity for major creditors. The carrier also received a $350 million equity infusion. 

Spirit plans to relist its shares on a stock exchange but hasn't set a date yet.

Turmoil on Wall Street is keeping financial planners' phones ringing as 401(k) holders watch their retirement account balances fall with the stock markets they're tied to. For the most part, they're being told to sit tight and breathe through it.

“I've seen more concern and fear with clients that I've talked to over the last month or so than I have since the financial crisis,” said Jude Boudreaux, a senior financial planner at the Planning Center, a New Orleans-based firm. He added that this week has been especially hectic. “People are really concerned.”

Vanese Pitts said she watched her husband's 401(k) shed $8,000 on Monday, when a wide-ranging market selloff pushed the S&P 500 to its lowest close since September. The sharp downturn in recent days followed several weeks of losses on Wall Street that have left the stock index about 4.8% lower than where it started the year. Many 401(k)s follow the broad-based S&P closely.

“It was just insane,” said the 41-year-old, who's raising two kids alongside her husband, a software engineer, in Birmingham, Alabama.

Pitts was among those who took to social media platforms to crowdsource advice and commiserate this week, as President Donald Trump's trade war with America's closest allies sends tremors through millions of savers' retirement investments. His chaotic rollout of new tariffs, the retaliatory levies they've triggered, and an ongoing purge of federal workers have stoked fears of rebounding inflation and a potential economic downturn.

Lee Baker, founder and president of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta, said he'd been fielding anxious calls from clients — most of them in or near retirement — for the past week or so. He was surprised to hear so much concern “from people who, mathematically, really don't have a problem in terms of making it through whatever this might be,” he said.

I've seen more concern and fear with clients that I've talked to over the last month or so than I have since the financial crisis.

Jude Boudreaux, The Planning Center, New Orleans

“Clients, particularly in times like these, don't want to hear, ‘Essentially, do nothing. It's going to be all right,'” Baker said.

That was the gist of Katie Szykman's mother's advice when the 23-year-old Philadelphian called in a panic. She had been contributing 6% of her paycheck to her employer's 403(b) — a type of retirement account offered by public schools and charities — for barely two years and watched more than $1,000 vanished in a matter of days, she said.

“My mom was like, ‘Don't even touch it,'” said Szykman, who works in marketing at a local nonprofit. “Everyone was always saying make sure you invest in your retirement, so [that was] the first thing I did once I got my first job outside of college. I can't say that I'm surprised. It just feels disheartening a little bit.”

Szykman said she found some comfort knowing that downturns have occurred in recent decades and that “people have gotten out of it.” Still, she feels frustrated having another economy-related issue to worry about — especially when “it didn't have to be this way,” she said.

“Having that money just kind of diminish a little bit when groceries are so expensive, it just takes a little bit of an extra toll,” she added.

Plenty of retirement savers have forgone the advice of Szykman's mother. Empower, a financial firm that administers retirement plans for some 19 million investors, told CNBC Wednesday that some account holders are increasingly shifting money toward safer investments. though the company emphasized that it's “not seeing widespread capitulation despite the downturn.”

While the activity accounts for only a sliver of overall balances, trading in 401(k)s has doubled over the past three weeks as savers yank money out of funds calibrated toward a target retirement date and those linked to big companies' stocks, according to the Alight Solutions 401(k) index. Lower-risk investments including government bonds, money market accounts and so-called stable value funds have swelled over the same period.

Financial planners generally urge clients to think carefully before adjusting their 401(k)s, though changing the makeup of an account's portfolio is far different than withdrawing funds early, which entails paying a penalty.

In terms of investments, Baker said those looking to build some cushion into their portfolios could look to TIPS, or Treasury inflation-protected securities, which are indexed to inflation to guard investors from a decline in purchasing power. TIPS funds have returned an average 3.4% so far this year, according to Morningstar, making it a top-performing bond fund category.

He also pointed to a recent uptake in “buffered products” like S&P 500-tracked exchange-traded funds, where high-performing assets are locked and evenly proportioned for a period of time. But investors who move in that direction should be comfortable missing out on potential gains, Baker warned. If markets reverse and bound higher, “remember we had this conversation, because in this moment you were afraid,” he said.

Some planners also advised having a good mix of international funds in their portfolios.

Previously, “international [stocks were] something that you kind of had to apologize for” as an adviser, said Samuel Deane, founder and president of Rora Wealth in Atlanta. But some ETFs that exclude U.S. stocks have been performing remarkably well, he said.

Boudreaux agreed but pointed out that many international companies' revenues are heavily linked to the U.S. market, limiting the potential appeal of foreign stocks.

“It's a very globally connected world, and that applies to our investments also,” he said.

Clients, particularly in times like these, don't want to hear, ‘Essentially, do nothing. It's going to be all right.'

Lee Baker, Claris Financial Advisors, Atlanta

Planners also said it's OK to take a more conservative approach with future retirement contributions rather than touching what's already there.

“People are tightening up,” said Kevin Mahoney, founder of Illumint, a Washington, D.C.-based firm. “So there's some uncertainty about spending or investing savings now. It's less about existing investments and more focus on potential investments that they might have planned.”

And for investors nearer to retirement than others, now is also a good time to focus on cash flow, said Boudreaux.

“I like clients to have a good cash reserve heading into retirement,” he said. “It allows them to be more selective when they sell from their portfolio, and to not have to sell every month if we are heading into a downturn.”

“The goal with any of these things is to respond — and not react,” he added.

As difficult as it's been for Pitts to “just let it stay and hope for the best,” she said she and her husband aren't touching their retirement funds. Instead, they're thinking about getting a financial adviser to help them protect their savings.

“Every day it's something different,” Pitts said. “Something that's not good.”

A composite decking company is looking to open a $70 million manufacturing plant in Lackawanna.

Michigan-based group Deckorators has submitted an application to the Erie County Industrial Development Agency to lease property on Commerce Drive. The application states that Deckorators is also planning to make improvements to the existing property and construct a new facility.

The company will have a public hearing on Friday with the ECIDA, during which anyone will be able to express their opinions either in favor of or opposed to the project. The hearing will also address potential tax breaks.

The hearing will take place at 9 a.m. at Lackawanna City Hall. A live stream will be made available on the ECIDA website.</p>

Belgian Prosecutors Arrest Suspects in Huawei Bribery Probe Targeting EU Parliament

BRUSSELS (AP) — Belgian federal prosecutors on Thursday announced the arrests of several people in a corruption probe linked to the European Parliament and the Chinese company Huawei, which is suspected of bribing EU lawmakers.

The arrests came as an investigation by Le Soir newspaper and other media said lobbyists working for the Chinese telecoms giant were suspected of bribing current or former European Parliament members to promote the company's commercial policies in Europe.

The prosecutor's office confirmed in a statement that the alleged bribery “is said to have benefited Huawei.” 

About 100 federal police officers carried out 21 searches in Brussels, the Flanders and Wallonia regions, and Portugal. The investigating magistrate in charge of the case also asked for seals to be placed on offices inside the EU Parliament allocated to two parliamentary assistants allegedly involved.

Prosecutors said one person was arrested in France.

The suspects would be questioned over “alleged involvement in active corruption within the European Parliament, as well as for forgery and use of forgeries,” prosecutors said. “The offences were allegedly committed by a criminal organization.”

The company said in a statement that “Huawei takes these allegations seriously and will urgently communicate with the investigation to further understand the situation.”

“Huawei has a zero tolerance policy towards corruption or other wrongdoing, and we are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations at all times,” it added.

The European Parliament said only that the assembly “takes note of the information" and "always cooperates fully with the judicial authorities.”

Huawei, which makes cellphones and is the biggest maker of networking gear for phone and internet carriers, has been caught in tensions between the United States and China over technology and trade. 

READ:  

Some European nations have followed Washington's lead and banned Huawei's equipment from next-generation mobile networks over allegations that it poses a security risk that could help facilitate Chinese spying. The company has repeatedly denied this.

European Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier said the EU's executive branch had no comment regarding the investigation but underlined the commission's security concerns about Huawei and Europe's fifth-generation mobile phone networks.

“The security of our 5G networks is obviously crucial for our economy,” Regnier told reporters. “Huawei represents materially higher risks than other 5G suppliers.”

EU member states should swiftly "adopt decisions to restrict or to exclude Huawei from their 5G networks,” Regnier said. “A lack of swift action would expose the EU as a whole to a clear risk.”

The prosecutor's office said it believes there was corruption “from 2021 to the present day" in various forms, "such as remuneration for taking political positions or excessive gifts such as food and travel expenses or regular invitations to football matches."

Prosecutors also believe payments might have been disguised as business expenses and in some cases may have been directed to third parties. They said they would also look to "detect any evidence of money laundering.”

Police seized several documents and objects during the searches. Staff at Huawei's offices in Brussels declined to comment and turned the lights off inside to avoid photographs taken through the window.

This is the second corruption case targeting the EU Parliament in less than three years. 

In December 2022, the legislature was shaken by a corruption scandal in which Qatari officials were accused of bribing EU officials to play down labor rights concerns ahead of the soccer World Cup.

The scandal scarred the reputation of the EU's only institution comprised of officials elected directly in the 27 member countries. It undermined the assembly's claim to the moral high ground in its own investigations, such as into allegations of corruption in member country Hungary.

EU Greens lawmaker Daniel Freund — who supervised the work of the assembly's ethics body during the scandal, dubbed Qatargate — said Thursday the parliament's reputation is again under threat.

“The risk of corruption in Brussels is high because the EU is so influential," he said. "We need a complete investigation quickly, and finally reforms that will make the Parliament more resistant to corruption.”

According to Follow The Money, an investigative journalism platform, one of the main suspects in the probe is 41-year-old Valerio Ottati, a Belgian-Italian lobbyist who joined Huawei in 2019. 

Before becoming Huawei's EU public affairs director, Ottati was an assistant to two Italian MEPs who were both members of a European Parliament group dealing with China policy, Follow the Money reported.

Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard has reiterated its determination to acquire Seven & i Holdings, although the operator of Japan's top convenience store chain has rejected its offer

Canada's Couche-Tard's Chief Stresses 'Friendly' Interest in Japan's 7-Eleven Chain

TOKYO (AP) — Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard reaffirmed Thursday that it is determined to acquire Seven & i Holdings, although the operator of Japan's top convenience store chain has rejected its offer.

“We are continuing to pursue a friendly, mutually agreeable transaction,” the chairman and founder of Alimentation Couche-Tard, Alain Bouchard, told reporters in Tokyo. 

Bouchard stressed that his company was pursuing a “friendly” transaction, not a hostile takeover. He reiterated his promise to retain local management, saying the merger would be good for 7-Eleven's business.

The chain has more than 20,000 stores nationwide and more than 80,000 outlets around the world, serving an estimated 63 million customers a day, according to Tokyo-based Seven & i Holdings Co. 

In rejecting the Canadian company's offer, Seven & i Holdings said it intends to boost its own corporate value. It also has raised antitrust concerns that it says will come up in the U.S. 

Seven & i appointed a new chief executive this month and announced a share buyback and said it will sell its supermarket subsidiary to U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital, to help boost its value and fend off the acquisition.

Last year, Couche-Tard, which operates Circle K stores, proposed acquiring all of Seven & i Holdings shares for $14.86 per share in cash. Media reports now say the offer is for $18.19 per share, or about 7 trillion yen ($47 billion).

Seven & i has made public a letter that Stephen Dacus, its new chief executive, sent to Bouchard in September, explaining why it was rejecting the Canadian company's offer. 

“The proposal is not in the best interest of 7&i shareholders and other stakeholders. We are open to engaging in sincere discussions should you put forth a proposal that fully recognizes our standalone intrinsic value,” Dacus wrote.

Convenience stores, known as “conbini” in Japan, are popular, offering various services such as paying utility bills and selling concert tickets, while selling various everyday goods. 

Seven & i announced a restructuring plan last year to strengthen its U.S. business and streamline operations, closing some Ito-Yokado supermarkets in Japan. In 2023, Seven & i sold its Sogo & Seibu department stores in Japan to Fortress Investment Group, a U.S. fund, for $1.5 billion.

Couche-Tard, founded in 1980 in Quebec, offers coffee, beer, snacks, fuel and lottery tickets. It runs more than 16,800 stores worldwide, including in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

There are now eight businesses near George Floyd Square who've filed lawsuits against the city of Minneapolis, claiming their businesses have suffered because the city failed to open the intersection and 38th and Chicago in a timely and safe manner.

Attorney Michael Healey represents all of the business owners in the suit. He told 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS why his clients are seeking financial compensation.

“The complaint represents both Cup Foods and seven other business owners at the intersection essentially that their businesses were destroyed by the conduct of the city,” said Healey.

The plaintiffs are seeking $49 million, according to court records.

In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs claim they've lost income, employees and their property values have dropped significantly.

A city spokesperson issued a statement which said, in part, “As with all areas of the city, MPD provides 24/7 emergency response to the 38th and Chicago area. Chief O'Hara has assigned two officers to a dedicated beat in this area, focusing on community engagement, relationship-building, and collaborating with local businesses and residents.”

The next court hearing is later this month.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his new administration.

McALLEN, Texas (AP) — The Trump administration moved to drop a civil lawsuit Wednesday against the largest provider of housing for migrant children over allegations of sexual abuse and harassment of unaccompanied minors, saying it also would no longer use the provider.

The motion to dismiss the suit against Southwest Key Programs was filed after the federal government announced it had moved all unaccompanied children to other shelters.

The complaint, filed last year during the Biden administration, alleged a litany of offenses between 2015 and 2023 as Southwest Key Programs, which operates migrant shelters in Texas, Arizona and California, amassed nearly $3 billion in contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services. 

The agency said it stopped sending unaccompanied children to the provider's facilities “out of continuing concerns relating to these placements,” and said it would review grants going to the contractor. In view of the agency's action, the Department of Justice has dismissed its lawsuit against Southwest Key, HHS said in a statement. 

The shelter provider said they were pleased with the decision to dismiss the case. “Southwest Key strongly denied the claims relating to child sexual abuse in our shelters, and there is no settlement or payment required,” the statement Wednesday evening said. 

“We always believed the facts would prove the allegations to be without merit. We thank the Government for its commitment to reviewing the whole record and dropping the case with prejudice,” they added.




This week, Southwest Key Programs furloughed employees across the country. “Due to the unforeseen federal funding freeze and the stop placement order on our unaccompanied minor shelters and Home Study Post Release programs by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, we have made the difficult decision to furlough approximately 5,000 Southwest Key Programs' employees,” the company said in a statement shared Tuesday.

According to allegations in the 2024 lawsuit, Southwest Key employees, including supervisors, raped, inappropriately touched or solicited sex and nude images of children beginning at least in 2015.

Among the accusations: One employee “repeatedly sexually abused” three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas, with the 8-year-old telling investigators the worker “entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their ‘private area.'”

The lawsuit also alleged that another employee, at a shelter in Mesa, Arizona, took a 15-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020.

Children were warned not to report the alleged abuse and threatened with violence against themselves or their families if they did, according to the lawsuit. Victims testified that in some instances, other workers knew about the abuse but failed to report or concealed it, the complaint said.

“DOJ's lawsuit revealed horrific sexual abuse and inhumane treatment of children detained in Southwest Key shelters,” said Leecia Welch, an attorney who represents unaccompanied children in a separate case. “It's shocking to me that the government now turns a blind eye to their own contractor's actions. I hope the impacted children will have other legal recourse and support in healing from their abuse.”

The lawsuit may not be over. On Wednesday, the National Center for Youth Law asked the court not to dismiss the case and grant them an opportunity to formally intervene on behalf of those affected by the alleged abuse. If granted, they would have 30 days to file a motion in the lawsuit.

At least two employees have been indicted on criminal charges related to the allegations since 2020. 

The civil lawsuit had sought a jury trial and monetary damages for the victims.
