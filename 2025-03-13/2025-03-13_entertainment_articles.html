As she answered fans’ questions, one asked, “To me, you always look effortlessly beautiful for your skin, hair and makeup: what are your favorite products? “My pre-show routine is that I show up to this studio approximately five minutes after I was supposed to be in the studio.” She added, “I then proceed to frantically do my makeup while we go through our rundown.” The TV personality, 25, dished on her modified glam routine — which is more relaxed than what she’s been known for — in a Thursday, April 6, episode of Vogue’s “Beauty Secrets” YouTube series. “I’ve changed my look a lot,” Jenner explained […] Kylie doesn’t have many steps in her beauty routine. She first uses a Bare Minerals Matte Loose Powder Foundation, before going in with her CoverGirl Lash Blast mascara and adding a touch of Vaseline to her pout. “I have been wearing the same makeup since high school,” Kylie shared.

Donny Osmond hinted at when he plans to retire from live performance. “I mean, let’s be honest, it’s inevitable [to retire],” Osmond, 67, said on the Thursday, March 13, episode of The View. The “Soldier of Love” singer is currently headlining his first-ever solo Las Vegas residency at the Harrah’s Showroom, where he celebrates his 63 years in show business. Talk soon turned to whether Osmond was thinking about retirement, with the musician confirming that he’s given serious thought to stepping away from the stage. It’s a lot of work, and I put 100 percent into my show, but I still have a lot of fuel in this body.” “I’m looking into the eyes of myself 53 years ago, talking to him and singing with him … There’s a lot of negative things you can go down that path [with AI],” he said. “I’ve taken a break from social media for the past 9 months and will continue to do so as I have felt a need to unplug and spend time with family,” Marie, 65, wrote via Instagram on Wednesday, January […] Donny released his first solo song at 14 years old with “Sweet and Innocent” in 1971, and later scored a series of hits with sister Marie Osmond throughout the 1970s. Donny experienced a musical comeback in the late 1980s with “Soldier of Love” and “Sacred Emotion,” before reaching a whole new generation of young fans in the 1990s by voicing Captain Li Shang in Disney’s animated classic Mulan. The Osmond family endured a tragic loss earlier this year when Donny’s older brother Wayne Osmond died at age 73 after suffering a stroke in January. Numerous Osmonds publicly paid tribute to Wayne, including Donny sharing an emotional statement via Instagram. “Even though I know with certainty that I will see him again, there’s a vacancy in my heart that hurts,” Donny wrote in January. “I came across [some] pictures today and thought they would be perfect together. It’s all he ever talked about!” Marie, 65, recalled in her memorial statement. “I admired him, too, for his deep love and unwavering devotion to God our Father and His Son, our Savior, Jesus Christ. Throughout his life, Wayne was an honorable member of The @churchofjesuschrist It was his eternal compass, and he was a light to others as he testifies of God’s great plan of happiness for us in this life.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Aaron, 48, filed for divorce in Clark County, Nevada, on Wednesday, March 12, per records viewed by Us Weekly exclusively. In the filing, Aaron seeks to maintain his separate property and have their community assets divided equally. He is also seeking to have his single status restored. Aaron is also requesting that alimony not be rewarded to either him or Victoria, 32. The Alleged Hitman in ‘Ghost Adventures’ Murder Plot Grant Amato made headlines long before he was named in the alleged murder plot against Ghost Adventures star Aaron Goodwin. According to a police report obtained by Us Weekly, Amato was named as the Floridian prison inmate who was allegedly talking to Aaron’s wife, Victoria Goodwin. When contacted by Us Weekly, Aaron’s attorney said he could not comment on pending litigation. According to police reports obtained by Us, Victoria had been communicating with a Florida prison inmate named Grant Amato about wanting to leave her marriage. One of her alleged text messages read, “Am I a bad person? An arrest report claimed that Victoria, who has been married to Aaron for nearly three years, shared information about his whereabouts while filming Ghost Adventures in California. She allegedly allotted $11,515 to pay Amato in October 2024 and had spoken about a $2,500 upfront payment.

There are probably a lot of people who go up to an NYU film professor’s lectern on the first day and tell them that they want to be a filmmaker. Inbal Weinberg is maybe one of the few who has gone up and said, “I want to be a production designer.” In a time before places like Interior and Films or One Perfect Shot spotlighted how design and composition affect film audiences — to say nothing of Google Search’s ability to find examples of production design in the space of a few seconds — Weinberg knew in her bones that the visual worldbuilding organized by the production designer was how she could help tell stories. Counterintuitively, the films that actually drew Weinberg into a love of movies were not the ornate, period, or fantasy epics we often associate with production design. “When you sort of discard the ‘art for art’s sake’ reason for production design, then actually everything that the character uses or is surrounded by has an immense meaning.” This is not to say Weinberg doesn’t love injecting a little bit of art into the world of a film when it’s appropriate. “Nobody ever comes to film school [aiming for] a craft position. So I think [my professors] were actually very pleased. A lot of people come from architecture or theater design. But for me, it was really, ‘I love movies. At its best, it is even more collaborative than people realize. “I think department heads are usually viewed as, ‘OK, this is your universe. “We’re not just the heads of this department. Think of us as your compadres on this journey to making the film. We’re here to fulfill your vision in many ways, and it’s not necessarily bound by what is officially our job. But in making decisions about the visual world of the film and how it expresses character and tone, she’s also almost always making decisions that affect how the story is captured, too — in which country the film is shot, how much happens on a stage or at locations. But it’s something that Weinberg would like to see a lot more of as she continues her career. And I’m feeling like, ‘OK, if we practiced it a little less in the film industry, we [can] practice it less in life,” Weinberg said. From her very first collaboration with Cianfrance, Weinberg has learned that there are many ways of making a film. “Filmcraft: Inbal Weinberg” plays March 14-16 at Metrograph in New York.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

During a recent episode of The Kardashians, the reality star, 44, revealed that she still possesses her first engagement ring from West, 47, designed by famed celebrity jeweler Lorraine Schwartz. It was notably the only piece of jewelry that she opted to leave behind during her ill-fated trip to Paris in 2016 – a decision that, in hindsight, proved remarkably prescient. The Skims founder was attending Paris Fashion Week when thieves broke in late one night and stole over $10 million of jewelry from her apartment at the Hotel de Pourtalès. “And so that one I’m going to give to Northie because she was with me when I got engaged,” she said on the show. Related: Kim Kardashian Reveals She Paid for Her Engagement Ring From Kris Humphries Kim Kardashian offered a surprising revelation about how much her ex husband Kris Humphries paid for her engagement ring — and it allegedly was less than half. On Kardashian’s 33rd birthday in October 2013, West proposed with the custom-designed Lorraine Schwartz 15-carat diamond ring after the couple welcomed their first child, North West, that June. The star recalled a moment when her then-husband cautioned her about wearing both rings in public after he came across a friend’s Instagram post where she did just that. “Kanye saw it and went, ‘Don’t you ever wear both of your rings at the same time. The Paris robbery significantly impacted Kardashian, leading her to scale back on wearing extravagant expensive jewelry. North West Wears Jacket From Dad Kanye's First Fashion Brand It’s North West‘s world, and we’re just living in it! In 2019, Kardashian shared an Instagram post explaining the return of her “stolen” ring. Schwartz created a replica of her original engagement sparkler, which she occasionally borrows. Kardashian’s decision to gift the ring to her eldest daughter is an insight into North, who occasionally wears pieces from her father’s wardrobe that bear a similar level of significance, like the Pastelle varsity jacket she wore on a subsequent trip to Paris Fashion Week in July 2022. It wasn’t just any garment from her dad’s archive, either. What’s more, the Pastelle line itself was also his first true foray into the fashion world, even though it never came to fruition. Pastelle pieces are rare and hard to come by these days, and ultimately, the label fell under the control of one of West’s creative partners, Ian Dior, according to GQ.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A panel of judges in Liam Payne’s death investigation has denied an appeal to overturn the acquittal of the three people initially charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection with the singer’s death. In a March 12 ruling, obtained by Rolling Stone Thursday, a panel of judges maintained the original decision that cleared Payne’s friend Roger Nores and hotel workers Gilda Martin and Esteban Grassi in the case. The prosecutor’s original appeal, filed on March 5, claimed that the judge’s decision was “flawed in its reasoning” and that some hard drives — from Payne’s computer, cell phones for Nores and his partner, and one from the CasaSur reception desk — and other information had not been reviewed as evidence before the final decision was made. (The prosecutor’s office shared information about their appeal on Thursday but did not mention its rejection.) Trending Stories Can Trump Arbitrarily Take Money From Anyone’s Bank Account?

Ezequiel Pereyra and Braian Paiz — the two men accused of selling Payne drugs — will remain behind bars as they await trial. The new court update comes about a month after Rolling Stone published an extensive investigation into the tragedy of Payne, including a statement from his ex-fiancée, Maya Henry, breaking her silence on his death.

Social media quickly jumped in, with fans urging Seyfried to be cast as the young Mitchell in Cameron Crowe’s forthcoming biopic. However, Seyfried insists the viral “Tonight Show” moment was not part of a campaign to try to win the role. “It was not an audition,” she tells me on the “Just for Variety” podcast. “In fact, I didn’t even consider that, which is funny. What I know about that project is that I’m very, very much aged-out of [playing] young Joni.” Seyfried plays Mickey Fitzpatrick, a cop in Philadelphia’s rough Kensington neighborhood. As a serial killer starts targeting sex workers in the area, Mickey’s sister, Casey (Ashleigh Cummings), a drug addicted sex worker living on the streets, goes missing. “Long Bright River” can be tough to watch at times as the series examines life on the streets, the opioid crisis, alcoholism, sexual grooming, family secrets and corrupt cops. Seyfried says she decompressed after after filming some rather “hard shit” during the car rides to and from the Brooklyn sets and the Catskills home she shares with husband Thomas Sadoski and their two kids. So when the hard shit happened, when I was playing all that emotional stuff, we just wouldn’t take it back in the car with us, subconsciously. We’re going to talk about this.’ We would listen to Taylor Swift really loud some days because the commute is sometimes 90 minutes.” You can listen to the full conversation at “Just for Variety” above or wherever you download your favorite podcasts. What was it like seeing yourself in a cop uniform for the first time? I do not feel uncomfortable in this uniform.” Maybe it was because I’d wrapped my head around it already, maybe I had already done the ridealong [Seyfried shadowed Kensington police officers before filming began], maybe it’s because I had enough space and time to picture myself there. What kind of research did you do into addiction? I had a lot of life experience because I think most of us are touched by, have some connection to somebody who’s suffered with substance use and have some people who have OD’d, some people who have OD’d and are still alive, and some people who are in and out of rehab, or some people who are recovered. I grew up with somebody who is an addict and two people close to me, and everybody has their stories… I also had a lot of people that I could talk to, especially this woman named Sarah Laurel, who runs this place called Savage Sisters Recovery, and they’re on the ground in Kensington everyday all the time. And this woman who started it was also an addict, suffered from addiction and OD’d many times. Somebody I’m in touch with recently now is dealing with someone who is lost and absolutely in the throes of addiction. Two years ago, I would’ve been like, “Just expect them to overdose. Just expect it to go bad.” That’s actually not the conversation you should be having with yourself or other people. This person hasn’t hit rock bottom yet. It’s incredible how many times someone can be knocked down and get back up. I always learn something when I work, but it is interesting how little space we give people to change for the better. Taking a turn here, when is the “Jennifer’s Body” sequel happening? But you want it to happen, right? I haven’t seen anything, but one of the producers and I were in touch with it last year about it, and he just said, “Would you?” And I said, “Yes.” Listen, I’m pretty sure she’s about to have a baby, but I think by the time we do it, I wouldn’t do it without her. I also think we should just let Elizabeth Holmes be Elizabeth Holmes in whatever way she’s going to be, however her life ends up. I have no doubt that she’s got big plans. You can’t hold someone like that down. I’m sure when the push comes to shove, it would be a great opportunity, and I would do it because Mickey is complicated, so there’s never an end to the challenge for me.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

So when you see somebody move, shift their gun, it’s motivated by something. … It’s why I wanted to learn from different facets of filmmaking.

“I don’t torture myself [over Petty’s death],” Campbell, 75, told Guitar Player in an interview published on Tuesday, March 11. Petty’s death at age 66 sent shockwaves through the rock community, especially after a coroner’s report determined that a mix of opioids — including fentanyl and oxycodone — in his system contributed to a fatal “mixed drug toxicity.” The rock legend had gone through periods of drug use throughout his life, but famously got clean in 1999 when his future wife, Dana York, convinced him to go to rehab.

We didn’t socialize that much off tour,” he insisted. When Campbell was pressed on why he didn’t “get in [Petty’s] face” about his noticeable decline, the musician replied: “I don’t torture myself. The guitarist added that there was “an invisible understanding” between himself and Petty about their personal lives. “Like I said, there was no second thoughts or reservations about going out on tour. In fact, the last conversation I had with Tom about it, I said, ‘Are you sure you want to do this? Are you up to it?’ He said, ‘I’m not staying home. We’ll write some more songs, make another record.’ That was the plan.” Fleetwood Mac’s history of breakups, affairs and lineup changes is so famous that their name is now synonymous with rock ‘n’ roll drama.

It feels good when a show rewards you for paying attention. There was no reason to believe he was anything but what he seemed to be, a nice guy who was slightly out of step with the rest of the royal family … except for one small detail. Over and over, there’d be a brief but pregnant pause on the part of everyone who was introduced to them, until they quickly caught themselves and gave him a warm welcome. Something was clearly up, but much like the characters themselves, I was content to push it to the back of my mind. Gaebril is, in fact, Rahvin, one of the evil Forsaken freed from their millennia-long captivity. Through magic, he’s warped the memories of everyone in the world, pretty much, convincing them he’s been Morgaise’s significant other for a decade even though he only escaped his magic prison a few months ago. And he’s already playing his fellow Forsaken against one another, secretly an item with creepy Moghadien even as he plots with sexy Lanfear and gruff, battle-scarred Sammael (Cameron Jack) to take Moghedien down. He also mentions being in contact with Semirhage and Graendal, two other Forsaken who’ve been freed without Lanfear’s knowledge. In a show as packed with plot as The Wheel of Time has been during this first three-episode drop of season three, focusing on the little moments makes a big difference. For his part, he refuses to let the townsfolk disperse and be picked off farm by farm by either Whitecloaks or their Trolloc quarry. He proposes they make a stand where they are, en masse — even as he prepares to raid the Whitecloaks’ encampment to rescue his buddy Mat’s family, who’ve been taken prisoner in hopes of drawing Perrin out. I’ll remember his spear-maidens Chiad and Bain flirting with basically any male thing that moves, from Loial the Ogier to Maksim, the obviously grieving Warder for Alanna Sedai. I’ll remember how Maksim and Alanna are trapped in different stages of grief — how, despite literally wearing their fallen lover’s ashes as makeup, she’s ready to move on, while Maksim can only wallow in the misery, and how the difference is tearing them apart. Over in the Aiel Waste, we’ve got a similar situation on our hands. From a plot perspective, we learn that Egwene is an ultrapowerful “dreamwalker,” like the Aiel “Wise One,” Bair, whose dream she accidentally entered. Most importantly, we learn that with the right combination of magical MacGuffins, Rand might be able to actually kill the Dark One, freeing his evil girlfriend, Lanfear, from her oaths to him forever. What really lingers is the scene in which Moiraine and Lan glisten and gleam half-naked in a sweat lodge, once again establishing the profound platonic intimacy that exists between the Aes Sedai and her Warder. When a beautiful but noticeably blonde woman (Aiel are redheads until they go white as they age) named Melindhra gives them the eye, they playfully debate which one she’s interested in, and how badly Moiraine in particular needs to get laid. This high-fantasy speechifying goes down a lot smoother when everyone is gorgeous and mostly topless, I’m not ashamed to admit. Resplendently draped and veiled in red lace, with her sisters all looking equally fabulous, she strides into her ancestral home — actually the place where she was molested as a child, resulting in the son she cared for as an old man in Tar Valon until Lanfear killed him — and slaughters everyone present for the marriage of her rapist’s heir to another child bride. They’ve stolen an ancient bracelet from the White Tower that works like the Seanchan’s anti-magic manacles did, but which is older and more powerful. (Please note that Moghedien is spying on all this while posing as a servant. Through some political scheming and a little luck, she appears poised to grab a seat in the Aes Sedai’s government, from which position she hopes to stage a palace coup placing the Red Ajah in charge and refocusing the Aes Sedai’s mission on caging the Dragon Reborn. Elaida’s foretellings are way less frequent and foreboding than Min’s visions, which in this very episode include Mat hanging from a noose. (There’s some more of that ostentatious glam sexiness you ordered!) Though they interrogate two captured members of the Shadow-sworn secret society, they don’t get any actionable information, just a bunch of conflicting lies. Nynaeve deduces that Liandrin is the key to it all, and she and Elayne find the sigil that marks her as an Tanchico expat. I find this fun, more or less, but I can understand people who land on “less.” Clearly, its memorable standalone sequences and moments of passion and sensuality are the show’s real power, the way it delivered its knockout blows during season two.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

“Severance” lead star Adam Scott confirmed that “the king” Cruise was a direct inspiration for the opening sequence of Season 2. Scott’s character Mark sprints down the Lumon hallway for the scene, and Scott tried to emulate Cruise’s famed run in various action films. Scott in turn also realized just how much work it takes Cruise to make the run look effortless. “What I find is something that he does that’s incredibly impressive is, at one point when we were shooting the opening sequence for the first episode of Season 2, we did a bunch of different stuff. And at one point I was on a treadmill with a harness connected to me, and what we found was there was some uncanny valley thing that would start happening because if you’re on a treadmill, you’re running at a consistent speed. There’s no variation in your speed, whereas if someone is actually running, there’s constant variation in speed that isn’t even perceptible to the human eye.” Scott added that “Severance” director and executive producer Ben Stiller “also has an affinity for Tom Cruise.” Scott’s “Parks and Recreation” co-star and podcast host Rob Lowe cited their “mutual appreciation” for Cruise, saying that Scott “finally got [his] moment to pay homage to the Master.” Could Cruise make a “Severance” cameo for Season 3? We already know that Barack Obama was too busy to lend his voice to Season 2 (Keanu Reeves instead took the role), but perhaps Cruise post-“Mission Impossible” could make his way to Lumon….</p></b><br/><br/></div>

According to court documents obtained by Us Weekly on Thursday, March 13, Judge Lewis Liman approved Lively’s protective order in part, rejecting some of Wayfarer’s requests. The court chose to “enter a protective order with a modified Attorneys’ Eyes Only provision,” meaning that certain documents would only be allowed to go between the clients’ attorneys and not be seen my said client unless ruled upon by a judge. Related: Blake Lively Says She Got 'Violent' Messages Amid Justin Baldoni Lawsuit Blake Lively reportedly requested a protective order in light of her and It Ends With Us director Justin Baldoni’s ongoing legal battle. “We are fully in agreement with the Court’s decision to provide a narrow scope of protections to categories such as private mental health records and personal security measures that have never been of interest to us,” lawyer Bryan Freedman told Us in a statement on Thursday. We will oppose any efforts by Ms. Lively and her team to hamper our clients’ ability to defend against her attacks by incorrectly categorizing important information as ‘trade secrets,’ especially considering there were no issues in providing these communications willingly to The New York Times.” News broke last month that Lively, 37, and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, sought a stronger protective order than the standard one they were initially granted when she and Baldoni, 41, each first filed their respective lawsuits. Related: Blake Lively Slams Justin Baldoni's 'Disrespect' for Harassment Victims In a new filing obtained by Us Weekly, Blake Lively is firing back after being accused of trying to “prevent the public” from seeing “relevant evidence” in her legal battle against Justin Baldoni. Lively had named Baldoni in a December 2024 lawsuit, alleging that he sexually harassed her and fostered a “hostile work environment” on the set of that year’s It Ends With Us. Related: Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's Trial May Be Moved Up, Judge Warns at 1st Hearing Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni’s lawyers appeared in their first court hearing on Monday, February 3. Lively, 37, and Baldoni, 41, were not expected to attend the Monday earing. The lawyer further made a case for protecting Lively’s private correspondence with other “high-profile individuals.” “There is a significant chance of irreparable harm if marginal conversations with high-profile individuals with no relevance to the case were to fall into the wrong hands,” Lively’s attorney claimed. “These are matters of ‘for attorney’s eyes only’ restrictions,” he said on March 6. She detailed the sexual harassment claims and put that out there. My clients have been adjudicated as guilty right when this was filed.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

So the stock market is crashing and the U.S. is now looking to start a trade war with not only Canada, Mexico, and China, but Europe as well… that doesn’t mean it’s a bad time time to start a business, right? At least not according to the upcoming documentary “Any Problem Is No Problem,” which will be the closing-night screening at the upcoming AmDocs Film Festival in Palm Springs. From the Emmy-winning team behind “The Rescue List,” this new cinema vérité-style peek into the work of tech-business incubation showcases a three-month crash-course thousands only dream of participating in. These future tech company leaders lay their hopes on the line as they learn from others in the business, network with fellow entrepreneurs and engineers, and ultimately pitch investors during a Demo Day. For many, this opportunity is make-or-break and the only thing driving them is the potential delusion of their vision. It’s also a test of whether they have what it takes to handle the constant fluctuation inherent to the crypto business. While many may believe this work lacks a certain level of humanity, “Any Problem Is No Problem” aims to show is the very real emotions that goes into their innovation. “Any Problem Is No Problem” comes from directors Alyssa Fedele and Zachary Fink, who received the 2021 Outstanding Social Issue Documentary Emmy for “The Rescue List,” which tracked the story of three Ghanaian boys who escaped modern-day slavery. The documentary is produced by Actual Films, known for projects like Netflix’s “Athlete A,” which covered the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal that rocked U.S.A Gymnastics, as well as “The Lost Boys of Sudan.” The company was founded by filmmakers Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk and is currently led by Justine Nagan, who serves as head of production. No release date has been set for the documentary, but it is expected to premiere at some point in 2025.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Hollywood Reporter spoke to the former MTV VJ and ex-SiriusXM host, who suffered a stroke in January and can report that he has been released from the ICU and is recovering currently in a rehabilitation center in Los Angeles. During his hospitalization, Pinfield’s eldest daughter Jessica assumed temporary guardianship of medical and financial decisions. “She’s the one who saved my life,” says Pinfield of his daughter. “She protected me.” Also rallying support for the greater music community was podcast host Allison Hagendorf, formerly of Spotify. The SoCal Sound radio host shared that he was “close” to not making it, battling through pneumonia and being put on a ventilator. “My friends said I went on about ‘A Whiter Shade of Pale’ and how they couldn’t keep up with what I was saying,” he says. After emerging from the ICU in late February, Pinfield has “been off social media,” he shares, but he is aware of how friends and musicians rallied on his behalf. “He has championed so many artists over the decades who would have otherwise been ignored by mainstream media and the American music scene would be very different indeed without his taste and influence,” she wrote. If it hadn’t been for Matt playing the video for ‘Suffocate Me’ by my band Angelfish on 120 Minutes all those years ago now, Steve [Marker] would never have known I existed and the role of lead vocals for Garbage would have landed on somebody else’s lap entirely. We are sending out so much love and comforts to you Matt. Musician and producer Butch Walker also urged his social media followers to keep Pinfield in their thoughts, writing, “He LOVES music like no other. The smile on his face and fire in his eyes when talking about any record you can rattle off to him is so magnetic and beautiful.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/the-pitt-patrick-ball-langdon-robby-standoff-santos-fights.html'>‘The Pitt’: Patrick Ball on Langdon vs. Robby and Santos</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 18:26:08 <p>
When we first meet Dr. Frank Langdon (Patrick Ball), the hotshot senior ER resident seems to be heir apparent to Noah Wyle’s harried leader Dr. Robby. Langdon is charismatic in a banter-forward way, and as we learn from brief glimpses of his personal life, a dad under a lot of pressure to hold his life together. Over the course of the season, Langdon develops a bond with newcomer resident Mel (Taylor Dearden) while clashing hard with new intern Dr. Santos (Isa Briones), a hotshot herself who bristles against Langdon’s stern reprimands for her mistakes and oversteps. But the stakes are higher than they seem: By episode ten, Santos has started to suspect that Langdon is overprescribing benzos to his patients and stealing the excess for himself. She confides this in Robby and, in a blistering confrontation at the end of the episode, Robby confronts Langdon, makes him open his locker, and finds his stash of pain meds. As Langdon tries to defend himself, blaming a back injury from helping his parents move, Robby orders him out of the hospital. Aside from an appearance on Law & Order, The Pitt is Ball’s first TV role, and though some of the show’s audience might have not expected this twist, he knew that confrontation was coming from the jump. It was, in fact, his audition scene with Wyle, though as filming on the series actually started, Ball wasn’t sure exactly how the show’s storylines would converge to get Langdon and Robby to this moment. Ball grew up watching ER with his parents, who are medical professionals in their own right, and drew on all this experience in the audition room opposite Wyle. “John Wells goes, ‘Okay, take whatever time you need,’” Ball remembers. Did you know from the beginning that Langdon was stealing pain medication? That wasn’t part of the initial rounds of auditions, but when they decided to have me screen test, they included that scene from episode ten. It was my first time doing anything like this. They fly me out to L.A., take me to [Pitt executive producer] John Wells’s headquarters, and I’m sitting there with Noah. We do the first couple of scenes, which were just banter, and then we get to that big freak out. What was it like jumping right into that fight? I’ve gotten in a lot of trouble. And that scene is the closest thing you’re going to get to a break-up scene in The Pitt. Langdon thinks there’s an understanding that there’s a lot of trauma inherent in what we do and we’re just doing the best to soldier on. And then Robby says, “No, you took it too far. We’ve seen a few glimpses of Langdon’s life outside the hospital. You knew that fight was coming, but then you had to go and film all the episodes before it. How did you approach them, knowing what would be revealed about Langdon? They dropped these episodes to us one at a time, so we didn’t know exactly what was going to happen, but I knew that in episode ten the drugs were going to come out and I was going to get fired. So there’s this huge scary thing looming over me, but when we got to it on the day, it was just fun. He has that incredible ability to go out on a limb and get to the scary territory while also being a generous and present scene partner. There’s an interesting parallel in the fact that Noah’s character Carter had a painkiller addiction for back pain on that show. We grew up watching two shows every week, The West Wing and ER. It’s really crazy I now get to work with these guys. When this job came along, I made a point of not going back and watching ER because we were doing a completely different thing and I didn’t want to be consciously or subconsciously informed by it. But the guy I got to be on set with and who’s become a dear friend is a different person than that, so I’m glad I didn’t focus on the previous project he’d done. What’s it like for your parents to watch you on The Pitt? She gets mad at me for not wearing eye protection in the trauma scenes, and I’m like, “Mom, nobody’s got time for that!” It’s actually been a secret mission of mine to maximize my character’s relationship with the nurses because that is literally my mom’s job. Kristin Villanueva, who plays Princess, and I found this relationship where she’s the nurse who always has to remind me to put my gloves on, because I’m the guy who’s always moving fast and scatter-brained. I’m interested in the two very different dynamics that Langdon has with Mel and Santos. Let’s start with Santos: What do you think it is about her that sets him off? She comes from the theater like me, and there’s a tinkering-ness about her. Santos comes into that environment on her first day being like, “I’m the shit,” and that rubs Langdon the wrong way because he’s been there for years longer than her. He really respects authority and the chain of command, so when somebody doesn’t want to respect that, it causes major problems. But I think that whenever Langdon came in for his first day of work, he was probably a lot like Santos. I thought there was something lovely about him getting, for instance, that an assignment digging out gravel from a guy’s wound would be just the right job for her. Taylor is such a craftsperson, because she’s very unlike Mel in real life. Langdon sees in Mel someone who’s got the right stuff, is in it for the right reasons, and is also a caretaker for her sister in the way that Langdon is a caretaker for his kids. But she’s also sympathetic and generous, which is what Langdon needs in his life. Something I talked about with Noah early on is that Langdon is figuring out the difference between being labor and management. Langdon thinks he does his specific job as good as anyone and that he just has to lock in. That’s something he can do with Mel. When we work together with an autistic patient, Langdon doesn’t understand what he’s missing, and Mel comes in and teaches me about how the care this person needs might be different from what other people need. But we’re not cutting around the sequence and all the props have to be switched out because we have long and short versions of them depending on what actually has to go inside the actor. Meanwhile, you’re speaking what sounds like Ancient Greek medical terms, which you can’t get wrong because it all means something specific. If you do get it wrong, there will be a bajillion people out on the internet who will know. And I wouldn’t be able to go home for Thanksgiving. If you try to rise to the style of the language, you end up sounding real old school, like a Laurence Olivier sort of actor. I’m curious what it feels like when you know this big fight between Robby and Langdon is coming, but by episode nine airing, the show has started to hint pretty clearly at Santos picking up on what he’s up to. We’ve had a lot of response, dozens and dozens of real-life nurses and doctors reaching out in my DMs being like, “thank you so much.” It makes me feel very warm and fuzzy. But then I hosted an Oscars viewing party for my girlfriend and all her friends, and they were all like, “I fucking hate Langdon! The audience started to learn about these characters and share their ideas about them and I have to be like, okay, okay. The Pitt has been picked up for a second season. Do you know if Langdon will be back? This is my favorite show on television, and it’s fucking rad that I get to be on it, so I hope so.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

WASHINGTON—Extending an offer to immigrants hoping to relocate to the United States, President Donald Trump unveiled a new type of visa Thursday for any foreign citizen willing to move to America to be friends with his son Barron. “Any immigrant roughly Barron’s age with similar interests may apply, with very little waiting time to get them over here to start having fun,” a statement from the White House read in part, noting that there would be no restrictions on countries of origin so long as the applicant could name three ideas for hangout activities that the youngest Trump child might find appealing. “They’ll need to provide evidence that they have good social skills and strong, healthy hobbies in their home countries that they can bring to America to help Barron grow. The Barron Buddy visa will also offer a path to permanent residency for any cardholder who remains an active member of Barron’s social circle. Buddies here on visa should not expect a free ride, however—they will need to demonstrate that they can carry their own weight in Fortnite to stay in good standing with the U.S. government.” At press time, Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced raids on tens of thousands of illegal immigrants who were casual acquaintances of Barron at best.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Following a long stint as a GQ editor and directing the 2017 short, “Trapeze, U.S.A.,” Mark Anthony Green makes his feature directorial debut with A24’s “Opus,” starring Ayo Edebiri, John Malkovich, Juliette Lewis, Murray Bartlett, and Stephanie Suganami. The 2025 Sundance Film Festival premiere fits somewhere between thriller and celebrity satire. “I think my approach to filmmaking so far has been kind of like two buckets,” Green told IndieWire. Then in the other bucket, there are actual visual worlds that I want to spend time in, that I want to play around with, and create. So if one thing from one bucket seems like it would be serviced by the other thing in the other bucket and vice versa, then that to me feels like something to explore for an actual film.” During his tenure at GQ, close friend Lionel Boyce snuck a screener of “The Bear” Season 1 to Green, and he immediately knew he wanted Ayo Edebiri to star in “Opus.” “We’ve always had great creative rapport,” Green said of casting Edebiri. It’s one of the things just to see her in a different gear. I feel like there are a lot of reasons people should go see this film, but seeing Ayo in a different gear is worth $20 or $15 or whatever [your ticket is].” With such a strong cast of film veterans, I was curious to see if Green had pitched anyone else for a role in the film. “I really wanted Nikki Giovanni, who’s my favorite poet and recently passed away,” he revealed. My dream was to put Nikki Giovanni in an A24 movie, and I chased that woman. I sent them flowers — I was reading Nikki Giovanni this morning; She is truly [among the] top five writers that have had an effect on me in my life. So for my first film, I really wanted to put her in it, and then I heard from a mutual friend that her health wasn’t great, and that was the only thing that was going to make me chill out.” “I wish everybody that worked on ‘Opus’ got paid more, myself included,” Green said. “But nobody took more of a pay cut to what they usually get than Niles and Dream. They chose to do this purely for the creative challenge of it. I really wanted the whole film to feel like a pop record.” “I give so much credit to the local crew in New Mexico. We took a lot of really big swings with very little resources.” Stephanie Suganami, Tatanka Means, John Malkovich, Mark Anthony Green, Ayo Edebiri, Juliette Lewis and Murray Bartlett attend the ‘Opus’ Premiere during the 2025 Sundance Film Festival FilmMagic Experiencing it in a theater with people, with that sound, and other people’s energy and reactions, it’s like going to a concert, and I guarantee it will be one of the most fun theatrical experiences you’ll have this year,” Green said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.indiewire.com/features/best-of/best-hbo-series-all-time-ranked-shows-1201859391/'>The 46 Best HBO Shows Ranked, from ‘Succession’ to ‘Room 104’</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 17:45:00 <p>
[Editor’s Note: this list was originally published in July 2017. It has been updated multiple times with new entries.] And since the Warner Bros. and Discovery merger, there’s been many worries from TV fans about the impact it’s having on HBO’s future — especially with series like “Succession” and “Barry” concluding. But overall, the network’s commitment to collaborating with talented filmmakers and inventive creators has earned them creative success that few of their rivals have been able to equal. Even as the age of prestige TV has blanketed the marketplace with plenty of other options, HBO’s newest shows have been able to stand out. “Barry,” “I May Destroy You,” “The White Lotus,” and “Mare of Easttown” are among the Emmy-nominated series carrying on HBO’s storied tradition with TV that captivates and compels. Not including Max Originals (which have their own separate list): Here are 46 of the best TV shows HBO has ever had to offer. Michael Schneider, Alison Foreman, and Steve Greene contributed to this report. Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector in ‘The Gilded Age’ Courtesy of Barbara Nitke / HBO “The Gilded Age” is very much the opposite of that, a soothing exercise in small stakes that’s less about “plot” and “things happening” as it is about watching talented actors passive-aggressively fight in gorgeous period costumes. That’s not a bad thing: Julian Fellowes’ ensemble period piece about the lives of New York City elites during the Gilded Age is a soapy, dishy little pleasure, a show that knows exactly what it is and executes its own particular niche with precision. Although it’s tarnished somewhat by the presence of James Franco — playing twin brothers working for the Mafia — “The Deuce” had a brilliant enough ensemble to overlook him, and Maggie Gyllenhaal’s wonderful work as a sharp single mother and prostitute-turned-porn actress deserved far more flowers than it got. Across six half-hour episodes, Torres creates a vivid alternate-reality version of New York City that’s similar to our own, but queerer, freakier, and populated by a colorful cast of gig workers, ruthless capitalists, and starving artists looking for meaning in the chaos. Video game adaptations have such a dismal reputation that “The Last of Us” just had to be okay to surpass historical precedent. Still, Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann’s serialized adaptation of the latter’s beloved action game series impressed when it debuted in 2023 by succeeding not just “for a video game movie” but as a compelling drama in itself. While it veers a little too faithful to the source, the show succeeds when it makes departures, particularly in a standout episode starring Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett as doomed lovers. Each episode of “How To with John Wilson” is a standalone visual essay that starts small before going into broader and more poignant depths than you could possibly imagine. An installment can begin with a question about how to cook risotto or find a public restroom, before finding Wilson in Idaho at a conference discussing the Mandela Effect and ending with a discussion on the importance of living in the moment or letting go of your fears. It sounds heavy, and it can be, but “How to With John Wilson” is also just terrifically entertaining, filled with unexpected non-sequiturs and cringe comedy filtered through Wilson’s persona as an awkward, schlubby narrator. It’s a series of essays, but the show never feels like homework. After a shaky first season, “Industry” leveled up significantly in its sophomore outing, between sharp new characters, deeper writing for the central ensemble of four young investment bankers, and a more confident mix of the soap opera sexual entanglements and “Succession” lite cold-hearted business dealings that gives the show its own distinctive rhythm. A lot of that is due to the excellent, nervy performances from Myha’la Herrold and especially Ken Leung as the show’s leads, ruthless wheelers and dealers who behave as if every stock investment is a life or death battle. Mostly, it’s the show’s indelible portrait of the finance sector, as a warzone where people need to stoop to horrific lows to get ahead, that makes “Industry” such a consistent half-trash, half-prestige delight. A confounding, bizarre experiment, “The Rehearsal” got everyone talking when it premiered in Summer 2022, launching meme after meme about the various stunts creator and host Nathan Fielder gets into over its six-episode first season. Ostensibly a series about Fielder staging “rehearsals” for big life events in order to help ordinary people prepare for the unexpected, “The Rehearsal” gets so much weirder and more personal that that initial premise, as Fielder begins staging rehearsals for rehearsals and involving himself directly in the story. Is the show’s treatment of its real-life subjects one hundred percent ethically above board? The jury will (likely always) be out on that. The channel’s first one-hour TV drama, Tom Fontana’s 1997 show was set in an experimental, rehabilitative wing of the Oswald State Penitentiary, where several colorful inmates from different backgrounds engage in drug trade, gang wars, fight each other, or fall in love. Boasting brilliant performances from the large ensemble cast — including Harold Perrineau, J. K. Simmons, Lee Tergesen, Christopher Meloni, and Rita Moreno — the series remains an underappreciated, compulsively watchable drama decades after it broke ground. Thankfully, Kitteridge is played by Frances McDormand in one of her best performances. A depressed retiree in the Maine town of Crosby, the four-part series tracks Olive’s life over a 25-year period, as her relationships with her husband Henry (Richard Jenkins), son Christopher (John Gallagher Jr.), and friends grow and change. It takes guts to readapt a book that’s already been turned into a classic film, but Todd Hayes did just that when he wrote and directed a limited series adaptation of James M. Cain’s “Mildred Pierce” back in 2011. Hayes’ adaptation is significantly more faithful, featuring Kate Winslet in the title role. A hard-working mother in the Great Depression, Mildred struggles to care for her family when her husband loses his job, opening a restaurant and falling in love with a new man (Guy Pearce, wooing Winslet a few years before “Mare of Easttown”), while struggling to navigate her relationship with her spoiled and selfish daughter (Evan Rachel Wood). Winslet and Pierce both received Emmy Awards for their work in the miniseries. Fraggles are mostly carefree creatures with different personalities, led by the characters Gobo, Red, Wembley, Mokey and Boober. Although “True Detective” is an anthology — rotating casts, settings, and plots each season — there’s an eerie familiarity to the nightmarish journeys the crime show has taken thus far. In the first season, Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are Louisiana detectives investigating a series of killings seemingly related to the occult. Rachel McAdams, Colin Farrell, Vince Vaughn, and Taylor Kitsch lead the second season, as California cops looking into corrupt politicians. A fourth season starring Jodie Foster is expected in 2023. Zendaya stars as a high school-aged drug addict named Rue, whose struggles with mental health and grief ground an otherwise chaotic kaleidoscope of social media-fueled coming-of-age angst. Despite a rocky second season, Zendaya and the rest of the “Euphoria” cast continue to earn top praise for their performances with special attention paid to series regulars Sydney Sweeney, Jacob Elordi, Angus Cloud, and Hunter Schafer. Even with a head start as rich as George R. R. Martin’s novels, translating the dense mythology of this fantasy behemoth to the world of TV was an unprecedented undertaking, creating entire cities and species from the ground up on a mammoth scale. With segments on pressing issues as disparate as net neutrality, multi-level marketing schemes, mandatory minimum sentencing, gerrymandering, and infringement on LGBTQ rights, John Oliver and company have produced far more than the “evisceration” they often get headlines for (something Oliver himself has poked fun at). Using the show’s distinct viewpoint to punch up rather than tred on easy targets, it’s political-themed comedy that offers something constructive to our national discourse, all while managing to slip in dogs who look like Supreme Court justices for good measure. Bill Paxton plays a polygamist wrestling with the complications of married life in HBO’s “Big Love.” Set in a fundamentalist Mormon community in aughts Utah, the drama series ran for five seasons from 2006 to 2011 and was praised for its tight writing and emotional performances. Created by Mark V. Olsen and Will Scheffer, “Big Love” commingled the high-stakes intensity of religion and politics with the intimate family drama of three sister wives sharing a backyard and the household responsibilities therein. Played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, Chloë Sevigny, and Ginnifer Goodwin, the three main wives grounded the series, which would earn nine Emmy nominations. “The Jinx” kicks off with a criminal trying to get caught. If Andrew Jarecki’s journey into the mind of late murderer Robert Durst was only an unpacking of that single idea, it would have still been compelling TV. [Editor’s note: Plus, “The Jinx” helped get Durst convicted in 2021.] Dripping with dramatic irony, these questions fuel the extraordinarily bingeworthy six-part dramedy that earned the show five Emmy nods, including Outstanding Limited Series. In fact, the limited series was so outstanding it’s no longer limited at all, having gone the way of “Big Little Lies” and been green-lit for an Italian-set second season. Kate Winslet stars as title character Mare in Brad Ingelsby’s harrowing crime thriller about a beleaguered Philadelphia detective grappling with an unsolved case. Equal parts absorbing character study and slow-burn whodunnit, the stark series boasts not only an incredible knack for creating suspense but also a consistent commitment to following those threads somewhere satisfying. Whodunits so often get overrun by the juiciness of their premises. While the series left off as a strong, standalone piece of TV craftsmanship, it’s a testament to how well this blend of visual style and otherworldly performances captured audience’s imaginations that Season 2 happened (and with Meryl Streep in tow, no less). Anchored by some of the industry’s strongest voices, these reports go beyond human interest stories to uncover the hidden side of iconic institutions or put a face to stories only previously whispered in off-the-record circles. Recent pieces on college athletics, youth football leagues, domestic violence issues and traffic deaths in the Dominican Republic continue a two-decade tradition of offering insight into lives beyond the highlight-reel regulars. If Mike Judge made “Silicon Valley” now, it would have to be totally different. Seriously, turn off your phone, suspend any concerns you might have about the downfall of humanity, and instead revel in the strange optimism of this somehow already dated 2010s sitcom about misfit programmers trying to make it in big tech. Thomas Middleditch, Kumail Nanjiani, T.J. Miller, Josh Brener, Amanda Crew, Zach Woods, Jimmy O. Yang, Martin Starr, and more appear. Alan Ball’s opus about family, life, and loss is probably best known for how it tackled the subject of death. Frances Conroy, Lauren Ambrose, Freddy Rodriguez, and Rachel Griffith also starred in the series as characters all searching for their own personal truths. Here, dreams, memories and neuroses intersect, remind us that those who pass are never fully lost.” —MS HBO has had its share of bombast over the past few decades, but “Looking” is an example of the network doing quieter stories with even more profound impact. “Sex and the City” writer/director Michael Patrick King moved on from that show to immediately create another HBO classic, this time with former “Friends” star Lisa Kudrow. “The Comeback” made a comeback of its own in 2014, when a second season premiered nine years later, and was just as awkward, brutal, heartbreaking and beautiful as ever. The series, based on Candace Bushnell’s book, became a pop culture phenomenon, inspiring cocktail parties, cupcake runs and millions of people to proclaim whether they were a Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Samantha (Kim Cattrall), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) or Charlotte (Kristin Davis). The revolutionary series (created by Darren Star and later overseen by Michael Patrick King) was lauded for its portrayal of strong, complicated women in their late 30s and early 40s who freely discussed relationships, sex, gender, friendship, career, family, and more. “Sex and the City” won four Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2001. Not especially scary but particularly perfect for horror lovers, “Los Espookys” is a fantastically funny comedy series about a group of friends whose fondness for terror spurs them to start a strange new business. Created by Julio Torres, Ana Fabrega, and Fred Armisen, “Los Espookys” stars its creators as well as Bernardo Velasco, Cassandra Ciangherotti, Carol Kane, and José Pablo Minor. “It’s never scary, and even its appreciation of a good scare, which leads to a gross-out gag or two, keeps the focus on the craft talent who made it happen.” —AF “Cheers” is probably your favorite comedian’s favorite comedy, but among the other American outputs from last quarter century, few shows lay claim to a similar spot in the hearts of comedy nerds more than “Mr. Show.” Bolstered by the two men up top and a bevy of supporting players who would go on to have influential places of their own in the comedy world, few sketch shows have been able to create comedic shorthand in quite a way that this show did. Bending time, nesting narratives, and embracing the absurdities of everyday life, “Mr. “Insecure” exists as a TV landmark of two kinds. First, it paved critical new ground at HBO for Black stories, spotlighting the friendship of two Black women living in SoCal across five impeccable seasons. Second, it solidified creator/multi-hyphenate Issa Rae’s reputation as an auteur of the 21st century, letting her sparkling dynamic with co-star Yvonne Orji ground the show. Lisa Joyce, Natasha Rothwell, Jay Ellis, Dominique Perry, and more complete the sensational “Insecure” cast. David Milch’s 36-episode opus, which chronicled the growth of a South Dakota outpost in the 1870s, was lauded at the time for its take on civilization and capitalism — and remembered for its colorful, and frequent, use of profanities. Milch weaved real-life characters and fictional storylines together, casting Ian McShane as saloon owner Al Swearengen: a role that earned the actor an Emmy nomination. Other shows have mixed improvisation with scripted outlines, but no show has ever done it more masterfully than Larry David’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” The show first premiered in 2000, and quickly established David – then mostly known as the co-creator behind “Seinfeld” — as a star in his own right. But ultimately, the pieces fell into place just right, with Mike Nichols directing the six-hour miniseries and HBO splitting it into two three-hour parts: “Millennium Approaches” and “Perestroika.” Based on the Tony Kushner play, “Angels in America” starred Al Pacino as Roy Cohn, the real-life conservative (and closeted) lawyer who worked to have accused spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg executed in the 1950s, and later contracted AIDS, dying in 1986. The cast also included Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson, Emma Thompson, Mary-Louise Parker, James Cromwell, Jeffrey Wright, and Justin Kirk. Lena Dunham left an indelible mark on TV with the captivating complexity hidden behind the simply monikered “Girls.” Starring Dunham as a fictionalized version of herself, the New York-set series follows Hannah: a twenty-something grappling with ambition, isolation, and mental health in an increasingly demanding world. Allison Williams, Jemima Kirke, Zosia Mamet, Andrew Rannells, Adam Driver, and Alex Karpovsky bring fearless life to Hannah’s friend group, imbuing the exacting script with raw energy and fraught passion. HBO was first graced with the comedy stylings of Danny McBride in “Eastbound & Down” and “Vice Principals.” But “The Righteous Gemstones” — a stupidly entertaining dark comedy about a family of fabulously wealthy televangelists — finally blessed the creator with the production scale and budget needed to preach his goofy gospel from heavenly new heights. John Goodman plays the patriarch, with McBride, Edi Patterson, and Adam Devine portraying his adult kids. Tony Cavalero, Dermot Mulroney, Gregory Alan Williams, Cassidy Freeman, Syler Gisondo, Tim Baltz, Walton Goggins, and more fill out the congregation-sized cast. After seven sensational seasons, “Veep” still stands as TV’s greatest tribute to failing upwards. What these people lack in policy nuance and media savvy, they make up for in the nastiest, most vicious one-liners this side of the Atlantic. It helps to have a cast full of profanity Picassos, from Julia Louis-Dreyfus, all the way through Timothy Simons, Kevin Dunn, Dan Bakkedahl, and a legion of the slimiest characters our (fictitious) nation’s capital has ever had to offer. The Duplass brothers unleash otherworldly magic in “Room 104,” a low-budget anthology that’s arguably best likened to “The Twilight Zone” but exists in a category unto itself. From sci-fi adventures and ghost stories to cartoons and even a documentary, “Room 104” broke mold in ways no comment card could ever capture. Mark Duplass, Jay Duplass, Mel Eslyn, Sydney Fleischmann, and Xan Aranda executive produce, with a breathtaking score and original songs from Julian Wass. “The Leftovers” is a simple love story in a bleak time, cushioned by the tenuous family connections that helped each of these two central figures cope with varying degrees of loss. Their specific tragedies may be invented ones, but the boldness of the series’ storytelling only served to underline how their struggles connected a universal understanding of what it means to grieve something that’s gone. From the fierce, charged conversations that only took two people baring their souls to create something explosive, to the transformative “International Assassin” trilogy of episodes, “The Leftovers” took an unconventional approach to its source material and turned it into legend. Adapted from the Alan Moore comic of the same name, Damon Lindelof’s “Watchmen” blew audience expectations out of the water with a strongly grounded — and decidedly terrifying — new take on a familiar universe with stars Regina King, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Louis Gosset Jr., Jovan Adepo, Jean Smart, and more. It won Best Limited Series at the 2020 Emmy Awards. “Looking beyond the veils people share with the world, ‘Watchmen’ finds fundamental truths about an America divided by a lack of faith in itself, its people, and its institutions,” writes IndieWire’s Ben Travers. Through six episodes, ‘Watchmen’ has already provided a bounty of intelligent theories to study and debate, but it’s designed to be one helluva good time, as well.” —AF Through the vulnerability of performances from folks like David Schwimmer and Damian Lewis, delivered in a visual template set by executive producer Steven Spielberg’s “Saving Private Ryan,” it condensed a entire battalion’s worth of experiences into 10 hours and still made it feel like a story that had time to breathe. Earning eight nominations and two wins at the 2021 Emmy Awards, “I May Destroy You” expertly explored sexuality, dating, consent, and trauma through the unconventional story of a viral writer recovering from assault. Created, written, directed, and produced by star Michaela Coel, the 12-part series has been praised for its feminist message, delivered with searing specificity, and its fearless commitment to vividly portraying difficult subject matter. In Bill Hader and Alec Berg’s masterful “Barry,” a hitman chasing a mark through Los Angeles decides he’d rather be an actor instead. Entering its fourth season sometime next year, the series that started off sounding like a bad “Saturday Night Live” sketch has since matured into an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that’s not only a staggeringly well written study of its tortured main character, but boasts an ensemble cast that consistently leads the Emmys’ comedy acting race. There have been countless Hollywood parodies over the years, including others on HBO. But none have ever been as biting or realistic as “The Larry Sanders Show,” because perhaps no other show has better captured the ego, self-hate, insecurity and fear that actually drives this business. The late, great Garry Shandling had already become a cable pioneer with Showtime’s “It’s Garry Shandling’s Show” when he came up with “The Larry Sanders Show” as a way to satirize his experience as a “Tonight Show” guest host and standup comedian. Jeffrey Tambor played sidekick Hank Kingsley and Rip Torn was producer Artie, while the show also featured Janeane Garofalo, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Jeremy Pieven, and Bob Odenkirk in major roles. That’s commonplace now, but it was always surprising to see stars being self-deprecating on “Larry Sanders” (including David Duchovny, who famously played himself as having a massive crush on Larry). Created by Jesse Armstrong, “Succession” can be tidily described as the Bad People Olympics. Anchored in a terrifying centerpiece performance from Brian Cox, the searing satirical drama follows media titan Logan Roy’s attempts to secure his insidious legacy. Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook, Kieran Culkin, and Alan Ruck portray the four main Roy children, with Nicholas Braun, Matthew Macfadyen, J. Smith-Cameron, and more rounding out the cast. At the Emmys, “Succession” has earned repeat acclaim for its acting, directing, writing, editing, and score. Writer-creator Craig Mazin and director Johan Renck put HBO audiences through hell with their “Chernobyl” miniseries: a staggeringly realistic dramatization of the 1986 Ukrainian nuclear disaster told in five parts. Winner of the 2019 Emmy for Outstanding Limited Series — as well as Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Writing — the series’ sprawling ensemble cast includes Stellan Skarsgård, Jared Harris, Emily Watson, Jessie Buckley, Paul Ritter, and more. “Each nauseating moment, be it a shot of decaying human flesh or a decision made for the wrong reasons, has a purpose — and pays back the viewer for their investment,” writes IndieWire’s Ben Travers. “‘Chernobyl’ is a stunning dramatization, and one worth admiring on many levels.” —AF “The Sopranos” was an early nail in the broadcast networks’ coffin, inspiring this modern era of peak TV as every cable network and streaming service began looking for its own breakthrough show (and HBO became a go-to destination for top-tier talent). From a storytelling perspective, David Chase’s story of a New Jersey mobster visiting a therapist (Lorraine Bracco) in an effort to balance the demands of his life ushered in an age of the anti-hero, and also helped re-popularize episodic serialized television, breaking the stranglehold that procedural dramas had on TV. David Simon’s magnum opus is one of the most thoroughly constructed and physically detailed looks at American life that American TV has ever put forth. As a result, HBO proved that gambling on shows that don’t have an established star at the head or that take place outside of the familiar New York and LA environs could be an artistic boon, something that would have a lasting legacy beyond its airdate.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ready for another spooky Stephen King adaptation from Mike Flanagan? In IndieWire’s review out of TIFF, where “The Life of Chuck” won the People’s Choice Award, critic Katie Rife wrote, “Structured around a verse from Walt Whitman’s ‘Song of Myself’ — ‘Do I contradict myself? It does so in a way that’s surprising enough that it’s best not to discuss it in too much detail; suffice to say that it takes a cosmic approach to the idea of inner worlds. The entire movie isn’t sad, although it does land on a note of genuine pathos. But sentimentality suits Flanagan, whose florid writing style is well matched by the high-concept ideas explored here.” Though the film came into TIFF with no distributor, Neon quickly acquired it and announced a summer 2025 release. Could this far out release be because they already had their 2024 Oscar player with Sean Baker’s Palme d’Or winner (now Best Picture winner as well), “Anora”? The film is clearly an audience favorite based on its win at TIFF, and the popularity of its cast and creative is evident. In addition to lead actor Hiddleston, the film stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Karen Gillan, Mark Hamill, David Dastmalchian, and Matthew Lillard, with Nick Offerman narrating. If one thing is for certain, it’s that like with “Anora” and its previous Oscar winner, “Parasite,” Neon will be giving “The Life of Chuck” a top-notch theatrical roll-out, especially considering its summer box office placement.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Thank Goodness.</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 17:30:00 <p>
On Wednesday night, Stephen Colbert opened “The Late Show” with a joke about Donald Trump’s tariffs. During “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” Jimmy Kimmel spoke to Denis Leary about his new Fox sitcom, “Going Dutch.” And over on Netflix, John Mulaney peeped at his neighbors through a telescope. One of these things is not like the other. Even if the gist of Mulaney’s bit sounds like it might be setting up some sort of game — similar to what “Tonight Show” viewers seem to enjoy — the execution doesn’t deliver Jimmy Fallon’s typical tomfoolery. Instead, the discomforting gag further separates “Everybody’s Live” from traditional late-night talk shows, even as it doubles down on what Mulaney already created with his 2024 cult hit, “Everybody’s in L.A.” The similar titles, returning sidekicks, and initial marketing all mirrored what we’d seen last year, when Mulaney was given a week-long run of live episodes designed to draw extra eyeballs to Netflix’s L.A.-based comedy festival, Netflix Is a Joke. It introduced Jerry Seinfeld alongside wildlife advocate Tony Tucci, a shared billing that flummoxed the TV titan so thoroughly he never recovered (on air, at least). As disparate and discombobulating as each of these elements seem, they were tied together by the show’s enduring theme, the city of Los Angeles, which was then used to provide a subset of themes for each subsequent episode. Tucci appeared with Seinfeld because that episode’s central subject was “coyotes.” The library reading room was featured because Los Feliz is a popular L.A. neighborhood (and DiCaprio is one of its favorite sons). Having a loose housing for Mulaney’s eccentric ideas served “Everybody’s in L.A.” quite well, and losing the city as a centerpiece for “Everybody’s Live” suggested the new series could be broadening out. After all, this isn’t a limited week-long run anymore. And with an extremely popular comedian at the helm, Netflix executives undoubtedly see an opportunity to attract a wide audience — one more shot at reinventing the late-night talk show for the streaming age, a la “Chelsea,” “The Break with Michele Wolf,” “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,” and others. So if dialing back the weird a little means dialing up the viewership (and keeping Mulaney around, season after season), why not give it a go? Jessica Roy, Michael Keaton, Joan Baez, and John Mulaney at ‘Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney’ Couretsy of Ryan West / Netflix A couple months went by and Netflix did a focus group about the title, ‘Everybody’s in L.A.,’ and it turns out that people around the country don’t like L.A. After the fires, I said, ‘Maybe they like us more now,’ and it turns out, no, people still didn’t.” It brought out guests in pairs, starting with “Actor and Filmmaker” Michael Keaton and San Francisco Chronicle financial columnist, Jessica Roy (aka “Lady with Some Savings”). It had inexplicable bits (like Mulaney’s peeping tom shtick) and outrageous pre-taped segments. Mulaney even asked the night’s callers what kind of car they drove before hanging up. “If you’ve seen this beautiful set, some of you eagle-eyed viewers will notice that there are subtle differences in the set design,” he said. That sense of freedom is key to the show’s future and more important than the flubs and duds that littered Episode 1. Sure, Mulaney’s routine about his wife, Olivia Munn, and her struggles with “cancer brain” didn’t really land. But “Everybody’s Live” is still putting all its chips in the right buckets. He wants his guests to get a little uncomfortable. He wants his callers to steer conversations down unexpected avenues. Perhaps the most telling thing Mulaney said last night was when he joked about “Everybody’s Live” being his replacement for “coke and Adderall.” “Will this show get my heart rate up to the level where I feel alive? That he’ll embrace what makes live shows so electric to begin with: the unknown; the sense that anything can happen at any time; the friction of unrehearsed, raw interactions that audiences can enjoy unfiltered, as if they’re really there, sitting in their odd friend John’s living room, not knowing where the night will take them? So far, “Everybody’s Live” is setting itself up to explore all the peculiar little nooks and crannies that get lost in an edited talk show. Its sense of humor may call to mind Conan O’Brien’s absurdist “Late Night” work, and the visual style may hearken back to Johnny Carson’s era, but John Mulaney isn’t trying to make another late-night talk show. “Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney” premiered Wednesday, March 12 on Netflix.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The deal for a new ballpark had been largely negotiated before Hurricane Milton tore the roof off the Rays’ home, Tropicana Field, in October. Rays owner Stuart Sternberg relayed the team’s decision to St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch in a phone call. “After careful deliberation we have concluded we cannot move forward with the new ballpark and development project at this moment,” the statement read in part. “A series of events beginning in October that no one could have anticipated led to this decision.” The Rays—who will play this season at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Fla., the spring training home of the New York Yankees—have no place to play in the area beyond this season unless repairs are complete at the Trop. They open their season against the Colorado Rockies on March 28. The deal was already under siege from the St. Petersburg City Council and Pinellas County Commission. The Rays have a stadium lease with St. Petersburg through 2028. The Rays said that the city is “currently advancing plans to restore Tropicana Field for the 2026 season,” adding, “we continue to focus on finding a ballpark solution that serves the best interests of our region, Major League Baseball and our organization.” (This story has corrected the name of the Historic Gas Plant District in paragraph five.)</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Clap if you want to know what’s going on with Wendy Williams. The former Wendy Williams Show host, who has been in a court-ordered guardianship since 2022, went to a hospital on March 10 after being escorted out of her assisted-living facility by police, and later said that she passed a mental-capacity test “with flying colors.” After leaving the hospital, Williams spoke in her first interview on video, hitting back at her conservatorship. The New York Post previously reported that the NYPD had shown up after Williams dropped several notes that read “Help! During a Tuesday interview she did with Williams on The Breakfast Club, Monterroso clarified that she personally called the police and asked them to conduct a welfare check. “The people who live there don’t remember anything, unlike me. It’s a cry for help.” The police ultimately escorted her from the building into an ambulance that took her to a local hospital. While calling into Good Day New York from the hospital on March 11, Williams claimed that she took mental-competency tests at the hospital and “passed with flying colors.” TMZ previously reported that she scored a “10 out of 10” on a psychiatric exam. Monterroso — who alleged that Williams’s guardian, Sabrina Morrissey, was at the hospital and attempted to prevent the tests from taking place — suggested that the results can be used in court to help Williams’s case. Accompanied by her niece Alex Finnie, Williams spoke with Entertainment Tonight on March 13, taking the opportunity to criticize her guardian, Morrissey. “We came back from dinner, and apparently police were called because Coterie here was saying that I took my aunt from this facility and whisked her away,” Finnie says in the video, referencing the senior-living facility where Williams resides. “They are lying to me when they say I can go out and do what I wanna do,” Williams says. “This is my niece, Alex, she just flew in from Miami, okay. I just came from the hospital, so we are going out to celebrate.” Williams was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia and progressive aphasia in 2023, a press release announced last year. However, she later publicly denied the diagnosis and has maintained that she is “not cognitively impaired.” Morrissey, her guardian, recently affirmed to Vanity Fair that she sees “issues” with Williams’s speech when it’s “not scripted;” Williams scoffed at that suggestion on The Breakfast Club. Her guardianship was instated in 2022 on the grounds that she needed to be protected from financial abuse. When asked on Good Day New York if she would be willing to get a financial adviser if she were released from the guardianship, Williams replied, “I’ve had that for years. The money I have right now is all with my guardian person.” Williams previously alleged in Lifetime’s 2024 documentary Where Is Wendy Williams? Williams said on Good Day New York that getting out of her guardianship is her “number one most important thing.” Beyond that, she has hopes of staying in New York and “going back to work.” In the more recent future, she is scheduled to call into The View on March 14. As of her Tuesday Breakfast Club interview, Williams said she was still in the hospital.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Alex Garland is crediting “The Last of Us” for making his sequel film “28 Years Later” even better. Garland, who penned original 2002 zombie film “28 Days Later” and returns to write the third feature “28 Years Later,” said during the “Creator to Creator” podcast in the below video that it was “The Last of Us” video game that inspired him to up his own “game” as a screenwriter. “I was so inspired by your work,” Garland said to Druckmann. It was very nice for me with ‘The Last of Us’ to sort of feel like someone saying, ‘Where’s your game? Garland’s script has been circulating since 2019, with Boyle saying in 2022 that he was “very tempted” to direct; the film now will be released in 2025. Danny Boyle read it and he kind of said, ‘Yeah, OK. Garland continued, “And then I was thinking, ‘Why doesn’t he like it? It’s just not that good…’ And then I thought I should be much stranger with this, much odder, so I made a completely different story, which in truth has a ‘Last of Us’ connection. ‘Last of Us’ had such an impact on me.” Druckmann in turn said, “I find it such a compliment. Garland, who is now co-directing military thriller “Warfare” with Navy Seal veteran Ray Mendoza, said that he used to never revisit his past films, including “28 Days Later.” It wasn’t until he had to create story ideas for 2007 sequel “28 Weeks Later” that Garland looked back at his own career. I’d been the director for a few years and I was sort of done with it in various ways.” He added that co-directing “Warfare” with Mendoza made “the job a lot easier.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/tool-lawsuit-100-fans-festival-setlist.html'>100 Fans Are Ready to Sue Tool</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 16:07:32 <p>
“The fact that we’re even talking about this, at all, tells you Tool has a problem.” Photo: Gonzales Photo/Alamy Part of their fan base seems to think so. At the band’s inaugural destination festival in Punta Cana this past weekend, attendees — some of whom shelled out thousands of dollars to be there — raged after a promise of “two unique sets” was not upheld. (Social-media footage showed people booing and hurling expletives at Maynard James Keenan & Co. during the second night.) Now, one disappointed attorney who was present at the festival is initiating a class-action lawsuit. Stas Rusek, a longtime fan leading the case, told Vulture that roughly 100 attendees have already signed up. While he doesn’t have a filing date in mind, Rusek plans to do so as soon as “ethically possible” after investigating all of his clients’ claims. While not exactly a Fyre Festival level of chaos, the Tool quandary presents a new and amusing legal logic to ponder: If your favorite artist asserts that they’ll do two distinctive concerts and doesn’t follow through, are you entitled to financial compensation? “The fact that we’re even talking about this, at all, tells you Tool has a problem,” he says. One hundred fans have signed up for the class-action lawsuit, with more expected to be added in the coming weeks. It’s the type of thing no band wants. The main thing I tell my students, which relates to the intersection of music and law, is even when the law is on your side, something like this doesn’t look good. With social media, you’re able to quickly rack up signatures for stuff like this. How could one define “unique” in a lawsuit like this? There might be a little bit of playing fast and loose with lingo and the word “unique.” There are two different ways one can interpret that word. What if it was, “Each night we’ll play one single and unique song”? There’s a legitimate argument that fans expected no overlap, and there’s also an argument for the band that “unique” doesn’t necessarily mean every song in the set list. Listen, I’m not a Tool fan myself. But I’m unsure if there’s a strong claim on false advertising. Some of the weekend packages went for over $7,000 when tallying up tickets and hotels. I’m someone who buys concert tickets a lot at different price points. That feeds into what the contract is between Tool and its fans, or the promoters for Tool and its fans. As long as the advertising itself wasn’t actually deemed misleading, the contract between them is what happens when you buy the ticket and agree to all those terms and conditions. I have no doubt that buried in there are all sorts of things like, There’s no guarantee for specific songs played and it’s all at the discretion of the performers. Do you feel that makes a difference at all, as opposed to a random attorney who doesn’t have strong feelings toward the band? I don’t want to criticize the lawyer, but one of the first things they taught us in law school was “never represent yourself.” And that’s because what a disinterested lawyer would do is bring in that objectivity. But a disinterested lawyer would tell him, “Look, it’s probably not a strong case.” I’m not saying there’s no chance, but there’s a lot of things working against this particular lawsuit, and it’s going to cost you a lot of money. Since this person is personally affected, using his own time, and not trying to persuade another lawyer, he’s motivated. He’s already caused them trouble simply from the negative publicity. My gut tells me that this isn’t going to go very far in terms of a court suit. You don’t want them to say something that might make the lawsuit even worse. If I were managing and advising Tool, I’d say, “Without saying we did anything legally wrong, we acknowledge the unhappiness of the fans.” And I’d voluntarily rebate a portion of the ticket prices. Again, not because they’re legally obligated to. Maybe it’ll be negotiated with this particular lawyer, or maybe the band will decide to do it. They shouldn’t be sued by their fans. Does a lawsuit like this worry you at all, in terms of a precedent being set for touring musicians and what they could open themselves up to in the future? It’s not the worst thing in the world if artists are more careful about how they speak and what they put out there. That’s going to be the natural next step: If there’s any concession here, the lawyers will be like, “Make sure you let me look at your advertising before it goes out. We don’t want to create a potential liability.” What wouldn’t be a good thing if a fan sued for a reason like, “I didn’t like how the timbre of this artist’s voice sounded that night.” Some things are beyond the control of the artist. But this is something that can be controlled.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Chances are, therefore, that you didn’t have to wait much longer than an hour and ten minutes in real time between starting the premiere and arriving at the deliciously nasty opening scene of episode two. Brother, I’ll take all of that ya got. It works marvelously well, especially once you get a chance to compare and contrast the perkily vicious Morgaise with her daughter, whom we’ve come to know and love as Elayne. Elaida is with her, of course, and as a former rival of the Aes Sedai’s current honcho, Siuan, for the Amyrlin Seat, her presence is fraught. It’s the brothers who tip Elayne off that the true purpose of their visit is to bring her with them when they return. Note that Gaebril’s presence in the retinue seems to surprise almost everyone who meets him, giving the impression he was probably just some rando who got lucky in love rather than the result of Morgaise forming a strategic romantic alliance with a preexisting power player; maybe this is why he and the relatively down-to-earth Princess Elayne are so comfortable with each other. Gaebril tells Elayne that things are going poorly for Queen Morgaise back home. Elayne listens to all this with an open mind. But she still chooses to stay in the White Tower and even convinces her imperious mother of its wisdom. Siuan has called upon Elayne and Nynaeve to be her “hounds,” rooting out any remaining Black Ajah presence within the White Tower; since Liandrin kidnaped them, sold into slavery, and ultimately aided the Dragon Reborn, the Amyrlin knows she can trust them like no one else. Having already fought a Forsaken, Elayne knows the Last Battle is coming, and her homeland’s as much at risk in that conflict as anyplace else. But it’s not only a desire to see the job done that motivates Elayne. She feels that if she’s to hold the kingdom of Andor’s Lion Throne, she has to earn the job like her mom did, not just have it handed to her. Her next stop will be the Arches so she can take the final test and become Accepted like Egwene and Nynaeve before her. The whole royal visit cramps Mat Cauthon’s style. Going around showing it off so a bunch of 19-year-olds will fuck you is, therefore, stupid on an almost cosmic scale. Chastened, Mat gives her the horn, although given the White Tower’s recent track record with magic-artifact security, I’m not sure she’d have been my first choice. She apologizes to Mat for having sold him out back in season two, and she’s trying to make up for it by secretly working for Siuan, posing as a White Tower servant while actually gathering intel on the Aes Sedai and their future. That future looks bleak: Yet another deadly battle within the tower’s walls is coming, she says, though she can’t say when or why or with whom. Indeed, Perrin is their actual target in the town. But he and his companions aren’t the only supernaturally supercharged people Mrs. al’Vere is hiding in her attic. To Perrin’s surprise, Alanna (Priyanka Bose), one of the Aes Sedai allies of our main character Moiraine, and Maksim (Taylor Napier), the surviving member of Alanna’s Warder throuple, are squirreled away there too, recovering from wounds they say were inflicted by the Trollocs. It’s weird, though: Tracks from the nearest Waygate — basically the Warp Zones from Super Mario Bros., but they’re ornate doors instead of sewer pipes — indicate they traveled through that extradimensional portal without an Ogier guide, something only the evil dark friends do. Indeed, the idea that no homecoming is truly possible for these characters is a running theme, and has been ever since Moiraine told Rand this in so many words during the premiere. Elayne can’t return to her mother’s troubled kingdom without risking the larger mission against the Black Ajah and their master. Perrin can’t go back to his hometown without running afoul of the radicals who’ve already tortured him once before, back in season one. Aviendha has brought her messiah back to “the Three-fold Land,” as the Aiel name their own country, but does so knowing it means that country’s downfall. It’s like Elayne tells her royal mother: “There’s no going back to a cloistered life … Far too much is at stake. Safety is a luxury the world no longer affords us.” Someone please call Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and the administration of Columbia University — they need to hear this! But it’s the little things that make this episode superior to its predecessor. Costume designer Sharon Gilham, for example, is clearly having a whale of a time, from Queen Morgaise’s Lewis Carroll finery to Moiraine’s Radagast hat. Williams and Aghdashloo class up the proceedings by their mere presence alone; Williams in particular is a hoot as her much younger, somewhat sociopathic self in the cold open. Donal Finn, the most unpredictable actor in the core cast, does delightful comic work as Mat, especially in his awkward meeting with Siuan. Elayne’s boozy chat with her stepdad, Gaebril, feels realistic and warm.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Directors Robert Olsen and Dan Berk are well known to horror fans for smart, scary, and sometimes quite funny thrillers like “Body,” “Villains,” and “Significant Other.” With their latest film, “Novocaine,” the precise and expressive visual style of those early films remains, but the genre is new: The story of a mild-mannered banker (Jack Quaid) on a quest to save his kidnapped new girlfriend (Amber Midthunder) is a full-on action movie packed with exhilarating set pieces. “We’ve wanted to make an action movie for a very long time, but it’s really hard early in your career,” Berk told IndieWire’s Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. While “Novocaine” has a modest budget for a studio feature — somewhere just shy of that 20-million-dollar figure — it has no shortage of scale or ambitious set pieces, something the directors say was partly achievable thanks to the decision to shoot in Cape Town, South Africa. “It has a coastal vibe that can play as Miami or San Diego, but then you go inland, and the downtown area could be New York City. And then a few blocks away looks like New Orleans.” That said, shooting in South Africa did pose unusual challenges. “There’s a lot in Cape Town that is structurally different,” Olsen said. He has a rare disorder that keeps him from feeling pain — both an advantage and a major problem as he fights one bad guy after another on his path to saving his love interest. “What we like about ‘Lethal Weapon’ and ‘Die Hard’ is that they’re really funny, yet they’re not full-on comedies where you lose the stakes,” Olsen said. “We wanted to make a movie that was really funny but grounded, and what drew us to this movie was the fact that [Nate] couldn’t fight. “For some reason, [the industry] has lost sight of building movies from character out,” Berk said.

WASHINGTON—Following a daring operation that saw authorities seize the man’s property and detain him in an undisclosed location, FBI director Kash Patel announced Thursday that federal agents had uncovered 43 terabytes of free speech from local protestor Andrew Wyman’s residence. “Every American should be chilled to the core by the overwhelming display of constitutionally protected speech we found on this deviant’s computer and phone,” Patel said as he stood before a table covered in countless hard drives, folders, and documents that he described as “disturbing evidence” of America’s most inalienable and foundational right being put into practice. “What’s incredible is that this creep got away with it for so long: Every day, he was out there in public, expressing his own convictions, as every U.S. resident—citizen or noncitizen—has done since our nation’s founding. Thankfully, we got a tip about posts he had made on social media suggesting he might be the sort of freak who spends time conveying his beliefs to others without fear of retribution from a tyrannical government, possibly because that practice is expressly enshrined in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights. This guy was sick, really sick. Make no mistake, our team is pursuing every legal remedy to ensure something like this never happens again.” Patel then praised those involved in the raid for intervening before the suspect went on to use his legally guaranteed right to peaceably assemble.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/review-the-day-the-earth-blew-up-a-looney-tunes-movie.html'>A New Looney Tunes Movie Has Escaped Containment</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 14:09:48 <p>
Comically massive in scale yet modest in ambition, The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie thumbs its nose at our fascination with spectacle. Especially in the wake of Coyote vs. Acme’s much-publicized extermination by the dark forces that run Warner Bros. nowadays, it already feels like a small miracle that The Day the Earth Blew Up (which was initially meant to premiere on Max but was handed off to a smaller distributor, Ketchup Entertainment) is even getting released. Director Peter Browngardt, who already rebooted the Looney Tunes cartoons for Max several years ago, is an old hand at this by now. His new feature ably captures the Looney Tunes spirit, which is something our world can always use more of — and which is a far more formidable endeavor than might at first seem. An alien spaceship has spiked an immensely popular bubblegum with an interdimensional ectoplasm that turns everyone who chews it into zombies, and the only ones who can save humanity are bickering foster brothers Daffy Duck and Porky Pig (both voiced by Eric Bauza). The always-bold, always-hyper Daffy is incorrigibly incompetent, while shy milquetoast Porky is too busy nursing a crush on beautiful gum-flavor scientist Petunia Pig (voiced by Candi Milo) to ever really accomplish much. Their hand-drawn antics play out against a backdrop of familiar (and welcome) Looney Tunes imagery: beautiful blue skies, verdant green lawns, mid-century architecture … with those sudden, jagged changes in shape and color and texture that this style of animation does so well. There’s a reason why the Looney Tunes franchise was built around shorts for most of its existence. Its goofy, devil-may-care logic and rapid-fire comedy rarely translated to feature-length run times. A lot of the early Looney Tunes features were just packaged shorts, and most original movies with these cartoon characters have been live-action hybrids (think Space Jam, or the wonderfully underrated Looney Tunes: Back in Action). Thus, before the main story kicks in, we’ve already witnessed a montage of Daffy and Porky growing up, and we’ve also been treated to a film-within-a-film (complete with its own credits and everything) following these two adorable ding-dongs’ hapless attempts at employment. When they do find steady jobs — at the local bubblegum factory, of course — color and detail drain from the screen and we’re treated to a Constructivist musical sequence featuring sepia silhouettes of Daffy and Porky dancing among the giant, churning gears of monstrous machines. Even the cliché needle drops feel weirdly on point: A flashback sequence plays out against Bryan Adams’s “(Everything I Do) I Do It for You,” while one climactic scene is scored to R.E.M.’s “It’s the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine).” The whole thing works because once you’ve captured the casual vibe of a spoof, you can basically get away with anything. And one benefit of a plot built on relentlessly surreal happenstance is that eventually every new plot development starts to feel like a twist — because nothing is predetermined, and rationality and rigor have already gone out the window.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/the-wheel-of-time-recap-season-3-episode-1.html'>The Wheel of Time Season-Premiere Recap: The People of the Dragon</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 14:00:10 <p>
The gardener’s job isn’t to draw and execute blueprints; it’s to prune and cultivate the blossoms into a pleasing shape. I haven’t read The Wheel of Time, the 15-volume epic-fantasy saga by the late author (and close friend of Martin’s) Robert Jordan and, following Jordan’s death, his collaborator and chosen successor, Brandon Sanderson. They’re more like Abstract Expressionist painters, dipping their brushes into big cans of epic-fantasy stuff and just splashing them all across the canvas. But eventually, a picture emerges, one that clearly communicates the artist’s ideas and emotions. Even if it’s difficult to make them out now, hey, that sure is a lot of bright-colored paint they flung at the wall, isn’t it? Together with his posse of supernaturally gifted and very good-looking friends, he slew Ishamael (Fares Fares), the chief lieutenant of the satanic Dark One, and repelled an invasion by the Seanchan, an overseas empire that enslaves magic-wielding women while wearing armor that looks like Eiko Ishioka designed it. Unlike women, men in this world are not permitted to “channel the One Power” — i.e., use magic— because it invariably corrupts them and drives them insane enough to slaughter those close to them, along with anyone else who stands in their way. Two very important Aes Sedai — Moiraine (Rosamund Pike), who’d made finding the Dragon Reborn her life’s work, and Siuan (Sophie Okonedo), Moiraine’s sometime lover and the head of the order — knew this was happening and failed to bring Rand under Aes Sedai control. (It seems to me that magically enforced rules don’t do much good if they only apply to the good guys, but that’s where respecting norms gets you every time.) They escape the Amyrlin Seat and her star witness, Nynaeve (Zoë Robins), a magic-wielding friend of Rand’s who was sold into captivity by Liandrin and has since become so afraid of her power she can no longer use it. Naturally, Rand, the Dark One’s nemesis, is tops on their hit list. Now the question of what to do next is more pressing than ever. Moiraine has an unlikely backer in this plan, too: Lanfear (Natasha O’Keeffe), the sexy domme Forsaken with whom Rand has had an actually pretty sincere romance. She’s probably up to no good in some way, as that’s her nature, but she really seems to want him to get the sword just so he can protect himself from her evil buddies. The problem is, as always on this show, that Rand is too dedicated to his friends to Do What Must Be Done. Tough to blame him, too, considering how many friends he’s now accrued. A post-battle scene in which Moiraine, Rand, and the rest of the gang debate their next steps slowly reveals a hilariously large posse, which includes (deep breath): Moiraine Damodred (Rosamund Pike), Rand’s surly and scheming female Gandalf figure. Nynaeve al’Meara (Zoë Robins), Rand’s old pal and Lan’s love interest, an Aes Sedai trainee possessing mega-powerful magic barely under her own control. Mat Cauthon (Donal Finn), Rand’s ne’er-do-well pal who can’t seem stop picking up magical items, like a cursed dagger and the legendary Horn of Valere, that grant him great powers at the expense of his sanity. Perrin Aybara (Marcus Rutherford), a hulking, sad-voiced blacksmith turned werewolf (it happens). Elayne Trakand (Ceara Coveney), an influential princess turned acolyte at the White Tower who has impressive healing powers and with whom there’s a budding thing going on with Rand. Bain (Ragga Ragnars) and Chiad (Maja Simonsen), Aveindha’s Aiel sisters-in-arms, who are loyal to Perrin because he freed Aviendha from captivity and who enjoy flirting with the various hunks they now hang out with. Plus there’s Siuan Sanche (Sophie Okonedo) and Alanna Mosvani (Priyanka Bose), Moiraine’s closest Aes Sedai allies, who also know who and where all these important kids are. (I truly apologize for the massive text/info dump, dear reader, but if you can think of a more succinct way to sum up the show’s core cast of 15 or so characters, be my guest! To force Rand’s hand, Moiraine and Lanfear concoct a plan. Lanfear will use her powers to stage an attack on Rand and all his friends while they’re shacked up with each other in various configurations one night, deliberately using the trademark spells of other Forsaken to deflect suspicion. What neither woman counts on is, well, other Forsaken. Specifically, Moghedien (Laia Costa) the creepy little goth Forsaken who looks and talks like Dark Björk, sends in one of her Gray Men, virtually imperceptible and unstoppable undead assassins only she can manufacture, apparently. The Gray Man nearly kills Nynaeve before all is said and done. Nynaeve and Elayne stay in the city of Tar Valon, where all this has taken place, to continue their training in the White Tower. Mat stays behind with them in hopes that Nynaeve can re-harness her powers and use them to heal his brain, which now thinks in ancient tongues and is plagued by memories that aren’t his own. Perrin sets out for the group’s old hometown, the Two Rivers, with Loial as a guide and Bain and Chiad in tow. He won’t go to the ancient stronghold to retrieve his big sword of destiny unless and until he has an army at his back. To be honest, the show, which I enjoy quite a bit, suffers from it. Even in the opening battle, 15 minutes or so of CGI lasers and force fields and blood and property destruction, there are simply so many people, many of whom you only know by sight, if at all. I swear that like 20 characters have speaking parts before Rand and Egwene and them even show up, at which point things get more convoluted, not less. This is a generous way of saying, “This episode is incoherent.” But it’s incoherent like a fox, or at the very least it’s incoherent on purpose. I don’t think anyone involved in it labored under the delusion that this is a great entry point for new viewers or a simple way to ease existing fans back into the action. It’s not designed to explain or elucidate its massive collection of characters and concepts; it’s designed to flex on having them all at its disposal. The tightness and focus were what made those story lines work; there’s nothing nearly so solid on offer here. I mean, Egwene goes through the Arches just like Nynaeve does, but we only get one glimpse of what’s going on in her mind in there before it’s over. That’s an apples-to-apples comparison in which the earlier apple is clearly superior. And it’s the job of a premiere like to catch you up with every character it can, as quickly as possible, even if there’s like 40 of them, several of whom perish from being CGI’d to death.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/reacher-recap-season-3-episode-6-smoke-on-the-water.html'>Reacher Recap: The Russians Are Coming</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 14:00:10 <p>
Quinn/McCabe — whom I’ll just call Quinn for the remainder of this briefing — even interrupts his own reprimand of Beck for hiring an ATF agent as his housekeeper to praise him for bringing on the tall and equally wide drink of water standing next to him. He doesn’t even notice that Reacher is holding a pistol behind his back. Quinn makes it clear to Beck and Reacher — and to Duffy and Villanueva, listening in via the super-secure government-issue cell phone Reacher is no longer even bothering to conceal in his shoe — that he’s been keeping Duffy’s informant Teresa Daniel alive because “the client has a thing for redheads.” Quinn deals weapons for profit but dabbles in human trafficking for free. But he still needs Zachary alive to complete this big, pending sale, he says, because “the client” expects to close the deal with Zachary. Quinn evidently knows enough Russian to translate his lender’s reply to his request for more time as “Give a man a fingernail and he’ll take the whole arm.” This guy must be really bad news if Quinn is afraid of him. Driving Pa Beck back to his mansion, Reacher takes an odd swerve into family counselor mode, telling the gunrunner that his son deserves to know that the reason he’s been made to suffer these last five years is because, welp, his old man is a gunrunner. Sure, Zachary Beck has had his business absorbed into that of a more violent and ruthless arms merchant, but his sins are far worse than just bribing customs officials to avoid import duties on rugs or whatever. It doesn’t make much sense that Beck knows all about the deal Quinn made with the Russian mob when Quinn treats him as a lackey rather than a partner, but the writers need to shovel this exposition into our mouths somehow. Reacher suggests they head into town to find some glue to repair the vintage toy pistol Richard bought as a gift for Zachary’s imminent 50th birthday party, which was damaged by a trio of 35-year-old bullies before Reacher beat them in episode three. Reacher, we learn, has suggested this so he can rendezvous with Duffy and return her badge. In what one really cannot call a rare breach of discipline, Duffy is so grateful that Reacher didn’t just kill Quinn when he had the chance, which would’ve doomed their chances of rescuing Teresa, that she plants a kiss on him. Sure enough, when Richard finds his way into that alley mere seconds later, the jig is like a beloved 2009 Pixar film: up. Zachary Beck is doing some serious hand-biting in this episode, expressing his envy for the way Richard looks up to Reacher. I wonder when yours is coming?” Zachary’s anger and jealousy towards Reacher is misplaced but — like so vanishingly few elements of Reacher — plausible and convincing. It isn’t Richard who ultimately blows Reacher’s cover. It’s the fact that Quinn learns from some identified source that Warrant Officer Powell at the 110th Special Investigations Unit ran his license plate and that Reacher’s friend and frequent partner-in-vigilante-justice Frances Neagley, formerly of the 110th, pulled the military dossiers on Angel Doll, Winston Duke, and Paulie Van Hoven not long after that. Powell, that Warrant Officer who was so chuffed to be speaking to the legendary Major Jack Reacher back in episode one, proves he’s no clay-footed fanboy, absorbing a brutal beating while refusing to give up Reacher’s name. (He did already name Reacher to Duffy after she threatened to charge him with obstruction of justice, which is how Duffy roped Reacher into her reckless undercover operation in the first place.) Piss-poor security for what we’ve been told is an elite private-investigation firm! When one of Neagley’s assailants, bleeding out from the abdomen, asks the woman he just tried to kill to call him an ambulance, Neagley replies, “You’re an ambulance.” The dad jokes, more than any other single element, are what keep me watching Reacher. Anyway, the fact that both of the parties checking up on Quinn and his associates are current or former members of the 110th makes it a cinch for even a dummy like Beck to figure out that Reacher, who used his reputation as the founder of that unit to persuade Beck to hire him, is a traitor. He calls Duffy for help, but not before several ATV-riding henchmen pursue him into the woods. What begins as yet another gunfight morphs into a horror-movie scenario: Reacher covers his face in mud like Arnold at the end of Predator and kills the last of his assailants by strangling him using a winch mounted on one of the ATVs. At the Beck house, Quinn muses that “nothing beats a serrated knife” while displaying some truly amateurish kitchen-knife handling skills. Richard’s odds are lousier than Reacher’s were when Beck forced Reacher to play because this revolver is a five-shot model instead of a six-shooter. (Also, Richard doesn’t have a notch cut into the cylinder to help him see which chamber the bullet is in like Reacher did.) You might’ve thought Reacher was too overcome with grief, confusion, physical pain, or some miserable cocktail of all those things while carrying out poor Annette’s corpse off for disposal last episode to pay attention while Harley yammered on about how this unplanned killing had shipwrecked his weekend plans. Reacher heard Harley brag about his boat, the Sweet Marie, because in a flash of insight, Reacher now tells Duffy that the boat is where Teresa is being held. They swim out to investigate, finding evidence that Teresa was indeed kept there under sedation. Rather than attempt to extinguish the flames, Reacher tosses in more fuel. And that’s an explosive wrap for Harley, the loathsome little weasel. Reacher chides Duffy for stealing looks at his presumably Reacher-size junk while they change out of their wetsuits, but she’s more upset about the fact their last lead for finding Teresa just blew up. I wonder what Canadian metropolis will play the City of Angels. • I’ve been waiting for three episodes now for Reacher’s daylight beatdown of Richard’s bullies in downtown Abbottsville to produce some consequences. Reacher’s strained relations with inept and/or corrupt local law enforcement is a recurring feature of Lee Child’s Reacher novels and their screen adaptations, but it appears there is no local law enforcement in Abbottsville.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/sam-seder-says-his-viral-debate-was-a-little-disturbing.html'>Sam Seder Knows His Viral Debate Was ‘a Little Bit Disturbing’</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 13:59:31 <p>
This week, the lone representative was Sam Seder, host of the progressive internet radio show and podcast The Majority Report, who engaged in a rhetorical gauntlet with an eclectic group of young and diverse Trump supporters. The result was a mix of debate club, speed chess, and musical chairs: Participants leapt from their seats to claim a space in front of Seder, where they could address a progression of claims (“Trump’s policies make the rich richer and the poor poorer,” etc.) and were removed from the spotlight only when ten of their confederates indicate that their views are not being adequately represented by raising a red flag. Surrounded, which takes place in an almost Squid Game–like setting inside an industrial-stark nowhere space, is quite the watch: At one point in Seder’s episode, you see him square off with a young man who fiercely and falsely believes that government agencies receive tax breaks for hiring diverse employees (they don’t, because federal agencies are not private businesses); at another, you see Seder come to swift awareness that the young blonde woman in front of him is quite literally a Christian nationalist. The series comes from Jubilee Media, a Los Angeles company that’s grown into a YouTube juggernaut over the past eight years by producing social-experiment-esque content that typically involve throwing people with conflicting beliefs in the same room and seeing what happens: scientists versus flat-earthers, vegans versus meat-eaters, cops versus, uh, criminals. Since rolling out in September, the series has shot videos with right-wing commentators Ben Shapiro, Charlie Kirk, and Michael Knowles, along with the anti-abortion activist Lila Rose. Before Seder showed up, former secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg was the lone left-leaning figure to anchor an episode. These videos reliably go viral, and Seder’s entry was no different. How did you end up doing one of these videos? They reached out to a guy who sometimes functions as my manager. We recorded back in January, back in the wake of the L.A. fires — I wasn’t even sure we were still going to do it. It was still pretty hazy when I got out there. Are you a big consumer of Jubilee’s stuff? To be honest with you, I only had a vague awareness of it. I think I had seen some clips when some of the right-wing guys had been on it, but my daughter, who’s 19, was like, “You gotta do it. Everybody our age watches that.” So that’s what basically convinced me. In your perspective, what was this video supposed to achieve? I went in with the intention of trying to correct some false narratives out there. I wanted to communicate what was going on with Project 2025. DOGE hadn’t fully geared up at that point, because we filmed in the last week of January, and they were still in that mode where they were saying these cuts only had to do with DEI. So I wanted to expose the dynamic that when they attack government agencies ostensibly because of DEI, what they’re really doing is what Republicans always do, which is to attack the administrative state. But my understanding of why Jubilee makes these videos is to establish a sense of potential for “common ground.” Was that something you felt was possible in that room? I don’t enter into these things with the notion of achieving common ground. Particularly with the advocates of these agendas, I don’t think they’re seeking common ground. So for me, engaging with this isn’t so much it being about a blood sport, but more about trying to educate the audience — not the people I’m debating with. They asked me to write the claims, and I tried to fashion the claims in a way where it was more policy oriented and more concrete than what I’ve seen in the past. Because you had to juggle with that alongside debating people simply believed in objectively false statements. It was exhausting, and the people they cut out were even more, shall we say, off topic. I’m gonna let them espouse their agenda and allow the audience to decide if that’s the vision of America that they want. With the theocrat, it took me a while to understand what he was actually saying in terms of he was probably espousing a society where women are subjugated by men, where trans people don’t exist, where marriage rights are not extended to anyone but heterosexual couples. If I had to do it again, I would have attempted to realize that first and then just let him espouse how he envisions America instead of fighting him so hard. Because from my perspective, I do think there is a majority of people in this country, and even a significant chunk of Trump voters, who don’t want that. But isn’t that a risky thing to do? To sit back and say, “I’ll let them hang themselves,” because we do have a resulting situation where clips from this video then go out into the internet and right-wing commentators like Matt Walsh say, “Look at this guy destroying Sam Seder.” Because the guy did, to use your words, hang himself. He’s making this academic argument when my argument is, “What are the implications of this?” They may think amongst themselves that they have a “rational explanation” for why the Bible should supplant the Constitution, but I’m betting that the majority of the public who watch these things don’t want to live in a world where gay people are ostracized or women are subjugated. And by embracing somebody who is so explicit about it, it should cause their audience to realize what is at the heart of their agenda. I haven’t spent too much time noodling around, but somebody sent me Michael Knowles’s video response, and looking through his comments section on YouTube, there are people who are saying, “What are you talking about?” Which, for me, is the goal I had going into this. You might not peel off the majority of his audience. You might not even peel out a substantial chunk. But if you get some percentage of people greater than 0 percent to look at this guy with a more jaundiced eye, you might amount to something. What could you tell me about that casting choice? Did you think Jubilee’s casting choices here were trying to communicate something? It feels like there’s a very specific story being told when you’re assembling a group of Trump supporters, and they’re all young and diverse. Firstly, I think the casting is impacted by it being in L.A., and secondly, and this is all complete conjecture on my part because I literally had no conversations with anybody associated with Jubilee about this, but I can imagine a world where they just had twenty white guys there and conservatives would complain that you’re not showing the diversity of the conservative movement. But I have no idea about their casting process. The age dynamic is one that really stood out to me. Many of them were younger than you by quite some margin. And because of that dynamic, it felt like you were in a situation where you were the older guy having to explain life and the world to confident young people. There was one guy who I explained the child tax credit to. He said something like the government can’t control poverty, and I told him we cut child poverty by 45 percent in this country. He did not believe me, and after we were done, I brought him into the green room as I was getting my bag and brought it up on my phone. Just the level of assuredness that they had in things I knew were so fundamentally wrong. But I think they did a pretty good job of cutting those people out. I noticed you made it a point to sort of shake the other person’s hand when their turn was up. There are circumstances where there are people whose hand I would not shake, but I need to know them first and have a reason. The only conversation I had with any of them outside of sitting in that chair was that one guy who just came back and I showed the cut in child poverty. I want to close out with a question about the format. You went in with the specific goal of refuting false narratives and getting your perspective out there. It seems to me that these Jubilee YouTube videos have a certain belief in the idea of staging these debates as a force that can cultivate empathy. I’m curious what you think about that very premise. To be honest with you, I don’t know. I don’t know if there’s much value in me thinking about that because I don’t have control over it.

Mickey 17 is Pattinson’s latest vocal experiment and yet another opportunity for the actor to throw himself far from the heartthrob he’s known to be and into territory much weirder and more interesting than his looks alone could ever convince you he is. Pattinson infuses Mickey 17’s nervous disposition with a voice that wobbles and groans with abject misery, pitching his tone upward so it sounds like a door creaking on its hinges. While many British actors approach the “American accent” as a sweeping attempt to hit all 50 states, Pattinson goes for region (like his “Hahvahd Yahd”–lite New England drawl in The Lighthouse) and specificity (that native New York bite in Good Time), hitting a tone or pitch that echoes a character’s, well, character. He’s gone up higher for other roles before, like his shrill turn as a rotten southern preacher in The Devil All the Time and his sassy French accent in The King. He’s gone lower when playing Batman and for his California drawl in Map to the Stars. He’s put himself through the accent wringer so many times that when he actually does play English — as he did in Tenet and The Lost City of Z — there’s a novelty to his posh affectation, as if perhaps he was making that up the whole time, too. There are lots of strange actors currently who contort and modulate their bodies and looks by appealing to their distinctive features. Barry Keoghan can change the tenor of a scene just by shifting his shoulders; Rami Malek has built a career on showing up and blinking either too much or too little. We’ve seen physical chameleons gaining and losing weight or piling on a bunch of prosthetics. There are endless ways to change your appearance onscreen, but it’s rarer for a guy to use his own body like a ventriloquist’s dummy. While Pattinson has long worked to shed the pretty-boy type he played in the Twilight films, he has rarely altered his look; sometimes he dyes his hair or has a beard, but you always know when you’re looking at Robert Pattinson. As with Christian Bale, yet another Batman, it’s difficult to remember what he’s actually supposed to sound like, his voice now distorted and amplified across a number of bizarre characters. He is as unrecognizable as an actor could be, disappearing so thoroughly into the part that it’s easy to question if it’s really Pattinson down in that strange bird. The animation puts Pattinson’s physical twitchiness and good looks at a remove; he contorts all that is magnetic about himself as a performer and spits it out through the character’s beak. After playing the same character for five Twilight movies in a row, he never wants anyone to know what they’ll see — or hear — next when they look at him on the big screen. In the near(ish) future of the film, scientists have created a 3-D printer that can make multiple copies of living humans in order to kill and remake and re-kill the same person with the same biology over and over like a guinea pig. He may know very well what his multiple looks like, but Mickey 17 never knows what the man who looks like him is going to say.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

JACKSON, MS—Seeking to assuage consumer concerns about dwindling supplies, the nation’s egg companies reportedly assured shoppers this week that a dozen has always meant nine. “While we have seen some temporary shortfalls due to the avian flu, I want to let all our loyal customers know that we will continue to sell delicious, farm-fresh eggs by the dozen, which is a colloquial way to refer to the number nine,” said Cal-Maine Foods CEO Sherman Miller, joining egg producers across the country to tout the product as still readily available in the same paper-pulp or plastic containers that hold a dozen eggs plus “three empty, bonus chambers.” “Eggs are a crucial staple of the American diet, and they’re not going anywhere. So come by your local grocery store today and pick out whatever size suits you best—our smaller half dozen, which is to say four eggs, all the way up to our 18-pack, which can hold anywhere from 12 to 15.” Miller added that his company was proud to continue their longstanding tradition of making one out of every five eggs a decoy made of styrofoam.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

JOPLIN, MO—In an effort to ensure the sustained growth of the white race and prevent the decline of Western civilization, a local school district launched a new pronatalist sex education class Thursday that requires students to care for 14 sacks of flour. “For the next week, each of our seventh-graders will be in charge of 14 sacks of flour in order to learn about responsibility and propagating the next generation of true Americans,” said school superintendent Ray Schuett, adding that minority students would be excused from the program. “One day these kids will be adults, and it’s imperative they understand how having only one or two kids negatively impacts the economy. This project will teach our students what’s required to restore our nation’s fertility rate to a level that guarantees future GDP growth. Obviously this is just a fun demonstration, but we hope it gives students a taste of how to support their country by having as many children as possible.” Schuett added that seventh-grade girls could earn one extra credit point for each additional sack of flour they supervised.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

“I was very disappointed there weren’t more women nominated.” (From left: Liam Gallagher, Cyndi Lauper, and Jack White.) Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Getty Images (Harry Durrant, Scott Legato), Didier Messens/Redferns If this year’s Gen X–heavy Rock & Roll Hall of Fame shortlist indicates anything, it’s that your reign is coming to an end. This evolution was inevitable for the Rock Hall, which has recently rebranded itself as a more generalized hub for popular music. “But sometimes you wind up with strange ballots — and this is one of the stranger ballots.” Another member is more blunt: “I was very disappointed that there weren’t more women nominated. There had been a trend in recent years of trying to right the gender imbalance, so I was surprised it was so male dominated.” This year’s shortlist is the most regressive in years for gender diversity, with only four artists (Cyndi Lauper, Mariah Carey, the White Stripes’ Meg White, and New Order’s Gillian Gilbert) representing a female contingent. “I really have no idea who’s going to get in,” the voter adds with a sigh. For the fourth consecutive year, Vulture has gathered two voters for the Rock Hall to anonymously analyze what their ballots look like. While their strategies and allegiances may vary, they’re both in firm agreement on one thing: Why the hell is Chubby Checker there? Are they an ever-present classic-rock act heard on the radio to this day? “Feel Like Makin’ Love” may be a meathead anthem, but it’s catchy. I won’t vote for them, though, because I’m trying to use my vote strategically to help women and people of color. Voter 2: When you look at people talking about the Rock Hall and saying, “Why isn’t X inducted?,” Bad Company is up there every year. You have Paul Rodgers and Simon Kirke, so you have links to Free, Mott the Hoople, and King Crimson. They have a good chance of getting in without my vote. But do I think they deserve to be on this ballot? This comes up with the Monkees argument every year. If they get in, it’s because people will say, “When you think rock and roll in the ’90s, you think Black Crowes.” Voter 2: It had never occurred to me that the Black Crowes, of all bands, would get nominated. I just don’t think they’re Rock Hall–worthy. Voter 1: I buy the argument that Mariah Carey’s hybridization of Whitney Houston–style singing with hip-hop aesthetics is influential. Bluntly, it felt good to let her go by for at least one ballot. In a world where everybody from Radiohead to Janet Jackson didn’t get in on their first ballot, why was it such an outrage that Mariah didn’t, either? Unlike Whitney, who had to do a Teddy Pendergrass duet before she actually broke in the mid-’80s, Mariah launched her career with five No. This gal has rarely waited very long for anything. When you’re thinking about mixing pop, hip-hop, soul, and R&B, she excelled at it all. His career is overshadowed by one big and important hit. I’m not sure why he was nominated in this main Performer category. I’m surprised he wouldn’t get in as an Early Influence. Voter 1: I’m partially disappointed by this nomination because it would’ve been nice if he had been on the ballot while alive. He’s a very distinctive vocalist, but the recorded output is spotty. “Up Where We Belong” and “You Are So Beautiful” aren’t priority songs in the history of rock and roll. You’re basically voting for him as a song stylist. He sits in the Linda Ronstadt–type category in that he’s such a wonderful interpreter of music and other artists’ songs. What his impact is, I don’t know. Voter 1: Do I need to vote for this guitar-wielding white man? This nomination is basically about Billy playing ball with the Rock Hall. Not to be too cynical, but appearing at a couple of ceremonies is notoriously a way to get on the ballot. The main thing I love about him is he’s a tough genre categorization. If anything gets me to vote for Billy, it’s his shape-shifter nature. Voter 2: I would never have anticipated Billy Idol getting inducted. When you think of ’80s solo acts, he was huge. He started off in Generation X as a real punk-rocker and translated that attitude to rock and pop music for decades. But this year, there were other people I felt needed my vote more. Voter 1: However many times they appear, I’ll check that box. If ever there were a cause célèbre for my generation, it should be them. Voter 2: They weren’t exactly a no-brainer, but I’m like, Yeah, it’s about time. It’s funny that the Rock Hall insists on lumping them together, because they’re so different in terms of their specific sound. When you’re just looking at influence, they both continue to reverberate. In the end, I did, and this year it’s even easier for me. First of all, there aren’t enough women on this ballot. Yes, the career gets thin after the first two albums, but what she achieved on those albums — especially She’s So Unusual — is vital and important enough. I was upset a few years ago when she didn’t get in. She writes her own songs and has written so many beautiful ones about important topics like abortion. You can’t look at the ’80s without her. She paved the way for any female artist who wants to carve out their own path and not follow convention. Voter 1: There’s a snowball’s chance in hell Maná will get in unless we have enough voters who understand Latin rock. There are certain acts the Rock Hall puts forth that almost feel like trial balloons for somebody they eventually wind up inducting via a side category. I have a feeling Maná will be one of those. Voter 2: I’m not very familiar with them. Still, I’m happy the Rock Hall nominated Maná. I applaud them for saying, “No, this is a rock band who’s influential around the world.” I have a hard time seeing the influence. I suspect a lot of the people voting for them are ten years younger than me who remember the ’90s a little more fondly than I do. Voter 2: They’re so influential, almost in spite of themselves. It’s been 30 years since they first emerged, and bands that are still forming are saying, “I want to sound like Oasis.” The fact they’re coming around to do a victory lap, to say, “Hey, remember us? There was a period in America when they were the consensus stars of their era. They were an act that hip-hop heads and boring white people liked equally. I was a bit disappointed there was only one hip-hop artist on the ballot again this year because when you only have one, it almost looks like they’re the token nominee. We’ve had a lot of hip-hop inducted from the East and West Coasts. Voter 1: If I were going to rank this ballot, Phish would be dead last. I come by my distaste honestly: About ten years ago, I was at a bar with some buddies; I was relatively sober and something had been playing on the jukebox for about 15 minutes. I was finally like, “What is this shit music?” It was in minute 18 of a 20-minute track from the Phish album A Live One. I do appreciate that Trey Anastasio is a genuine fan of rock history. A few years ago, Trey Anastasio inducted Genesis into the Rock Hall and Phish played “Watcher of the Skies.” That unlocked something in my head. I was like, Oh, they’re a prog band. I didn’t vote for them, just because I felt there were other people who deserved it more this particular year. Voter 1: They arguably could’ve gotten in before Nirvana and Pearl Jam and have a bit more influence than them. They were in the Seattle scene long before Nirvana even released an album. I’m trying to find room for Soundgarden this year because they deserve it. This is morbid, but after Chris Cornell died, why didn’t they get in the following year? Voter 2: They’ve probably been dinged for so long because they draw so much on the metal side, especially their earlier stuff. I can see people being a little put off because they hewed toward that end rather than, say, someone else from Seattle who was a bit poppier, like Nirvana. They were a “classic band,” so I voted for them. Jack White is a walking history of rock and roll. I hope if they get in, she can overcome her stage fright and appear with Jack. They were the linchpin for a lot of that. Everyone knows Jack for how he is now as a solo artist, but Meg’s drumming was so unique and the White Stripes wouldn’t have worked without her. Over the years, there’s been more of a reassessment of her drumming because there was so much misogyny and sexism directed toward her.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Awards season only just ended, but we’re already gearing up for 2026. CBS and the Golden Globes on Thursday announced that Nikki Glaser will be back to host the 83rd Annual Golden Globes airing in January 2026 on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ with Showtime in the U.S.

“Hosting the Golden Globes this year was without a doubt the most fun I have ever had in my career,” Glaser said in a statement. “I can’t wait to do it again, and this time in front of the team from ‘The White Lotus’ who will finally recognize my talent and cast me in Season Four as a Scandinavian Pilates instructor with a shadowy past.”

“Nikki Glaser brought a refreshing spark and fearless wit to the Golden Globes stage this year. Her sharp humor, and bold presence set the tone for an unforgettable night, making the ceremony feel vibrant and most of all fun,” said Helen Hoehne, President of the Golden Globes.

Glaser’s return is no surprise. She was a reliably funny personality after a year in which comedian Jo Koy bombed. One of her highlights was a moment in which she seemed poised to launch into a parody song mashup of “Popular” from “Wicked” with “Conclave” for a song called “Pope-ular,” coming on stage in a papal mitre and holding a golden staff, only to cut it off 30 seconds in after pretending to get a note from her producers to end it because “this whole thing sucks.”

However, the ratings for the 2025 ceremony were on par, if slightly below, what they were for Koy’s turn in 2024. The Globes reported that the show averaged 10.1 million viewers, though Nielsen data said it was 9.3 million, which was down an eyelash from 9.4 million in ’24.

Glaser, who was named “Comedian of the Year” by the New York Times, is currently on her “Alive and Unwell” tour across the U.S., Canada, and Australia up through October 2025. She also currently hosts and executive produces “Lovers and Liars,” which is a spinoff of the reality dating series “FBoy Island.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/teyana-taylor-iman-shumpert-divorce.html'>What’s Up With Teyana Taylor and Iman Shumpert’s Messy Divorce?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 11:54:00 <p>
The couple that caused widespread bi panic after starring in the Flashdance-themed music video for Kanye West’s 2016 song “Fade” is splitting up for good. Teyana Taylor and Iman Shumpert finalized their divorce July 1, 2024, in Fulton County, Georgia, per court records, after a judge previously ordered them to submit their divorce settlement in writing by noon on June 27. Despite rampant rumors about their settlement terms since then, final details are sealed, per a July 1 order. The news comes after a protracted divorce proceeding that was first filed in January 2023 and kept hidden from the public until late last year. Taylor secretly filed to divorce former basketball player Shumpert in January 2023 citing his “cruel treatment.” She managed to keep the filing under wraps for a full ten months before reporters caught wind of the divorce in November of last year. In the court documents, Taylor alleges their marriage crumbled because Shumpert was jealous of her fame, grew insecure when photographers requested him to step out of the frame for pictures of her, and felt like he wasn’t good enough for her. Eventually, Shumpert began “treating her cruelly and displaying extreme narcissistic behavior throughout the majority of their marriage,” the filing claims, per TMZ, adding that Shumpert “emotionally and mentally” abused Taylor. He allegedly “did not want her to work” when she became a mother but complained about her lack of employment when she stayed home to raise their two children. She filed for divorce once in 2022 before asking her legal team to withdraw the filing one day later. Since the divorce, there has been speculation about a multimillion-dollar settlement for Taylor. However, the terms of their divorce settlement are sealed, per a July 1, 2024, order. Taylor denied the TMZ reports about Shumpert’s behavior, saying the articles have “misleading headlines.” “My court documents aren’t clickbait for your salacious headlines,” she wrote in an Instagram Story on January 27. Taylor also claimed he failed to feed them when they were under his care and once sent them to Chicago’s United Center arena alone using a rideshare app. While he allegedly put the children in danger, he also allegedly cut off the utilities at their Georgia home, leaving Taylor without Wi-Fi, cable, or water. “Also, let me add,” Taylor wrote, “ALL OF THE UTILITIES IN MY HOME WAS ON THE SAME DAY AFTER THAT SHIT WAS PULLED!! Me and my kids are NEVER GOING TO BE SITTING DUCKS!! I kindly asked you mothaf%ckas to mind ya damn business, and for y’all to respect me and my family’s privacy.” She added, “HOWEVER, y’all keep putting out f%ckery. If you’re going to keep leaking my documents, SHOW IT ALL & COME CORRECT!!! Stop taking bits and pieces and putting 10’s on 2’s!” This kind of coverage, Taylor explained, is why she filed the divorce secretly in the first place using only her initials. Taylor made her red-carpet debut with new boyfriend Aaron Pierre at the Oscars earlier in March. Meanwhile, Shumpert had a beach day with model Amber Rose last September but later insisted to TMZ they were just friends.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/slithery-singing-john-malkovich-is-the-best-thing-in-opus.html'>A Slithery, Singing John Malkovich Is All Opus Has Going for It</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 11:00:00 <p>
This review was originally published on January 28, 2025, out of the Sundance Film Festival. We are recirculating it now timed to Opus’s theatrical release. Wealthy eccentrics and their pseudo-cults appear to have replaced haunted houses in our cultural imagination. Any number of genre films now turn on unsuspecting characters receiving coveted invites from charismatic neo-barons to their remote compounds for luxury, decadence, and ornate slaughter or some variation thereof. Who needs haunted houses when we’re all surrounded by rich, strange predators? In A24’s new bizarro horror, Opus, the moneyed weirdo is a reclusive legendary pop star named Alfred Moretti, who’s about to release a new album after 27 years. This is reason enough to see this film, which just premiered at Sundance and will release theatrically on March 14, or at least to be intrigued by it. Malkovich never really left his theatricality behind when he broke through into movies in the 1980s; instead, he used it to give many of his characters flamboyance and a slightly insolent, above-it-all quality. It’s frankly shocking that nobody has asked him to play a pop star until now. The man’s gatherings are famous, and for some reason, Ariel scores an invite alongside a few high-profile figures, most of whom do have a past with Moretti, including a TV journalist (Juliette Lewis), an influencer (Stephanie Suganami), and Ariel’s own editor (Murray Bartlett). When they arrive at the estate, they discover a host of strange rituals as well as acres of smiley happy people making sculptures, painting, crafting, and doing Tai Chi and archery. One even awkwardly jogs behind Ariel when she goes out for a morning run. Obviously, things aren’t going to end well, but they sure do take their time getting there. Maybe that’s not such a bad thing: The film is at its best when it lets Malkovich be a supreme oddball enacting little charades for his followers and performing his songs for the journalists he’s gathered. And it helps too that the songs are quite catchy old-school techno tunes with shouted, one-word lyrics that are mainly there to provide a background for beats and dreamy melodies. They’re pitched at the same level as Malkovich’s performance: self-aware, silly, but involving. Aside from the ingenious creation of Moretti and his occasionally unpredictable behavior, the film fails at creating interesting characters, deploying suspense, and even delivering some cheap thrills. Edebiri’s Ariel is a standard and familiar genre part — she’s the one person here who acts like a normal human being — and the young actress, with her down-to-earth persona, is well suited to it. Director Mark Anthony Green occasionally delivers some impressive imagery, and he can certainly put together a montage. I could have watched hours more of the actor’s antics.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

She’s (going to be) ba-ack! Nikki Glaser is returning as host of the Golden Globes in 2026. Glaser hosted the 2025 ceremony, and killed with both her monologue and her “Pope-ular” bit. “Hosting the Golden Globes this year was without a doubt the most fun I have ever had in my career,” Glaser said. “I can’t wait to do it again, and this time in front of the team from The White Lotus who will finally recognize my talent and cast me in season four as a Scandinavian Pilates instructor with a shadowy past.” Glaser pulling double duty is a rare moment of consistency for the troubled awards show. Since the Globes’ brief expulsion from prime time, the show was purchased by Dick Clark Productions and is now for-profit. Since then, hosts have included Jo Koy, who bombed, and Jerrod Carmichael, who gave an esoteric monologue pondering the value of his presence there. Glaser, meanwhile, came to kill. The inimitable preparer has a whole year to get ready.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Peacock, you better watch out, Gaggy isn’t playing around. The Traitors season-three winner Gabby Windey is calling out the streamer and reminding them that she’s still waiting for a check.

Xavier Worthy's fiancée made some shocking claims in her application for a protective order against the NFL star this week ... including allegations he choked and beat her on several different occasions. TMZ Sports just obtained the court filing ... and in it, Tia Jones -- who got engaged to Worthy in July 2024 -- says the Kansas City Chiefs wideout violently put his hands on her at least five different times in the last year. Several weeks later, around Christmas time, Jones claims in the protective order application that Worthy picked her up, slammed her on a bed and began choking her after they "were arguing over him cheating." "He knew about my history of abuse in past relationships," she said, "so I was horrified that he would do that. I told him to never do that again." She, though, states that only angered Worthy further ... alleging he then charged at her and threw her on the ground. She stated the two were in a dispute in a closet of one his Kansas City residence's rooms -- when he "got tired of what I had to say, grabbed my throat with his left hand and squeezed it, shook me, and threw my head back." She wrote in the docs the next incident took place around Valentine's Day ... after the two had gotten into another dispute over his alleged infidelity and his subsequent asking of her to leave their house. He then walked away, and I just cried." Jones wrote the last -- and most recent -- physical altercation took place on March 7 ... which ultimately led to his arrest later that day. "This was the absolute most violent he has ever been," she said. Jones -- a track and field athlete -- stated the issues began in the morning, when Xavier got "upset with me because I did not give him and his new dog enough attention the night before after my long day of practice." Jones says Worthy picked her up and slammed her body against their home's walls -- all while yelling "get out, get the f*** out." She alleged Worthy eventually calmed down -- but she had to cancel her practice because her leg "hurt so bad that I was limping on it." She says Worthy was adamant about her moving out in the hours that ensued ... yet when she thought they were going to discuss future living arrangements, he allegedly snapped again. She wrote in the documents, Worthy threw his keys at her but missed. He lets one of his hands go to open the garage, and then he puts both of his hands around my neck from behind and he chokes my neck so tight I was making choking sounds." Seconds later, she said Worthy "grabbed the part of my throat that I swallow with, like he was trying to rip it out." He then allegedly threw her to the ground and put his "right knee on my throat."

Something seems off between Sydney Sweeney and Jonathan Davino ... her fiancé was just spotted in Los Angeles, after she'd been hanging with her girlfriends in town for weeks, then left the country without him -- fueling speculation the couple is on the outs.

Jonathan was spotted Wednesday talking to construction contractors at Sydney's $6 million Los Angeles mansion and taking a phone call.

Sydney went to France this week for Paris Fashion Week without Jonathan ... and when she was in L.A. before her trip, she spent several weeks staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel without him too.

TMZ broke the story ... Sydney stayed with some of her friends at the hotel and they gallivanted around the property for almost a month without him ever being spotted, sparking speculation about a potential breakup.

Keep in mind, Sydney and Jonathan were supposed to get married in May but, as we first told you last month, the wedding is postponed.

Sydney's home being a construction zone is a pretty good reason for her to go stay at a hotel ... but Jonathan not staying with her despite them being in the same city raises some red flags.

Plus, property records show the mansion was purchased by a trust Sydney has used in the past for her other estates ... so this isn't a house she bought with Jonathan.

It's been a while since we've seen Sydney and Jonathan together at all ... the last time was in January, so it's been nearly two months at this point.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A police officer in Florida added "deliver" to the whole "serve and protect" motto ... 'cause he took a pizza the last few hundred feet to a house after an alligator in the driveway terrified the delivery driver.

The incident went down in Bradenton -- a suburb of Sarasota -- earlier this week ... when someone called the cops about a huge 8-foot-long alligator hanging out under a parked car in a residential neighborhood.

The responding officer -- identified by the department as Officer Tolson -- calls the Florida Fish and Wildlife department to remove the gator ... but, before they arrive, a pizza deliverywoman comes up -- with an order for the house with the gator in the driveway.

The deliverywoman is stopped on the street ... and, the officer tells her she can probably go around back to deliver the food -- but, she's terrified and asks him to do it ... and he agrees to take the pizza for her.

One of the neighbors calls and tells the woman who ordered the pizza not to come out front ... but, she does anyway -- and, the officer screams at her to get back inside 'cause she's mere feet away from the huge reptile.

Eventually, Tolson meets the woman at the backdoor -- who asks him how much she owes. He says he has no idea ... and, then she realizes he's not your average deliveryman.

Officer Tolson does one more favor for the woman in the house ... taking a pic of the alligator for her. Eventually, the trappers come and haul the beast off -- ending what is almost certainly Tolson's strangest day in uniform ... though it is Florida, after all.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

She shared a photo of her mom smiling while holding her as a baby and says her "heart is shattered."

The 34-year-old was anguished, saying she'd do anything to have her mom back ... calling her "my best friend, my whole heart, my everything." Taylor vowed to make her mom proud and celebrate her every day, promising to always tell her 7-month-old daughter, London, how "incredible" her grandmother was. David and Pamela also have a second daughter, Hayley. The tribute was set to "Pure Imagination" from the 2023 'Wonka' remake ... ending with, "I will be strong for you and hold on to your memory until we meet again my beautiful."

Blake Lively is getting the protective order she wants in her war with Justin Baldoni -- but Justin's team is also celebrating the fact that ultimately, there will be very few secrets kept from the public in this case. According to docs, the judge in Justin's lawsuit against Blake and Ryan Reynolds is issuing an order allowing Blake and Justin's legal teams to designate sensitive material as suitable for "attorneys' eyes only" -- meaning they can choose to keep certain details out of the public eye. On the surface, this is a big win for Team Lively. As we reported, she and her attorneys wanted the protective order as a means to block Justin's side from continuing to release a slew of emails, texts, videos and other material related to their war over "It Ends With Us." Justin and his attorney Bryan Freedman have said they want to reveal as much evidence as possible to defend his reputation from the accusations Blake's made against him, which include sexual harassment. The judge's order includes a provision informing both sides ... "the Court is unlikely to seal or otherwise afford confidential treatment" for any documents exchanged between Blake and Justin that end up as evidence in the trial. Translation: All the juicy stuff will come out in the end ... that's assuming this goes to trial and doesn't settle out of court. Bryan Freedman tells TMZ ... "We are fully in agreement with the Court’s decision to provide a narrow scope of protections to categories such as private mental health records and personal security measures that have never been of interest to us as opposed to Ms. Lively's exceedingly over broad demand for documents for a 2.5 year period of time which the court rightly quashed." He adds, "We remain focused on the necessary communications that will directly contradict Ms. Lively's unfounded accusations. We will oppose any efforts by Ms. Lively and her team to hamper our clients’ ability to defend against her attacks by incorrectly categorizing important information as 'trade secrets,' especially considering there were no issues in providing these communications willingly to the New York Times."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Cassie Ventura's lawyer is calling BS on Diddy's claim that the video of him beating her up in a hotel hallway is edited ... and, her attorney says he's sure the footage will be admitted into evidence.

Douglas Wigdor tells TMZ ... it's not surprising Diddy "would make a disingenuous argument to exclude the disturbing video from being shown to the jury in the upcoming trial."

TMZ broke the story ... Diddy's defense claims CNN destroyed the only known copy of the 2016 Cassie beating video and aired altered footage before destroying the original version.

Diddy's camp claims CNN purchased the video, uploaded it into a free editing software, altered the footage and then destroyed the original.

Matt Pinfield says he's recovering after ending up in a coma earlier this year ... and, he's crediting his daughter Jessica for his recovery -- despite his girlfriend and brother's misgivings.

The former MTV host spoke with The Hollywood Reporter ... and, he says he's recovering after his scary hospitalization, which left him unresponsive for two months -- with doctors even fearing he'd never walk or talk again.

As we told you ... Matt's daughter Jessica filed for a temporary conservatorship to take guardianship of his financial and medical decisions -- and, Matt says Jessica is "the one who saved my life. She protected me.”

This is a strong statement of support for his daughter ... 'cause Pinfield's girlfriend, Kara Brown, and his brother, Glenn, claimed Jessica was icing them out -- and, they said Matt was far more responsive than Jessica had them believe when they went to visit him in the hospital.

Kara and Glenn went as far as filing legal documents to fight Jessica's appointment as temporary conservator after Jessica claimed she was worried Kara planned to empty Matt's bank accounts.

However, it sounds like Matt's saying he was in serious trouble for many months ... battling pneumonia and ending up on a ventilator -- but, the support from family, fans and friends helped him get through.

Pinfield told THR he's looking to be released from the hospital later this month if all goes according to plan.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bombshell in the Diddy prosecution ... CNN destroyed the only known copy of the 2016 video in which Diddy is seen beating Cassie in the hallway of an L.A. hotel ... this according to new court documents. Diddy's defense team and prosecutors filed a joint letter about evidence in the case. The letter claims "CNN purchased the only known copy of the Hotel's surveillance footage, uploaded that footage into a free editing software, altered the video and then destroyed the original footage, even though it knew about and repeatedly reported about the federal investigation." A 2016 surveillance video obtained by CNN shows Sean "Diddy" Combs violently grab, shove, drag and kick his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura during an altercation in a hotel in California. It also includes speeding up the video to make it falsely appear that the actions in the video are taking place faster than they are. As a result, the CNN videos do not fairly and accurately depict the events in question." The InterContinental Hotel has closed down in that location and we're told no other video of the incident exists. The defense makes it clear ... they will be filing a motion to exclude the video from Diddy's upcoming trial. Diddy is not being prosecuted for the beating -- that's a state matter and the statute of limitations has run -- but prosecutors want to use it to show Diddy's alleged violent propensities. The reality is this ... courts almost never admit video evidence where the video is edited -- judges insist on the raw footage, so there's an extremely good chance this video will never be played to a jury.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Kim Kardashian says her ex-husband Kris Humphries only partially paid for her lavish engagement ring, then took it back in the divorce.

On the latest episode of "The Kardashians," Kim reminisces with Khloe about her engagement rings from ex-husbands.

Kim reveals Humphries proposed with an 18-carat emerald cut from Lorraine Schwartz ... a step up from the 14-carat cushion cut engagement ring she got from her first husband, Damon Thomas.

However, Kim says she no longer has Humphries' proposal ring ... claiming that while she was pregnant with her daughter North during their divorce, Kris apparently insisted she give it back in order to cut ties.
