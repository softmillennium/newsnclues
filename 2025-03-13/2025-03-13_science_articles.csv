https://sciencenews.org,These ancient Maya puppets may have been used in rituals,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-maya-puppets-rituals,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT","Five oddly expressive clay figurines, made on the edge of the Maya world about 2,400 years ago, were probably used as puppets in public rituals to commemorate mythical or real events.

“They would have either represented actual personages, or they were generic ‘media’ for rituals connected to rulers,” says archaeologist Jan Szymański of the University of Warsaw.

Szymański and his colleague Gabriela Prejs unearthed the puppets near the top of a ruined pyramid at the San Isidro archaeological site, a little under 50 kilometers west of San Salvador. The soil layer containing the puppets dates to about 400 B.C. But such figurines may have been used throughout the Maya Preclassic and Classic periods, from about 2000 B.C. to A.D. 900, Szymański and Prejs report March 5 in Antiquity.

One of the largest puppets is about 30 centimeters tall and depicts a man, while two others of similar size depict women. The three large figurines lack hair, but two smaller ones — one almost 18 centimeters tall and the other about 10 centimeters — depict women with locks of hair on their foreheads.

The puppets had no clothes when they were found, but Szymański thinks they were decorated for their ritual roles. “I’m pretty sure that they were given clothes and wigs in order to look more lifelike,” he says.

The most striking features of the large puppets are their movable heads and strange facial expressions. From eye level, the puppets look angry, but from above they seem to be grinning, and from below they look scared, Szymański says.

What messages or stories they would have been posed to convey, however, are not known.

University of Michigan archaeologist Joyce Marcus, an expert on Mesoamerican figurines who was not involved in the study, says the ability to move the puppets’ heads was “probably a sight to behold, a kind of ‘numinous’ [spiritual] experience.”

This suggests that the figurines may have portrayed participants in rituals, witnesses to certain events or deceased individuals who were “brought to life” during the public rituals, she says.

Similar figurines have been found elsewhere in Central America, hinting at unexpected cultural connections between the San Isidro site and these other areas. The region was once thought to be a southern frontier of Maya culture, centered in the lowlands of Chiapas and Yucatán in Mexico, as well as Belize and eastern parts of Guatemala. But Szymański says that the discoveries indicate the region was instead a cultural crossroads linking the Maya world with other societies.",sciencenews
https://sciencenews.org,Dark coats may have helped the earliest mammals hide from hungry dinosaurs,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-coats-earliest-mammals-dinosaurs,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","Zebra stripes? Leopard print? Neither were in vogue among the earliest mammals during the Age of Dinosaurs.

Early mammals and their close relatives probably sported dark, drab coats from snout to tail, researchers report in the March 14 Science. The monochrome ensembles may have helped ancient mammals blend into their nighttime surroundings and evade predators.

Many dinosaurs — especially birds — showcase a vibrant array of colorful feathers. But the diversity of fur color among modern mammals is underappreciated, says Matthew Shawkey, an evolutionary biologist at Ghent University in Belgium. “There’s obviously lots of patterns, stripes, spots, blotches, all those types of things,” he says. “But also fairly diverse colors: grays, yellows, oranges.”

Yet very little is known about the evolution of mammals’ colors or their presence in the fossil record, Shawkey says. Though pigment-containing structures called melanosomes have yielded details about the bright feathers of extinct birds, details about fossilized mammals’ coat colors remain scarce, save for recent evidence of reddish fur in a 3-million-year-old mouse fossil.

Shawkey and his colleagues used a scanning electron microscope to analyze melanosomes in the hairs of 116 modern mammals, linking their shapes and sizes to the colors they produce. After organizing the known melanosomes by various physical features, the team used statistics to test their ability to predict which colors others would produce. Melanosomes responsible for brighter colors, such as reds and oranges, are rounder, the researchers found, while blacks and browns generally come from elongated melanosomes.

Working with colleagues in China, the team applied this predictive power to melanosomes in preserved hairs from six early mammals and close relatives that lived in China 120 million to 167 million years ago, mostly during the Jurassic Period — the middle phase of the Mesozoic Era. While modern mammals exhibit an extensive range of these pigment-bearing structures, those from the six protomammals fell within a narrow range associated with dark grays and browns across their bodies, suggesting the ancient beasts had the same dark shade throughout.

The early mammals in this study — like many during the Mesozoic Era — were small creatures much like rodents, shrews or moles. They also appear to have had similarly gray and brown coats. It’s not unexpected given the world they evolved in, Shawkey says.

“They were basically dinosaur food,” he says. “They’re going to be hiding in the shadows. So it makes sense that they were dark.”

Despite being a mix of gliders, burrowers and scamperers, all the mammals in the study had dull, dark fur. This suggests a nocturnal existence was ubiquitous for Mesozoic mammals and their relatives, regardless of their ecological role.

“I think this is the first good evidence that we have of an antipredation strategy among early mammals,” says Luke Weaver, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who was not involved with the research.

Dark, melanin-rich fur may have been useful in other ways. It heats up easily, and potentially helped early mammals stay warm. The dark hairs may have also been particularly tough and wear-resistant, protecting the mammals’ skin.

Shawkey notes that the study was limited to six extinct species, leaving the possibility that some early mammals exhibited patterns or bright colors. The team’s monochrome hypothesis could be upended, he says, if paleontologists “find a [fossil] rat with a giant orange mohawk.”

Determining when those kinds of fashion statements first arose is a natural next step, Shawkey says. “When do we start seeing spots and these patterns? When do we start seeing light browns and oranges and things like that?”

It’s possible the extinction of nonavian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago played a key role. Mammalian diversity exploded in response, and the movement to a wide range of finally-safe daytime habitats may have triggered a broader spectrum of colors, too.

However, Weaver notes, some studies suggest that this diversification might have begun earlier. “There’s emerging evidence to suggest that [mammals] might have been diversifying ecologically — and potentially inhabiting more daylight habitats — prior to the extinction of dinosaurs,” he says. Sampling melanosomes from mammals that lived during the late Cretaceous Period, at the twilight of the Age of the Dinosaurs, would be particularly informative.

Maria McNamara, a paleontologist at University College Cork in Ireland, would like to know if mammals that lived in different biomes or latitudes during the Jurassic Period were similarly dark.

“We need more papers like this to be published,” McNamara says. “It’s really important to demonstrate that modern paleontology is much more than describing dusty old bones. It’s a thriving analytical science.”",sciencenews
https://sciencenews.org,A new iron compound hints ‘primordial’ helium hides in Earth’s core,https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iron-helium-compound-earth-core,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT","Scientists have coaxed one of the universe’s most stubborn elements into a new compound.

Formed under intense pressures, the newly discovered compound packs helium atoms into crystalline iron, researchers report February 25 in Physical Review Letters. The compound joins a short list of materials that incorporate the normally unreactive element and suggests that helium from the early solar system could be stored in the iron that makes up Earth’s core.

Helium is one of the least reactive elements on the periodic table. Like the other noble gases, helium doesn’t gain or lose electrons easily and so does not normally form chemical compounds. But under extremely high pressures, helium can interact with a few other elements, including nitrogen and sodium — and now iron, research shows.

To make the new iron compound, physicist Kei Hirose of the University of Tokyo and his colleagues squeezed iron and helium together in a diamond anvil cell, a high-pressure device that subjected the elements to pressures greater than 50,000 Earth atmospheres and temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius. This compression formed crystals containing both iron and helium.

The volume of the crystal formed was larger than that of a crystal of pure iron at the same pressure, the team found. The researchers attributed this increase to helium ions packing into interstitial sites, the tiny spaces between iron atoms in the crystal. But the helium atoms don’t bond directly to iron — they’re too unreactive, even at extreme conditions.

“Helium is very happy as it is. It doesn’t want to share an electron,” says Stefano Racioppi, a chemist at The State University of New York at Buffalo. But it can still participate in “chemistry without chemical bonds” to form these ordered, crystalline compounds.

The new compound could help explain observations of helium in Earth’s interior, Hirose says. Most of Earth’s helium atoms have two neutrons and form from the radioactive decay of elements like uranium. But some ocean volcanic eruptions release helium atoms with just one neutron. These atoms first formed shortly after the Big Bang. Earth picked up this “primordial” helium as the planet formed.

Its loss from magma suggests that the planet has a deep reservoir of primordial helium, and the new compounds suggest that Earth’s iron-rich core could hold some of that helium. But the team will need additional experiments to determine whether helium is more likely to reside in Earth’s core or higher in its mantle.

“The partitioning of helium between magma, silicate melt and metallic iron is really the key,” Hirose says. If helium is more stable in iron than in the silicates found in the mantle, that would suggest that the helium is more likely to reside in the core — and vice versa.

Computational physicist Ronald Cohen agrees. “I wouldn’t say that it’s a proof that there’s helium in Earth’s core, but it suggests that it’s possible,” says Cohen, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C.

Aside from the geophysical implications, the findings could further expand noble gas chemistry. “I would like to see whether this is unique for iron or if it could also happen to other transition metals,” says Maosheng Miao, a chemist at California State University, Northridge. Forming other helium metal compounds, he says, could lead to “chemistry that we never thought of.”",sciencenews

The findings have further bolstered Saturn's status as our solar system's ""moon king."" With an updated total of 274 known natural satellites orbiting the gas giant, it is leagues ahead of its main competitor Jupiter, which has just 95 confirmed moons .

This week, the International Astronomical Union officially recognized the team's discovery. The researchers published their findings March 10 in the journal arXiv , so they have not yet been peer-reviewed.

""Our carefully planned multi-year campaign has yielded a bonanza of new moons that tell us about the evolution of Saturn's irregular natural satellite population,"" study lead author Edward Ashton , an astronomer at Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academia Sinica, Taiwan, said in a statement .

The newfound moons are situated within the Norse group of Saturn's moons — a group of moons that orbit in retrograde (travelling in the opposite direction to the planet’s rotation) along elliptical paths outside Saturn's rings. The 128 newly discovered objects are considered ""irregular"" moons, meaning they're only a mile or two in size and far from spherical.

Their diminutive sizes and location means these moons are likely fragments of larger moons that were smashed apart by a cataclysmic collision — probably with Saturn's other moons or a passing comet. This collision could have occurred as recently as 100 million years ago, the astronomers said in the study.

The discovery was made using the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which combed the sky around Saturn between 2019 to 2021 and discovered an initial 62 additional moons in its orbit. The team also found faint signals of an even larger number of orbiting bodies but were unable to confirm them at the time.

""With the knowledge that these were probably moons, and that there were likely even more waiting to be discovered, we revisited the same sky fields for three consecutive months in 2023,"" Ashton said. ""Sure enough, we found 128 new moons. Based on our projections, I don't think Jupiter will ever catch up.""

The researchers say they are now finished moon-spotting for the foreseeable future, at least until telescopes capable of spotting even fainter signatures are developed.

""With current technology I don't think we can do much better than what has already been done for moons around Saturn, Uranus and Neptune,"" Ashton said.",livescience
https://livescience.com,"'Pregnant' ancient Egyptian mummy with 'cancer' actually wasn't pregnant and didn't have cancer, new study finds",https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-egyptians/pregnant-ancient-egyptian-mummy-with-cancer-actually-wasnt-pregnant-and-didnt-have-cancer-new-study-finds,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:03:15 GMT","The ""Mysterious Lady"" mummy viewed in a mixed-reality system reveals different aspects of the inside of her body.

An ancient Egyptian woman thought to have been pregnant and dying of cancer was actually just embalmed with a technique that mimicked these diagnoses, researchers have concluded, settling a four-year scientific debate.

Nicknamed the ""Mysterious Lady,"" the first-century-B.C. mummy was found in the Egyptian city of Luxor (ancient Thebes) but was brought to the University of Warsaw in Poland in 1826. The mummy was not scientifically studied for over a century.

In 2021, experts with the Warsaw Mummy Project concluded that, contrary to their assumption that the mummy was a male priest based on the sarcophagus, it was actually the remains of a woman in her 20s who was 6.5 to 7.5 months pregnant .

In the first published study of the mummy, researchers used X-ray imaging and CT scans to identify several bundles of mummified organs in her abdomen. They also suggested that a poorly preserved fetus, around 28 weeks in gestational age, could be seen on the scans.

In a second study , the research team proposed that the reason no fetal bones could be clearly identified was that the mother's uterus lacked oxygen and had become acidic over time, essentially ""pickling"" the fetus . And finally, the team suggested that they had found evidence of potentially fatal nasopharyngeal cancer in the mummy's skull.

These interpretations were controversial, however. Radiologist and mummy expert Sahar Saleem told Live Science in 2022 that the Warsaw team failed to ""identify any evidence of anatomical structures to justify their claim of a fetus."" Instead, Saleem was convinced the mysterious structures in the mummy's abdomen were embalming packs.

To settle the debate, a team of 14 researchers with varied expertise led by archaeologist Kamila Braulińska of the University of Warsaw studied the Mysterious Lady and published their findings in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences last month.

Members of the research team each examined more than 1,300 raw CT image slices of the mummy produced in 2015 to determine whether there was any radiological evidence of a pregnancy or of cancer.

Every expert who reanalyzed the CT scans concluded that there was no fetus and that the material assumed to be a fetus was actually part of the embalming process. Further, the suggestion that the fetus' skeleton and soft tissue did not show up on the scans because the body was ""pickled"" is impossible, the researchers noted in the study, because acids within the human body are insufficient to dissolve bone, especially after a body is embalmed.

Similarly, none of the experts on the new study could identify clear evidence of cancer in the mummy. Some suggested instead that the damage to the woman's skull most likely occurred when her brain was removed during the embalming process .

Given the diagnostic consensus of the international panel of experts, the researchers concluded in the study that ""this should resolve once and for all the discussion of the first alleged case of pregnancy identified inside an ancient Egyptian mummy, as well as the dispute about the presence of nasopharyngeal cancer.""

But given the public's intense interest in the ""case of the pregnant mummy"" over the past four years, the researchers suggested that, going forward, additional focus should be given to questions of maternal and pediatric health in ancient Egypt .

https://livescience.com,"How does rowing affect your heart, and is it different to running?",https://www.livescience.com/health/exercise/how-does-rowing-affect-your-heart-and-is-it-different-to-running,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","Rowing and running are undoubtedly some of the most popular forms of cardiovascular exercise. Both activities can send your heart rate through the roof and get your blood pumping, and both have been shown to decrease the risk of developing heart disease and high blood pressure . When it comes to cardiovascular benefits, rowing and running seem to be on equal footing, according to a 2023 study published in the European Heart Journal .

However, there is an interesting twist — evidence suggests that elite rowers tend to have notably bigger hearts compared to elite runners.

Take the landmark 1994 study published in the American Journal of Cardiology , for example. One of the biggest of its kind, it investigated structural and functional changes within the heart of 947 elite athletes representing 27 sports disciplines. Scientists used echocardiography — images of the heart obtained with an ultrasound scan — and found that, of all study participants, rowers had the thickest left ventricular wall.

This is the layer of muscle and connecting tissue surrounding the largest chamber of the heart. Rowers also had some of the largest left ventricles during the resting phase between heartbeats, when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. On the other hand, runners did not seem to display such far-reaching changes to their hearts, the study authors noted.

So how does rowing affect your heart, and is it different from running?

While both of these activities challenge your cardiovascular system, they do not do so in the same way, Dr. Bhaskar Semitha , a cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon at Fortis Hospital Vashi in Mumbai, India, told Live Science by email. ""[This is why] elite rowers tend to have bigger, stronger hearts compared to elite runners, even when they have similar levels of cardiovascular fitness,"" Semitha said.

The reason lies in the movement itself. Running predominantly targets your legs . Rowing, on the other hand, is a low-impact exercise that simultaneously engages muscles in your legs, core and upper body.

""Rowing is a full-body workout that demands a high oxygen supply, so the heart has to pump more blood per beat,"" Semitha said. As such, exercising on one of the best rowing machines may force your heart to pump blood more efficiently than if you opted for a jog on a treadmill.

""Over time, this leads to a lower resting heart rate and a higher stroke volume [the volume of blood pumped from the ventricle per beat.] The heart is working less while delivering more oxygen,"" Semitha said.

This also leads to a significant increase in VO2 max , the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during exercise, which is one of the key markers of performance in cardiovascular exercise. ""That's why you will often see rowers with some of the lowest resting heart rates of any athletes,"" Semitha said.

Rowing and running elicit different heart rate responses even if these activities are performed at the same intensity, according to a 2002 study published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology . Scientists measured the blood lactate concentration — a biochemical marker of fatigue within exercising muscle — in 55 young, healthy men rowing on a rowing machine and running on a treadmill, and found that their heart rate was consistently lower during rowing even when both these exercises were performed with maximum effort.

Why? Again, it is all about the movement. The seated position during rowing makes it easier for blood to flow from the body's lower extremities back to the heart, scientists concluded.

There is a slight twist to the tale, though. Running, even at moderate intensity, is still more effective than rowing for increasing VO2 max, Sergii Putsov, PhD , a professional weightlifter, researcher and head of sports science at coaching service Torokhtiy Weightlifting, told Live Science. ""Running forces your body to work against gravity, amplifying oxygen consumption and utilization. Since rowing is less weight-bearing than running, its overall ability to increase VO2 max is slightly lower for people who do not push themselves to high intensity,"" Putsov said.

Running forces your body to work against gravity. (Image credit: Getty Images)

Running also tends to cause more dramatic spikes in heart rate, particularly during high-intensity sprints. ""[This is why] running puts more demand on arterial flexibility than rowing,"" Semitha said. ""The repeated impact and fluctuations in intensity force the blood vessels to expand and contract rapidly, which can make arteries more elastic over time and therefore help prevent high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.""

So in the rowing vs running debate, which activity wins for cardiovascular benefits? Neither. Both rowing and running are good exercises for boosting stamina and strengthening the heart muscle, according to Putsov.

""However, their effectiveness may depend on your fitness level, specific goals and physical condition,"" Putsov said. ""The full-body nature of rowing helps improve oxygen utilization efficiently without the harsh repetitive impact associated with running. Running, on the other hand, generates repetitive pounding on your joints and requires relatively high initial energy which can be overwhelming for beginners and people with poor cardiovascular fitness.""

Researchers in China have developed a quantum processing unit (QPU) that is 1 quadrillion (10¹⁵) times faster than the best supercomputers on the planet .

The new prototype 105-qubit chip, dubbed ""Zuchongzhi 3.0,"" which uses superconducting qubits , represents a significant step forward for quantum computing , scientists at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Hefei said.

It rivals the benchmarking results set by Google's latest Willow QPU in December 2024 that allowed scientists to stake a claim for quantum supremacy — where quantum computers are more capable than the fastest supercomputers — in lab-based benchmarking.

The scientists used the processor to complete a task on the widely used quantum computing random circuit sampling (RSC) benchmark in just a few hundred seconds, they said in a new study published March 3 in the journal Physical Review Letters .

This test, 83-qubit, 32-layer random circuit sampling task, was also completed 1 million times faster than the result set by Google's previous generation Sycamore chip , published in October 2024. Frontier , the second-fastest supercomputer in the world, would only be able to complete the same task in 5.9 billion years, by contrast

Although the results suggest QPUs are capable of achieving quantum supremacy, the specific RCS benchmarking used favors quantum methods.

""Our work not only advances the frontiers of quantum computing, but also lays the groundwork for a new era where quantum processors play an essential role in tackling sophisticated real-world challenges,"" the scientists said in the study.

Rivaling Google's best quantum processor

The latest iteration of Zuchongzhi includes 105 transmon qubits — devices made from metals like tantalum, niobium, and aluminum that have reduced sensitivity to noise — in a 15-by-7 rectangular lattice. This builds on the previous chip, which included 66 qubits.

One of the most important areas critical to the viability of quantum computing in real-world settings is coherence time, a measure of how long a qubit can maintain its superposition and tap into the laws of quantum mechanics to perform calculations in parallel. Longer coherence times mean more complicated operations and calculations are possible.

Another major improvement was in gate fidelity and quantum error correction, which has been an obstacle to building useful quantum computers. Gate fidelity measures how accurately a quantum gate performs its intended operation, where a quantum gate is analogous to a classical logic gate, performing a specific operation on one or more qubits, manipulating their quantum state. Higher fidelity qubits mean fewer errors and more accurate computations.

Zuchongzhi 3.0 performed with an impressive parallel single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.90%, and a parallel two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.62%. Google's Willow QPU edged it slightly, with results of 99.97% and 99.86% respectively.

These improvements were largely possible due to engineering improvements, including enhancements in fabrication methods and better optimized qubits design, the scientists said in the study. For instance, the latest iteration lithographically defines qubit components using tantalum and aluminum, bonded through an indium bump flip-chip process. This improves accuracy and minimizes contamination.",livescience

""Every dollar we spend, every program we fund, and every policy we pursue must be justified with the answer to three simple questions,"" Rubio said in a State Department press release . ""Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?""

One may take issue with such a narrow view of the value of foreign development assistance, which is essential to the survival of millions of people in regions affected by war, poverty and the impacts of human-caused climate change. But even by this narrow standard, the Trump administration's reckless dismantling of U.S. foreign aid programs makes no sense. In fact, it fails all three of Rubio's tests, making America weaker, less safe, and more prone to shocks that could cripple our economy.

Nowhere is the short-sightedness of the administration's strategy clearer than in the havoc it has brought on the U.S. Agency for International Development. USAID provides development assistance in more than 120 countries, funding projects that bring health services, education, food and clean water to vulnerable communities across the globe. From building schools to aiding in recovery from natural disasters, its work contributes in important ways to the health and economic development of regions that are prone to poverty, conflict, displacement and the political extremism that can often accompany social and economic disparity.

In terms of direct and tangible benefits to the U.S., one of USAID's most critical functions is to fight the spread of infectious diseases that have the capacity to spark a global pandemic. In 2014, for example, USAID deployed teams in West Africa to coordinate the response to a fast-growing Ebola outbreak. A significant part of that response was the establishment of screening protocols for people traveling from the affected region, a key measure in preventing an Ebola crisis in the U.S., which recorded only 11 Ebola cases in that year.

Such pandemic threats have not gone away. Ebola cases are rising in Uganda , and Tanzania recently experienced a deadly outbreak of Marburg virus , which causes severe hemorrhagic fever. Last August, an outbreak of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo triggered the World Health Organization to declare an international public health emergency , signaling renewed concern about a virus that spread to 122 countries in a 2022 outbreak.

In other parts of the world, USAID is a critical player in efforts to identify novel forms of avian influenza and other pathogens that have the potential to cause a future pandemic. As part of maintaining this global early warning system, the agency has funded labs and surveillance protocols in more than 30 countries, an investment of more than $900 million in 2023.

The best way to prevent an epidemic in our own country is to control it at its source. Chris Beyrer, Director of the Duke Global Health Institute

While much of this work is carried out far from the U.S., infectious diseases know no borders, and we have seen countless instances of viruses that arise in one part of the world but quickly find their way to other countries. The best way to prevent an epidemic in our own country is to control it at its source.

What is disappearing is our ability to react to such global health threats. USAID had been leading efforts to respond to the mpox crisis in the DRC, committing more than $55 million to orchestrate efforts to screen for the virus and distribute vaccines. However, among the many devastating impacts of President Trump's foreign aid freeze is that this work has stopped. All but six of USAID's 50 staff dedicated to global outbreaks have been fired, and on-the-ground disease response teams have been sent home.

The abrupt withdrawal of staff and financial support has left underresourced health systems such as the DRC's on the brink of collapse , unable to provide even basic health services. These disruptions continue to affect even the programs permitted to continue under the administration's narrow waivers for life-saving interventions.

The administration's announced order to cancel more than 90% of USAID's foreign contracts , effectively cutting nearly $60 billion in assistance, will only deepen these risks. According to USAID documents obtained by Propublica , discontinuation of the agency's services is predicted to lead to surges in cases of malaria and drug-resistant tuberculosis. One million more children will suffer severe malnutrition, and 200,000 more will be paralyzed by polio, according to the report.

In dozens of countries around the world, clinics that provide antiretroviral medications to 20 million people living with HIV — most of which rely on USAID for administrative and logistical support through PEPFAR (U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) — have been shuttered. According to our research , even just a 90-day interruption in these services will lead to an additional 100,000 HIV-related deaths this year, threatening more than two decades of progress toward ending the global epidemic of HIV and AIDS .

For decades, U.S. leaders on both sides of the political spectrum have recognized the strategic value of these efforts. President John F. Kennedy, who launched USAID in 1961, described foreign aid as ""a very powerful source of strength"" for the U.S., allowing the country ""to exert influence in the maintenance of freedom."" Four decades later, President George W. Bush made historic investments in global health a centerpiece of his national security agenda, launching both PEPFAR, the largest commitment to fight a disease in our history, and the President's Malaria Initiative.

These presidents, like countless other leaders over the years, understood that working to secure the health and prosperity of other countries is, in fact, a direct investment in our own national health and prosperity. By contrast, what we see today is a haphazard retreat that will inevitably result in a world that is sicker, less stable and perilously exposed to threats such as climate change or a future infectious disease outbreak. We need only to look at the COVID-19 pandemic to understand how a health crisis that emerges in one part of the world can impact lives and economies across the globe. It is a dangerous strategy, and one for which we all may pay dearly.",livescience

A survivor (left) and her daughter and granddaughter contributed to a study examining whether such trauma can be biologically inherited.

There are markers that sit on top of DNA and change over the course of one's lifetime, and they can even be passed down to future generations. These ""epigenetic"" markers alter how genes are expressed — without changing their codes — and they can change based on a person's experiences and environment.

Research suggests that stressful events can tweak a person's epigenetics — but what happens on a larger scale? How do people's epigenetics change, for example, in a population exposed to upheaval or violence multiple times over generations?

A new study, published Feb. 27 in the journal Scientific Reports , sought to answer that question.

An international collaboration of researchers convened by Rana Dajani , a molecular biologist at Hashemite University in Jordan, published first-of-their-kind results: they found that epigenetic signatures of trauma can be passed down through generations of people. The study was conducted with three generations of Syrian families that experienced the Hama massacre in 1982 and the Syrian uprising that began in 2011.

""This is an interesting and fascinating study that emphasizes the importance of considering how traumatic experience can have an impact across multiple generations,"" Michael Pluess , a developmental psychology researcher at the University of Surrey in the U.K. who was not involved in the work, told Live Science in an email.

A multinational and multigenerational collaboration

Dajani mainly studies the genetics of ethnic populations in Jordan but always had an interest in stress and epigenetic inheritance. There were several studies in lab animals that suggested epigenetic changes can pass from one generation to the next.

However, the question of whether epigenetic signatures of trauma and displacement can pass between generations of people had yet to be answered.

As a daughter of a Syrian refugee, Dajani realized she was in a unique position to probe the question.

""It clicked in my mind, 'Wait a minute; we can actually answer this question because of the unique characteristics and the unique history that the Syrian community has gone through,'"" Dajani told Live Science.

Dajani brought the idea to Catherine Panter-Brick , an anthropologist at Yale University with expertise on stress biomarkers and global health, and Connie Mulligan , an epigeneticist at the University of Florida who focuses on childhood adversity. The three scientists spent the next decade partnering on the study.

Connecting with the community

Dajani and Dima Hamadmad , a co-author of the study and a daughter of Syrian refugees, contacted families all over the world mainly through word of mouth. The researchers sat down with the families and listened to their stories; they also explained the science of epigenetics, what they could expect from the study's results, and how these results could bring awareness to their stories.

""They [the families] felt gratified because, first, they understood the science, and second, they felt agency — that they were doing something in response to what happened to them,"" Dajani said.

""This could have only happened because … I'm a scientist and I'm Syrian. So it's somebody from the community center.""

The Hama massacre was an assault by the government on the west-central city of Hama, during which an estimated 10,000 to 40,000 people were either killed or disappeared. The Syrian uprising that began in 2011 resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians protesting the Assad government regime.

It took seven years to find families with three generations of women willing to participate in the study and gather enough samples to meet its criteria. The researchers collected cheek-swab samples from grandmothers who had been pregnant during the 1982 attack, as well as from their daughters and granddaughters.

They also collected samples from mothers who had been pregnant during the 2011 uprising and from their mothers and daughters.

Additionally, the research team found families with daughters where one was a child during the 2011 uprising, and thus had direct exposure to trauma, while the other daughter was still in the womb at the time.

Finally, they took samples from Syrian families that had left the country before either incident, to use as a point of comparison.

""You cannot find three generations of humans who have been subjected to the brutality of war in such a discrete way with grandmothers versus mothers versus children being exposed or non-exposed to war. So that's a very unique design,"" Panter-Brick said.

Epigenetic marks of trauma

An analysis of the samples revealed 21 distinct epigenetic changes in the genome that were unique to those who had direct exposure to trauma. An additional 14 changes seemed to be unique to the grandchildren of grandmothers who were exposed to trauma while pregnant.

Together, these changes occurred at 35 sites along the genome. And the data hinted that, at the majority of those sites, the same pattern of epigenetic changes unfolded regardless of the type of exposure — direct, prenatal or from a prior generation.

Specifically, one common type of epigenetic change is the addition or subtraction of a compound — called a methyl group — from DNA. So across the different trauma types, most of the sites showed methylation in the ""same direction,"" either adding or subtracting.

However, that finding wasn't statistically significant, likely due to the relatively small sample sizes in each group, the authors noted. So the findings bear confirming in larger samples.

""What it seems to say is that there might be a common epigenetic signature of violence across generations, exposures and developmental stages,"" Mulligan told Live Science.

The analysis also found that children who were exposed to trauma in the womb appeared epigenetically ""older"" than their chronological ages; this was not seen in other modes of exposure. So-called accelerated epigenetic aging has been linked to a number of health issues, but it's unclear whether the epigenetic changes drive the health problems or simply reflect them .

Mulligan suggested that this aging effect could be the result of trauma exposure during a highly active stage of fetal development, which could explain why it was only seen in the context of prenatal exposure.

What does this mean for human health?

The scientists don't yet know what differences these epigenetic signatures might mean for human health.

Mulligan suggested that the marks ""might have allowed humans to adapt to environmental stressors, particularly psychosocial stress and violence."" The theory would need to be confirmed in future research.

Looking ahead, the researchers plan to continue investigating what these epigenetic changes mean biologically, as well as study other groups of people and see if the same sites are changed.

Dajani previously published work about how studies like these can shift our perspective on traumatic events.

""We can use this framing to go from victimhood and vulnerability to agency and adaptability,"" she said. ""We can propose that our discovery is proof that humans inherit this adaptability so that they can cope with future unpredictable environments.”

Dajani also recently became a grandmother and reflected on what she would say to her granddaughter about the discovery.

""Even though your grandparents or great-grandparents went through something, you have the tenacity, the 'sumud' [an Arabic word meaning ""steadfastness""], to go forward and thrive and flourish,"" she said.

For Panter-Brick, ""it's just pure joy to see the actual results come to fruition at this point.

""And it just means a lot for the population themselves, for our team of women scientists, and for the results of science,"" she added. ""But this is [also] an example of how we can work together for the benefit of humanity by understanding more about the challenges that humans repeatedly find themselves in when they face different kinds of violence.""

Disease name: Polymerase gamma-related diseases, called POLG-related diseases for short

Affected populations: POLG-related diseases are a group of rare, incurable conditions caused by inherited gene mutations. These disease-causing mutations are carried by up to 2% of people of Northern European descent. However, not everyone who carries the mutations ultimately develops a POLG-related disorder.

Estimates suggest that these diseases affect approximately 1 in 10,000 people worldwide.

Causes: POLG-related diseases are caused by several hundred different mutations in the POLG gene . This gene encodes a protein in mitochondria, called DNA polymerase gamma (pol γ), which is needed to replicate and repair the unique DNA found only inside mitochondria, rather than in the cell nucleus.

People develop POLG-related diseases by inheriting either one or two copies of the mutated POLG gene from one or both of their parents.

Mitochondria are the cellular powerhouses responsible for breaking down the carbohydrates and fatty acids in food to produce molecules called ATP, which the body then uses as energy.

In people with POLG-related diseases, issues with polymerase gamma can either end up decreasing the amount of DNA in mitochondria or introducing mutations into that DNA. And in some cases, both these events can occur.

Ultimately, cells become energy-depleted , and this can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

POLG mutations are the most common cause of inherited mitochondrial disorders, with around 300 mutations in POLG known to cause disease. Examples of POLG-related diseases include Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, ataxia neuropathy spectrum and childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum.

Patients with POLG-related diseases often experience epileptic seizures caused by electrical instability in the brain. (Image credit: koto_feja via Getty Images)

Symptoms: POLG-related diseases can be tricky to diagnose, in part, because they can cause an array of symptoms that vary in severity. These symptoms can also emerge at different times in a person's life, from early childhood to adulthood , depending on which disease they have.

The timing of symptoms partly varies depending on the specific POLG mutation a person carries and the number of copies, as well as the underlying driver of their condition — whether it's mostly related to the loss of DNA or accumulation of mutations.

Once they manifest, the symptoms mostly affect parts of the body that require a lot of energy , such as the central nervous system , muscles and liver .

Common symptoms of POLG-related diseases include progressive weakness of the eye muscles and the muscles that are closest to the center of the body , such as those located in the shoulders or upper arms. People with these diseases may also have droopy eyelids and develop epilepsy and liver failure .

Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is one of the most severe forms of POLG-related disease . In addition to the previously listed symptoms, people with this condition also usually experience seizures, a reduced ability to move and liver disease.

People with ataxia neuropathy spectrum, meanwhile experience issues with coordination and balance, as well as reduced nerve function.

Treatments: There is no cure for POLG-related diseases; current treatments instead focus on reducing a patient's symptoms . For instance, doctors can prescribe drugs to help manage seizures or movement difficulties. Transplantation is also an option for patients who experience liver failure.

People with a POLG-related disease typically live for between three months and 12 years after symptoms first begin.

Recent cases: In March 2025, Prince Frederik of Luxembourg, who was second cousin of the heir to the throne, reportedly died of a POLG-related disease at the age of 22 . Frederik was the founder and creative director of The POLG Foundation, an organization that supports research into treatments for POLG-related diseases.",livescience

https://theconversation.com,Are Ukrainians ready for ceasefire and concessions? Here’s what the polls say,https://theconversation.com/are-ukrainians-ready-for-ceasefire-and-concessions-heres-what-the-polls-say-252025,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:54:05 GMT","A U.S.-Ukraine accord on a ceasefire proposal has put the notion of a negotiated end to the three-year war on the agenda, and in the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

But even before Moscow responds, it’s pretty clear where the parties stand. Breaking a prior taboo against negotiations involving territorial concessions, the U.S. has suggested Ukraine must cede land in any permanent deal, whereas President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated repeatedly that he will never yield sovereignty over Ukraine’s territory.

Meanwhile, Russia has demanded that Ukraine renounce its aspiration to join NATO and accept restrictions on its military. But at present, Kyiv looks unlikely to gain the security guarantees it seeks from the U.S. before contemplating such terms.

What is talked about less is what the Ukrainian people are willing to accept for peace. And while any armistice will likely be dictated by guns, territorial gains and great power geopolitics, it will be in large part down to ordinary Ukrainians to shape what happens afterward. An ugly peace may be accepted by a war-weary population. But if it has little local legitimacy and acceptance, peace is likely to be unsustainable in the long run.

We have tracked public opinion in Ukraine from before the war and during the course of the conflict.

It is an imperfect exercise; most polling in wartime Ukraine is by mobile phone and depends upon those with service who are willing to participate. Many people, especially in the country’s south and east, do not want to answer sensitive questions out of concern for themselves and relatives, some in occupied territories and Russia.

Those who do respond may give guarded responses. Some are mindful of wartime censorship, while others are patriotic or wish to present themselves as such to the stranger calling them. Meanwhile, many other Ukrainians are overseas and excluded. Similarly, those in Russian-occupied territories are left out of surveys.

Nonetheless, the responses still give insights into how opinions in Ukraine have evolved since the Russian invasion of February 2022. Here are five important findings from relatively recent public opinion polls that are relevant to any forthcoming peace negotiations.

1. Nearly all Ukrainians are stressed and tired of war

Unsurprisingly, three years of a brutal war of aggression has created tremendous stress among a population increasingly weary of war.

A December 2024 poll from the respected Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, or KIIS found that nearly 9 in 10 Ukrainians experienced at least one stressful situation in the previous year. Large shares reported stressful experiences related to bombing and shelling (39%), separation from family members (30%), surviving the death of loves ones (26%) and the illness of loved ones (23%). Only 10% said they’d experienced no stressful situations.

In a related vein, surveys we have conducted showed that by summer 2024, 84% of the population had experienced violence in some form – be that physical injury at the hands of Russian forces, displacement, loss of family member and friends, or witnessing attacks.

And consistent with a growing number of news reports, we found that Ukrainians were deeply worried about war weariness among their fellow Ukrainians – just 10% reported that they did not worry about war fatigue at all.

2. More Ukrainians want negotiations, but there are red lines

As the war has gone on, several polls show that Ukrainians increasingly support negotiations. The share of the population in favor of negotiations varies depending on how the question is posed.

When given the choice between two options, a Gallup Poll from late 2024 showed that 52% preferred that “Ukraine should seek to negotiate an ending to the war as soon as possible,” whereas 38% preferred that “Ukraine should continue fighting until it wins the war.”

Our earlier surveys from 2022 and 2024 similarly show a growing preference for negotiations, though at a lower level – from 11% in 2022 to 31% in 2024. In contrast to the binary Gallup question, our surveys presented respondents with different territorial compromises for a ceasefire. While about one-third wanted an immediate ceasefire, half wanted to continue fighting until all territories, including the predominately Russian-speaking Donbas region and Crimea, are brought back under Kyiv’s control.

But survey responses make clear that the country’s political independence is a red line for the public – even if defending it comes at a very high cost.

3. Ukrainians are more open to territorial concessions

In tandem with growing support for negotiations, our surveys – in line with KIIS’s own polls – show growing willingness to cede territory. And among those most worried about war fatigue and more pessimistic about continued Western support, the willingness to cede territory is higher.

That said, most Ukrainians still want Ukraine to continue fighting until the country’s territorial integrity is restored and under Kyiv’s control, including Crimea. But that majority has diminished since the beginning of the war – from 71% in 2022 to 51% in 2024.

When we asked in July 2024 whether people agreed with the statement: “Russia should be allowed to control the territory it has occupied since 2022,” 90% disagreed. As such, there is very little evidence that Russia’s territorial annexations – or an agreement recognizing these, which is what Russia wants – will have any legitimacy among Ukraine’s population.

4. Ukrainians see Russia’s war goals in existential terms

Neither Zelenskyy nor most Ukrainians trust Putin – hence there’s a strong preference for any agreement being accompanied by security guarantees from NATO states.

Poll findings in the past month from KIIS reveal that 66% of Ukrainians interpret Russia’s war aims as an existential threat, comprising genocide against Ukrainians and destruction of its independent statehood. And 87% believe Russia will not stop at the territories it already occupies. Negotiating with an enemy bent on Ukraine’s destruction appears delusional to many Ukrainians.

5. Zelenskyy remains popular; his endorsement matters

As a defiant wartime leader, President Zelenskyy’s popularity was very high in the immediate months after the invasion. Indeed, KIIS polls from May 2022 show that 90% of the population expressed trust in him.

This has declined as the war has endured, but it has always remained above 50%. Recent polling measuring his approval puts it at 63%, an increase from 2024. Indeed, the very latest KIIS polls, from February through March of this year, show a 10-point jump in his trust rating to 67%, a finding widely viewed as rallying in the face of U.S. criticism.

Thus Zelenskyy’s endorsement of any ceasefire and settlement will matter, though ceding territory is likely to be hazardous for him politically.

Conditions for a lasting peace

While the U.S.-Ukraine accord on a ceasefire has “put the ball” in Russia’s court, it is unclear whether it will be enough to bring Putin to the table. And even if it does, given past precedent it is difficult to see him arriving as a compromiser rather than a conqueror.

What does appear clear is that whatever “peace” emerges looks set to hang more on Ukraine making concessions and accepting losses.

Such a peace can be negotiated behind closed doors. But without public support in Ukraine, whether it endures on the ground is another matter.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Environmental protection laws still apply even under Trump’s national energy emergency − here’s why,https://theconversation.com/environmental-protection-laws-still-apply-even-under-trumps-national-energy-emergency-heres-why-251558,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:22:29 GMT","In response to President Donald Trump’s declaration of a “national energy emergency,” the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recently listed hundreds of energy and infrastructure projects that would be eligible for fast-track permitting.

The projects, which include oil pipelines, natural gas power plants and mining projects, were already under review. But the possibility of accelerated permitting raised concerns that without effective oversight, the projects might be allowed to alter or destroy hundreds of acres of wetlands or risk contamination of drinking water sources.

Facing a backlash from environmental groups, the Corps removed the list and said it would follow up with a refined version.

But based on my experience as an environmental law professor and former government lawyer, it’s not clear that the claimed emergency conditions warrant fast-tracking major projects with minimal environmental review or public scrutiny.

Dealing with emergencies under the law

To be sure, swift action is often necessary in an actual emergency to prevent loss of life or property damage. A levee breach during a storm may require emergency repairs, including placing rocks, dirt or sand to contain flooding. An advancing inferno may call for hasty felling of trees to create firebreaks. Or a bridge collapse may necessitate prompt debris removal and reconstruction.

Existing environmental laws and regulations largely account for such circumstances. For instance, the National Environmental Policy Act generally requires federal agencies to analyze and publicly disclose the environmental impacts of their actions. In emergencies, however, agencies may comply with this requirement through “alternative arrangements” such as a shortened public comment period or a report on environmental impacts after the fact.

Similarly, the Endangered Species Act bars federal actions that jeopardize protected species. But there are limited exceptions for emergency circumstances. When there is a federally declared disaster, for example, the Endangered Species Act allows the president to exempt projects to repair or replace public facilities when necessary to prevent the disaster from recurring. Examples of such projects include rebuilding a highway, bridge or railway.

President Trump’s declaration

President Trump’s declaration of a national energy emergency invokes the National Emergencies Act, which allows the president to follow emergency procedures that have been spelled out in other federal laws. For instance, the Stafford Act enables federal support in an emergency for services to protect lives, property, public health and safety, or to lessen the threat of a catastrophe.

But a declaration of an emergency does not allow a president to waive or ignore all other legal requirements. The declaration must specify the law or laws whose emergency provisions are being activated.

In this situation, the declaration calls on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers “to identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the (n)ation’s energy supply that may be subject to emergency treatment” under the Corps’ permitting process. That process is governed by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and related statutes.

How the Corps’ regulations handle emergencies

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires project developers to apply to the Corps for a permit to discharge dredged material or other dirt or soil into “waters of the United States.” This term encompasses relatively permanent bodies of water as well as wetlands connected at the surface to those permanent waters. Many construction projects, such as pipelines or housing developments, require a Section 404 permit because they cross water bodies or involve the fill of adjoining wetlands. The standard procedure for processing a permit application includes public notice, a public comment period and preparation of environmental documentation, followed by the agency’s decision.

In emergency situations, the Corps’ regulations allow the use of “special procedures” for processing applications – which the regulations do not specifically spell out. Instead, agency officials must tailor the process to the circumstances of each case. According to the Corps, in some situations an appropriate response to the emergency might include “a public notice to clarify permitting procedures for dealing with the clean up and repair caused by these events.” Immediate approvals may be appropriate for work to prevent flood damage from an approaching storm, but inappropriate for reconstruction after that storm.

The “national energy emergency” declared by the president does not qualify as an emergency under the Corps’ regulations. Those regulations define an emergency as “a situation which would result in an unacceptable hazard to life, a significant loss of property, or an immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship” if the standard permitting procedures were followed.

Guidance from the Corps suggests flooding and hurricanes as “example(s) of emergency situations caused by a natural disaster.” A further example includes “a catastrophic … failure … due to an external cause,” such as “a bridge collapse after being struck by a barge.”

Even if a situation qualifies as an emergency under the Corps’ regulations, the agency must make reasonable efforts to take comments from other agencies and the public.

Furthermore, neither these regulations nor the emergency declaration excuses the Corps from its duty to comply with other laws. Under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Corps would still have to analyze and publicly disclose the environmental impacts of federal actions, though it perhaps could use those “alternative arrangements” like a shortened comment period. And under the Endangered Species Act, the Corps still can’t harm endangered species unless a permitted project would repair or replace public facilities in a declared disaster area.

If the Corps’ promised revisions to the list of emergency projects look anything like the original version, expect a flood of lawsuits – which will seek to challenge any permits granted under emergency procedures.",theconversation

The leafy vegetable is a quintessential part of African American, Southern and “soul” foods in the United States. Collards are also important in some regions of Africa: In Kenya, where they are called sukuma wiki, they are one of the most commonly consumed vegetables.

Until now, the consensus scholarly view has held that collards came to the Americas early in the 16th century with Spanish, Portuguese or English Europeans, who introduced collards as a garden plant that was then taken up by enslaved Africans.

But our discovery of collards growing in southern Moroccan oases gardens put us on a quest to better understand the path collards took to arrive in the American South. Our new research suggests that they arrived in Morocco with early Muslim traders, adding the potential of a stop in North Africa hundreds of years before they journeyed to North America.

Moreover, the similarity in recipes from Morocco and the American South supports the idea that Moroccan oases may have been a stop in the journey collards took to America.

A green path

Collard greens belong to the species Brassica oleracea, which also includes broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kohlrabi and Brussels sprouts. The huge genetic diversity within the species has complicated research into where collards were first domesticated and how they moved around the world.

Evidence suggests collards were likely domesticated in the Mediterranean, from wild relatives also found on coastlines around the Mediterranean. Their path from the Mediterranean to the American South remains unclear.

A new theory sprouts

As ethnobiologists and researchers interested in traditional foodways, we have been studying leafy vegetables across Morocco for 20-plus years. Yet we had never seen collards growing in any of the other areas across north and central Morocco we had worked in.

While working in date palm oases in southern Morocco, we were, therefore, surprised to find collard greens in the gardens of African diaspora communities that are descended from enslaved people brought across the Sahara.

Suspecting that the presence of collards in an important ancient trade hub might shed new light on the history of the plant and its journey to the Americas, we began collecting stories, proverbs and recipes from the African diaspora communities and searching for potential links to other places where collards are culturally important.

Tracking down information was complicated: Leafy vegetables rarely show up in the archaeological record, and historical texts use the same words to refer to heading cabbage – what most people call “cabbage” today – and nonheading cabbages such as collards and kale, which were more common than heading varieties until fairly recently.

Historical texts in English refer to both as “cabbage” or “cole.” In Spanish, both are called “cole”; and “couve” is used similarly in Portuguese. Arabic texts use “kornub” to refer to both. However, this was one important clue to the ancient Arabic origins of collards in Morocco. In Moroccan Arabic, cabbage is called “mkouwer” or “melfouf,” and cauliflower is usually called “chou-fleur” – a word derived from the French. Moroccans only rarely use “kurunb,” from classical Arabic, to refer to cauliflower.

The communities that grow collards in Morocco call it by the ancient Arabic name “kornub.”

As we searched, we were astonished to find a recipe in a 10th-century cookbook from Baghdad that was almost identical to how people in Morocco cook collards. Moreover, the cookbook describes in detail a variety of cabbage with smooth leaves called “kurunb Nabati,” or “Nabatean cabbage,” where only the leaves are eaten. That, and the fact that the preparation description refers clearly to leaves rather than heads, offered further evidence that this was referencing collard greens.

We pieced together a possible historical route from Baghdad to Morocco from the rare cases when historical documents included specific descriptions of the plant.

One report from a British explorer who traveled through Algeria in 1860 included notes about finding various types of “cabbage” and about a man who had stolen cabbage and had it concealed under his shirt – suggesting flat leaves rather than heads.

Moreover, a colleague at the Oman Botanic Garden told us that collards are grown in oases gardens in the Hajar mountains of Oman.

Middle East to American South

After piecing it all together, our research suggests that collards arrived in Morocco from Iraq and Oman with early Kharijite Muslim traders in the eighth century. These are the same people who founded the great city of Sijilmasa and ran the early trade routes that carried gold and enslaved humans across the Sahara.

The presence of collards in Moroccan oases also necessitates a reconsideration of the currently held assumption of how the vegetable arrived in the Americas.

We couldn’t find concrete evidence of connections between Morocco and the arrival of collards in the Americas, so it’s impossible to say that the consensus scholarly view on collards’ journey is wrong. Still, the currently held assumption that collards arrived in the Americas with settlers and were adopted by Africans who used them as a substitute in leafy green recipes from Africa needs revisiting.

Indeed, unlike common collards recipes, most leafy vegetable recipes from West and Central Africa include fish, ground nuts or peanuts and palm oil. Compared with leafy vegetable recipes from West Africa, the collard recipes used in the United States today are strikingly similar to those from Morocco and 10th-century Baghdad. The similarity in recipes from Morocco and the American South suggests that Moroccan oases may have been a stop in the journey collards took to America.

The story of collards in the Moroccan oases is an opportunity to consider the ways the transatlantic trade systems were entangled with the trade routes and systems before them, especially the trans-Saharan trade routes, and what these entanglements mean for the foodways of Africans and African diasporas around the world.",theconversation

Despite a February 2025 federal court order to resume refugee resettlement, the administration has said that won’t be happening any time soon because the country’s refugee system has been so thoroughly dismantled.

Trump’s Jan. 20, 2025, executive order discontinued regular refugee processing and halted all federal funding for refugee resettlement. It ended the State Department’s 2023 Welcome Corps program, which allowed U.S. citizens to privately sponsor refugees, as well as a program that resettled children from Central America and certain family members. Trump also suspended the follow-to-join visas that reunited refugee families.

Together, these programs make up the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Created in 1980, the program resettles refugees nationwide through partnerships between the government and U.S.-based resettlement agencies. It had made the U.S. the global leader in refugee resettlement.

As a scholar of refugees and displacement, I expect refugee admissions to remain close to zero for the rest of Trump’s term. Thousands of refugees, both at home and abroad, will suffer as a result. So will the many Americans who work within the country’s sprawling refugee resettlement network.

Brief history of US refugee policies

Under U.S. and international law, refugees are people fleeing “persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution” due to race, membership in a particular social group, political opinion, religion or national origin.

While refugees have come to the U.S. since its founding, the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 was the country’s first official “refugee” law. The act, which expired in 1952, allowed more than 350,000 European refugees displaced by World War II to enter the U.S. within the constraints of an existing quota system that defined how many refugees the country would admit each year, and from which countries.

Between 1952 and 1980, numerous international refugee crises spurred Congress to pass a series of laws welcoming certain groups into the country.

Political calculations played a major role in these decisions. For instance, as part of America’s Cold War anti-Communist strategy, Congress passed laws in 1962 and 1966 giving tens of thousands of Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro’s regime sanctuary in the U.S.

In the 1970s and 1980s, following its loss to communist North Vietnam in the Vietnam War, the U.S. welcomed approximately 1.4 million refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.

In 1980, Congress passed the Refugee Act, which amended existing law to raise the annual ceiling for refugees and created a formal process for refugee resettlement.

Every year, through presidential determination, the president in consultation with Congress establishes refugee admissions levels. This decision takes into account U.S. national interests and international humanitarian crises. The caps are announced in the fall.

On average, since 1980, the annual presidential determination number has exceeded 95,000 people. Since 2000, Presidential determinations have ranged from a low of 27,131 – after the 9/11 attacks – to last year’s ceiling of 125,000 refugees per year.

How to get refugee status

To vet potential refugees and assist qualifying refugees in the resettlement process, several U.S. government agencies coordinate closely: The State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services.

To qualify for consideration, refugees must be living overseas. The resettlement process begins with registration with the U.N. Refugee Agency. U.N. officials collect documentation and perform an initial screening, then refer qualifying individuals to one of seven U.S. State Department resettlement support centers worldwide.

State Department officials interview applicants and submit them to a rigorous screening that includes an FBI background check. Highly trained immigration officers posted overseas then try to confirm whether applicants meet the legal standards of a refugee. They conduct face-to-face interviews to verify who they are and what forced them to flee. Testimonies are evaluated for consistency with country conditions.

The process takes 18 to 36 months or longer.

Once refugees are accepted into the U.S., 10 national refugee resettlement agencies in coordination with local nonprofit partners support them during their first 90 days in the country.

Previous suspensions

Critics of resettlement, including Trump, have argued that refugees threaten U.S. national security, are unvetted and do not assimilate into the U.S. economy and society.

However, research show that refugees contribute both economically and socially through taxes and entrepreneurship. They also revitalize towns with declining populations.

Between 2005 and 2019, refugees yielded a net positive fiscal impact of US$123.8 billion, at both federal and state levels, and generated an estimated $581 billion for governments at all levels. A 2023 American Immigration Council report found that the spending power of refugees in just one state, California, totaled more than $20.7 billion.

There is no link between refugees and crime, nor is there any notable link to terrorism.

Although the 9/11 attacks were not committed by refugees, President George W. Bush in 2001 suspended refugee admissions for several months, leaving 23,000 refugees already approved for resettlement in limbo, mainly in South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Many had sold their belongings and homes in anticipation of moving to the U.S.

In 2017, Trump in his first term in office issued executive order 13769. The directive suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days and barred entry of people from seven Muslim-majority countries – Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen – for 90 days. It also indefinitely banned Syrian refugees.

Trump also lowered the annual refugee admissions cap, from 110,000 in 2017 to 45,000 in 2018, and continued dropping it each year. By 2021, his administration had set the lowest refugee cap in U.S. history, at 15,000.

What happens when refugee resettlement pauses

The second suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program drastically affected refugees waiting abroad for resettlement and those already in the U.S.

Arabic-speaking refugees in particular struggled with discrimination and psychosocial challenges such as stress and other medical issues, leading to poorer social integration.

The U.S. economy suffered, too. One researcher estimated that Trump’s 2017 suspension of refugee resettlement deprived the country of $9.1 billion in economic activity per year and sapped public coffers at all levels of government of over $2 billion a year. More than 300 Americans who worked in refugee resettlement were laid off in 2017 alone.

Trump’s Muslim ban created an enormous backlog of immigration cases. In 2021, for instance, the incoming Biden administration inherited petitions for 25,994 unprocessed refugee family reunification cases.

Many other vetted refugees were not allowed entry, including U.S.-affiliated Iraqis and Afghans who remained trapped in violent contexts.

Immediate impact of Trump’s order on refugee resettlement

Similar repercussions are already seen today.

As of Jan. 22, 2025, the Trump administration had canceled the flights of 10,000 vetted refugees into the U.S. Most of them were coming from the 10 countries that the U.S. had accepted refugees from in recent years, including Venezuela, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Sudan and Iraq.

These refugees are now at acute risk of persecution and violence.

Recently arrived refugees, who would normally receive assistance for their first 90 days, are likewise losing support for basic essentials such as warm clothing, food and housing assistance.

Resettlement agencies nationwide are also feeling the pain of Trump cutting federal funding for refugee resettlement.

Several nonprofits have lost millions in government contracts allocated to assist new arrivals. They were forced to fire dozens or in some cases hundreds of staffers.

Three refugee resettlement agencies have sued the federal government for withholding congressionally appropriated funding for refugee processing and services. On Feb. 25, 2025, a federal judge in Seattle agreed with the plaintiffs in Pacito v. Trump that Trump likely exceeded his authority and temporarily blocked the refugee program’s suspension.

The legal battle over America’s refugee system has just begun. History suggests everyone involved with the program and the U.S. economy will suffer for years to come.",theconversation

When the Philly league joined the Women’s Flat Track Derby Association in 2005, it was one of the first, following the Texas Rollergirls in Austin and leagues in Portland, Oregon; Chicago; New York; and other cities. The WFTDA, which governs flat-track roller derby, had formed just one year prior with a goal of “revolutioniz[ing] the role of women in sports.”

Primarily organized by women, the association takes an explicitly feminist position and welcomes anyone who is of a “marginalized gender.” This includes cisgender women as well as all transgender, intersex and two-spirit individuals. Intersex people have chromosomes and/or reproductive organs that do not fit into a binary male or female classification, while two-spirit refers to members of Indigenous cultures who identify as having both a masculine and feminine spirit.

I’m a kinesiology professor who studies philosophic and historical perspectives of sport – especially women’s sport. I have a particular fondness for roller derby, which started in the U.S. in 1935.

In some ways, roller derby’s reinvention as a revolutionary feminist sport in the 21st century isn’t that surprising. After all, women have been included as, at minimum, equal participants since the sport’s beginning.

Feminist roots

Seeds of roller derby’s feminist roots can be traced to its earliest version: the Transcontinental Roller Derby.

This endurance-sport fad of the Great Depression featured pairs of skaters accumulating miles as they skated laps around a track, following imaginary routes across the country. American sportswriter Frank Deford perpetuated the apocryphal story of Leo Seltzer’s invention of roller derby. Seltzer, an entertainment entrepreneur and promoter of walkathons, supposedly scribbled the basics of the sport on a tablecloth at a Ricketts restaurant in Chicago in the spring of 1935.

Whatever the truth of that story, what is true is that in August 1935, spectators gathered in the air-conditioned Chicago Coliseum to watch 25 pairs of skaters set off to travel 3,000 miles – the approximate distance of a cross-country trek from New York to San Francisco – all while never leaving the city.

Seltzer organized the event, which featured man-woman duos skating thousands of laps around a banked track while the crowd followed their fictional cross-country progress on a large electronic map. More than a month after they started, Bernie McKay and Clarice Martin completed the race in 493 hours and 12 minutes.

Leo Seltzer took his show on the road, organizing Transcontinental Roller Derby events in cities like Cincinnati, New York, St. Louis, Indianapolis and Miami. In May 1937, roller derby made its way to the Philadelphia Arena on Market Street.

Mount Carmel Item, 1937

In all of those cities, skaters completed what the Chicago Tribune called an “imaginary cross-country dash”, sometimes covering up to 100 miles per day. Early on, the pairs skated for 10 to 12 hours daily. Eventually, skaters spent only the event hours on the track, usually starting at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. and finishing at midnight or 1 a.m. Teams alternated skaters – women skated against women and men against men – in 15-minute turns. In some locations, cots were set up on the inside of the track, giving alternating skaters a place to rest.

Seltzer saw women as an untapped sports audience who could bolster the success of his endeavor. He courted women spectators through advertisements, selling “Ladies Day” tickets, and dispersing discounted tickets to businesses frequented by women customers.

Seltzer believed that women spectators would be drawn to women skaters. This, in part, drove him to ensure a place for women in the roller derby. Few opportunities for women existed in traditional sports at that time. When women did participate in sport, many had to deal with commentary about their appearance and a focus on their beauty rather than their athletic accomplishments.

This was the case with roller derby too. For example, one Chicago Tribune reporter wrote that a 1935 leader of the roller derby was “the blonde in the cerise tights, and a right pretty gal she is” – without ever mentioning her name.

Paying the price

Despite the participation of women since its beginning, roller derby has certainly not been a total bastion of feminist progress.

Even when challenging gender norms, women skaters were objectified. Their appearance was used to market the sport in promotional photographs. Skaters like Tiny McDowell, whose photo advertised the opening of roller derby to Indianapolis Star readers in 1937, posed in their uniforms, but without the tights and pads worn during the event.

Roller derby in the 1970s, ‘80s and '90s featured strong, tough women skaters. But as communications professor Heidi Mau and I wrote in a chapter of “Sportswomen’s Apparel in the United States,” the uniforms during that era were typically tight with low-cut zippers. Organizers of roller derby – and its competitors like RollerGames and RollerJam – embraced stereotypical ideas about femininity and beauty and sexualized women skaters.

The inclusion of women also signaled to some that roller derby was not a legitimate sport – something that haunts it to this day.

Historian Michella Marino, in her comprehensive history of the sport, says that women roller derby skaters “paid a price” for doing something subversive in challenging gender norms. That price, she writes, is that sports media relegated them to the level of “spectacle,” which led to the belief that the sport was illegitimate precisely because women competed on the same level as men.

Sports columnists in the 1930s emphasized that roller derby was a dramatic spectacle, calling it a “cat fight on wheels,” an “insane indoor sport” that was about “putting on a show.”

Women skaters today approach roller derby with a feminist, do-it-yourself attitude. The modern leagues were created by women who wanted to skate and didn’t want to wait for someone else to start a team. The Women’s Flat Track Derby Association now boasts over 400 leagues on six continents.

Today’s roller derby draws spectators of all types. Tickets typically go for about $15. Some audiences come for the Riot Grrrl, or feminist punk, personas of the skaters, and are rewarded with fast-paced, high-contact skating. Others see it as a cheap family outing, and leagues advertise themselves as family friendly. Some leagues now have co-ed youth leagues, like the Junior Brawlstars of the Philly Roller Derby.

Other leagues have branched out beyond women’s flat-track roller derby, like the Penn Jersey Roller Derby in Camden, New Jersey - also founded in 2005. Home to the Devils and Hooligans, Penn Jersey competes in flat and banked track versions of the sport and even includes a team competing in the Men’s Roller Derby Association.

Still, roller derby remains unabashedly feminist, a sport that encourages women to subvert gender norms while they skate to athletic success.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,You’ve likely heard the Serenity Prayer − but not its backstory,https://theconversation.com/youve-likely-heard-the-serenity-prayer-but-not-its-backstory-250244,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:51:41 GMT","I’m not sure when I first encountered the Serenity Prayer, or when it first occurred to me to ask who wrote it. For much of my life it never occurred to me that prayers were the kind of things that people actually wrote down, especially something as popular as the Serenity Prayer: “God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to tell the difference.”

This simple, powerful sentence has been reprinted on everything from key chains and coffee mugs to tattoos and tea towels. For many people, it is probably most closely associated with 12-step recovery programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous. There, the prayer serves as a reminder both of human limits and of the fact that they do not define us.

Originally, however, the prayer was written by the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. For him, it was a call to confront the realities of the world with courage – relying not on one’s own power but on God’s grace.

Christian realism

Over the years, the prayer has often been attributed to other Christian writers, including Thomas Aquinas, Augustine and Francis of Assisi. Many people might be surprised to discover that, far from being penned in an ancient European monastery, the Serenity Prayer was written less than a century ago in a cottage in western Massachusetts.

Niebuhr was born the son of a German American pastor in Wright City, Missouri. He became a pastor himself, serving a congregation in Detroit before moving to New York to teach at Union Theological Seminary, where he gained recognition as a theologian, activist and social critic. His brother, H. Richard Niebuhr, also became a well-known ethicist and theologian, as did his sister Hulda.

Today, Reinhold Niebuhr is probably best known as a founder of “Christian realism.” As I describe in my book “The Niebuhr Brothers for Armchair Theologians,” it is an approach to ethics grounded in the insight that human beings are called to strive toward their highest moral ideals, while recognizing our inability to fully achieve them.

This idea is captured by the title of one of his best-known books, “Moral Man and Immoral Society.” There Niebuhr argued that, while individuals are sometimes capable of acting purely from love for others, groups are not. When human beings form collectives, those collectives are ultimately capable of acting only from self-interest.

Therefore, the most that can be expected from any society is not love but justice – which approximates, but never fulfills, the demands of love.

Over the years, Niebuhr’s thought became particularly influential in politics. His work was read and respected by liberal politicians such as Arthur Schlesinger and Hubert Humphrey, who was vice president under Lyndon B. Johnson. Some of these admirers had little use for his religion, and even dubbed themselves “atheists for Niebuhr,” but they respected and embraced his insights into society.

2 versions

How then did Niebuhr come to write this prayer?

His daughter, Elisabeth Sifton, recounts the story in her book “The Serenity Prayer.” She was a girl when Niebuhr first composed the lines for a worship service near their summer home in Heath, Massachusetts. Later, as she tells it, he contributed a version to a prayer book for soldiers being shipped off to fight in World War II, and from there it eventually migrated to Alcoholics Anonymous.

Niebuhr did not believe that prayers should be copyrighted, she writes, and never profited from its popularity – though friends would gift him with examples of Serenity Prayer kitsch, such as wood carvings and needlework.

Yet the best-known version of the prayer is not quite the version that Niebuhr originally wrote. According to Sifton, his first version read, “God, give us the grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed, the courage to change the things that should be changed, and the wisdom to distinguish the one from the other.”

The differences between the two versions are subtle but significant, emphasizing themes that were central to Niebuhr’s thought. He did not simply pray for serenity, but for grace. He did not pray for courage to change what can be changed, but only for what should be changed.

And crucially, it is not an individual prayer, but collective: “grant us,” not “grant me.” Niebuhr believed that while the highest moral achievements could be attained only by individuals, constructive social change was possible only by working together for justice.

‘Saved by hope’

The Serenity Prayer in all of its forms rests on Niebuhr’s hard-won sense of history’s tragic dimension, borne of his experience of two world wars and a global depression. He recognized that even the most courageous actions are not guaranteed to succeed.

But Niebuhr was no fatalist and did not believe uncertainty was a reason not to act. On the contrary, he believed that as human beings we are obligated to enter the fray of social conflict – not with an arrogant sense of our own superiority, but with a humble recognition of our limits.

As he wrote elsewhere: “Nothing worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope. Nothing true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we must be saved by faith. Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore we must be saved by love.”

In the end, for Niebuhr, it is God’s grace that determines the final course of history, rather than our own actions – enabling us to accept the reality that the outcomes of our actions are often out of our hands.",theconversation

They assumed their isolation would protect them. It didn’t. Peru, and Iquitos, were hit fast and hard.

In many wealthier parts of the world, states stepped in to help people whose livelihoods had disappeared. Not in Iquitos. The pandemic led to an extreme case of societal breakdown. In a surreal situation, people were left to fend for themselves, fighting to get hold of oxygen on the black market for their loved ones and forced to put themselves in danger to survive.

In this episode of The Conversation Weekly podcast, we speak to a researcher who spent a year living in Iquitos, trying to understand what happened there during the pandemic. It serves as a warning that even after facing multiple crises, five years later, few places are ready for the radical reckoning needed to avoid the same thing happening again.

When Japhy Wilson began asking people in Iquitos of their memories about the first wave of COVID in March 2020, many mentioned the story of one man: Juan Pablo Vaquero, known locally as Uncle Covid.

This man who had been taken to the main hospital in the city at the height of the first wave, was pronounced dead. His sister wasn’t allowed to see his body. She had to return home and three days later he appeared at her front door, supposedly stinking of death. She asked what had happened to him, and he told her that he’d awoken in a pile of black garbage bags out in the jungle and had found his way home from there.

In 2022, Wilson, a lecturer in human-environment interactions at Bangor University in Wales, went to live in Iquitos for a year. He recently published research based on interviews he did with people in the city about their memories of the early stages of the pandemic.

I knew there’d been this huge disaster, but everyday life was just carrying on as normal. It was being kind of deliberately forgotten, and as soon as I started talking to people about it all kinds of extraordinary stories emerged. Almost everybody had lost at least one close family member during this first wave. I’ve done research in a lot of difficult, conflict situations in the past. But never had I encountered so many people breaking down in tears as they did in this case.

Anything else would have to come from their new environment.

So they built shelter from local timber, rocks and sod; foraged for food and cultivated the soil beneath their feet; and fabricated tools from whatever they could scrounge up. It was difficult, but ultimately the successful ones made everything they needed to survive.

Something similar will take place when humanity leaves Earth for destinations such as the Moon and Mars – although astronauts will face even greater challenges than, for example, the Vikings did when they reached Greenland and Newfoundland. Not only will the astronauts have limited supplies and the need to live off the land; they won’t even be able to breathe the air.

Instead of axes and plows, however, today’s space pioneers will bring 3D printers. As an engineer and professor who is developing technologies to extend the human presence beyond Earth, I focus my work and research on these remarkable machines.

3D printers will make the tools, structures and habitats space pioneers need to survive in a hostile alien environment. They will enable long-term human presence on the Moon and Mars.

From hammers to habitats

On Earth, 3D printing can fabricate, layer by layer, thousands of things, from replacement hips to hammers to homes. These devices take raw materials, such as plastic, concrete or metal, and deposit it on a computerized programmed path to build a part. It’s often called “additive manufacturing,” because you keep adding material to make the part, rather than removing material, as is done in conventional machining.

Already, 3D printing in space is underway. On the International Space Station, astronauts use 3D printers to make tools and spare parts, such as ratchet wrenches, clamps and brackets. Depending on the part, printing time can take from around 30 minutes to several hours.

For now, the print materials are mostly hauled up from Earth. But NASA has also begun recycling some of those materials, such as waste plastic, to make new parts with the Refabricator, an advanced 3D printer installed in 2019.

Manufacturing in space

You may be wondering why space explorers can’t simply bring everything they need with them. After all, that’s how the International Space Station was built decades ago – by hauling tons of prefabricated components from Earth.

But that’s impractical for building habitats on other worlds. Launching materials into space is incredibly expensive. Right now, every pound launched aboard a rocket just to get to low Earth orbit costs thousands of dollars. To get materials to the Moon, NASA estimates the initial cost at around US$500,000 per pound.

Still, manufacturing things in space is a challenge. In the microgravity of space, or the reduced gravity of the Moon or Mars, materials behave differently than they do on Earth. Decrease or remove gravity, and materials cool and recrystallize differently. The Moon has one-sixth the gravity of Earth; Mars, about two-fifths. Engineers and scientists are working now to adapt 3D printers to function in these conditions.

Using otherworldly soil

On alien worlds, rather than plastic or metal, 3D printers will use the natural resources found in these environments. But finding the right raw materials is not easy. Habitats on the Moon and Mars must protect astronauts from the lack of air, extreme temperatures, micrometeorite impacts and radiation.

Regolith, the fine, dusty, sandlike particles that cover both the lunar and Martian surfaces, could be a primary ingredient to make these dwellings. Think of the regolith on both worlds as alien dirt – unlike Earth soil, it contains few nutrients, and as far as we know, no living organisms. But it might be a good raw material for 3D printing.

My colleagues began researching this possibility by first examining how regular cement behaves in space. I am now joining them to develop techniques for turning regolith into a printable material and to eventually test these on the Moon.

But obtaining otherworldly regolith is a problem. The regolith samples returned from the Moon during the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 70s are precious, difficult if not impossible to access for research purposes. So scientists are using regolith simulants to test ideas. Actual regolith may react quite differently than our simulants. We just don’t know.

What’s more, the regolith on the Moon is very different from what’s found on Mars. Martian regolith contains iron oxide –that’s what gives it a reddish color – but Moon regolith is mostly silicates; it’s much finer and more angular. Researchers will need to learn how to use both types in a 3D printer.

Applications on Earth

NASA’s Moon-to-Mars Planetary Autonomous Construction Technology program, also known as MMPACT, is advancing the technology needed to print these habitats on alien worlds.

Among the approaches scientists are now exploring: a regolith-based concrete made in part from surface ice; melting the regolith at high temperatures, and then using molds to form it while it’s a liquid; and sintering, which means heating the regolith with concentrated sunlight, lasers or microwaves to fuse particles together without the need for binders.

Along those lines, my colleagues and I developed a Martian concrete we call MarsCrete, a material we used to 3D-print a small test structure for NASA in 2017.

Then, in May 2019, using another type of special concrete, we 3D-printed a one-third scale prototype Mars habitat that could support everything astronauts would need for long-term survival, including living, sleeping, research and food-production modules.

That prototype showcased the potential, and the challenges, of building housing on the red planet. But many of these technologies will benefit people on Earth too.

In the same way astronauts will make sustainable products from natural resources, homebuilders could make concretes from binders and aggregates found locally, and maybe even from recycled construction debris. Engineers are already adapting the techniques that could print Martian habitats to address housing shortages here at home. Indeed, 3D-printed homes are already on the market.

Meanwhile, the move continues toward establishing a human presence outside the Earth. Artemis III, now scheduled for liftoff in 2027, will be the first human Moon landing since 1972. A NASA trip to Mars could happen as early as 2035.

But wherever people go, and whenever they get there, I’m certain that 3D printers will be one of the primary tools to let human beings live off alien land.",theconversation

Dans le cadre d’une étude publiée dans The Journal of Wildlife Management, nous avons utilisé des caméras robotisées pour observer des familles d’ours polaires au moment de leur sortie de la tanière à Svalbard, en Norvège. Cela nous a permis de mieux comprendre le comportement des mères et des oursons lorsque ceux-ci découvrent pour la première fois le monde extérieur.

Un phénomène difficile à observer

Bien que les tanières maternelles offrent des conditions idéales pour la croissance des petits, elles ne sont pas évidentes à étudier pour les chercheurs. Le temps froid, le manque de lumière du jour et leur isolement rendent les possibilités d’observation directe rares. Les ourses polaires en tanière sont souvent identifiées à l’aide de dispositifs de repérage portés par l’animal, généralement des colliers, mais aussi des étiquettes d’oreille ou de fourrure. Ces dispositifs transmettent des données de localisation par satellite, ce qui permet aux chercheurs de suivre les individus et d’étudier leurs déplacements.

Le développement des technologies permet de collecter davantage d’informations, sur l’activité et la température, par exemple. Une période d’immobilité prolongée et une faible activité sont des signes que l’ourse s’est installée dans une tanière. Des températures supérieures à la température ambiante en sont également des indices. Isolé par la neige et réchauffé par la chaleur corporelle de la mère, l’air de la tanière peut atteindre 20 °C de plus que l’extérieur.

Au Svalbard, les ourses polaires construisent leurs abris sur les pentes des fjords et dans les zones montagneuses, où la neige soufflée par le vent rend les tanières difficiles à distinguer de l’environnement.

Repérage des tanières

Nous avons utilisé les positions GPS transmises par des colliers satellites portés par les femelles pour localiser 13 tanières. L’allongement de la durée du jour au printemps a permis à notre équipe d’installer des caméras d’observation en face de l’entrée de chaque tanière présumée, afin de filmer les familles d’ours polaires lorsqu’elles en sortent. Pour limiter les perturbations, la dernière distance a été parcourue à pied ou à ski, et les caméras ont été collectées plusieurs mois plus tard, bien après le départ des familles pour la banquise.

Après avoir analysé des milliers d’images prises par la caméra, nous avons obtenu une perspective détaillée de cette étape énigmatique du cycle de vie des ours polaires. En associant les images aux données des colliers, nous avons également pu élaborer un modèle des différents comportements filmés, ce qui nous a fourni un nouvel outil pour mieux suivre à distance les ours pendant cette période.

Une endurance exceptionnelle

Bien qu’elle soit essentielle pour les oursons, la vie dans la tanière peut être difficile pour leur mère. Les femelles gravides y entrent généralement à l’automne, donnent naissance au milieu de l’hiver et y restent pour allaiter les oursons jusqu’à ce que la famille soit prête à sortir au printemps. Bien que leurs petits boivent du lait à haute teneur énergétique, les ourses polaires ne se nourrissent pas du tout pendant cette période et utilisent leurs réserves de graisse. Elles perdent jusqu’à 43 % de leur masse corporelle dans la tanière.

Même si elles ont toutes les raisons de retourner chasser sur la banquise, les ourses polaires demeurent dans la tanière avec leurs petits pendant des jours, voire des semaines après leur première sortie. En moyenne, les familles que nous avons suivies au Svalbard sont restées sur le site de la tanière pendant 12 jours après leur première sortie.

Déjà des milliers d’abonnés à l’infolettre de La Conversation. Et vous ? Abonnez-vous aujourd’hui à notre infolettre pour mieux comprendre les grands enjeux contemporains.

Au cours de cette période, la mère et les oursons quittaient souvent la tanière pour explorer, mais restaient parfois moins d’une minute à l’extérieur. En d’autres occasions, ils sortaient pendant des heures. Les petits s’aventurent rarement à l’extérieur sans leur mère et n’ont été vus seuls que dans 5 % des observations par caméra. En général, plus les températures sont élevées et plus le nombre de jours écoulés depuis la première sortie est grand, plus le temps passé à l’extérieur est long.

Cette période permet aux oursons de s’acclimater à l’environnement extérieur et de développer les compétences et la force dont ils auront besoin pour suivre leur mère sur la banquise pendant les deux ans et demi à venir.

Nous avons également observé des variations considérables dans le comportement des animaux après leur sortie de la tanière : une famille l’a quittée après seulement quelques jours, tandis qu’une autre y est restée un mois complet après sa première apparition à l’extérieur. Deux femelles ont même déplacé leurs petits dans une nouvelle tanière après leur sortie.

Conséquences des changements dans l’Arctique

Ces éléments soulèvent de nouvelles questions : qu’est-ce qui motive la décision de rester ou de quitter la tanière, sur quels critères les familles se basent-elles ? Bien que nous poursuivions le développement de notre ensemble de données pour mieux comprendre ces comportements, nous avons constaté qu’en moyenne, les ours polaires abandonnaient leur tanière environ une semaine plus tôt que ce qui avait été observé auparavant. La mer de Barents est une des régions de la planète qui se réchauffe le plus rapidement. Une surveillance continue permettra de savoir s’il s’agit d’une nouvelle tendance en réponse à la disparition de la glace de mer.

Pour obtenir des informations encore plus détaillées, nous avons testé des systèmes de caméras conçus sur mesure, capables de filmer les activités en continu.

Le réchauffement a déjà entraîné une détérioration de la santé des ours polaires dans certaines parties de l’Arctique où la glace de mer disparaît rapidement. Comme la population d’ours polaires est en péril dans une grande partie de leur aire de répartition, la réussite de la reproduction et de la vie dans la tanière est essentielle pour donner à la prochaine génération d’ours polaires une chance de survie.

Le temps passé dans la tanière, le moment de la première sortie et la durée pendant laquelle les ours demeurent dans la tanière après celle-ci sont autant d’éléments qui contribuent à la survie ultérieure des oursons. Avec le réchauffement climatique, l’empreinte humaine s’étend dans l’Arctique et risque d’empiéter sur les aires de mise bas et de perturber les familles d’ours polaires.

Une surveillance et une compréhension accrues du comportement des ours en tanière permettront de les protéger au cours de cette période critique.",theconversation

Entre essas organizações, o Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC) vem chamando a atenção de autoridades europeias, em especial as portuguesas, diante das evidências de que seus membros estão estabelecendo bases em alguns países da região. Relatórios indicam a existência de estruturas para tráfico de drogas, lavagem de dinheiro e até movimentação de armas, que podem impactar a segurança interna de Portugal e de outros países do continente europeu.

A expansão do PCC além do Brasil

O PCC, surgido nos presídios de São Paulo na década de 1990, cresceu vertiginosamente ao longo dos anos, tornando-se a maior organização criminosa do Brasil. Inicialmente focado em controlar prisões e em articular crimes de forma relativamente regional, o grupo passou a estabelecer conexões internacionais, sobretudo para viabilizar o tráfico de cocaína e outros entorpecentes. Em Portugal, dados do Serviço de Informações de Segurança (SIS) chegaram a indicar a existência de cerca de mil indivíduos com algum nível de vínculo ao PCC atuando no país, informação que foi muito contestada e até hoje não confirmada por outras fontes.

Mesmo assim, na análise de autoridades portuguesas, o país vem sendo encarado como porta de entrada na Europa para grandes carregamentos de droga, principalmente provenientes do Brasil. Os portos de Sines, Lisboa e Leixões são apontados como alguns dos principais canais de entrada de cocaína no continente. De acordo com reportagens locais, há registros de crimes violentos e tentativas de homicídio relacionados a ajustes de contas em torno do tráfico, sempre com o PCC figurando como ator central ou parceiro de outras redes criminosas europeias.

Desconfianças sobre a presença de membros do PCC na Europa

Por se tratar de um grupo com forte poder econômico no mercado ilícito de drogas, a presença do PCC desperta temores de que a organização possa reproduzir em solo europeu práticas de corrupção, intimidação de agentes públicos e expansão de sua influência. Uma fonte de preocupação é o fato de haver evidências, ainda que fragmentadas, de tentativas de infiltração em setores econômicos legítimos, como construção civil, barbearias, restaurantes, aviação civil, importação de frutos exóticos e imobiliário, com o objetivo de legalizar o dinheiro obtido com o tráfico de drogas.

Em Lisboa e Porto, surgiram suspeitas de aliciamento de cidadãos brasileiros e mesmo portugueses para servirem como testas de ferro em empresas de fachada. A facilidade linguística, o histórico de forte migração de brasileiros para Portugal e o interesse em obter rendimentos expressivos no mercado europeu explicam, em parte, por que o PCC teria preferido este país como um de seus pontos de partida. Autoridades brasileiras e portuguesas salientam que o grupo procura operar sem chamar a atenção, privilegiando a aparência de negócios lícitos ao estilo de franquias ou microempresas, mas cujos rendimentos efetivos viriam das remessas de tráfico.

Outro ponto que alimenta as preocupações é o fluxo de membros e lideranças do PCC que transitam entre diferentes países. Há registros de que importantes figuras do grupo chegaram a viver em Portugal por períodos variados, ocultando-se das autoridades. Um dos casos mais notáveis foi o de André de Oliveira Macedo, conhecido como André do Rap, que teria ficado escondido em Portugal por cerca de um ano. Essa movimentação reforça a hipótese de que o país está na rota de lideranças que, além do tráfico, buscam lavar dinheiro a partir de uma moeda forte, como o euro, e, ao mesmo tempo, usufruir de relativa tranquilidade pela falta de notoriedade em certas áreas da Europa.

O uso de portos portugueses como porta de entrada da cocaína

Portugal, que historicamente possui uma posição estratégica na confluência entre o Atlântico e o continente europeu, tornou-se alvo de traficantes interessados em reduzir distâncias e riscos na logística da cocaína. De acordo com as autoridades responsáveis, a maior parte da droga que chega ao país vem escondida em contentores de carga ou disfarçada em produtos como frutas, açúcar, carvão e outros bens, sendo desembarcada em portos como Lisboa, Leixões, Setúbal e Sines.

A “Operação Porthos”, realizada pela Polícia Judiciária (PJ) de Portugal, apresentou evidências de que funcionários portuários e agentes da Autoridade Tributária estavam recebendo subornos de organizações criminosas brasileiras (como o PCC) e cartéis colombianos, facilitando a saída de grandes lotes de droga dos portos em caminhões. Esse esquema abria caminho para que a cocaína fosse distribuída em outros países do continente, por via rodoviária.

O que torna a rota por Portugal ainda mais lucrativa ao PCC é o fato de a cocaína atingir na Europa preços muito superiores aos praticados no Brasil. Um quilo de cocaína que vale alguns milhares de euros na América do Sul pode chegar a dezenas de milhares no varejo europeu, podendo multiplicar o valor de origem em até cinco vezes. Com isso, a busca por sistemas de logística cada vez mais sofisticados e pela proteção de “laranjas” em empresas de fachada torna-se essencial para o negócio criminoso.

O crescimento do consumo de cocaína na Europa

Relatórios do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência (OEDT)] e análises de águas residuais em cidades do continente mostram que a presença de cocaína tem crescido de modo consistente em vários países, incluindo Portugal, Espanha, Bélgica e Países Baixos. Esses dados revelam que o consumo não se limita a grandes centros urbanos, estendendo-se também a cidades menores, o que indica que os padrões de consumo urbano podem estar sendo replicados por todo o continente.

O incremento na pureza da cocaína disponível no mercado europeu, em paralelo à estabilidade dos preços ao consumidor, sugere a crescente eficiência das redes de abastecimento e tráfico. Há casos de recordes anuais sucessivos de apreensões totais de cocaína, como Portugal que em 2024 apreendeu cerca de 23 toneladas de cocaína, mas, apesar disso, a droga continua a chegar em quantidades cada vez maiores.

Mais preocupante ainda é a diversificação das vias de consumo: o crack (forma fumável de base livre) tem surgido com maior frequência em comunidades vulneráveis de países como França, Bélgica e até Portugal. Esse consumo agrava os riscos sociais e de saúde, pois o crack está associado a padrões de uso intensivo e compulsivo, além de elevar as taxas de marginalização e insegurança em áreas urbanas.

A necessidade de lavar dinheiro na economia europeia

Outra vertente fundamental para compreender a presença do PCC em Portugal diz respeito à lavagem de dinheiro. Organizações de tráfico que movimentam grandes quantias em “dinheiro vivo” precisam legitimar esses capitais. Em território europeu, o PCC estaria investindo em ramos como construção civil, importadoras de frutas exóticas, restaurantes, barbearias e, além disso, apostando em fraudes virtuais. A escolha por esses setores se deve, em parte, à facilidade de abertura de empresas com estruturas simples e ao fato de que movimentações em moeda forte são naturalmente propícias à lavagem de capitais.

Muitas vezes, negócios de fachada são registrados em nome de pessoas que não possuem antecedentes criminais, mantendo uma operação comercial mínima para justificar despesas e aparentar legalidade. Em alguns casos, há suspeita de corrupção de autoridades locais para facilitar processos burocráticos ou ocultar transações. Como os valores gerados pelo tráfico internacional de cocaína podem chegar a centenas de milhões de euros, a preocupação com a expansão da lavagem de dinheiro é constante entre os órgãos de fiscalização.

A prisão de um mergulhador do PCC e as evidências do problema

A captura recente de um brasileiro de 38 anos, que vivia na região da grande Lisboa e seria responsável por organizar operações de retirada de cocaína dos cascos de navios no porto local, tornou-se um fato emblemático. Segundo a Polícia Judiciária, o suspeito teria ligações diretas com o PCC e ocuparia posição de destaque na estrutura de tráfico para a Europa. Em sua garagem, foram apreendidas metralhadoras, um fuzil de assalto modelo AR15, uma pistola calibre 9mm adaptada para rajadas e equipamentos sofisticados de mergulho, incluindo motos subaquáticas para ações furtivas.

A logística descrita pelos investigadores é reveladora: a cocaína era colocada nos cascos dos navios ainda no Brasil, por equipes de mergulhadores, e depois recuperada na Europa, em operações noturnas, antes que qualquer fiscalização fosse efetivamente feita nas embarcações. Estima-se que cada navio pudesse transportar algo em torno de 100 a 150 quilos de cocaína disfarçada. Considerando o valor de mercado europeu, a margem de lucro é altíssima. Esse episódio corrobora diversos alertas das autoridades sobre a sofisticação das rotas ilícitas, que integram conhecimento técnico, armamento pesado e uma rede logística global.

O arsenal encontrado na casa do suspeito também serve de alerta acerca das armas de fogo em circulação. Se há metralhadoras, fuzis de assalto e pistolas modificadas nas mãos de membros do PCC em solo português, existe o risco de incremento na violência armada, algo que preocupa órgãos de segurança pública habituados a patamares historicamente mais baixos de criminalidade violenta em Portugal.

O fluxo de armas e o impacto na segurança em Portugal

O tráfico de drogas, sobretudo no contexto do PCC, frequentemente anda de mãos dadas com a circulação de armas de fogo. A apreensão dessas armas em Portugal, associadas à organização criminosa brasileira, sugere que a logística do tráfico de cocaína pode também estar sendo utilizada para contrabandear armamentos que, caso se proliferem, podem elevar os índices de criminalidade violenta e de homicídios.

Tradicionalmente, Portugal não figura entre os países europeus com mais problemas de violência armada. Porém, há o temor de que essa nova configuração do crime organizado (com forte influência internacional) crie facções locais ou subgrupos associados que se enfrentem ou imponham práticas de intimidação, ao estilo do que ocorre em algumas regiões do Brasil. É importante lembrar que, além de Portugal, países como Espanha, França, Bélgica e Países Baixos já vivenciam situações de violência e assassinatos relacionados à disputa pelo controle de rotas de cocaína nos grandes portos, como Algeciras, Antuérpia e Roterdã.

Cooperação com o Brasil, parcerias europeias e preparação de Portugal

Diante desse cenário, cresce a consciência de que apenas a colaboração transnacional pode frear a expansão do PCC. Portugal e Brasil têm historicamente canais de cooperação em áreas judiciais e de segurança. Em fevereiro de 2025, durante a XIV Cimeira Luso-Brasileira, ministros da Justiça de ambos os países assinaram acordos para o intercâmbio de informações, o compartilhamento de dados criminais e para facilitar investigações conjuntas. A meta é ampliar a troca de antecedentes criminais, monitorar suspeitos e neutralizar as bases de financiamento dos grupos.

O envolvimento de outros países europeus, que sofrem com grandes apreensões e crimes violentos relacionados à cocaína, é igualmente crucial. Sem uma estratégia abrangente de controle portuário, a cada país que aperte a vigilância surgirão pontos de entrada alternativos, como apontam autoridades do Centro de Inteligência de São Paulo e da própria Polícia Judiciária portuguesa. Nesse sentido, investigações conjuntas com a Europol, a Interpol e polícias federais brasileiras podem ser vitais para rastrear rotas, desmantelar laboratórios de refino e fechar brechas na fiscalização de contentores.

Portugal, por sua vez, precisa adaptar-se à nova realidade de ser um dos portões de entrada de cocaína na Europa. A necessidade de reforçar as equipes policiais, de combater a corrupção em pontos sensíveis do sistema portuário e de aprimorar os serviços de inteligência é consenso entre especialistas. Há também demandas sociais para que se previna a escalada do consumo de cocaína no país, pois dados recentes mostram um aumento de apreensões recorde de entorpecentes e o crescimento do uso, verificado em análises de águas residuais.

Uma questão maior: a “guerra às drogas” está perdida?

Vários analistas apontam que, em diversos países, a chamada “guerra às drogas” fracassou, resultando em superencarceramento, pouca redução na oferta de entorpecentes e crescimento exponencial de facções e cartéis. Os custos sociais e econômicos do combate ao tráfico são altíssimos: envolvem contingentes policiais, gastos com sistemas de justiça, prisões e, muitas vezes, problemas de corrupção.

Na Europa, o desafio não é diferente. Mesmo com intensas apreensões, o fluxo de drogas não parece diminuir. Organizações como o PCC adaptam-se rapidamente, encontrando novas rotas e métodos de ocultação. Os indicadores de consumo de cocaína também apontam tendência de alta na Europa, o que gera questionamentos sobre a eficácia de políticas exclusivamente repressivas.

Assim, abre-se espaço para uma discussão sobre modelos alternativos, como a legalização ou a regulação de substâncias hoje ilícitas. Em Portugal, a experiência da descriminalização do uso pessoal de drogas (adotada desde 2001) é citada, mas não contempla a legalização do comércio. Ainda assim, a política lusa de descriminalização é considerada avançada no que se refere ao tratamento de dependentes, ao reduzir a estigmatização e ao permitir acesso mais fácil a serviços de saúde e de reinserção social.

A ideia de legalizar e regulamentar o comércio de drogas, algo que alguns países vêm experimentando com a canábis, poderia, em tese, minar as bases econômicas do tráfico e, portanto, a capacidade de organizações criminosas como o PCC de financiar suas ações. Entretanto, essa hipótese esbarra em questões éticas, morais, políticas e até diplomáticas, já que a cooperação internacional tende a defender a proibição. O caminho europeu, portanto, não está definido: algumas nações parecem dispostas a revisar suas leis; outras endurecem penas e reforçam a repressão, apostando em operações policiais conjuntas.

Conclusão

A presença do PCC em Portugal, e na Europa como um todo, mostra-se um fenômeno complexo. O grupo não busca apenas expandir o tráfico de cocaína, mas também criar esquemas de lavagem de dinheiro e influenciar mercados legítimos. Essa realidade expõe vulnerabilidades institucionais, especialmente em portos e em setores econômicos com menor fiscalização. A infiltração do crime organizado nas instituições estatais é uma tática comum dessas redes e tem como consequência a fragilização das mesmas.

O crescimento do consumo de cocaína na Europa correlaciona-se diretamente com a entrada ampliada de entorpecentes, abrindo margem para a consolidação de organizações criminosas transnacionais e para o aumento de crimes violentos, incluindo a circulação de armas de fogo. Ao mesmo tempo, o problema não respeita fronteiras nacionais, pois a logística do PCC envolve o Atlântico, a América do Sul, a África Ocidental (em alguns casos) e diversos países do continente europeu.

A cooperação internacional com o Brasil, combinada a estratégias conjuntas dos países europeus, é apontada como a via preferencial para combater a expansão do PCC. Reformas no controle aduaneiro e medidas anticorrupção em portos e alfândegas podem aumentar a eficácia da repressão. A articulação com órgãos como a Interpol, a Europol e polícias nacionais é essencial para o intercâmbio de informações e para promover operações de maior impacto no desmantelamento das cadeias logísticas criminosas.

Por outro lado, o debate sobre a legalização e regulamentação de entorpecentes, especialmente a cocaína, cujo consumo cresce na Europa, não pode ser desprezado. Tais propostas, embora polêmicas, levantam a possibilidade de minar a principal fonte de renda do PCC, caso houvesse um modelo regulado de oferta. Há, contudo, dúvidas significativas sobre como efetivamente implementar tal política sem ampliar problemas sociais, e se ela realmente diminuiria as atividades de grupos violentos.

Fato é que, enquanto a demanda por cocaína permanecer elevada na Europa e as organizações criminosas tiverem acesso a portos vulneráveis e redes de lavagem de dinheiro, esses grupos tenderão a manter ou expandir sua presença. Portugal, por sua vez, precisa se preparar para enfrentar os desafios de um novo cenário criminal, em que atores estrangeiros organizados, com recursos financeiros vultosos e conhecimentos técnicos (até mesmo mergulhadores especializados), colocam em xeque a capacidade tradicional de fiscalização.

Afinal, a “Guerra às Drogas”, tal como delineada há décadas, mostra claros sinais de exaustão, com relatos de fracasso em múltiplos países. A Europa, em particular, assiste ao aumento do consumo de cocaína e à consolidação de organizações transnacionais. Os portugueses, por sua vez, enxergam seu território como alvo de traficantes brasileiros, cujo modus operandi pode se tornar cada vez mais complexo. Se a legalização e a regulamentação serão adotadas ou se a repressão policial se intensificará, o futuro dirá. O certo é que o desafio exigirá soluções combinadas, envolvendo a esfera policial, o desenvolvimento de políticas sociais, a cooperação internacional e, não menos importante, o questionamento honesto dos limites e resultados do modelo proibicionista.

Desse modo, permanece a dúvida sobre qual será o caminho escolhido pela Europa para enfrentar o problema das drogas e do crime organizado. Enquanto a solução não se define, organizações como o PCC continuam a explorar brechas, movimentar montantes expressivos em euros e a pressionar sistemas de justiça e de segurança em países que não estavam acostumados, até então, a esse patamar de ação criminosa transnacional.",theconversation

Agora, imagine trazer essa sensação de acolhimento para o ambiente da Saúde, onde frequentemente prevalecem tensão e preocupações.

Iniciativas pet-friendly na rede pública de saúde ainda são pouco comuns, e geralmente se estendem apenas a pacientes internados em hospitais. Porém no Brasil elas estão alinhadas com as diretrizes da Política Nacional de Humanização (PNH), que busca oferecer um atendimento mais humanizado e inclusivo à população.

Pesquisas indicam que a interação com animais de estimação pode promover saúde mental. Em linha com tais pesquisas, permitir pets em hospitais e clínicas de saúde é uma ideia promissora e que pode resultar em melhor saúde física e mental de adultos e crianças. No entanto, ainda temos um longo caminho pela frente e desafios complexos a serem debatidos.

A relevância da implementação de práticas pet-friendly na saúde

O Brasil tem a terceira maior população pet do mundo. Além disso, alguns tutores afirmam que amam mais seus pets do que membros da família. Com a evidente importância dos animais de estimação, é crucial que o sistema de saúde se ajuste às necessidades da população. Isso significa valorizar o papel emocional dos pets na vida das pessoas e ampliar o debate sobre espaços pet-friendly em diversos contextos, incluindo em serviços de saúde.

Apesar dos desafios inerentes à implementação de políticas pet-friendly em ambientes hospitalares, pesquisas sugerem que essa ideia pode ter sim um impacto positivo. Pois seria capaz de:

1. Encorajar a adesão ao tratamento:

Abordagens que incluam a possibilidade de trazer o pet ao atendimento podem derrubar barreiras que impedem algumas populações de buscar suporte médico e psicológico. Por exemplo, pessoas com graves transtornos psicológicos, e/ou donos de pets em situação de rua muitas vezes enfrentam no dificuldade no acesso aos serviços médicos e psicológicosquando isso significa se separar de seus pets. Isso pode reduzir o acesso à saúde para populações vulneráveis. Portanto, é fundamental ajustar os serviços de saúde às demandas dessas populações.

2. Reduzir o estresse de pacientes e equipe de saúde:

Incluir animais em clínicas e hospitais pode humanizar o ambiente, facilitar a comunicação, e amenizar o estresse tanto de pacientes quanto de profissionais da Saúde. Para os profissionais, o resultado é a redução de burnout. Além disso, para os pacientes a interação com animais oferece conforto emocional e uma distração de preocupações, o que pode resultar em maior adesão ao tratamento.

3. Melhorar a comunicação entre paciente e equipe de saúde:

O simples fato de falar com o paciente sobre o seu pet pode melhorar a comunicação entre ele e a equipe de saúde. As pessoas simplesmente se sentem mais à vontade quando são questionadas sobre esse importante vínculo. Ao criar mais políticas pet-friendly, esse tipo de diálogo pode ser potencializado o que pode gerar mais sensação de confiança no relacionamento com os profissionais de saúde.

Desafios e potenciais riscos

Embora os benefícios sejam evidentes, a adoção de políticas pet-friendly na saúde ainda é limitada, em parte devido às preocupações com os riscos de transmissão de doenças.

De fato, aspectos logísticos envolvendo a higiene e segurançasão aspectos importantes nesse debate. Ao mesmo tempo, com adequados protocolos de saúde os riscos oferecidos pela presença de pets podem não ser maiores que aqueles associados às visitas de familiares em ambientes hospitalares. Essa foi a conclusão do Juravinski Hospital no Canadá, que desenvolve um programa que permite a visita de pets a pacientes internados. Em outras palavras, os riscos existem, mas podem ser reduzidos com protocolos apropriados, como apontado em alguns estudos.

Seguindo essa lógica, em cidades brasileiras como São Paulo por exemplo, embora apenas em hospitais, a visita de pets já é regulamentada e segue protocolos claros.

Para controle de bactérias, cuidados com o pelo e higiene do animal devem ser garantidos, assim como o monitoramento das visitas por profissionais de saúde. É possível minimizar riscos com informações claras sobre em que áreas especificas o animal pode circular e com quem pode interagir. Outra medida necessária é a exigência de laudo veterinário atestando a saúde do animal.

A vasta maioria dos profissionais que já interagiram com animais em ambientes da saúde, reconhece os benefícios dessa interação. Mas o preparo da equipe de saúde é igualmente relevante. Eles precisam se sentir confortáveis para lidar com pets no ambiente de trabalho. Portanto, tais políticas devem ser construídas em colaboração com profissionais da área. Isso pode garantir que o manejo de situações especificas como fobia de animais e alergias sejam colocadas na balança e adequadamente respeitadas.

Questões comportamentais também devem ser consideradas para que a presença do pet não cause transtorno para outros pacientes ou profissionais. Sem tais cuidados, políticas pet-friendly não conseguirão alcançar seu objetivo que é promover saúde física e mental e tornar serviços de saúde mais inclusivos e acolhedores.

O reconhecimento desses desafios é, portanto, fundamental, e serve para ajudar na elaboração de propostas pet-friendly que de fato sejam viáveis e benéficas para todos os envolvidos.

Ampliando horizontes

A abordagem “One Health” (Uma Só Saúde) reconhece a conexão entre a saúde humana, animal, vegetal e ambiental. Com base nesse conceito, considerar a presença de pets na rede de saúde é mais que uma forma de promover conforto emocional, é uma ideia alinhada com uma visão mais integrada da saúde.

Com a adaptação de protocolos, treinamento de equipe e participação ativa dos profissionais, podemos transformar serviços de saúde e torná-los mais acessíveis e abertos aos pets.

Essa abordagem cria um ambiente acolhedor, ajudando a melhorar a qualidade dos cuidados oferecido à população. O objetive final é aplicar o que sabemos sobre pets par construir propostas mais holísticas, e alinhadas com as diretrizes de saúde no Brasil.",theconversation

Na maioria das vezes, essa transição ocorre sem problemas, mas quando algo dá errado, as consequências podem ser devastadoras.

Estudamos mais de 35 mil bebês nascidos na Suécia entre 1997 e 2012, acompanhando seus prontuários de saúde por até 20 anos. Descobrimos que os bebês com pH do cordão umbilical abaixo de 7,05 (sugerindo que não receberam oxigênio suficiente durante o parto) enfrentaram um risco maior de morte e deficiências nas duas primeiras décadas de vida.

Se a privação de oxigênio (conhecida como “acidemia neonatal”) durar muito tempo, ela pode causar danos duradouros ao cérebro e a outros órgãos - e até mesmo a morte. Em todo o mundo, mais de um milhão de bebês morrem a cada ano devido à privação de oxigênio no nascimento.

Um teste simples e indolor - a amostragem do sangue do cordão umbilical - pode verificar os níveis de ácido (pH) para revelar como o bebê lidou com o nascimento. Um pH baixo no cordão umbilical indica uma escassez significativa de oxigênio durante o nascimento, o que pode levar a uma série de complicações. No entanto, em todo o mundo, os médicos não chegam a um acordo sobre qual valor de pH do cordão umbilical é considerado anormal.

Em países como a Suécia e a Noruega, um pH do cordão umbilical inferior a 7,05 é geralmente considerado anormal, refletindo uma abordagem mais cautelosa, enquanto outros países podem definir o limite de pH em 7,00 ou menos para desencadear uma intervenção médica adicional. Essas diferenças nas diretrizes podem afetar profundamente o momento das intervenções e o tratamento de recém-nascidos que sofrem de acidemia ao nascer.

Em nosso estudo, o risco de paralisia cerebral (um distúrbio que afeta os movimentos e a coordenação) foi quatro vezes maior em bebês nascidos com pH do cordão umbilical abaixo de 7,05 em comparação com bebês nascidos com pH do cordão umbilical acima de 7,05. Da mesma forma, a epilepsia (uma condição neurológica que causa convulsões) foi quase duas vezes mais provável em bebês nascidos com um pH do cordão umbilical de 7,05. O risco de deficiências intelectuais também foi mais comum, mas somente quando o pH do cordão umbilical era mais baixo (pH 6,95).

Nosso estudo estabeleceu uma conexão clara entre acidemia no nascimento e problemas neurológicos de longo prazo. E quanto menor o pH do cordão umbilical, maior o risco.

O cérebro é altamente sensível à flutuação dos níveis de oxigênio no sangue. Os neurônios, as principais células de comunicação do cérebro, são particularmente vulneráveis. Se privadas de oxigênio, estas células podem sofrer danos ou morrer, afetando os movimentos, a memória e a função cognitiva.

As áreas cerebrais normalmente afetadas incluem o córtex motor, que controla o movimento e está ligado à paralisia cerebral; o hipocampo, essencial para a memória e o aprendizado; e os gânglios basais, que regulam o movimento e podem ser danificados em bebês com privação de oxigênio.

Tratamento rápido pode evitar problemas por toda vida

Se houver suspeita de falta de oxigênio em um recém-nascido, a equipe de saúde pode coletar amostras do pH do cordão umbilical imediatamente. Em minutos, eles podem diagnosticar se o pH do cordão umbilical do bebê está anormal, permitindo uma intervenção médica oportuna que pode salvar o bebê de danos cerebrais de longo prazo e até mesmo da morte.

A hipotermia terapêutica, ou terapia de resfriamento, tem se mostrado promissora na redução de danos cerebrais quando aplicada durante as primeiras horas após o nascimento. O resfriamento do bebê ajuda a desacelerar o metabolismo do cérebro, dando-lhe tempo para se recuperar. A equipe médica geralmente resfria o bebê a cerca de 33,5°C por aproximadamente 72 horas antes de aquecê-lo novamente de forma gradual.

Pesquisadores continuam a explorar novos tratamentos para proteger bebês de danos cerebrais de longo prazo.

Reconhecer o efeito dos níveis de oxigênio no nascimento é uma necessidade médica, e um simples exame de sangue pode nos fornecer essa informação.

A coleta de amostras do pH do cordão umbilical deve ser uma rotina em todas as maternidades, pois esse exame fornece um retrato da saúde do bebê ao nascer. Ao melhorar os cuidados com os recém-nascidos e as práticas médicas, podemos ajudar cada criança a ter a chance de uma vida melhor, livre de deficiências evitáveis.",theconversation

We’re going to home in on four pillars that Quanta covers, like math, physics, computer science and biology.

STROGATZ: I think it’s great to single those four areas out because they are very important to us at Quanta and at “The Joy of Why.” There are all kinds of great science outlets where you can learn about applied areas like climate or health, engineering.

LEVIN: Yeah, I sometimes worry that a lot of people are consuming science that really is kind of all about ourselves. How’s it going to make my life better, you know? Extend my life. So it’s a lot of medical and health, but I really sometimes feel the blue skies and the big dreamy ideas, that’s actually really valuable for us and a good way to keep the world in perspective.

STROGATZ: Yeah, we also won’t be covering Sasquatch, or ESP, or alien abductions.

LEVIN: You just lost us half our audience.

STROGATZ: I know! I wish I had their numbers. Their ratings are incredible, those Sasquatch people. But this is actual science we’re going to be doing here.

LEVIN: I really think our audience will find their curiosity sparked. We often ask our guests a question. which actually I’m going to ask you, Steve, which is what brings you joy in your science?

STROGATZ: Well, math generally, but especially how math connects to the real world. I’m what would be called an applied mathematician, and so that means, where’s the hidden math in the phenomena around us, like why are we all just connected by six handshakes? How can we learn about our DNA by thinking about it as if it were a twisted rubber band? So these kinds of ideas, where math connects to everything, especially things that don’t seem overtly mathematical, that, for me, is what makes me want to wake up every day.

How about you, Janna? What would you say is the thing that brings you joy as a scientist, also as a science communicator?

LEVIN: Yeah, it’s not entirely dissimilar. A lot of the work I do is really connected by thinking about space and time. So that could be about the Big Bang or black holes or quantum field theory and extra dimensions. But these are all very mathematical subjects. And I marvel that we can follow the math into making physical discoveries. It still astounds me.

Looking back over last season, what were some of your favorite standout moments?

STROGATZ: Well, there were a couple and for different reasons. A lot of us as scientists just like to do what we’re curious about. So one that I just can’t get past — I love thinking about this, is something that Shai Shaham, a cell biologist who was talking to us about cell death. I asked him something in regard to a comment that Francis Crick of Watson and Crick, DNA fame, had once said that it’s just as easy to work on an important problem as a trivial problem. And does Shai ever think about that when he’s doing his work? Does he try to select problems based on their external importance in some sense?

[music]

Shai Shaham

SHAI SHAHAM: I’ve often thought of that quote in trying to decide what my next goal should be. But I will tell you that, in my opinion, I lack the hubris to decide what’s important and what’s not. And I think science has proven over and over how discoveries that seemed unimportant and fringe at any moment turn out to be all the rage just a couple of decades later. And I just think my imagination, good as it is, is just not good enough to be able to foretell the future like that.

[music]

STROGATZ: And then there was one other moment that caught me off-guard for a different reason: when I was talking to Nigel Goldenfeld, a condensed matter physicist, about magnetic phase transitions and more broadly the question of why we can even do science at all. And it was both hilarious and illuminating. Here’s Nigel on that theme.

[music]

Nigel Goldenfeld

NIGEL GOLDENFELD: So suppose you said to a scientist, “Make a theory for me of a magnet.” So they’d say, “Well, a magnet is made out of atoms.” So in order to understand atoms and how they interact and become magnetic, I need to worry about the electrons in the atoms.

I need to worry about the magnetic movements of those atoms. And so I make a model of the material based on quantum chemistry. Okay. Well, that model is unimaginably complicated.

So then you say, “Let’s simplify it. Let’s just worry about how the electrons move around in the material.” So you go ahead and do that, and you find you’ve got a complicated model of electronic structure. And that model is too hard. So then you say, “Let’s take thermodynamics.”

And that’s a model where you can finally do a calculation. You’ve got one, two, three, four, five models of a model of a model of a model of this material. And at each step along the way, you have made an approximation that would be rejected from every physics journal. Because everybody would say, “That’s approximation you can’t justify, there’s no small quantity, no idea what you’re talking about. How can that possibly work?”

[music]

LEVIN: You know, for me, I was really struck when I was talking to Penny Boston, who’s a microbiologist who studies extremophiles. She was describing these simple organisms that metabolize minerals or just oxygen or just hydrogen. It really made me question what we mean by life.

[music]

LEVIN: Why are caves of particular interest in your area of expertise? What is unique about subterranean microbiology?

Penelope Boston

PENELOPE BOSTON: Yeah, I mean, so I could just regale you for hours, but I will spare you, I’ll just hit on the high points. There are some really clear advantages. One is that you can consider a cave a semi-closed system.

And when you look at the genetics of the organisms that we find there, we find vast biodiversity. And we also find that most of the organisms are not the ones that we find on the surface, even on the surface right over a given cave. So what that says to us is that however organisms get into a cave, they’re immediately subject to really different conditions, and that promotes an evolutionary pace that pushes them in the direction of becoming a very unique little biosphere miniature ecosystem.

And that each cave has the potential for doing that. And so I think of them as little baby planets that we can study.

[music]

LEVIN: Talking to Lenny Suskind also was so much fun. He was talking about his conflict with Stephen Hawking, who was also his friend, and how they had a battle over black holes. And in his book, The Black Hole War, the subtitle was “My Battle With Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics.”

[music]

Lenny Suskind

LEVIN: So the information that fell in, even if the black hole evaporates, it’s like you’re yanking a curtain up, but the stuff is gone and there’s nothing you can do about it. And he fell down on the side of information was lost, but you said wait, there’s no way. Why was it so important to you to say information cannot be lost? What’s so bad about that?

LENNY SUSKIND: Hawking was saying what comes out of the black hole will be absolutely independent of what fell in.

If you follow that line of reasoning, and they ask what it implies, it implies chaos, nothing makes sense anymore. I just felt that couldn’t be right.

LEVIN: How contentious, how heated, did this become, this debate?

SUSKIND: In a personal sense, not at all. Stephen and I were good friends. There were times when my wife and I, and whoever he was with at the time, would have dinner together. He would challenge me. He was 1,000 percent certain of what he was saying. Of course, I was also 1,000 percent certain of what I was saying.

LEVIN: If you don’t mind me quoting you, I believe it was in The Black Hole War, you said Stephen was also a very arrogant man.

And then you said, so was I.

SUSKIND: All physicists who are ambitious and really want to get somewhere in the subject have to have a certain degree of arrogance for sure. You have to believe, not only that the human brain is smart enough to unravel these incredibly sophisticated ideas, you have to believe that your human brain is smart enough to do that, to be able to figure out quantum mechanics, smart enough to be able to figure out how the universe works.

On the other hand, you also have to be very clear about what you don’t know, and what you’re very, very far from. And what you may never know.

[music]

STROGATZ: Another standout moment for a completely different reason was just the shock value of something that Terry Tao said to me. Terry is one of the world’s greatest mathematicians, and I was curious about where does he go when he wants to learn some new math? Here’s what he said.

[music]

Terence Tao

TERENCE TAO: The fact that I can go on Wikipedia or whatever and get started learning a subject, and I can email somebody, and we can collaborate online. If I had to do things old-school, where I could only talk to people in my department and use physical mail for everything else, I could not do the math that I do now.

STROGATZ: Wow, alright. I just have to underline what you just said because I never thought in a million years I was going to hear this. Terry Tao reads Wikipedia to learn math?

TAO: As a starting point. I mean, it’s not always Wikipedia, but just to get the key words, and then I will do a more specialized search of, say, MathSciNet or some other database. But yeah, for the …

STROGATZ: It’s not a criticism. I mean, I do the same thing. That’s just funny. I love hearing that.

TAO: I mean, these tools, you have to be able to vet the output. You know, so I mean, the reason why I can use Wikipedia to do mathematics is because I already know enough mathematics that I can smell if a piece of Wikipedia mathematics is suspicious or not. You know, it may get some sources and one of them is going to be a better source than the other. And I know the authors and I have an idea of which reference is going to be better for me. If I use Wikipedia to learn about a subject that I had no experience in, then I think it would be more of a random variable.

[music]

STROGATZ: So Janna, if you’ll forgive me for saying it, I think of you, in addition to being a great scientist, as a very lyrical and even poetic writer.

LEVIN: That’s very kind.

STROGATZ: But you deserve it! And I would like, putting on your poetry hat for a second, was there any kind of moment in last season where a scientist sort of reached levels of poetry in their explanations to you?

LEVIN: Oh, yeah, there was a really nice moment with Claudia de Rham when she described gravity, which Einstein also famously did, as a state of falling. So she talked about how to understand space-time and geometry as a state of falling and weightlessness, which seems really counter to what we usually think of as gravity, which is kind of a heaviness. I thought that was very poetic and very beautiful and a reminder that these very elegant ideas really do help lead us to discovery. Here’s Claudia actually talking about that.

[music]

Claudia de Rham

CLAUDIA DE RAHM: We experience gravity as, for instance, your chair or the sole of your shoes or anything that holds you on the surface of the Earth.

This is the pressure in which we feel gravity, but the reality is gravity feels nothing. It’s just freedom in some sense. When something falls down and crashes on the floor, if you have a broken leg or a broken vase, you may think of this being gravity, but that’s actually not gravity itself. That’s just the end, the end of the fall, the end of gravity.

The beauty of falling is actually, it’s completely free. You are experiencing gravity in one of its purest possible ways, with nothing stopping you from this experience of complete gravity.

LEVIN: Yeah, the astronauts in the International Space Station are floating, not because they don’t feel gravity, but because they’re falling. They’re falling around the Earth.

DE RAHM: That’s right. Because they’re feeling nothing but gravity. And that’s what allows them to experience it.

[music]

LEVIN: So we got to talk to a lot of pretty amazing people last season. What are you hoping for this season? What are you excited about?

STROGATZ: I am particularly curious these days about machine learning and anything to do with artificial intelligence. You just can’t really get away from it. And I would love to have some of our guests explain to me what’s coming down the road. What are the big puzzles? What are the big opportunities? What’s scary? What about you? Anything that you’re looking forward to?

LEVIN: Yeah, I think, I often seek out kind of the blue skies ideas when life is a little stressful. I find it very soothing that instead of getting into the immediacy and the minutia and the woes in the world, to think about the big ideas. So I’m also interested in hearing how people came to those ideas themselves.

STROGATZ: Right, it’s not just the ideas. We also want to illuminate not just the science, but the scientist, right? Their inner struggles.

LEVIN: It’s a human endeavor. It may be true that we want reproducibility for science, and if Einstein didn’t do it, somebody else would have, but it still was Einstein; these are still the people making these discoveries, and it’s a human endeavor. We can’t forget that part.

STROGATZ: That one is fun for me to ponder, because I often think of Einstein as the one example of someone who, if he hadn’t done it, nobody would have done it.

LEVIN: You know, it might have taken a lot longer. Maybe it would have taken another hundred years. I don’t know. But that’s the really magical aspect of science. We might have gotten there by quantum field theory, instead of the way Einstein got us there. We might not be talking about geometry as much if Einstein hadn’t given us that machinery and that language, but we would have gotten there, to the relativity of space and time.

STROGATZ: Maybe, I don’t know if we’re getting too much into the arts here for a science show. But we did talk a little bit about poetry. And I think there is something poetic about the fact that “The Joy of Why” is produced by Quanta Magazine. And that’s an interesting choice for a name of a science magazine that I feel like has maybe potentially poetic resonance. So as our resident poet. What do you hear poetically in the name Quanta, if anything?

LEVIN: Well, a quanta is an individual corpuscle of something, and so maybe it’s conceptually we’re tackling these individual grand leaps of ideas in the different fields and the different technical subjects.

STROGATZ: Uh huh. So along with this particularity aspect, let me suggest it might also have something to do with photons, that when Einstein and his photoelectric effect gave us the ideas of quanta of light, you could even say Quanta makes a good name for a science magazine because we’re illuminating one particle at a time the whole landscape of science.

So that actually brings us back to how we met. I don’t know if you would remember this. Do you actually remember the first time?

LEVIN: I think so.

STROGATZ: In my memory, it was that I had read your first book, How the Universe Got Its Spots, soon after you were a postdoc. I think you were just beginning as a professor, and we were having an event about science communication, and I was so entranced with your book, and also just your lyrical writing, and I couldn’t wait to meet you.

LEVIN: That was my memory, too, and that is so sweet. I remember, right away we’re talking about writing and math, and writing and math. And I do think that there’s a poetry both in the mathematics and in the written word. Different kinds, but it’s there.

[music]

STROGATZ: It’s our first chance collaborating. We have never written a paper together. And so, for me, personally, it’s a really big thrill to be your partner on this show. And I don’t know what we’re going to end up talking about or learning together, but I can’t wait to find out this season.

LEVIN: Here on “The Joy of Why” from Quanta Magazine.

STROGATZ: Well, I can’t wait. See you soon.

LEVIN: See you soon, Steve.

https://undark.org,Infertility Is a Mental Health Bombshell,https://undark.org/2025/03/13/opinion-infertility-mental-health-bombshell/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","My lower abdomen was covered in yellow bruises from injections I gave myself twice a day. I cried over tiny mishaps: when I couldn’t find my keys, when I spilled coffee grounds, when I realized I’d be late for yet another appointment at the fertility clinic to have my blood drawn and ovaries probed. It felt like every imperfect thing I did reflected my apparent inability to get pregnant.

Last year, I joined the anxious, frustrated club of millions of people who have turned to fertility technology in hopes of having a child. I educated myself in the science of conception, the options available, and the many lifestyle factors that could work for or against me. I spent thousands of dollars, went to countless doctors’ visits for hormone and ovarian follicle tests, and subjected my body to unnatural floods of chemicals and two surgeries because I believed that the prize of becoming “with child” was within easy reach.

Although literature from my fertility clinic acknowledged that in vitro fertilization would be stressful on the body and mind, those words did not prepare me for the toll that all of this would take on my mental health. I also had no idea how isolated I would feel from close friends and family members, who couldn’t possibly understand my struggle.

For two full cycles, I gave my days over to the all-consuming, exorbitantly expensive IVF regimens. Midway through the second round, I felt like I had lost all hope and joy about the possibility that the treatments might actually work. Suddenly, other people’s pregnancy announcements made me sad. I understood more deeply than ever why my clinic has digital reminders and a sign requesting that patients refrain from bringing children to appointments.

In February, the White House issued an executive order that “directs policy recommendations to protect IVF access and aggressively reduce out-of-pocket and health plan costs for such treatments.” If this leads to cheaper fertility care, that would be a huge relief to patients’ bank accounts. But it doesn’t address another burden often interwoven with fertility challenges: mental health.

Fighting back tears on a recent bike ride to the clinic, I thought, “Wouldn’t it be great if there were a person I could talk to at the fertility clinic about my emotional turmoil and traumatic associations with this process?” But I knew there wasn’t. Having any spare time and energy to seek professional counseling seemed impossible.

Those words did not prepare me for the toll that all of this would take on my mental health, and how isolated I would feel from close friends and family members.

To find others going through IVF at the same time, I spent hours on Reddit. I read how other patients went through numerous miscarriages and even more egg retrieval surgeries than I, and still had no luck. I read testimonies from my anonymous IVF siblings who had put their lives on hold in more extreme ways than I — quitting jobs, leaving school, or declining professional opportunities to focus on this hypercontrolled regimen. They postponed vacations and developed negative feelings about their own bodies as they gained weight during hormone injections. Some said IVF had become their entire identity.

Data backs up the mental health burden. A 2016 study led by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, assessed the mental health of fertility patients and found that nearly 57 percent of women and about a third of men had symptoms of clinical depression during at least one check-in point during the 18-month study. What’s more, almost 80 percent of women and more than 60 percent of men reflected clinical anxiety symptoms at one or more assessments.

But almost a decade ago, those numbers weren’t translating into intervention. The same study found that only 21 percent of women and about 11 percent of men said that they had received mental health services during the same 18-month period. Other psychiatric disorders that may be linked to infertility include obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance abuse, and eating disorders. In another study, scientists even found that the psychological burden of infertility was similar to that of cancer and HIV.

Whether stress itself actually produces worse outcomes in terms of live births has been controversial and hard to measure. Yet one study found that interventions to reduce the stress hormone cortisol prior to beginning IVF “could improve treatment outcomes” and another stated that psychological interventions have been associated with “significant increases in pregnancy rates.”

In a perfect world, all fertility practices would have mental health professionals available as a matter of course, in the same building. Bloodwork and ultrasound monitoring appointments could be scheduled immediately before or after talk therapy. In an even more perfect world, the cost of mental health care would be covered.

But there is little regulation around fertility practices in general. Likely, such a world would have to be created by the clinics themselves.

Some fertility practices do have in-house therapists on hand. One of them is Elizabeth Grill, director of psychological services at Weill Cornell Medicine’s Center for Reproductive Medicine in New York. “The number one reason why people drop out of treatment is because of the psychological burden,” she told me in a recent interview. And despite the data showing how much distress IVF patients experience, Grill said there is still a real “disconnect” between patient needs and mental health services that are provided to them.

Grill is also the chair of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association. RESOLVE’s website offers search tools for locating support groups and mental health professionals across the country — though not all therapists in the U.S. accept some, or any, insurance plans.

In a perfect world, all fertility practices would have mental health professionals available as a matter of course, in the same building.

One small but important service that clinics could — and sometimes do — offer struggling patients is a list of local mental health practitioners qualified to address issues relating to infertility, Grill said. The 2016 study found that less than 27 percent of the men and women surveyed reported that a fertility clinic had made information about mental health services available. “Sometimes there’s a learning curve to this where people and centers need to be educated about the importance” of the mental health burden of fertility treatment, Grill said.

It’s also relatively easy to set up support groups for patients to meet and discuss their ups and downs. Mirroring my own experience, Grill noted that “a lot of people feel even more loss in their life around infertility because the best friend that’s been with them through every crisis suddenly doesn’t get this.” Besides on Reddit, I’ve found comfort from friends with whom I wouldn’t otherwise share nitty-gritty details of my fertility treatments because they had either frozen eggs or created children through IVF.

As of this writing, neither of my IVF rounds has led to a successful pregnancy, and I don’t know whether any fertility treatment or technology ever will. There is still a lot of mystery around why some people have a harder time getting pregnant than others. But giving us ways to cope with emotional rollercoasters, vast uncertainties, and disappointment — that should be easily conceivable.
