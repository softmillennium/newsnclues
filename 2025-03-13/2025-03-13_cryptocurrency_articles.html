Bitcoin maximalists like Strategy's Michael Saylor often tout the cryptocurrency as a form of digital gold, a safe haven asset that can protect holders from financial storms. 

Donald Trump's White House has echoed the argument that Bitcoin's scarcity makes it ideal as a store of value.

That narrative has now been challenged — again — after the digital asset's price nosedived alongside tech stocks like Meta, Nvidia, and Elon Musk's Tesla. By contrast, gold has surged to record heights.

In short, Bitcoin is behaving less like digital gold and more like a glorified tech stock, market watchers say.

“If Bitcoin equals ‘digital gold,' then time to act like it. Otherwise, it will reinforce the narrative that it's simply a high beta asset,” said ETF Store President Nate Geraci on X. “Most of crypto equals tech play [in my opinion]. So it currently is and will be caught up in a broader tech sell-off.”

The debate about Bitcoin's role as a safe haven asset comes as it shed 15% of its value over the past month. 

It now trades at roughly $82,000. Some experts even suggest it will plunge as low as its previous March 2024 high of $74,000.

The overall crypto market's value dropped 18% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has dropped 11% in the same period. 

Trump triggered the plunge after instating, retracting, then reinstating, re-retracting, and re-reinstating tariffs against the US' closest trading partners Mexico and Canada. 

The back and forth prompted Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly to describe US trade policy as a “psychodrama.”

This is not the first time Bitcoin has failed to live up to its reputation as a safe haven. During the March 2020 Covid-induced crash, the asset plunged more than 50% in a two-day period.

Still, the digital gold narrative has picked up speed of late. 

The White House referred to Bitcoin's safe haven potential in Trump's executive order to create a national stockpile of the asset. 

“Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve,” it said. 

The argument is that the country will be able to hedge against financial instability by storing up the cryptocurrency. It holds gold and petroleum for the same reason. 

Other top officials, like Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hum a similar tune. 

In December, Powell said, “it's just like gold, only digital.”

Industry heavyweights like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and Euro Pacific chief economist Peter Schiff have echoed that sentiment over the years.

Others adopt a more measured approach. 

In May, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas described Bitcoin as investment hot sauce, something to add to a traditional portfolio made out of stocks and bonds. 

What made it interesting to him, compared with other spicy alternatives, “is this underlying story about hedging the devaluation of the dollar.” 

“To me, Bitcoin is like gold, but as a teenager,” Balchunas told The Block.

However, its recent price action says otherwise — and supporters are getting antsy. 

“Can't act like a high beta asset with every sell-off,” Geraci said.

Bitcoin's (BTC) role in decentralized finance (DeFi) is growing as the world's largest cryptocurrency evolves from more than just a store of value, Binance Research said in a report Thursday.

The Bitcoin network is "evolving into a broader decentralized finance ecosystem with the emergence of Bitcoin DeFi," analyst Moulik Nagesh wrote.

This is a sector that "unlocks bitcoin's capital efficiency" with the use of financial applications focused on lending, staking, stablecoins and decentralized exchanges (DEX's), the report said.

DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without the need for traditional intermediaries.

Binance noted that only ~0.8% of the bitcoin supply is currently being used in DeFi, and this presents a large "untapped opportunity." In fact, last year, Julian Love, a deal analyst at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, said the opportunity could be as much as $1 trillion.

Binance Research report said that Bitcoin needs layer 2s as the network lacks "native programmability," unlike smart contract-based layer 1s. A layer 1 network is the base layer or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s.

While there has been some progress on the development of Bitcoin layer-2 networks, these platforms need greater adoption and liquidity incentives to be able to scale up effectively, Binance Research said.

The network's security model is faced with "long-term sustainability challenges" as block rewards will continue to halve, the report said, thereby reducing miner incentives.

The long-term viability of Bitcoin DeFi is dependent on execution, the further development of layer-2s, and the "ability to align with bitcoin's unique value proposition," the report added.

United States President Donald Trump recently announced the U.S. would establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve of Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, Solana and Cardano. This move, he said, would make the U.S. "the crypto capital of the world."

Once a vocal crypto-skeptic, Trump now frames his support as an embrace of technologies that champion freedom and innovation.

However, the problem with Trump's view is that it assumes crypto will lead to the elimination of financial intermediaries. By replacing trust with transparency, cryptocurrency promises to put individuals in charge of their monetary transactions.

Our research demonstrates that this is only a partial view. In reality, crypto is dependent on social practices behind the technology.

Crypto-believers often blame greedy financiers as the cause of the Great Recession in 2008. But we argue that crypto is not immune to these same risks.

Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital money that trades on a blockchain. A blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that allows users to trade pseudo-anonymously.

Public blockchains operate on a distributed peer-to-peer network. This network provides each user a complete record of transactions that is updated in real time. Users can send digital cash between themselves without relying on a centralized authority.

Since each user has a full record of transactions, the system promises full transparency. But our research demonstrates that public blockchains, and the cryptocurrencies that run on them, do not actually replace trust with transparency.

Speculation, manipulation and market crashes remain very real dangers, regardless of whether the financial system is centralized or decentralized.

We studied the communications between the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, and the early Bitcoin community. We found the development and implementation of cryptocurrencies relies on negotiations between individuals. Who has a final say on which line of code will prevail depends on a social hierarchy dominated by insiders.

Centralization of power in the hands of insiders is still a major issue in the cryptocurrency space. This is particularly an issue for emerging cryptocurrencies like memecoins. Memecoins are a type of cryptocurrency named after internet memes or similar jokes. They draw their value entirely from speculation.

The Trump Organization recently launched memecoins $TRUMP and $MELANIA. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has concluded that memecoins do not qualify as securities, and therefore are outside its regulatory purview. Not only are memecoins risky, but they come with a significant risk of insider trading.

A recent case study on the memecoin $LIBRA shows how influencers, anonymous developers and centralized exchanges facilitate market distortions, often at the expense of retail investors.

When cryptocurrencies are outside the scope of regulation, individuals behind the technology can profit from insider information. This is less of a risk with widely traded cryptocurrencies like Ether and Bitcoin, but investors should be aware that any technology is reliant on the people who design the code and regulate its changes.

Personal views towards privacy, for instance, can impact governance decisions. These beliefs can have important implications for the value and usability of any technology, cryptocurrencies included.

Our research suggests cryptocurrency insiders can artificially inflate the value of their coins by talking them up, effectively creating value out of nothing.

By using economic and accounting language to describe Bitcoin, the early Bitcoin community effectively turned a string of zeroes and ones into something that could be measured, valued and recognized. Economists argue that even fiat currency is backed by a type of belief—trust in institutions.

Bitcoin, too, relies on belief, but a different kind. Its value is based users' collective confidence in the technology and security of the network, a phenomenon known as the network effect. As more people adopt Bitcoin, its perceived value rises, creating a self-sustaining cycle of belief and value based on market demand.

Recently, American stockbroker and anti-crypto advocate Peter Schiff accused Trump of manipulating the cryptocurrency market following the announcement of the strategic crypto reserve. Schiff has called for a congressional investigation into Trump and his team to determine who may have profited from the announcement, which triggered a massive increase in crypto prices.

Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, their values are highly susceptible to herd behavior, and public sentiment has a significant effect on cryptocurrency returns.

Our research and other studies like it have shown that cryptocurrency is subject to important value changes based on announcements by a small group of influential individuals.

We caution anyone interested in investing in crypto to do their homework by examining the underlying economics of a coin, getting to know the team behind it and evaluating their risk tolerance before moving forward.

With thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation, distinguishing between a promising investment, a speculative gamble or even scams is crucial.

Despite the uncertain and unpredictable nature of digital assets, one thing is certain: the conversation around crypto is far from over.

A federal jury in the Northern District of California on Wednesday convicted cryptocurrency entrepreneur Rowland Marcus Andrade of wire fraud and money laundering connected to the sale of a token called AML Bitcoin.



The charges stemmed from an initial coin offering Andrade conducted for AML Bitcoin in 2017 and 2018. Early court filings covered by CoinDesk alleged Andrade, a Texas resident, falsely told investors that AML Bitcoin tokens would ultimately be converted into a tradeable AML Bitcoin currency — a cryptocurrency that never launched and was named to resemble the popular Bitcoin token.



The conviction marks the conclusion of one of the first and longest-running crypto "pump-and-dump" cases to involve U.S. federal prosecutors.



The Department of Justice named famed D.C. lobbyist Jack Abramoff a co-conspirator and he pleaded guilty in 2020, paying more than $50,000 in disgorgement and interest. Abramoff is better known for his involvement in a federal corruption scandal that resulted in his imprisonment and was depicted in the film "Casino Jack."



A statement released by the U.S. Department of Justice accused Andrade of diverting "more than $2 million in proceeds from the sale of AML Bitcoin" and using it on "personal expenses, including the purchase of two properties in Texas and two luxury automobiles."



According to the statement, Andrade also falsely claimed that the Panama Canal Authority was close to permitting AML Bitcoin to be used for ships passing through the Panama Canal when no such agreement existed.



"Fraudsters often tout new and innovative technology in order to raise money from investors. But raising money through lies and misrepresentations is neither new nor innovative. It's unlawful, plain and simple," said Acting United States Attorney Patrick D. Robbins. "If you deceive investors to enrich yourself and spend their money on personal expenses, homes, and property, you will be held to account."



Andrade is scheduled to be sentenced in July. According to the DOJ press release, "he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the wire fraud count and 10 years in prison for the money laundering count, and forfeiture of all property that is traceable to his wire fraud and money laundering violations including property that Andrade bought in Texas."

            At a White House summit last week, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick spoke passionately about the Trump administration's plans to embrace cryptocurrencies, a largely unregulated industry that has historically operated on the fringes of finance.
    


            “Technology is at the foundation of the Trump presidency,” Lutnick said, addressing two dozen crypto CEOs. “We're using the blockchain. We're using bitcoin. We are going to use digital assets to pound forward, and Donald Trump is leading the way.”
    


            The summit was remarkable in part because of the shift in tone from the White House, which under previous administrations, including Trump 1.0, largely kept crypto companies and their volatile digital tokens sidelined. Suddenly, with President Donald Trump's re-election, the government is not only open to the industry — it's actively cheering for it.
    


            But Lutnick's longtime industry ties have come under scrutiny as he pushes the Trump administration's pro-crypto priorities, many of which have questionable benefits for anyone besides existing crypto holders.
    


            Among those existing holders is Cantor Fitzgerald, the family-run Wall Street firm Lutnick headed for decades before handing the reins this year to his 27-year-old son, Brandon.
    


            Cantor Fitzgerald is the primary banking partner for Tether, a controversial stablecoin issuer whose token of the same name is by far the most heavily traded digital asset.

            And the firm is expanding its crypto holdings. On Tuesday, Cantor Fitzgerald announced it was setting up a new bitcoin financing business to provide leverage to institutional investors holding the asset.
    


            The firm also recently acquired a stake — now valued at more than $1.58 billion — in MicroStrategy, the biggest corporate holder of bitcoin on the planet, according to a new report from Accountable.US, a progressive government watchdog group, that was shared exclusively with CNN. Cantor's crypto holdings also include more than $87 million in iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.
    


            It's not clear whether Lutnick personally holds crypto assets.
    


            His 92-page financial disclosure listed holdings in more than 800 entities — all of which he pledged to sell within 90 days of being confirmed, in compliance with conflict-of-interest laws.
    


            It's not clear what the status of that process is.
    


            The Commerce Department didn't respond to multiple requests for comment. Cantor Fitzgerald also didn't respond to a request for comment.
    


            Lutnick's crypto promotion while in office falls into an ethical gray area, according to experts who spoke with CNN.
    


            “He ought to stay out of anything that Cantor Fitzgerald is doing and let other people handle that at the Commerce Department,” said Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush. “Now, I'm going to tell you: There's no law that requires him to do that.”
    


            By putting Cantor Fitzgerald in his adult son's control, Lutnick complied with conflict-of-interest laws that compel Cabinet members to divest certain holdings. Under the law, “divest” could include selling the assets, putting them in a trust or gifting them to a family member — excluding spouses or children under 18.
    


            “The law only requires you to disclose and to divest,” said Hui Chen, an anti-corruption expert and former federal prosecutor who resigned from the Justice Department under Trump's first administration. “But that doesn't mean you can't shape things for the long run that ultimately will benefit you.”
    


            That issue is hardly unique to the Trump administration, Chen notes. “But this administration has certainly posed a lot of conflict questions.”
    


            Despite Trump's populist messaging on the campaign trail, his administration is one of the wealthiest in US history, with more than a dozen billionaires and mega-millionaires on staff.
    


            “Having a lot of billionaires who are closely tied to what they'll be regulating raises a lot of questions,” said Jordan Libowitz, the vice president for communications at the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington or CREW. “And they have been, for the most part, unclear on exactly what they'll be doing in terms of divestment and recusal.”
    


            Cantor Fitzgerald's $1.5 billion stake in MicroStrategy, which last month renamed itself Strategy, is a bitcoin proxy holding — a popular way for mainstream investors to ride the crypto wave without the logistical and security headaches of actually holding digital assets.
    


            Strategy's founder, Michael Saylor, was one of about two dozen crypto leaders to attend the White House summit, and he is one of bitcoin's most vocal evangelists. For the past five years, Saylor's software company has amassed a roughly $40 billion stockpile of bitcoin — an estimated 2% of all bitcoin in circulation.

            Strategy's stock trades in lock step with bitcoin. In announcing the company's new name and sharpened focus on the asset, Saylor declared: “We are a bitcoin treasury company.”
    


            Shares shot up more than 10% earlier this month after President Trump announced plans on March 2 for a “crypto reserve” that would include bitcoin and other tokens.
    


            But that initial burst in value quickly faded amid industry hand-wringing over the makeup of the planned reserve.
    


            As prices slumped, Lutnick spoke to the media to clarify that bitcoin would have a unique status in the reserve once it was formally announced. It would be a bitcoin reserve, not a grab bag of crypto tokens — an important distinction for investors who view bitcoin as a kind of digital gold.
    


            “A bitcoin strategic reserve is something the President's interested in … and I think you're going to see it executed (at the summit)” Lutnick told Pavlovic Today on March 5, two days before the crypto summit. “So bitcoin is one thing, and then the other currencies, the other crypto tokens, I think, will be treated differently — positively, but differently.”
    


            Sure enough, the following day, Trump signed an executive order establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” along with a stockpile of other digital assets. Bitcoin, which is prone to volatile trading, went up slightly in response.
    


            The digital asset, in step with financial markets, soared to record highs after Trump's re-election but has in recent weeks struggled to shake off anxieties about the president's ever-shifting trade policy — for which Lutnick is also a top spokesman.
    


            Under Trump's executive order, the United States would essentially consolidate all the bitcoin it has seized through criminal and civil forfeitures and hold it as a reserve asset, similar to the way gold and petroleum are stockpiled, as a hedge against future financial instability.
    


            This is a controversial idea among economists, lawmakers and even some pro-crypto analysts.
    


            Critics question the wisdom of linking the full faith and credit of the US government to a purely speculative, highly volatile asset. They argue that the reserve is little more than a scheme to backstop the value of bitcoin, thereby juicing the portfolios of early investors.
    


            “Who does having a strategic crypto reserve benefit? It's not your everyday Americans, right? It benefits these guys,” Libowitz said, referring to current bitcoin holders.
    


            Of course, with any innovation, early investors are poised to profit, Chen notes. But the question around bitcoin is more nuanced, given its lack of regulation and unproven benefits.
    


            “I think the question is: How robust is the evaluation about the risk to the government when it puts its weight around this form of currency? … Who is doing that analysis? Are the people doing that analysis unbiased?” she said.
    


            A White House official didn't respond to specific questions about a risk assessment, telling CNN in an email that the bitcoin reserve is the best way to protect the digital assets already in the government's possession.
    


            The Accountable.US report found that at least four senior Trump officials disclosed total ownership of up to $7.7 million in cryptos including bitcoin, ether and solana, all of which spiked when Trump announced a crypto reserve plan on March 2. That surge would have boosted these officials' investments by as much as $800,000, according to the report.
    


            Two senior Trump officials, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, have pledged to divest up to $1 million in crypto investments, but, according to the report, they have yet to file certifications showing that they have unloaded these currencies. (Both of their ethics pledges state they will divest by early to mid-April).
    


            A Treasury spokesperson told CNN in an email Wednesday that “the secretary has already divested of this Bitcoin Trust” and that “he will file his certificate of compliance with the Office of Government Ethics by the required deadline.”

            A spokesperson for Gabbard's office told CNN the director is committed to her pledge to divest before her April 15 deadline.
    


            President Trump himself is a recent convert to the crypto world.
    


            The first family are direct beneficiaries of World Liberty Financial and at least two memecoins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA, that have raised concerns across the political spectrum about the potential for corruption. By its nature, crypto offers a particularly easy way to, anonymously or otherwise, funnel money into entities that could potentially enrich the president and his family.
    


            Those concerns escalated late last month when the Securities and Exchange Commission, America's top financial regulator, said it would no longer pursue its civil fraud case against crypto mogul Justin Sun.
    


            Before the SEC put its case on hold, Sun had boasted on social media that he'd dropped $75 million on World Liberty tokens — an investment that could set the Trump family up to eventually collect tens of millions of dollars. (The SEC has declined to comment on the case.)
    


            “This is, I guess, going to be the new approach — hands off crypto, not enforcing fraud … and I don't think it's going to end well,” Painter, the law professor, told CNN at the time. “The SEC is going to back off — because that's what the Trump administration wants — on whatever enforcement they are able to do. I think it's a very worrisome situation.”

Oops, something went wrong

Some cryptocurrency investors worry about data security in the future. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) owners often tout the largest coin's unchanging qualities as a major selling point. But if Bitcoin's technical platform never changes, how can it meet unexpected challenges and adapt to new security threats? In particular, won't Bitcoin's encryption soon crumble under an assault from quantum computing systems?

So there's something you should know before you write off Bitcoin entirely, or dive into it head first. Bitcoin can have the system stability cake and eat incoming threats too.

Bitcoin is indeed changing over time, and should be safe from quantum computing attacks in the long run. It's just very unlikely to make sudden turns into dangerous or economically unsound moves, such as changing its inflation-proof coin-minting process.

Quantum computers should eventually disrupt many industries. A powerful system of this type is perfect for finding patterns in seemingly random data. They will crack the genetic code of genetic diseases, provide the most accurate weather forecasts ever, and bring clarity to the chaos of financial markets.

And of course, they will be able to crack the encryption algorithms at the heart of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

If and when that happens, that must be the end of Bitcoin as you know it. Scoundrels and miscreants will be able to change, delete, or insert data into Bitcoin's blockchain ledger, moving billion-dollar fortunes with the click of a quantum-powered mouse.

This wouldn't be such a scary situation if Bitcoin's technology wasn't so unchangeable. You often hear crypto bulls touting the firm cap of 21 million Bitcoins as an immovable guard against inflation. Once the last fraction of the 21-millionth digital coin has been minted, there simply won't be any more production. With 19.83 million Bitcoin already created, that's 94.4% of all Bitcoin that ever will exist.

So Bitcoin isn't changing. When the bad actors finally get their hands on game-changing quantum computers, Bitcoin's data security must fall.

The end.

Hold your horses, dear investor.

The computing platform behind Bitcoin can indeed change over time. The Bitcoin Core software that manages the blockchain ledger and the Bitcoin mining procedure is up to version 28.1 these days. The latest update fixed a few bugs and added some developer-friendly features. It was released on October 2, 2024, to be followed by a more substantial "major version" in the spring of 2025.

These changes could indeed involve very important features and software bits, including the limit of 21 million coins and the encryptions methods in use.

And there are already encryption methods that are hard to crack with quantum computing systems. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the first federal standards for quantum-hardened encryption in 2022. Development efforts toward this goal started in 2016. IBM (NYSE: IBM) included these quantum-resistant algorithms in the z16 mainframe systems the same year, and will make these encryption solutions mandatory over time. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is quietly rolling out data security with quantum-safe algorithms, too.

There's absolutely no reason to believe that the Bitcoin developer community will let the whole system run into quantum-based hacking issues. Long before quantum computers grow powerful enough to pose a real threat, the old-school SHA-256 hash function will be replaced by a quantum-safe alternative.

The key thing to remember is that updates only happen with a proper majority approval. More than half of the systems running the Bitcoin blockchain need to install the new version in order to achieve consensus on approving each transaction on the public ledger. A so-called 51% attack is possible, but only if you control more than half of the world's Bitcoin mining power -- a tall order even for trillion-dollar tech giants or governments. And before that, every software update goes through a meticulous process of planning, development, testing, and installation.

And it would not be in the community's best interest to adopt software versions with unwanted features. The 21-million coin cap is safe, because upping that limit would immediately lower the value of the Bitcoin holdings and mining systems that made it possible to change that particular number.

So Bitcoin developers have the freedom to tackle technical challenges, including the future threat of hackers with quantum computers. The system is also sophisticated enough to resist unwanted software changes. No project, system, or organization is ever 100% safe against every threat, and that's only more true in the unfamiliar cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin investors shouldn't lose sleep over this particular issue, though.

Quantum computers won't break the Bitcoin platform any time soon, and they're still many years away from posing a serious threat. That's more than enough time to dodge the entire problem with the appropriate software tweaks.

The Central Bank of Russia has proposed restricting cryptocurrency transactions to "particularly qualified investors" who possess over RUB 100 million (US$1.1 million) in securities or have earned more than RUB 50 million (US$560,000) per year.

Source: The Moscow Times

Details: For other citizens, cryptocurrency transactions may be prohibited, with penalties introduced for violations. 

The regulator reaffirmed that "the Central Bank of Russia still does not consider cryptocurrency as a means of payment". It also plans to ban crypto transactions between Russian residents and impose regulatory requirements on financial institutions seeking to invest in digital assets.

Since 1 September 2024, Russia has allowed international settlements in cryptocurrency under an experimental legal framework. However, in late November, Vladimir Putin signed a law recognising digital currencies as taxable property.

Additionally, Russia legalised cryptocurrency mining on 1 November 2024, with new tax regulations for miners taking effect in 2025. However, the government has banned mining in the North Caucasus republics and occupied territories of Ukraine.

Background: Stablecoin issuer Tether recently froze RUB 2.5 billion (US$28 million) worth of USDT on the Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex, forcing the platform to suspend operations.

The "Wall Street Journal" reports this, citing sources familiar with the negotiations.

Representatives of the family of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, have begun talks to acquire a stake in the U.S. arm of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the negotiations. The move could tie Trump to the company, which pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering violations in 2023.

According to the newspaper, the founder of Binance Changpeng Zhao, who served four months in prison after pleading guilty in court, is reportedly seeking a pardon from the Trump administration. Zhao, who remains Binance's largest shareholder, is said to have pushed the deal as part of a strategy to re-enter the U.S. market. It's unclear what form the Trump family's eventual participation might take, or whether the deal is contingent on Zhao being pardoned. One possibility is that the investment could be made through World Liberty Financial, a Trump-backed cryptocurrency firm launched last September.

The talks reportedly began after Trump's election victory and involved a working group within Binance led by current CEO Richard Teng. The company's officials reportedly sought to develop a plan to overcome legal hurdles related to Zhao's conviction, which could impede operations in the United States and other regulated markets, such as the European Union. Sources cited by the “Wall Street Journal” indicate that Steve Witkoff, a longtime friend of Trump and the US administration's negotiator for the Middle East and the conflict in Ukraine, would have participated in the talks for a deal with Binance. A White House official, however, denied Witkoff's involvement, specifying that the latter is proceeding with the sale of his business interests. In 2023, Binance agreed to pay $4,3 billion in fines to settle a dispute with U.S. authorities, who accused the platform of facilitating transactions with sanctioned groups, including Hamas and the Islamic State, and of circumventing U.S. anti-money laundering regulations.

As part of the deal, Zhao stepped down as CEO, but retained controlling interest in the company. After his release from prison last September, Zhao moved to Abu Dhabi. The talks between Binance and Trump's family are part of a broader push by the U.S. president to embrace the cryptocurrency industry. Since taking office, Trump has signed a series of industry-friendly executive orders and promoted initiatives such as the White House Crypto Summit, aimed at strengthening the role of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. economy.

Cabinet members' Bitcoin holdings spark debate over ethics and influence in Trump's pro-crypto governance approach.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Several members of Donald Trump's cabinet have significant Bitcoin holdings, with their combined investments valued in the millions, according to their financial disclosure reports.

These disclosures show that cabinet members have gained exposure to Bitcoin through direct purchases on crypto exchanges and investment vehicles like exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

The presence of crypto-friendly figures in the administration aligns with Trump's goal of positioning the US as a dominant force in the digital asset industry.

During this short term of his presidency, Trump has introduced several policies, including plans for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, to strengthen America's foothold in the sector.

Kennedy holds the largest Bitcoin investment among cabinet officials, reporting a Fidelity crypto account valued between $1 million and $5 million.

He has been vocal about his support for Bitcoin, previously stating that a significant portion of his personal wealth is in the asset.

Kennedy previously advocated for the US Treasury to acquire Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, proposing a strategy to accumulate 550 BTC daily until the nation holds 4 million BTC in reserve.

Bessent's financial report lists BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF investment worth between $250,001 and $500,000 in his portfolio.

However, as outlined in his ethics agreement, he has agreed to divest from these holdings within 90 days of his confirmation.

In past statements, Bessent described Bitcoin as an investment option for younger, disillusioned investors in the traditional financial system.

Duffy disclosed multiple Bitcoin investments, including direct holdings valued between $250,001 and $500,000. He also stated that he has Bitcoin stored in a Gemini wallet within the same value range.

Additionally, he has a $50,001 and $100,000 stake in the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund.

These government officials' substantial Bitcoin holdings raise ethics concerns, considering the Trump administration's pro-crypto approach to governance.

US lawmaker Elizabeth Warren recently warned that the Trump administration's “actions have the potential to benefit billionaire investors, Trump Administration insiders, and speculators at the expense of middle-class families.”

Oops, something went wrong

Warren Buffett is famous for his patience, as well as his sharp focus on finding investments that are priced at the right valuation, and equipped to continue gaining in value for years and years. Something he isn't as famous for is that he detests all forms of cryptocurrency, even Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).

But that doesn't mean you can't apply some of his investment principles to evaluating cryptocurrency investments. In fact, it's probably a smart idea to take his perspective, at least with some assets. Here's what you'll need to do to get a more Buffett-esque twist when you're looking at crypto.

Many of Buffett's best investments have been a feature of his portfolio for many years. Take Coca-Cola, for example, which he bought in 1998, or American Express, which he first purchased in 1991. There aren't any cryptocurrencies with that kind of vintage of being in existence. The closest would be Bitcoin, which was launched in 2009.

The point of Buffett holding investments for so long is that it allows the company's competitive advantages to play out and increase the stock's value as it inevitably wins against its competitors over time. That way, he gets the benefit of compounding growth, and someone else is doing the work each day to make it happen.

You can use this same idea very easily: Which cryptocurrencies, if any, have drivers that'll sustain their growth for years to come? As mentioned before, the only coin that's been proven to do that over any period of time that's sufficiently long to be Buffett-approved is Bitcoin. Others might achieve this eventually, but for now, it's the only one with enough of a history, and it's the only one with supply dynamics that are likely to continue forcing its price upward over the long term.

Buffett is a stickler for buying stocks at an appropriate valuation.

In crypto, this equates to not buying assets when everyone is talking about them and sentiment is high. There is minimal focus on the underlying investment thesis and more focus on price action. It's rarely a good deal to buy coins that are actively being bid up.

Instead, take Buffett's approach. You don't need to try to time the market. You just need to make sure that you're not buying at the points of a coin's life when there's a baked-in hype tax. If there's a real mechanism by which the coin can generate value over the long term, and not just hype, it'll recover from any lows that its price hits anyway.

So be patient and invest slowly, preferably while prices are nowhere near their recent highs. For Bitcoin, a perfect example would be buying in early 2023, right after the bear market.

Take a look at this chart:

It's fine to buy as prices are rising, as long as you're diligent about dollar-cost averaging (DCAing) when prices are falling too. It's more important to be invested for the long haul than it is to nail the perfect dirt-cheap valuation entry that Buffett tries to do with stocks. The science of crypto valuation isn't nearly as mature as stock valuation, so aim for being in the right ballpark rather than hitting the bullseye.

Buffett has a lot of different holdings. But he doesn't buy stocks every day. He screens annual reports, calculates valuations, determines if there's an asset worth owning, and then patiently waits for the opportunity to purchase it at his preferred price. That means doing nothing most of the time. And it means not buying something that looks juicy until he sees signs that the fruit is actually ripe.

You should be taking a similar approach with cryptocurrencies. There is no rush to buy anything that is worth holding for more than a few years. Today may not be the right day to invest in something, given your capital, your portfolio's positioning, and your current level of risk exposure. The more deliberate you can be, the better your results will be.

Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you'll want to hear this.

On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you're worried you've already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it's too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

Nvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you'd have $282,016!*

Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you'd have $41,869!*

Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you'd have $482,720!*

Right now, we're issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

03/13 update below. This post was originally published on March 11

Bitcoin and crypto prices have moved sharply lower, following stock markets, as fears swirl the bitcoin price could be teetering on the verge of a major crash.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has dropped under $80,000 per bitcoin, dragging down the wider crypto market that's now erased $1 trillion of value in just a month (even as bullish traders bet on a U.S. president Donald Trump “game-changer”).

Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, the chief executive of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock has warned Trump's trade policies will stoke inflation—pouring cold water on hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates through 2025.

"I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic—and I'm not saying that's a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me—that it's going to have elevated inflation," BlackRock's Larry Fink told CeraWeek conference attendees, it was reported by Reuters.

03/13 update: U.S. inflation has slowed to 2.8% in February from a year earlier, boosting the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates but failing to offset fears that U.S. president Donald Trump's global tariff trade war will push up prices through 2025. 

The latest consumer price index (CPI) reading came in below January's 3% and the 2.9% expected by economists, according to a Reuters poll.

“Today's lower-than-expected CPI should be bullish, signaling faster rate cuts, but crypto hasn't reacted strongly," Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, said in emailed comments. 

"Weeks of market fear require more than a single good print to regain confidence. The real issue is Trump's aggressive tariffs, which risk making inflation stickier while also crashing markets and triggering layoffs, particularly by the Doge department of government efficiency. This puts the Fed in a bind: High inflation from tariffs makes rate cuts harder. Market crashes and job losses pressure the Fed to cut rates sooner. Cutting too early could reignite inflation, making future policy tougher. Stocks are bouncing back, but crypto remains sluggish. Investors want stronger support from the White House or Fed, especially after last week's crypto summit failed to reassure markets. Until clearer signals emerge, fear and uncertainty will weigh on crypto market sentiment."

Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs economists have upped their odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 15% to 20%, pointing to Trump's economic policies as the “key risk." Yardeni Research economists have also raised their recession odds, increasing them from 20% to 35% due to "Trump 2.0's head-spinning barrage of executives orders, firings, and tariffs."

Last week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the Fed is in no rush to cut rates, with the labor market still strong and inflation on a bumpy path toward its 2% goal.

The CME FedWatch Tool shows the market is heavily betting the Fed leaves rates on hold at its March meeting next week but is split over whether rates will be cut in May.

On Wednesday, the latest U.S. inflation data in the form of the consumer price index (CPI) will drop, with consumer prices expected to have ticked up in February, according to Bloomberg, highlighting the Fed's slow progress on battling inflation and potentially raising the specter of stagflation—characterized by an economic slowdown coupled with spiraling price rises.

"This market downturn is largely driven by broader economic concerns, including fears of a U.S. recession and persistent inflation," Sean Dawson, head of research at decentralized options trading platform Derive.xyz, said in emailed comments.

“The market is facing significant challenges as the macroeconomic environment worsens, and crypto assets are no exception. With bearish sentiment building, traders are turning to downside hedging strategies, especially as volatility surges across both traditional and crypto markets. The coming weeks will be critical for assessing how the broader economic situation impacts digital asset prices and trading behavior."</p>

CONVERGE LIVE - Singapore, March 12-13 2025 - Request invitation

The CEO of crypto exchange Binance said he expects U.S. President Trump's "pro-crypto" legislation in the U.S. to spur regulators in other parts of the world to follow suit.

"We have moved from a period where there's big regulatory uncertainty and in many sense, some regulatory hostility towards the industry, to one where the largest economy of the world said 'we want to embrace crypto,'" Binance CEO Richard Teng told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal at CONVERGE LIVE in Singapore on Thursday. 

Under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, regulators cracked down on the industry in an effort to protect Americans from fraud and money laundering.

"[If] you ask anybody in the crypto industry, people prefer the current administration compared to the last one," Teng said.

Chao Deng, CEO of crypto fund manager HashKey Capital, who spoke alongside Teng at the CONVERGE event, shared that view, saying that under Trump, "the momentum is building, institutional [and] retail adoption [of crypto assets] is immense." 

The comments came after Trump pressed ahead with an executive order to establish a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies for the U.S. using digital assets seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases. 

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that in addition to Bitcoin, the strategic reserve would include ether, XRP, Solana's SOL token, and Cardano's ADA coin.

The Binance CEO described the U.S. crypto reserve as a "landmark" issue. "The messaging is the largest government … the biggest capital market in the world is now holding Bitcoin as part of the reserve, [that'll] cause many other governments to think through the issue, to sit up to say, should we start doing allocation into crypto and bitcoin?"

Bitcoin prices have fallen since Trump's announcement of a strategic crypto reserve as details of the plan fell short of expectations. Investor enthusiasm toward assets perceived to be risky has also softened more broadly due to concerns over the impact of Trump's tariff plans.

Teng downplayed the recent pullback in crypto markets as a "tactical retreat," as — like any other asset class — it is not "immune" to macroeconomic situations. Nonetheless, Washington's embrace of the digital assets and Trump's nomination of several crypto-friendly legislators will provide "strong" long-term drivers, he said.  

Since his victory in November, Trump has focused on appointing government leaders who support the cryptocurrency sector. Venture capitalist David Sacks was tapped by Trump to be the White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar.

According to Teng, during the last administration, you had "Operation Choke Point 2.0" in progress — an alleged effort by regulators during the Biden presidency to pressure banks into severing ties with crypto. CNBC was unable to verify these claims.

Teng also said the industry faced "regulation via enforcement," which made it extremely tough for it to grow. 

Hashkey Capital's Deng agreed that a return of banking services for crypto companies in the U.S. is one of the most important changes to come from the election. 

"They encourage and they allow banks to be involved with crypto. This is a very huge step for the crypto and Web3 industry," he said, adding that banks will now feel more comfortable working with crypto-related clients.

Authorities in India have arrested a cryptocurrency exchange administrator wanted by the US for allegedly helping cybercriminals launder money and violate sanctions. 

Aleksej Besciokov, a Lithuanian citizen and Russian resident, was arrested in the southern state of Kerala on Tuesday, India's top investigative agency said.

According to the US Justice Department (DOJ), he was one of the administrators of Garantex, a Russian cryptocurrency exchange, and was responsible for reviewing and approving its transactions.

Besciokov is in custody and has not yet made a statement. Garantex could not immediately be reached for comment. 

Besciokov was "residing in Russia", according to DOJ's recently-released indictment, and it is unclear when and why he came to India. 

India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said in a statement that it issued a provisional arrest warrant against him at Washington's request. 

Besciokov will now be produced in a court in Delhi, it said. It is not clear when he will be extradited to the US. 

The United States, in coordination with Germany and Finland, had taken down the online infrastructure used by Garantex, the DOJ said last week. 

It added that Garantex processed at least $96bn (£74.10bn) in cryptocurrency transactions since 2019 and that it allegedly received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds, which were then used to "facilitate several crimes", including hacking, ransomware, terrorism and drug trafficking. 

The DOJ also accused the Lithuanian national of violating sanctions and operating an "unlicensed money transmitting business". 

Last week, US officials charged Besciokov along with the exchange's Russian co-founder Aleksandr Mira Serda with money laundering.

Garantex was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in 2022. 

But soon after, Besciokov and other administrators "redesigned" its operations to "evade sanctions" and induce American businesses into working with them, DOJ said.

US authorities have alleged that the Garantex cryptocurrency exchange had been used to process at least $152.5 billion in funds since 2019, which also allowed international criminal organisations to launder money. (Reuters: Dado Ruvic)

Indian intelligence authorities have arrested a Russian resident the US Justice Department has accused of money laundering.

US law enforcement says Aleksej Besciokov and another Russian national operated a $152.5 billion cryptocurrency exchange that helped criminal entities like terrorist organisations to launder funds.

After Mr Besciokov 's arrest in the Indian state of Kerala, Washington is expected to pursue his extradition to the US.

India's top crime fighting bureau says its authorities have arrested a cryptocurrency exchange administrator accused by the United States of money laundering conspiracy and violating sanctions.

The US, Germany and Finland took down the online infrastructure used by the Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex, the US Justice Department said in a statement last week, adding that two administrators of the exchange were charged.

One of those administrators was 46-year-old Aleksej Besciokov, a Russian resident and Lithuanian national who was charged with money laundering and also faced accusations of violating sanctions and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, the Justice Department said on Friday.

The US agency also said that another 40-year-old Russian national and United Arab Emirates resident, Aleksandr Mira Serda, was also charged with money laundering and conspiracy.

"According to court documents, between 2019 and 2025, Besciokov and Mira Serda controlled and operated Garantex," the US Justice Department said in the statement last week.

"Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds and was used to facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to US victims.

"According to the indictment, Besciokov and Mira Serda knew that criminal proceeds were being laundered through Garantex and took steps to conceal the facilitation of illegal activities on its platform.

Mr Besciokov was arrested in the southern Indian state of Kerala on Wednesday, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said, adding that he was wanted by US authorities. 

The CBI said that at Washington's request, India's foreign ministry had a provisional arrest warrant issued.

It also said that Mr Besciokov was planning to flee India, but it was not immediately clear why he was in the country. Washington is expected to pursue Mr Besciokov's extradition.

The ACCC will increase its scrutiny of Australia's supermarkets, retailers, airlines and essential services, and its chair has voiced concerns there could be an uptick in financial scams as US President Donald Trump relaxes cryptocurrency regulations.

"I can confirm Aleksej Besciokov, one of the administrators of Garantex, was arrested in India at the request of the United States," a US Justice Department spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday local time.

The department also said last week that on March 6, US law enforcement including the country's Secret Service seized three website domains that were being used to support Garantex's operations.

"The seizure of these domains will prevent these sites from being used for money laundering and additional crimes," the department's statement said.

"Individuals visiting those sites now will see a message indicating that the site has been seized by law enforcement.

"US law authorities have separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex's servers, including customer and accounting databases. In addition, US law enforcement has also frozen over $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex's money laundering activities."

The US Justice Department says charges of conspiracy and money laundering carry maximum jail term penalties of 20 years, while the charge of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business carries a maximum five-year jail term.

Ethereum (ETH) traded around $1,860 in the Asian session on Thursday as its price remained largely subdued by bearish sentiment weighing on the general crypto market. However, expectations surrounding the potential approval of staking within US spot Ethereum ETFs could lift the top altcoin out of its recent weak performance.

The SEC acknowledged it has received Fidelity's proposal to allow staking within its spot Ethereum ETF (FETH). However, it's unlikely the agency will decide on the proposal soon, considering it recently postponed deciding on several crypto ETF applications.

The SEC postponed making decisions on Dogecoin, Solana and XRP ETF applications on Tuesday. The ETF Store president Nate Geraci suggested it is due process considering Paul Atkins, Trump's pick to chair the agency, has yet to get Senate approval.

Grayscale and 21Shares have also filed to allow staking within their spot Ethereum ETFs.

Meanwhile, Ethereum's next technical upgrade, Pectra, which will bring several UX improvement features to its blockchain, is getting closer after finalizing on testnets Holesky and Sepolia. Users now await the mainnet upgrade, and many anticipate it could mark a turnaround in ETH's price trajectory, which has severely underperformed Bitcoin and Solana.

"Improved tech does not distract from the overarching theme over the last two years – ETH's underperformance," noted K33 Research analysts in a Wednesday report.

"There are, however, potential bullish catalysts such as the incorporation of staking rewards into US spot ETH ETFs [...] This, more than technical upgrades, could be the necessary trigger for some ETH momentum and enable it to regain favor with market participants," they added.

Standard Chartered analysts have predicted that staking within Ethereum ETFs could drive ETH's price above $14,000 by year-end.

Ethereum saw $60.98 million in futures liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of long and short liquidations was $34.10 million and $26.88 million, respectively.

ETH appears to lack directional bias as bulls and bears struggle to gain hold of prices since it bounced off the $1,750 support. The top altcoin has to overcome the emerging resistance near $1,960 and surpass a key descending trendline resistance to strengthen the quest to recover $2,200.

However, a sustained consolidation around $1,900 and $2,000 could establish the range as a key resistance.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) are close to their oversold region, indicating dominant bearish momentum.

A daily candlestick close below $1,500 will invalidate the consolidation thesis and send ETH toward $1,000.

After the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, Ethereum users are looking towards the Pectra upgrade slated for early 2025. The upgrade will come in two phases, featuring improved wallet experience, an upgrade to the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), PeerDAS for scaling L2s, improvement of blob capacity, etc.

Forks are upgrades or changes to the codebase/architecture of a blockchain network. Considering blockchain networks have no central governance, forks are only carried out after developers and validators reach a consensus. Hard forks are substantial permanent changes in a blockchain protocol that create two parallel chains – one with the old rules and the new with the implemented changes. Developers can either upgrade their software to build on the new chain or remain on the old chain as a separate network. During a hard fork, users receive an equivalent amount of their tokens on the new blockchain network 1:1. Soft forks, on the other hand, are subtle changes on a blockchain network that are backwards-compatible, meaning the network still operates as a single entity even when some developers don't implement the new changes.

Famously scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 22 minutes, Ethereum improvement proposal EIP-7702 is an advanced way of marrying EIP-3074 and ERC-4337 to unlock massive adoption for Ethereum's smart wallet functionality. Slated to go live in the upcoming Pectra upgrade, EIP-7702 will implement an advanced version of account abstraction enabling features like batching that allows users to pay a one-off transaction fee for multiple actions, sponsorship to enable an account pay gas fees for other users and wallet recovery options if users misplace their seed phrase.

Layer 2 is a collective term for protocols that aim to scale Ethereum by processing batches of transactions off the Mainnet. After performing a series of mathematical computations to ensure their validity, these L2s send a compressed version of the transactions back to the Mainnet for final processing. As a result, Layer 2 networks reduce transaction fees and enhance the Mainnet's speed while reaping its security. Think of them like several personal assistants that help their boss to process a series of paperworks. These assistants send a summarised version of the paperworks to the boss who confirms and signs on them.

Layer 3 solutions are application-specific blockchains built upon existing Layer 2 networks to offer high scalability and interoperability. For example, an L3 can focus on tackling privacy, increased scalability, gaming, or some complex functionality while still ultimately deriving security from the Layer 1.

                    A Lithuanian national Aleksej Besciokov, wanted by the U.S., arrested in a coordinated operation between the CBI and Kerala Police.

Indian authorities arrested at Washington's request a cryptocurrency exchange administrator accused of money laundering conspiracy and violating sanctions, India's top crime fighting bureau said on Wednesday (March 12, 2025).

The United States, Germany and Finland took down the online infrastructure used by the Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex, the U.S. Justice Department said last week, adding that two administrators of the exchange were charged.

One of those administrators was Aleksej Besciokov, a Russian resident and Lithuanian national who was charged with money laundering and also faced accusations of violating sanctions and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, the Justice Department said on Friday.

Besciokov was arrested in Kerala, India's Central Bureau of Investigation said, adding he was wanted by U.S. authorities. The CBI said that at Washington's request, India's Foreign Ministry had a provisional arrest warrant issued.

It added Besciokov was planning to flee India. It was not immediately clear why he was in India. Washington is expected to pursue Besciokov's extradition. His representative could not immediately be reached.

"I can confirm Aleksej Besciokov, one of the administrators of Garantex, was arrested in India at the request of the United States," a U.S. Justice Department spokesperson told CNN.

The exchange has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions since April 2019, the U.S. Justice Department said last week.

Garantex was sanctioned by the U.S. in April 2022.

Blockchain research company TRM Labs said in a blog post last week that the takedown of Garantex "marks a major milestone in the fight against illicit finance" but cautioned that sanctioned exchanges often attempt to evade restrictions by creating new entities.
