This intense class has been a fan favorite for decades after over 51 years in the NHRA. The NHRA is an iconic association because of its dedication to bringing the American automotive enthusiast community a place to play around with their favorite pastime. With a great emphasis on ensuring that everyone could have fun with their vehicles in a safe and fast environment, the racing brand separated its racers into classes based on a specific set of rules and seed requirements. This decision was very similar to other sports leagues that separate players based on weight class to allow a more fair game. This race would be the first Pro-stock race ever to be featured in the NHRA series and would lead to an American automotive revolution as people began to see what they could do with their favorite muscle and sports cars from the 1960s and '70s. Regularly you could see quarter-mile times as low as 9-seconds due to the heavy emphasis on modifying and tuning up the crazy vehicles to their full potential. However, now and then, you might find yourself watching some of the world's most incredible automotive feats, such as in 1984 when Sammy Miller set an insane record of 3.58 seconds on the quarter-mile. Crazy drivers such as Bill Jenkins, Ronnie Sox, Dick Landy, and Sammy Miller brought Pro-stock drag racing into the eye of the public, and the legends of these ridiculous racers still stand firm to this day. Many have tried and failed to beat records set around that time, and pro-stock racing is still one of the most popular types of drag racing because of its ability to combine the stock, more like stock-adjacent, style with tons of power and extremely low quarter-mile times.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/watch-full-length-trailer-brad-200700266.html'>Drop Everything and Watch the Full-Length Trailer For Brad Pitt's F1 Movie</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 20:07:00 <p>
The first trailer for F1, the new feature film about a fictional Formula 1 team starring Brad Pitt, has finally landed online. Unlike previous teasers that focused on how F1 will communicate the sights and sounds of auto racing, this one is all about the movie itself. As expected, the film seems to be focused mostly on Pitt's character, Sonny Hayes. Pitt, who is 18 years older than the oldest driver currently in Formula 1, plays a driver who comes back to F1 to support a team run by Javier Bardem's Ruben Cervantes. He is joined at the team by Damson Idris' character Joshua Pearce, a young driver who should be filling the roles of both mentee and rival at different points in the movie. As it so happens, that plot summary sure sounds a lot to us like the plot of Sylvester Stallone's maligned CART movie Driven. The good news is that Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kucinski is directing F1, and production on the project features a similar level of on-location filming with real machinery. A modified Formula 2 car was used for filming, complete with unique bodywork that made the car look like an original F1 design for the 2022 through 2025 seasons. If the trailer looks up your alley, you shouldn't have to wait long to actually see the movie. F1 is scheduled to release in American theaters on June 25th.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The crypto market is showing signs of a major reversal, and savvy investors are already positioning themselves for massive gains. While mainstream coins recover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is emerging as a top performer for exponential growth. The operational success of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) occurred during this time period. Since its launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) collected $3.2 million through the investments of more than 5500 holders. Mutuum Finance has succeeded in attracting many investors through its attractive opportunity structure. Mutuum Finance introduces innovative financial services through its next-generation dual-lending approach which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. Users maintain exclusive ownership of their confidential loan arrangements through the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system because it operates without requiring any intermediaries. Users can access maximum security and adaptive operations together with profit generation through current APY rates that reach up to 10% during liquidity provision. The platform registers growing popularity because it has gained over 5300 investors. Throughout the Phase 3 presale event people may purchase MUTM tokens at their initial value of $0.02. The site adds more value to users who are capable of attracting new investors as it drives user engagement and community growth rates higher. Mutuum Finance stands among the top DeFi alternatives as cryptocurrencies start to regain value. Analysts project MUTM’s value to reach $7 at a projected 12,020% rise by six weeks based on existing investors surpassing 5,500 accounts with $3.2M invested. At launch investors who enter during the initial phase will receive double their capital ($0.06) before it reaches an expected value of $3 or more by 2025. A $100,000 prize draw giving away 10 rewards will motivate people to adopt the system and an extra incentive program runs through referrals.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/309938/when-will-strategy-buy-bitcoin-dip'>When Will Strategy Buy the Bitcoin Dip?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 19:56:50 <p>
Nearly half those announcements followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s reelection in November, as crypto prices boomed. The pause comes amid Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs, which have battered stocks and crypto, while prompting outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Despite the recent drop, its shares are still valued 50% up from a year ago. “MSTR's cost of capital increases during market corrections, which makes it harder for Strategy to buy BTC when prices dip,” Engel and Flynn wrote in a research note this month. Within the past few years, Strategy has embraced so-called convertible senior notes as a way to buy Bitcoin. As a form of company debt, investors can convert these notes for shares. Strategy said that it had sold $3 billion worth of convertible senior notes at a 55% conversion premium relative to its stock price in November. Investors later paid a 35% conversion premium on $2 billion worth of convertible senior shares in February, indicating its offering had become less lucrative. As perpetual strike preferred stock, the Nasdaq-listed product pays a fixed dividend indefinitely, unless Strategy decides to redeem it. “There is no reason to believe that Strategy’s appetite for buying bitcoin has abated,” he said, describing Monday’s announcement as “an emphatic statement about its commitment to its bitcoin acquisition strategy.” As market participants waited to see whether that offering would translate into immediate buys, Saylor, Strategy’s ever bullish co-founder and executive referenced the product on Thursday. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), he said, “$STRK while the iron is hot.” Strategy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton inserts himself into a famous movie scene.

The man loved speed and performance, he himself barely slowly down even in his elderly years. Seeking greater economic prosperity, his family moved to Modesto, California An enterprising youth, he opened his first automotive shop at the ripe age of 15.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/pick-motorcycle-even-heavy-one-192500160.html'>How To Pick Up A Motorcycle, Even A Heavy One</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 19:25:00 <p>
It's okay, it happens to the best of us — and also to me, a woman who drops her bikes during such complex maneuvers as "getting cut off by a bicycle" or "turning from a stop." In fact, I dropped my old 500-pound BMW GS with its 10.5 inches of ground clearance enough times to really nail down the technique of picking it back up without grievously injuring my back. Today, you get to heed the wisdom of all my attempts. I mention my old GS's ground clearance because, contrary to what you might expect, that matters more than the weight of your motorcycle when you go to pick it up. Think about it like a lever — the bike's weight is acting on a distance from the point around which you're trying to roll it. A taller bike is harder to pick up than a lower one, and a tall heavy bike — like an ADV — is just about the worst thing to pick up. Read more: These Are The Dumbest Looking Cars Of All Time, According To You Luggage racks are great for this, but bodywork can do the job in a pinch. You'll end up positioned like the picture above, crouched next to your bike. Keep your back as upright as possible and lift with your legs until you feel the bike's weight shift from its side to its wheels. That's just a little tilt, though, compared to the next step: Standing up and stepping backwards to push the bike up using your thigh muscles. It's easier to lift a bike than to hold one up, so your motion once the bike's weight is resting on its wheels should be a single, fluid one. Don't try to throw the bike up in an instant but don't tire yourself out by making the process last longer than it needs to. If not, don't worry — you'll feel the bike getting lighter as more of its weight settles onto its wheels, and you can start to taper off your effort, so you don't go too far. I've used this method to pick up that old GS immediately after running myself ragged at the climbing gym, and I can confirm that it spares you the worst of the soreness that you'd get from other lifting methods. Proper technique makes all the difference in the world when lifting a bike, and a technique that works on tall, heavy ADVs should work on anything.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news.yahoo.com/autos/12-features-kia-sorento-stylish-190742406.html'>12 features that make the Kia Sorento a stylish family SUV with great tech</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 19:07:42 <p>
A Kia Sorento X-Line SX Prestige 2.5T AWD in jungle green. I recently drove a fully loaded Sorento in X-Line SX Prestige trim. I was impressed by the Sorento's peppy driving dynamics, rugged styling, and well-executed tech. I recently tested a fully loaded Kia Sorento and was impressed by the family SUV's peppy driving, rugged looks and suite of tech features. The 2025 Sorento starts at $31,990 and is pretty much unchanged from previous years. With fees, my Georgia-made X-Line SX-Prestige test car came out to $48,285. 12 features jumped out to me that helped make the Sorento a great family SUV that's practical, fun to drive, and packed with cool tech. Most vehicles offer consumers one or two engine options. My high-end test car was powered by a 281 horsepower turbocharged engine with an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. More value-minded buyers can opt for the entry model's 191 horsepower, naturally aspirated four-cylinder. The Sorento can also be had as a hybrid with 227 horsepower and as a plug-in hybrid with 261 horsepower and 31 miles of electric range. A 2024 Kia Sorento X-Line SX-Prestige 2.5T AWD in Jungle Green. It draws heavily from the brand's flagship Telluride SUV. Kia's 2.5-liter turbocharged engine and eight-speed DCT combine to make the Sorento surprisingly peppy. Power delivery felt immediate, consistent, and pretty smooth for a turbocharged four-cylinder. According to Kia, my 4,250-pound test car could accelerate from 0 to 62 mph in 7.5 seconds with a top speed of 131 miles per hour. The sage green leather upholstery in my test car looked great and was a happy break from the traditional black, white, and tan interiors found in my vehicles. The heated and ventilated power front seats are not only incredibly comfortable, but their quilted design also adds an extra dash of flair to the cabin. Every carmaker has an infotainment system, but few do it well. The system is responsive, easy to navigate, and comes packed with helpful features like built-in vehicle diagnostics and a 360-camera system. All Sorentos also come with standard wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration. The system, which uses side mirror-mounted cameras, activates when the turn signal is used and proved to be a helpful feature This smart design, also found on a couple of other recent Hyundai/Kia SUVs, makes the USB-C sockets easily accessible to both front and rear seat passengers. I've encountered the voice memo feature on several recent Hyundai/Kia models. It's offbeat and not something I'd necessarily use, but I can certainly see it coming in handy if inspiration strikes while stuck in traffic. The Sorento's standard third row isn't terribly spacious. However, its mere presence in a smaller, lower-priced midsize SUV and the flexibility it affords owners make it a standout feature. You don't have to kick or swing your leg under the rear bumper. A Kia Sorento X-Line SX Prestige 2.5T AWD in jungle green. When road conditions are really bad, the Sorento comes with a center-locking differential, activated by pushing a button on the center console, that ensures power is split evenly between the front and rear wheels.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A lot of people love the modern Shelby GT350Rwith its flat plane-crank Voodoo V8 engine, which sounds just unearthly, carbon-fiber wheels, etc. It’s a true track toy with few comforts, although it’s not nearly as stripped-down as the original. Don’t worry, though, because Samcrac is restoring everything to factory spec You might not believe this, but now has been the best time ever to buy a Shelby GT350 since the cars launched. Some people are even dumping their old Shelby to get one of those new cars. However, the GT350Rs are far rarer, thanks to Ford seriously limiting production. If you don’t want to do the math, that’s about a $20,000 drop in value. The setup drops 29 pounds of unsprung weight, which is incredible, but the $4,400 price tag is hard for a lot of people to stomach. The second owner might really thank you for doing so, plus it’s a good selling point if you don’t want to remove the modifications before listing it for sale.

Unfortunately for the supercar configurator enthusiasts among us, Ford does not have a public means of speccing out its supercar-fighting Mustang GTD online. Fortunately, though, Ford seems to have no restrictions against future owners showing the public what that exclusive tool looks like. One of those approved buyers, Manny Khoshbin, shared the configurator in a YouTube video uploaded last week. The clip reveals a few specifics about how Ford's ultimate supercharged Mustang will be built, including some of the option packages and a few of the visual customization selections available for GTD buyers. The package also features a painted carbon fiber splitter and diffuser, plus lightweight half-shafts and the all-important lightweight carpeting. Just six paint colors are available in the car's standard palette, but an optional paint-to-sample-style program allows significant customization. An optional carbon package adds more exposed carbon fiber to the exterior, while an optional titanium package adds larger paddle shifters behind the steering wheel. Unlike many other configurators, Ford's GTD tool does not seem to show price changes added by specific packages and options. hat said, Ford enthusiast site Ford Authority reports that the two special editions, Spirit of America and Carbon Edition, are priced at a whopping $429,000 and $428,000, respectively. If options are an additional charge on top of that, the ultimate Mustang certainly does not come cheap.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In any case, the U.S. Southern Command is apparently developing potential plans that vary from somewhat reasonable ideas like partnering more closely with the Panamanian military to less likely — more drastic — measures like sending U.S. troops to seize the Canal by force, according to NBC News. Of course, both China and Panama say there isn't any interference in the canal, a waterway whose neutrality is actually enshrined in Panama's Constitution, NBC News says. Now, Defense Secretary and party boy Pete Hegseth is set to visit Panama sometime in April. Read more: F-150 Production Halted, Ford Temporarily Lays Off 9,700 Workers Privately, he has struck up a very serious tone about sending the military down there, as NBC News explains: Trump has told his advisers that he sees a U.S. military presence in Panama and on the canal itself as critical to that effort, the U.S. officials said. Trump has also made it clear that he wants U.S. service members to be visible in the canal zone as a show of force. Trump administration officials have argued that China has too large a presence near the canal. Some of them include Special Forces units who are working with Panamanian forces to protect the country from internal threats, insurgencies or unrest. Potential administration strategies include simply ensuring that U.S. ships have safe passage through the canal, to restoring total U.S. ownership and operation of the passageway, officials said. Other options under consideration include using the U.S. military to secure existing ports in Panama, to build new ports in Panama or using the Army Corps of Engineers to operate the canal's locks, officials said. In any case, I feel like putting a lot of time and effort into who owns and operates the Panama Canal is something you do when you've got all of your other issues figured out. Critically, the U.S. and the Trump administration have a lot of other issues to deal with that are far more pressing than this waterway. I'm sure that no matter how this whole thing shakes out, the history books will look back on it and throw around the word "fiasco" rather liberally. Tourist boat Pacific Queen passes through the Pedro Miguel locks while transiting the Panama Canal on September 23, 2023 in Pedro Miguel, Panama. Over the past few years, the Panama Canal has been dealing with a lot of news, and most of it hasn't been particularly great. Extreme drought has thrown the whole operation into jeopardy.

Democrats who voted for the GENIUS Act’s passage include bill cosponsor Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), as well as Senate Banking Committee members Mark Warner (D-VA), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), and Ruben Gallego (D-AZ). The GENUIS Act passed out of Senate Banking with a strong and bi-partisan 18-6 vote. This is a huge step towards providing regulatory clarity for stablecoins, and a huge step towards upgrading and making the dollar more competitive. During Thursday’s meeting of the Senate Banking Committee, longtime crypto critic Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) attempted to add multiple new provisions to the GENIUS Act, which creates a legal framework for nonbank stablecoin issuers to participate in the U.S. economy. Warren proposed amendments to the bill that would have blacklisted any stablecoin issuers whose tokens were found to have been used in connection with state enemies and illegal activity, including drug trafficking and the purchase of child pornography. All her amendments were voted down, mostly along party lines. “Who are we trying to protect, the child pornographers and Iran and North Korea?” Warren said at one point, in apparent exasperation, after her third amendment was voted down. “Nobody’s looking to shut this down, no one’s looking to stop innovation,” the progressive senator said at a later point during the meeting. The bill proceeded shortly after to a vote, which it passed handily. While it has been generally supported by industry leaders, some crypto users pushed back on a new provision that would require stablecoin issuers to have the ability to "seize, freeze, burn, or prevent the transfer” of tokens if obligated to comply with legal orders.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/gas-prices-drop-four-low-183000101.html'>Gas Prices Drop To Four Year Low</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 18:30:00 <p>
If you haven’t noticed lately, gas prices are low. In fact, they’re so low, we haven’t seen prices like this for four years. Considering how expensive it’s been to fill up tanks for the last four years, this kind of relief is very welcome. But there’s plenty of speculation about whether it will last. According to AAA, nationally the average price for a gallon of gas on March 13 is $3.079. According to a CNN report, the price of oil in West Texas Intermediate, sits at $66.71 which curiously is 11 percent cheaper than the day after President Trump was sworn into office for a second time. It can take some time for gas prices to come down, but it appears the downward trend will continue as oil prices also tank. However, there are fears that if the price of oil dips below $60 a barrel, that might result in a cut in production, causing prices to start climbing again. That’s great news for truckers and other commercial drivers. But some fear tariffs could cause fuel prices to jump.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Aston Martin built some pretty incredible models over its 110-year existence like the DB5, which found fame on the silver screen, and the DBR9, which won its class in Le Mans two years running. One of its wildest creations is the One-77, which was meant to show what the British brand could muster when it really put its mind to it. Well, that's what Aston told its buyers at the time at least, as a 78th One-77 was sold to a buyer in America and it's one of the highest-mileage examples out there. A photo of an Aston Martin One-77 in profile. Two years later, this One-77 had already covered 22,000 miles. It was even used as a safety car for the Aston Martin Racing Le Mans Festival. It caught fire between its stint as a safety car and 2017, but the damage wasn't severe. By 2017, chassis #10711 had clocked 23,835 miles, and around this time, Aston Martin accepted an offer to restore the car for a large sum. After roughly 25,000 miles on the odometer, the One-77 racked up a costly list of repairs, which were documented by High Mileage Reviews over on YouTube. The mirror controls have also gone and the motor that controls the pop-up sat nav also has issues, but there's no word on what it costs to fix those parts. That's good to hear, as this One-77 covered more miles than the three other examples that are currently for sale around the world, so at least one owner is making the most of their 750hp monster.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/309858/deadrop-game-refunds-dr-disrespect-studio-closes'>‘Deadrop’ Game Players Claim Refunds After Dr. Disrespect’s Studio Closes</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 18:12:55 <p>
Deadrop was the vertical extraction shooter developed by Midnight Society, co-founded by controversial streamer Dr. Disrespect—who was later kicked out of the company due to allegations of inappropriate conversations with minors. Wanted to wait until I had confirmations on this, and it appears everyone should be able to… — Caramel (@Caramel_Hydra) March 7, 2025 Following that initial sale, the studio later sold $25 Tower Key passes (which weren’t NFTs), and eventually Drivers Keys for $20-30 apiece, which would unlock future in-game items of varying rarities. Once Midnight Society shut down at the end of January 2025, much of what users thought they’d spent money on was no longer going to be delivered. And those that bought a Drivers Key claim to have never received the in-game items at all. Pseudonymous gaming content creator JustAverageJay, simply known as Jay, shared receipts with Decrypt showing that he spent $449.80 on Deadrop Drivers Keys throughout October 2023, because he wanted to eventually flex the items in-game alongside his son, who also played Deadrop. Jay isn’t alone in this, with a group of players gathering in the Midnight Society Discord to discuss how they can get a refund. He said that this is done by contacting your bank and telling them the product was never delivered. Caramel shared receipts of three bank reversals from Midnight Society totaling nearly $390 for Drivers Keys. “I don't want the community that I helped build over the last 4 years to be out [of] hundreds, if not thousands of dollars,” Caramel said. After popular streamer Dr. Disrespect, aka Guy Beahm, was dismissed from the game studio, players were unsure where the game would go—or if it could succeed without him. Midnight Society co-founder and creative director Quinn DelHoyo told Decrypt in August 2024 that the game’s development hadn’t “skipped a beat,” and claimed that the “fully featured game” would release in fall 2025. This planned launch would have included the Season 0 battle pass that Tower Key buyers were anticipating. Just over three months after terminating its relationship with Beahm, Midnight Society confirmed last September that “significant” layoffs took place, after the news spread via ex-employees' social media accounts. But a leaner team wasn’t enough to save the studio, with Midnight Society officially shutting down four months later, leading to Deadrop being discontinued. One player that asked to remain anonymous provided Decrypt with correspondence from American Express approving a $25 chargeback for a Tower Key, because Midnight Society did not respond to the bank’s queries on the case. This player admitted that they only anticipated a partial refund, but was happy to take the full $25. However, this is an avenue that many players had already gone down to no avail. It appears that no one is monitoring the Midnight Society accounts, with no response from any of their email addresses and the Discord chat largely running free of supervision.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Representatives for the family of U.S. President Donald Trump are holding discussions with Binance about investing in its U.S. arm, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Thursday. Zhao, who was then the company's CEO, pleaded guilty on money laundering charges in November 2023 and served four months in prison. Zhao denied the WSJ report in an X post. "Fact: I have had no discussions of a Binance US deal with…well, anyone." More than 20 people have told me they were asked by the WSJ (and another media), "Can you confirm that CZ made some deal for a pardon?" As part of his agreement, Zhao has a lifetime ban from "managing or operating" the exchange. Binance pleaded guilty for violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws, paid a $4.3 billion fine–one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history–and agreed to "a complete exit" from the country. The White House had no comment and referred Decrypt to Zhao’s statement. BNB, the exchange’s native token, rose more than 6% at one point in the hours after the report and was more recently up 3%, according to data provider CoinGecko. Trump, who campaigned as a supporter of the industry, last week signed an executive order to launch a Bitcoin strategic reserve and separate crypto stockpile. The U.S. Department of Justice had been investigating Binance and Zhao for years before hitting both with the criminal charges.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Anchorage Digital was one such custodian that met with Treasury Department officials on Monday, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the matter. When asked about the meeting, Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley told Decrypt that government officials asked him detailed questions about best practices for custodying a national Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile. McCauley said the officials also inquired about how custody could impact stablecoins and market structure, two hot-button topics currently before Congress. “It’s clear that Treasury officials are treating this move into the digital asset space with care, recognizing that the United States is quite literally writing history.” The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on this story. The national digital assets stockpile, however, will consist of a wide variety of seized crypto assets on various blockchain networks, and therefore will likely be permanently custodied by a third party. Marshals Service announced it had tapped Coinbase to custody its large cap digital asset holdings. In the post, Armstrong boasts that his company “works with 145 government entities in the U.S. and 29 government entities outside the U.S.” and that Coinbase has seen increased interest in its custody services following President Donald Trump’s announcement establishing a Bitcoin Reserve. During an event in Washington held Tuesday by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe, Casa CEO Nick Neuman, and Anchorage Digital’s Nathan McCauley convened a panel on “Safeguarding America’s Bitcoin.” “It’s maybe sitting in a closet at the U.S.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The cryptocurrency industry is discussing as analysts forecast renewed gains for XRP and Litecoin (LTC). XRP, bolstered by legal clarity from recent regulatory developments, is positioning itself as a staple in cross-border payments. Both projects represent resilience and reliability, which are highly valued in a volatile market. Investors are eyeing potential surges, particularly with broader network upgrades and increasing adoption on the horizon. Yet, while XRP and Litecoin promise growth, the real conversation isn’t just about steady progress. While XRP and Litecoin cater to existing crypto use cases, BinoFi is tackling inefficiencies across the entire industry with cutting-edge technology. Analysts are calling it a game-changer for trading, providing solutions that address scalability, accessibility, and cost barriers. This approach is already turning heads, as it resolves long-standing compromises traders often face. What excites analysts most is the direct cross-chain trading functionality, enabling seamless swaps without bridges. By removing the complexities of multi-chain compatibility, BinoFi positions itself as a unifier in an increasingly fragmented blockchain world. BinoFi’s features are not just speculative; they have garnered tangible investment interest. BinoFi is capitalizing on both market demand and user needs with innovations like gasless transactions using its Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet technology. By lowering transaction costs while boosting accessibility, the project appeals to investors and traders struggling with Ethereum gas fees or limited trading options on other platforms. Seasoned investors are drawn to BinoFi because it offers something XRP and Litecoin cannot: next-generation solutions for future market needs. With strong community interest, innovative technology, and huge projected upside, BinoFi offers investors a compelling chance to join one of crypto’s most exciting rising stars.

A trio of Solana tokens—Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU, Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and Popcat (POPCAT) have all jumped in the last 24 hours, while meme coin leader Dogecoin (DOGE) has remained relatively flat in the same timeframe. DOGE, which is ranked inside the top 10 crypto assets by market cap, is down by just 0.4% in the last day while the trio of Solana tokens have outperformed amid their listing on Robinhood. Dogecoin was showing a gain earlier Thursday morning, but has since dipped slightly to a current price of $0.165. That’s highlighted by losses of more than 30% for DOGE and PEPE, two of the top three largest meme coins by market cap. Other notables, like the U.S. president’s official Solana meme coin TRUMP and Dogwifhat (WIF) have also posted moderate gains of 2.5% and 3.7%, respectively. The pair are both available for trading on Robinhood as well. That’s a far cry from the numbers the sector held in late 2024, when “dog-themed” tokens alone represented a nearly $105 billion market cap at peak, according to the coin tracking platform. Pump.fun is responsible for more than 8 million token deployments since its launch, including some of the top meme coins from this cycle like PNUT and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), though its usage stats have fallen sharply in recent weeks amid market turmoil. Others though, like Stratos hedge fund founder Renneck Palley, previously told Decrypt that “meme coins are here to stay.” They sometimes rise faster than other, more established crypto tokens, but often crash in a hurry based on factors like changing sentiment, large sales from “whale” holders, and moves from bad actors.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Coldware (COLD) is riding the momentum of a $1.5M presale, signaling its potential to outperform established tokens like DOGE. Its focus on easy integration with smartphones provides a seamless user experience for individuals new to the world of blockchain and DeFi. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, which often require complex setups and desktop-based interfaces, Coldware (COLD) offers a simple way for anyone to access decentralized exchanges (DEXs), stake tokens, and interact with smart contracts—all directly from their smartphones. For new investors and Dogecoin (DOGE) millionaires looking for the next big opportunity, Coldware (COLD) presents a perfect entry point into the world of decentralized finance. The token’s presale success, already reaching $1.5M, indicates that there is significant demand for its mobile-first DeFi solutions, and the potential for future growth is substantial. Dogecoin’s meteoric rise over the years has generated a massive following. However, many investors are beginning to see the limits of their initial profits, as Dogecoin (DOGE) has plateaued in recent times. While DOGE has become one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies in the world, its potential for explosive gains has become more limited compared to newer projects like Coldware (COLD). The $1.5M presale shows that there’s significant appetite for a new solution in the DeFi space, and Coldware’s innovative mobile-first approach is giving investors a fresh avenue for potential profit. With $1.5M raised and strong community support, Coldware is positioning itself to make waves in the cryptocurrency market. If the momentum continues, it could eventually overtake Dogecoin, offering even bigger profits for those who got in early. While Dogecoin (DOGE) remains one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, its price growth has slowed in recent years. As a meme coin, Dogecoin’s value has often been driven by social media trends and hype rather than solid technological advancements. In contrast, Coldware (COLD) offers more than just meme coin value. With its focus on bringing decentralized finance solutions to smartphones, Coldware is solving a significant problem in the blockchain space—mobile accessibility. By integrating DeFi into everyday mobile devices, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as a leader in the next generation of blockchain technology. As the cryptocurrency space continues to evolve, projects like Coldware (COLD) that focus on user accessibility and technological innovation are likely to lead the way.

El fondo busca rastrear el rendimiento de precio de XRP, ofreciendo a los inversionistas exposición al activo digital sin requerir custodia directa. XRP, el cuarto criptoactivo más grande por capitalización de mercado, actualmente se cotiza a $2.2. El precio del token ha ganado impulso tras un informe del miércoles que indica que Ripple Labs y la SEC están trabajando en resolver su demanda legal de larga duración. Otras firmas que esperan aprobación regulatoria para propuestas de ETF de XRP incluyen Bitwise, 21Shares, Canary Capital, Grayscale y WisdomTree. El analista de ETF, James Seyffart, señaló que, aunque los retrasos son procedimiento estándar, hay «altas probabilidades de aprobación» para estos ETFs de altcoins para octubre de 2025.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/309799/my-pet-hooligan-arbitrum-studio-chain'>‘My Pet Hooligan’ Will Launch on Arbitrum 'Studio Chain' for Games and Entertainment</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 12:01:03 <p>
The Karrat Foundation, which is linked to the battle royale game My Pet Hooligan, announced Thursday that it is collaborating with the Arbitrum Foundation to launch a gaming-focused chain called Studio Chain, which is aimed at fostering Web3-native capabilities in entertainment and video games. “Studio Chain and the My Pet Hooligan franchise bring with them a rich source of content and culture that we’re thrilled to add to the Arbitrum ecosystem,” Jack Fitzpatrick, Partnerships Manager at Offchain Labs, said in a statement. “We're excited to see how this collaboration will enable truly innovative player and creator experiences." Enjoy some clips & GZ pieshki for the 👑 EU & Asia Championships this weekend! To deliver those experiences the blockchain will look to My Pet Hooligan creator AMGI Studios, which counts entertainment icons Paris Hilton and Coldplay as early investors, to deliver AAA gaming experiences, tokenized IP and content rights, and new democratized funding channels. “By leveraging Arbitrum's powerful infrastructure, we're able to create gaming experiences that were previously impossible," said Luke Paglia, co-founder and COO of AMGI Studios. “My Pet Hooligan is just the beginning—this collaboration enables seamless in-game asset ownership, true player-driven interactive extensions, and enhanced interoperability that will transform how audiences engage with entertainment." “That means Web3 fungible and non-fungible assets can be reflected in the Web3 environment and any changes to asset states or balances communicated across platforms,” a representative for the game told Decrypt. Other notable crypto games are headed to Xbox and PlayStation consoles, though with mixed approaches—and still a lot of questions in some cases. Ethereum-based game Moonray will launch on consoles without crypto elements built in, the developer previously said. Meanwhile, Off the Grid—which is currently available in early access on Xbox and PS5—still has yet to launch its Avalanche L1 mainnet to power on-chain trading and token use. But developer Gunzilla has conceded that the crypto elements will be “handled differently” on consoles compared to PC. While details of Studio Chain’s official launch are still outstanding, when it comes, it will need to fight for users with other entertainment and consumer-focused blockchains like Ethereum scaling networks Ronin and Abstract. “The traditional entertainment industry is in crunch time, with studios shutting down, frequent layoffs, difficult barriers to entry, red tape, and more as IPs are looking for funding and new paths forward,” they continued.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Invesco Galaxy filing mirrors similar moves by major ETF providers, including BlackRock, which has recently sought approval for in-kind redemption mechanisms.

Even so, both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have faced challenges in recent days. On Tuesday, Bitcoin ETFs experienced significant outflows, with $371 million withdrawn, marking the seventh consecutive day of withdrawals, according to data from UK-based investment management firm Farside Investors.

Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon has requested an Interpol Red Notice for Hayden Davis, creator of the collapsed LIBRA token The LIBRA token was shared by Argentine President Javier Milei, quickly reaching a $4 billion valuation before crashing Davis reportedly made approximately $100 million from the token before its collapse The memecoin caused a political scandal in Argentina after being promoted by President Javier Milei. Gregorio Dalbon submitted the request to prosecutor Eduardo Taiano and judge María Servini. These officials are currently investigating President Milei’s involvement in the memecoin project. An Interpol Red Notice requests law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition. Dalbon argued that Davis poses a “procedural risk” if he remains free. Dalbon previously represented former Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in a corruption case. The LIBRA token gained massive attention after President Milei shared it across his social media accounts on February 14. This presidential mention happened just minutes after the token’s creation. The rapid rise and fall left many investors with major losses. In an interview with YouTuber Stephen Findeisen (known as “Coffeezilla”), Davis claimed he made around $100 million. Various lawyers have filed fraud charges against President Milei in Argentine criminal court for promoting the token. Other lawyers have reported the president for financial crimes to local authorities. President Milei has defended himself by claiming he didn’t “promote” the LIBRA token. Blockchain analysis firm Nansen reported that retail investors suffered losses of $251 million. Meanwhile, wallets linked to Davis and another figure named Kelsier extracted major profits before the collapse. They cited tactics such as “sniping” – using bots to buy tokens early and control liquidity. He claimed they were designed to prevent an immediate collapse and reinvest liquidity once President Milei resumed promoting the token. Investigations have linked the LIBRA team to other controversial crypto projects. Reports indicate connections between LIBRA insiders and a project called MELANIA.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

PEPE/ETH chart shows a breakout pattern with PEPE gaining against Ethereum despite ETH trending downward Analysts predict a potential 50% price increase for PEPE following the breakout PEPE was the biggest gainer among top 100 coins with a 15.85% price increase and over $1 billion in 24-hour trading volume The largest purchase came from wallet 0x7A7D, which bought 437.7 billion PEPE for $2.72 million (1,413.4 WETH). These large buys show growing confidence in PEPE’s market outlook. When whales make such moves, they often reduce available supply and can create upward price pressure. The timing aligns with technical signals pointing to a potential trend reversal. A breakout above this level might push prices toward the $0.00000640-$0.00000660 range. If rejected, PEPE might consolidate between $0.00000540 and $0.00000580 before making another move. Analysts have noted that PEPE is gaining strength against Ethereum despite ETH’s downward trend, showing price decoupling. This divergence suggests investors may be moving funds from larger cryptocurrencies into meme coins like PEPE. They may be seeking better short-term returns in the current market. This technical pattern occurs when price moves opposite to an oscillator, often signaling a coming trend change. Based on this breakout pattern, the analyst predicts PEPE could see a price increase of over 50%. Large PEPE transactions have been relatively flat since February 2025, ranging between 400-600 trades before dropping to 278 on March 11. The recent 7-day high of 304 large transactions still represents low activity compared to previous periods. For PEPE to move consistently above $0.00000060, increased whale activity would likely be needed. Trading volume has exceeded $1 billion, representing a 13.41% increase, indicating growing market interest. In that scenario, further selling could push PEPE toward $0.00000495 or lower.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The SEC plans to drop its lawsuit against crypto influencer Ian Balina over his promotion of Sparkster (SPRK) tokens in 2018 Balina allegedly received a 30% bonus on his $5 million investment but didn’t disclose this to followers Sparkster previously settled with the SEC for $35.1 million over unregistered securities violations The SEC originally accused Balina of violating securities laws. This bonus arrangement was not shared with Balina’s social media followers. At the time, he had over 100,000 YouTube subscribers who followed his crypto investment advice. In May 2024, a judge ruled that “SPRK tokens qualify as securities” under the SEC’s oversight. Balina’s legal team had planned to appeal this decision. He added that the “time has ended” for crypto regulation through enforcement actions. The commission has also dropped cases against other major crypto players. The SEC still has an open case against Ripple Labs. This involves an appeal following a $125 million judgment from August 2024. Without admitting wrongdoing, CEO Sajjad Daya agreed to several terms. These included destroying remaining tokens, requesting their removal from exchanges, and publicly posting the SEC’s order. Daya reportedly failed to cash out before the crypto market crashed. The price dropped 92% on its first day of trading. Investors who had bought in based on Balina’s promotion turned against him. They blamed him for hyping a project that collapsed immediately upon launch. They point to industry support for Republican candidates in the 2024 election. President Trump recently hosted a crypto summit at the White House on March 7. Representatives from companies like Robinwood, Gemini, Coinbase, and Kraken were present at this meeting. Many of these are the same companies that have seen enforcement actions dropped. The SEC declined to comment when contacted by Cointelegraph about Balina’s case.

Rumble purchased 188 Bitcoin for $17.1 million at an average price of $91,000 per coin Rumble joins other public companies holding Bitcoin despite recent crypto market volatility The purchase follows through on Rumble’s earlier promise to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. He pointed to Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation. “These holdings have the potential to serve as a valuable hedge against inflation and will not be subject to dilution like so many overprinted government-issued currencies,” Pavlovski said in a press release. The company began its Bitcoin buying on January 20, 2025, which coincided with President Trump’s inauguration day. However, Rumble did not disclose the amount purchased during that initial round. Rumble’s announcement clarified that future Bitcoin purchases would depend on several factors. The video platform stated that its “Bitcoin allocation strategy may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.” This gives the company flexibility to adjust its approach based on changing market dynamics. Late last year, stablecoin issuer Tether took a $775 million stake in the video-sharing platform. This connection has raised Rumble’s profile among conservative users in the United States. Bitcoin prices have faced downward pressure due to recession fears and concerns about inflation from the new administration’s proposed tariffs. Rumble now joins other public companies like Metaplanet that hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries. As inflation concerns persist, more corporations may follow Rumble’s approach to treasury management.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://blockonomi.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-increases-despite-30-market-correction/'>Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Increases Despite 30% Market Correction</a></h2><b>Source:</b> blockonomi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 09:50:37 <p>
Bitcoin’s mining difficulty continues to rise despite a 30% market correction Current data suggests miners are holding onto their Bitcoin reserves rather than selling Mining difficulty adjustment could lead to miner capitulation, potentially adding new downward pressure This trend, along with changing patterns in whale selling and stablecoin transfers, points to a complex market situation where miners appear to be holding onto their Bitcoin rather than selling at lower prices. The cryptocurrency has recorded a 2.6% increase, with its price currently at $83,510. Despite this short-term uptick, Bitcoin remains down by about 7.5% over the past week. While Bitcoin struggles to regain higher levels, CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain has spotted an important trend in mining activity. During the extended correction phase, mining difficulty saw a temporary drop. Historically, a decline in mining difficulty has been linked to miners shutting down less efficient rigs. The current data suggests miners have not yet begun offloading large amounts of Bitcoin. The miners appear to be holding onto their reserves rather than selling at lower prices. Another key metric, the Miner Position Index (MPI), previously showed signs of selling pressure in November 2024. If Bitcoin’s correction extends further, a decrease in mining difficulty could signal miner capitulation. This trend typically does not occur while Bitcoin’s price is declining. Large-scale investors could be absorbing market shocks through over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. While miners show strength, there’s another side to the market. According to CryptoQuant’s community analyst Darkfost, whale activity on Binance is showing signs of decline. High values of this ratio typically indicate increased selling pressure from large holders. A decreasing ratio suggests whales are not selling as much Bitcoin. This pattern has previously signaled market stabilization or the beginning of bullish trends. This metric has acted as a leading indicator of potential trend reversals. Despite positive signs from whale activity, miners may introduce new pressure. CryptoQuant verified author Axel Adler Jr. noted that miners are experiencing conditions similar to those seen after recent Bitcoin difficulty adjustments. Miner capitulation happens when miners must sell Bitcoin to cover operational costs. This typically occurs when mining profitability declines due to rising costs or falling prices. This additional supply could counteract any reduction in selling pressure from whales. Their activity will be key in determining Bitcoin’s short-term price movement.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The sale occurred at an average price of $12.88, according to on-chain data shared by Onchain Lens. In the past 48 hours, a whale has sold 356,665 $LINK for $4.59M $USDC at an average price of $12.88. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) are trending downward. These signals typically point to continued downward momentum in the weeks ahead. The price decline has been contained within a descending parallel channel. Currently, Chainlink is trading near the support line of this channel. Both the daily RSI and MACD are showing bullish divergences, which frequently precede upward price movements. Market analyst “Bitcoin Buddha” expressed optimism about Chainlink’s prospects. I'm optimistic about the possibility of a new all-time high in this cycle. Another analyst indicated that a future price target of $45 remains possible if Chainlink maintains key support between $6 and $9. He followed this appearance by delivering a keynote speech at the Ondo Finance Summit on March 10. The current price action leaves Chainlink at a critical juncture. However, a bounce and breakout above the descending channel could invalidate this bearish outlook. Traders and investors are closely monitoring LINK’s price movements in relation to broader market trends. The next few days may prove decisive for Chainlink’s medium-term direction.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bitcoin isn’t just an asset, it’s the most secure, decentralized financial network in the world, immune to manipulation and inflation. While governments print money and financial institutions strip workers of their wages, we are taking control. We are learning, building, and leading,” the union continued. “For too long, unions have played defense in a system rigged against workers. In addition to holding bitcoin on the balance sheet, a standing committee will be established to explore ways Bitcoin can provide long-term security for IATSE 728 members and their families. Proof of Workforce praised IATSE 728’s leadership in adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset, stating, “At Proof of Workforce, we understand that within every organization, exists someone who has discovered the true potential of Bitcoin. They now have begun to explore an innovative network, aligned with the values and proof of work exhibited by its members. As the first private-sector union to integrate Bitcoin into its financial strategy, IATSE Local 728 is setting a precedent that could inspire other private-sector unions across the country to follow suit.

XRP price surged 18% to $2.24 after inflation data strengthened expectations for a Fed rate pause Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit reportedly nearing resolution, removing a key obstacle for XRP Franklin Templeton joins other firms in race for XRP ETF, adding institutional interest Ripple’s digital asset XRP has shown strong recovery in recent days, climbing from lows near $1.90 to reach $2.24. This 18% price jump came as market participants grew more confident about the Federal Reserve’s next move. New inflation data showed that prices are rising at a slower pace than expected. The February Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in at 2.8%, down from January’s 3%. This cooling inflation has changed how traders view the Fed’s upcoming decision. Last week’s disappointing jobs report had raised fears about a possible recession. Those worries now appear to be fading as the inflation picture improves. Open interest in options jumped 10.69% to $1.37 million, showing more traders are betting on future price movements. This means more than twice as many traders are betting on price increases versus decreases. For a stronger rally, XRP would need to overcome resistance near $2.50. If successful, traders see potential for XRP to reach the $3 mark. On the downside, if XRP fails to hold above $2.24, selling pressure could return. The lower support level sits around $1.92, where buyers might step in again. There’s also discussion about restrictions on Ripple selling XRP to institutional investors. Despite being delisted from some U.S. exchanges due to the lawsuit, XRP has maintained strong interest. Franklin Templeton has joined Grayscale, WisdomTree and others in pursuing an XRP ETF. The company is working on a DFSA license to enable blockchain-powered crypto payments. These developments could support higher valuations if the legal situation is resolved favorably. The combination of improving macro conditions and possible legal clarity has created a more positive outlook for XRP. Many traders believe these factors could help XRP reach double-digit prices in the coming year. For now, XRP continues to navigate between technical resistance and support levels.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

They were also linked to the $29 million Phemex exchange hack in January. They used decentralized exchanges like THORChain that don’t require identity checks. Reports show that around $2.91 billion was moved through THORChain in just five days. This made it much harder for authorities to track and recover the stolen money. The group has become known for using mixing services and other techniques to launder cryptocurrency after their attacks. NPM is a tool used by developers to manage and install JavaScript packages for their projects. The malware, including a package called “BeaverTail,” is designed to steal credentials and crypto wallet data. For example, they might create packages with names very similar to legitimate and widely used libraries. It also specifically looks for data from Solana and Exodus cryptocurrency wallets. Socket researchers noted that while it’s challenging to attribute this attack with absolute certainty, “the tactics, techniques, and procedures observed in this npm attack closely align with Lazarus’s known operations.” The North Korean hackers have also tried to trick crypto founders with fake Zoom calls.

SOL price has declined 24.5% over five consecutive days, reaching seven-month lows around $115 Key support levels at $125 and $120 were broken over the weekend, triggering significant liquidations Without increased demand, SOL could potentially drop further to $99 Solana’s price has taken a sharp downturn, dropping to seven-month lows amid heavy selling pressure. SOL began its downward movement when it failed to clear the $155 resistance level. This triggered a fresh decline that mirrored similar drops in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The downward momentum picked up speed as Solana broke below several key support levels. It continued its decline past the $120 mark before finding a temporary low at $114. Since then, SOL has made modest recovery attempts, climbing back above the $120 level. The cryptocurrency is trading below both $130 and its 100-hourly simple moving average. A short-term rising channel has formed with support at $124 on the hourly chart. However, failure to rise above $132 could trigger another decline. The recent price action shows SOL has lost 24.5% over five consecutive days. Bollinger Bands are expanding downward, with SOL’s price firmly below the midline at $149.13. Macroeconomic concerns, including Trump’s trade tariffs and global inflation fears, have weighed on the broader market. The U.S. Non-Farm Payroll data released on Friday sparked another round of sell-offs. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers at 32.66, approaching but not yet reaching oversold conditions. Without a meaningful resurgence in demand, Solana appears poised to slip further toward $99 before encountering the next significant support cluster. Any recovery would require bulls to reclaim the $125 level, which could potentially trigger a short squeeze targeting $149.13. The steep price decline has left many investors wondering whether to hold or sell their SOL positions. With technical indicators leaning bearish and significant short leverage in play, the short-term outlook remains challenging for Solana.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This recovery push allowed the price to clear several resistance levels including $1,800 and $1,820. Ethereum price is now trading below $1,950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Should the upward momentum continue, an upside break above $2,060 might call for more gains. A recent development that could boost Ethereum’s prospects is the US House of Representatives’ vote to repeal an IRS rule. It now moves to President Donald Trump’s desk for final approval. If approved, this regulatory change could create a more favorable environment for the cryptocurrency sector. Despite Ethereum’s current struggle below $2,000, derivatives market positions suggest traders are bracing for a bullish reversal. Data from Coinglass shows bulls deployed $753 million in leverage on ETH long positions, narrowly exceeding the $744 million leveraged on active short positions. Technical indicators on the daily chart reveal a persistent downtrend. The 5-day, 8-day, and 13-day Super SMAs continue sloping downward, reinforcing bearish control as Ethereum trades near $1,881. However, a potential bottoming-out scenario could emerge if the $1,825 support level holds.

The attacker paid block builder “bob-the-builder.eth” a $200,000 tip and kept $8,000 profit Same trader may have been attacked 6 times in one day using different wallets, losing over $480,000 total Uniswap CEO clarified these transactions didn’t use their official interface which has MEV protection The trader started with $220,764 worth of USD Coin (USDC) to swap for Tether (USDT). Within just eight seconds, the victim was left with only $5,271 in USDT. The attack took place on Uniswap v3’s USDC-USDT liquidity pool, which currently holds about $19.8 million in locked value. This type of attack is named for how it “sandwiches” the victim’s transaction between two bot transactions. Mind you, this was a pool that had over $35m of USDC and USDT it. Two other wallet addresses linked to the same trader were also attacked earlier that day. These attacks happened just minutes apart from each other. Unknown entity got sandwiched for 714k today on six separate USDC -> USDT swaps. The funds first moved from Aave, a popular borrowing and lending protocol. Some experts have raised the possibility that these unusually bad trades might be connected to money laundering. 0xngmi, the founder of crypto data dashboard DefiLlama, suggested this could be a method to wash illicit funds. This theory involves creating transactions that are easy targets for MEV bots. By privately sending these transactions to specific bots, someone could potentially launder money while accepting the losses as a cost of cleaning the funds. It also has default slippage settings that would have prevented such losses. Slippage refers to the difference between expected and actual prices in a trade. Users who access Uniswap through its official interface benefit from these protections. However, those who interact with the protocol through other means may remain vulnerable to such attacks. This incident serves as a reminder of the risks in decentralized finance. Even when trading between stablecoins, which should maintain steady values, traders can fall victim to technical exploits. MEV attacks continue to be a problem in the DeFi ecosystem. Blockchain data showed that the entire attack happened in just eight seconds. This highlights how quickly MEV bots can identify and exploit opportunities for profit at the expense of other users.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Token Metrics CEO Ian Balina said Wednesday the SEC is expected to drop its case against him, ending a three-year legal battle over allegations he violated U.S. securities laws. “It’s official: The SEC is dropping its case against me,” Balina tweeted. Balina’s charges stem from a September 2022 order alleging he failed to disclose compensation received while promoting the Sparkster (SPRK) initial coin offering. Backing the CEO’s claim, Token Metrics tweeted Monday the charges had been "dropped," adding that "a possible shift in enforcement trends" was underway. The SEC and Balina did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment. The SEC has also not officially updated the case's status since September 2022, when it announced Sparkster and its CEO, Sajjad Daya, had settled for $35 million. The SEC's complaint alleged Balina received a 30% bonus on his $5 million investment in SPRK tokens but never disclosed this consideration when promoting the tokens to his substantial social media following. In May 2024, a judge ruled SPRK tokens qualified as securities under the SEC's purview. If confirmed by the regulator, the dismissal would follow several recent SEC decisions to abandon cases against crypto companies since President Trump appointed Mark Uyeda as acting SEC Chair following Gary Gensler's January departure. So far, the SEC has dismissed a number of cases containing allegations of securities violations against crypto firms including Binance, Coinbase, OpenSea, Robinhood, Uniswap, Gemini, and Kraken, among others.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Crypto exchange Coinbase said Wednesday it is suspending trading of three popular meme coins in New York, following a recent review of its listed assets. The exchange is halting the trading of Floki (FLOKI), Turbo (TURBO), and Gigachad (GIGA) in New York starting April 14, 2025, at 2 PM ET, per an announcement on X. The announcement has drawn immediate speculation from legal experts, with Ariel Givner, founder of GivnerLaw, suggesting on X, “I’d put a lot of money on this being tied to a pending legal case in NY.” Floki gained 3.6%, Giga rose 1.1%, and Turbo saw a 5.4% increase in the last 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. Meme coins—crypto based on internet jokes, memes, or cultural references—have seen significant popularity in recent years. One of the most influential platforms driving this trend is Solana-based meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, which, since its launch in January 2024, has spawned 8.5 million meme tokens, Dune Analytics data shows. The Securities and Exchange Commission under President Donald Trump’s administration recently clarified its stance on meme coins, saying such tokens typically do not qualify as securities under U.S. law. Meme coins "do not generate a yield or convey rights to future income, profits, or assets of a business," and thus do not fall under its jurisdiction, the SEC said. However, Jin warned, "Optimism should be met with a dose of caution," as the market faces new risks and uncertainties. While meme coins offer “significant opportunities for traders and investors worldwide”, Jin said, “the green light” for meme coin launches comes with high trading risks, requiring investors to increase their research and analytical efforts.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Since late January, the combined market capitalization of Treasury-backed tokens grew $800 million to hit a fresh all-time record of $4.2 billion on Wednesday, data source rwa.xyz shows. Real-world asset platform Ondo Finance's (ONDO) products, the short-term bond-backed OUSG and USDY tokens, climbed to just shy of $1 billion combined, a 53% surge in market value over the past month. A notable outlier was Hashnote's USYC, shedding over 20% of its market cap to $900 million, predominantly due to DeFi protocol Usual's decline after investor backlash. The token is the main backing asset of Usual's USD0 stablecoin, which plummeted below $1 billion supply from its January peak of $1.8 billion. "We believe the growth of the tokenized treasury market cap during the recent crypto downturn reflects a flight to quality, similar to how traditional investors shift from equities to U.S. Treasuries during economic uncertainty," Brian Choe, head of research at rwa.xyz, told CoinDesk. Choe based his analysis on comparing the market cap growth of tokenized treasuries with stablecoins between November and January, when crypto markets rallied, and from February when prices corrected. Stablecoins grew faster during the crypto rally from November to January, while tokenized treasuries' growth outpaced stablecoins over the past few weeks.

U.S. crypto lobbyists watched with excitement in recent days as a pair of votes cemented what they'd hoped: Congress is on their side. So many Democrats joined the sector's reliable Republican allies on those votes that crypto advocates suggest they may not have to give up much in negotiations over legislation that matters even more. Just before he left office, former President Joe Biden's IRS put a final stamp on a rule to pursue decentralized finance (DeFi) projects as brokers that would have to conduct the full range of tax reporting for users. With more than a third of Democrats on board in each chamber, there's little reason to suspect those Democrats wouldn't also be positively inclined to support other crypto topics. "For years, we’ve been playing defense — trying to protect the industry from hostile regulators and relying on compromises that, in many cases, weakened the final legislative product," said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association that advocates for pro-crypto policy in Washington. "But now we’re able to think a bit more expansively about what’s possible at the federal level." As the details are hashed out, an industry that may once have been pressured into aggressive controls on anti-money-laundering systems in order to maintain the support of some Democrats could instead afford to press on without giving ground, crypto insiders are noting. The industry's bigger prize, though, is the future legislation that will once-and-for-all set a clear system of regulations for U.S. crypto trading and transactions, and for the businesses and projects that handle people's digital assets needs. While a replacement effort may be further out than stablecoins, when it starts moving through this Congress, it could have a significantly easier path than its predecessor. Congress was flooded with new allies after the 2024 elections, in which the industry-backed Fairshake political action committee expended about $139 million to help get pro-crypto lawmakers from both parties elected. As lawmakers approach their votes this year, they'll know that a pro-crypto vote has a good chance of resulting in campaign dollars, and an opposition vote will likely result in spending aimed to snuff out their political careers. The main sources of money behind Fairshake are Coinbase, a16z and Ripple Labs, with other backers including Jump Crypto and Uniswap Labs. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in an interview outside the White House crypto summit last week that his company will keep supporting Fairshake, which he said "did an incredible job." "Our supporters in this industry are deeply committed to this political strategy," said Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Fairshake, in an interview with CoinDesk. He said the IRS votes were "a direct result of that strategy," which ignored politicians' other views and party affiliations to focus only on whether they'd push for crypto bills. Even before the recent elections, FIT21 had earned major Democratic support in the House, and a separate effort to try to get rid of a Securities and Exchange Commission crypto accounting policy saw significant bipartisan support in both chambers.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

“We are entering an unprecedented period of growth for the crypto industry, driven by greater regulatory clarity around the world and increasing institutional adoption,” said Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive officer of Ripple, in a release.

“Thanks to its early leadership in creating a supportive environment for tech and crypto innovation, the UAE is exceptionally well-placed to benefit.”

Ripple said it has seen increasing demand across the Middle East from crypto-native firms and traditional financial institutions, and has around 20% of its global customer base already operating in the Middle East.

Payments utility is also expected to drive greater stablecoin adoption in the UAE, with stablecoins offering real time settlements. That can drive further growth for Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin — which stands at a $134 million capitalization as of Thursday (meaning an equivalent amount in USD backing).

Ripple’s DFSA license adds to its growing list of over 60 regulatory approvals worldwide, including a Major Payments Institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Trust Charter, a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration from the Central Bank of Ireland, and Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) across multiple U.S. states.

Другой демократ, Кэтрин Кортес Масто из Невады, пожаловалась, что республиканцы комитета проигнорировали дебаты во время разметки — типа слушаний, призванных рассматривать и обсуждать поправки к законопроекту, — и некоторые из них T явились на слушания. «Это отличное начало, но оно еще не готово к PRIME распространению», — сказал сенатор о законопроекте, продвигаемом республиканцами. «Наценки — это беспорядочно», — сказал в ответ председатель комиссии Тим Скотт, республиканец из Южной Каролины. Сенатор Билл Хагерти, республиканец из Теннесси, который был основным автором законопроекта, назвал Закон о руководстве и установлении национальных инноваций для стейблкоинов США (Закон GENIUS) «по-настоящему двухпартийным усилием», в котором приняли участие демократы. «Он представляет собой правила здравого смысла, которые защищают потребителей, способствуют конкуренции и стимулируют инновации», — сказал Хагерти. В этом месяце отдельная попытка отменить правило Службы внутренних доходов, против которого выступает Криптo сектор, получила широкие двухпартийные голоса. Выборы 2024 года поставили республиканцев во главе обеих палат, и Скотт сделал законодательство о стейблкоинах ONE из своих главных приоритетов открытия.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Crypto tokens backed by U.S. Treasuries are at the forefront of tokenization efforts, as digital asset firms and global financial heavyweights race to put traditional instruments such as bonds, private credit and funds on blockchain rails, aiming to achieve faster settlements and operational efficiencies. BUIDL serves as a building block for multiple yield-generating offerings, and it's increasingly used as collateral on trading platforms. It's a key reserve asset for Ethena's yield-generating USDtb token, which now has a $540 million supply.

One of the leading U.S. advocates for decentralized finance (DeFi), Miller Whitehouse-Levine, is departing his job as executive director of the DeFi Education Fund, where he'll be replaced by the group's chief legal officer, Amanda Tuminelli.

Whitehouse-Levine, a fixture in U.S. crypto circles, will remain on the organization's board, according to a Thursday announcement, and a person familiar with his plans said he'll be taking a not-yet-announced role that keeps him in the industry lobbying space.

"I have made the difficult decision to leave my current role at DeFi Education Fund to pursue a new opportunity — a decision ultimately made easy knowing that Amanda’s incredibly capable leadership, passion and brilliance will lead DEF to new heights in service of the DeFi community," he said in a Thursday statement about the transition for the group, which was established in 2021.

The DeFi corner of the digital assets sector saw a major win in recent days as Congress has been moving toward the elimination of a recent Biden administration rule from the Internal Revenue Service that would have imposed potentially ruinous compliance demands on DeFi projects.

"For the first time in DeFi’s history, there is a significant, bipartisan group of U.S. policymakers and regulators thinking proactively and constructively about sensible crypto legislation, regulatory frameworks, and the way they fit with technological innovation, and our mission at DeFi Education Fund has never been more important,” Tuminelli said in a statement.

The charges stemmed from an initial coin offering Andrade conducted for AML Bitcoin in 2017 and 2018. Early court filings covered by CoinDesk alleged Andrade, a Texas resident, falsely told investors that AML Bitcoin tokens would ultimately be converted into a tradeable AML Bitcoin currency — a cryptocurrency that never launched and was named to resemble the popular Bitcoin token. The Department of Justice named famed D.C. lobbyist Jack Abramoff a co-conspirator and he pleaded guilty in 2020, paying more than $50,000 in disgorgement and interest. According to the statement, Andrade also falsely claimed that the Panama Canal Authority was close to permitting AML Bitcoin to be used for ships passing through the Panama Canal when no such agreement existed. "Fraudsters often tout new and innovative technology in order to raise money from investors. But raising money through lies and misrepresentations is neither new nor innovative.

Following two problematic tests of Ethereum's upcoming Pectra upgrade, the network's core developers decided on Thursday to create a new testnet to demonstrate the code update a final time before deployment. "A new testnet, Hooli, is going live Monday to wrap up Pectra testing," said Tim Beiko, who coordinates the ecosystem's core developers at the Ethereum Foundation, in an X post following a developer call on Thursday. Pectra will be tested on Hooli on Wednesday, March 26 — when the test chain will be upgraded to the new version of Ethereum and evaluated for performance and stability. Should everything proceed as planned, Ethereum users can expect Pectra to reach the ecosystem's main network in late April or early May. The Hooli testnet was created following complications with Pectra tests on Sepolia and Holesky, Ethereum's primary test networks. In both instances, configuration errors prevented proper testing of the Pectra upgrade. According to Beiko, Sepolia and Holesky — which are now running Pectra successfully — serve different testing purposes. "If you need to test validator exits, be on the lookout for [Hooli]! The network has faced mounting pressure from declining ETH prices, leadership transitions at the Ethereum Foundation, and growing skepticism about its ability to maintain market dominance amid competition from newer blockchains like Solana. Industry figures view the successful implementation of Pectra as crucial for restoring confidence in Ethereum's technical roadmap.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Solv is attempting to offer an "on-chain MicroStrategy" model, referencing the Michael Saylor-founded software company that now owns nearly 500,000 BTC.

BRO may appeal to institutions who wish to invest in BTC as a store of value in a similar way to Strategy (as MicroStrategy is now called) but without physically purchasing and holding it themselves. Furthermore, they may be seeking a more active yield-generating form of BTC investment.

Solv will deploy the BTC raised to various yield-generating vehicles, such as liquid staking tokens, and invested across decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world assets (RWAs) and institutional finance products.

Bitcoin's (BTC) role in decentralized finance (DeFi) is growing as the world's largest cryptocurrency evolves from more than just a store of value, Binance Research said in a report Thursday. The Bitcoin network is "evolving into a broader decentralized finance ecosystem with the emergence of Bitcoin DeFi," analyst Moulik Nagesh wrote. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . This is a sector that "unlocks bitcoin's capital efficiency" with the use of financial applications focused on lending, staking, stablecoins and decentralized exchanges (DEX's), the report said. DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without the need for traditional intermediaries. Binance noted that only ~0.8% of the bitcoin supply is currently being used in DeFi, and this presents a large "untapped opportunity." In fact, last year, Julian Love, a deal analyst at Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, said the opportunity could be as much as $1 trillion. While there has been some progress on the development of Bitcoin layer-2 networks, these platforms need greater adoption and liquidity incentives to be able to scale up effectively, Binance Research said. The network's security model is faced with "long-term sustainability challenges" as block rewards will continue to halve, the report said, thereby reducing miner incentives.

See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . This dystopian future sounds outrageous but it’s the logical endpoint of a fully government-controlled and monitored monetary system for which some prominent U.S. policymakers advocate. Its defenders argue that such a government-omniscient system would prevent crime. In reality, it would destroy the core freedoms of financial privacy and autonomy. Their programmability allows transactions to be executed automatically when specified conditions are met, unlocking enormous potential for automated finance, supply chain efficiency, and global commerce. This collaborative approach reflects an understanding that stablecoins could revolutionize global finance, enhance financial inclusion, and preserve the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the digital age. Unfortunately, some senators, especially Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), stand in stark opposition to this progress. Rather than embracing innovation, she pursues legislation that would smother stablecoins in their infancy. Senator Warren paints stablecoins as tools for illicit activity, claiming they primarily facilitate fraud, drug trafficking, and terrorist financing. Her characterization is not just inaccurate — it’s dangerously misleading. In fact, traditional cash is far more frequently used for money laundering and illicit trade than stablecoins ever have been. It would also weaken the dollar’s global dominance, as emerging economies and developing nations would turn to other digital currencies that are easier to access and use. Her constraints could not only impede the development of an important new technology, but also disrupt and harm ordinary Americans and businesses, and people around the world, who are using stablecoins today to move value across the internet as easily as sending an email or text message, often at a fraction of traditional costs. Major American corporations like Visa and PayPal are using stablecoins to settle some cross-border payments, reducing settlement times from days to minutes and lowering costs. In countries suffering from high inflation or capital controls, stablecoins provide ordinary citizens with a safe, dollar-denominated savings option, protecting their wealth from economic mismanagement. Migrant workers sending money home can do so more quickly, inexpensively, and more reliably with stablecoins than through traditional remittance services, which often charge exorbitant fees. The Warren vision rejects the open, public, universally accessible system being developed today — a system where individuals and businesses alike can transact freely, without needing permission from banks or governments. Fortunately, there is still hope for a balanced regulatory approach. Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Tim Scott (R-SC) have introduced the bi-partisan GENIUS Act which would create a constructive regulatory framework for stablecoins that addresses legitimate concerns while enabling innovation. Or will fear, misinformation, and stifling regulation hand the future of finance to other nations? The choice is clear: support innovation, enact smart regulation, and let stablecoins flourish.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://coindesk.com/opinion/2025/03/13/no-the-stablecoin-bill-isn-t-built-for-billionaires'>No, the Stablecoin Bill Isn't Built for Billionaires</a></h2><b>Source:</b> coindesk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-13 00:00:00 <p>
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (MA-D) recently sounded the alarm over new proposals on stablecoin legislation, claiming they’d give Elon Musk a “clear runway” to control U.S. money and payments. Here's what these bills actually do: the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act aim to create responsible guardrails for stablecoins, ensuring consumer protection and financial stability while encouraging innovation. Far from handing the keys to a single billionaire, they lay out clear standards so that no one — the world’s richest man or otherwise — can dominate payment infrastructure by sidestepping important safeguards. However, the transparency and composition of an issuer’s dollar reserves may vary, which some regulatory proposals aim to clarify. Contrary to the claim that these bills would allow one person to “print money,” the GENIUS Act and STABLE Act are chiefly about setting minimum reserve, auditing, and licensing standards for stablecoin issuers. Stablecoins offer innovations the legacy financial system has long struggled to provide: efficient, low-cost transfers, potentially faster settlements, and ability to instantly execute transactions that can fuel new financial products. They can be sent globally in near-real time, lowering barriers and giving everyday users more autonomy over their money, whether that be for remittances or payments for everyday purchases. By replacing cumbersome, expensive intermediaries, stablecoins empower consumers to transact more directly, preserving their privacy and autonomy without sacrificing efficiency. Encouraging stablecoin issuers to hold traditional U.S. treasuries as backing — rather than synthetic or foreign-issued substitutes — helps maintain steady demand for U.S. debt instruments and keeps the dollar anchored at the heart of global finance. Providing a predictable regulatory framework for stablecoins helps encourage developers and businesses to keep building on U.S. soil, ensuring that America remains at the forefront of this next wave of finance. While each may have its strengths and weaknesses, they reflect a growing effort in Congress to produce thoughtful, bipartisan legislation. Such legislation would reduce uncertainty, spur responsible innovation, and promote healthy competition in the digital asset marketplace. By clarifying legal obligations around reserve composition, auditing, and anti-money laundering practices, these bills aim to foster an environment where stablecoins can thrive under proper oversight — protecting consumers, upholding financial stability, and supporting national security interests. Elon Musk’s interest in digital payments, as with any ambitious project, highlights the larger trend: private sector initiatives are moving rapidly, sometimes outpacing existing laws. Establishing solid regulatory foundations for stablecoins is the first step in ensuring that emerging ventures — whether they come from tech entrepreneurs or established financial giants—must operate within rules that protect the public and preserve vital U.S. interests. It’s about providing certainty and accountability so that when a product like “X Money” or another innovative payment system inevitably comes along, it must meet rigorous standards for consumer protection and financial stability. The future of money is poised to be more digital, transparent, and open. That outcome serves everyday consumers, fortifies national security, and preserves America’s economic leadership in a rapidly evolving world.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In late 2021, two DeFi DAOs — Fei Protocol and Rari Capital — embarked on what was supposed to be a transformative merger. Their communities approved the merger with overwhelming support, and in December, Tribe DAO was born. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Since 2020, more than 65 deals have been executed by DAOs looking to scale, merge or consolidate. Today, the state of DAO M&A is more vibrant than ever. Corporate boards negotiate deals, investment banks structure financing, and legal teams ensure compliance. There’s no CEO to sign off on a deal, and token holders vote, often with unpredictable outcomes. Or they learn about it after the fact, as with Aragon's community. As we discovered in writing the State of DAO M&A report: valuations are murky, as DAO tokens fluctuate wildly, making it difficult to price acquisitions fairly or to satisfy token holder expectations, as evidenced in Fei-Rari and in Gnosis-xDAI. The absence of standards for legally binding DAO transactions prevents potentially valuable agreements from being implemented. Security concerns remain challenging for DAOs, as hacks can erase billions in value overnight. Just ask Fei's token holders, who had to cover $80 million in the Rari exploit. Imagine standardized swap and acquisition contracts, platforms for M&A discovery, or protocol conglomerates that create richer, more integrated on-chain ecosystems. But, for future deals to succeed, DAOs must rethink how they approach M&A. Better governance alignment is crucial, as DAOs need structured frameworks to align stakeholder incentives and avoid the infighting that doomed Fei-Rari. More thoughtful valuations are necessary since a token swap is not the same as a cash buyout; valuation models must account for token liquidity, governance power, and future earnings potential. Security must be a top priority, with rigorous smart contract audits and stress tests to prevent both catastrophic exploits. Merging DAOs isn’t just about putting two treasuries together. It’s about integrating communities, governance structures, and technical systems in ways that enhance — not undermine — the value of these organizations.

Donald Trump a menacé jeudi la France et l'Union européenne (UE) d'imposer des droits de douane de 200% sur leurs champagnes, vins et autres alcools si les tarifs douaniers de 50% annoncés par Bruxelles sur le whisky américain n'étaient pas abandonnés.Depuis son retour au pouvoir en janvier, le président américain a lancé toute une série d'offensives commerciales contre ses alliés comme ses concurrents, affirmant que les Etats-Unis étaient injustement traités dans les échanges internationaux.L'UE a annoncé mercredi des droits de douane sur plusieurs produits américains, dont le bourbon, les motos ou les bateaux, en représailles aux surtaxes américaines de 25% entrées en vigueur le même jour sur l'acier et l'aluminium.Ils devraient devenir effectifs le 1er avril, une journée avant les droits de douane dits "réciproques" voulus par Donald Trump.L'UE "a tout juste imposé 50% de droits de douane sur le whisky. Si ces droits de douane ne sont pas retirés immédiatement, les Etats-Unis vont rapidement imposer des droits de douane de 200% sur tous lesvins, champagnes et produits alcoolisés", a écrit le président républicain sur son réseau Truth Social.Et d'insister devant la presse: "Non, je ne plierai pas du tout - ni sur l'aluminium, ni sur l'acier, ni sur les voitures", a-t-il lancé. "Nous nous sommes fait dépouiller pendant des années et nous allons maintenant arrêter de nous faire dépouiller."Les Etats-Unis imposent depuis mercredi une surtaxe de 25% sur l'acier et l'aluminium entrant dans le pays, provoquant des représailles de la part de plusieurs pays et de l'UE.Le Canada a annoncé jeudi avoir déposé plainte devant l'Organisation mondiale du commerce (OMC), estimant que cette taxe va "à l'encontre des obligations des Etats-Unis" en matière de commerce international.Dans la journée, Bruxelles a annoncé que le commissaire européen au Commerce Valdis Dombrovskis a eu un échange vidéo avec le ministre américain de l'Economie Scott Bessent, durant lequel il a "exprimé son inquiétude de voir les droits de douane américains avoir un impact économique négatif de part et d'autre" de l'Atlantique.Les exportateurs français de vins et spiritueux ont vivement réagi, disant en avoir "assez d'être sacrifiés systématiquement pour des sujets sans rapport avec les nôtres" et souhaitant que "la Commission européenne fasse preuve de réalisme".Dans un message sur X, le ministre espagnol de l'Agriculture a relativisé la décision américaine, estimant qu'il s'agissait "d'une annonce comme une autre, ça va et ça vient. (...) Nous gardons notre calme mais faisons également preuve de fermeté."- "Clé sous la porte" -Cette réplique américaine inquiète également des restaurateurs locaux, à l'image de Franchis Schott, qui tient un établissement dans le New Jersey, pour qui "cela va simplement représenter du chiffre d'affaires qui va disparaître, c'est épouvantable. Si je perds la moitié du profit que je fais sur l'alcool, je mets la clé sous la porte."Selon le Centre du commerce international (ITC), l'UE a exporté en 2024 10,7 milliards de dollars de vins et spiritueux vers les Etats-Unis, dont 4,8 milliards uniquement pour la France. Près de 10% de la production de l'Hexagone a traversé l'Atlantique l'année écoulée.L'immense majorité des produits alcoolisés provenant d'Europe entrent aux Etats-Unis sans droits de douane, seuls 2% étant appliqués sur les vins pétillants, selon les données de l'OMC.Depuis son retour à la Maison Blanche, le président américain a multiplié le recours aux droits de douane, servant à la fois de moyen de pression sur les Etats tiers pour obtenir un accord, de moyen de protection de certains secteurs industriels américains, et de source de revenus fiscaux pour l'Etat fédéral.Jusqu'ici, Donald Trump ciblait ses trois principaux partenaires commerciaux: le Canada, le Mexique et la Chine.Le républicain a imposé 25% sur les produits canadiens et mexicains, avec des exemptions temporaires. Les produits chinois sont eux visés par 20 points de pourcentage de taxes supplémentaires, au-delà de celles déjà existantes.S'il a menacé à plusieurs reprises l'UE d'être la prochaine cible, il comptait en particulier sur la mise en place de droits de douane dits "réciproques" à compter du 2 avril pour taxer les produits européens.Ce type de droits visent à taxer les produits provenant d'un pays lorsqu'ils entrent aux Etats-Unis au même niveau que le sont les produits américains arrivant dans ce pays.bur-els/pno</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Many Democrats on the committee acknowledged the need for the bill while also seeking to add a number of amendments to add additional regulatory controls and limits, each of which was shot down with partisan votes. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the panel's ranking Democrat, led her colleagues' objections against certain provisions of the bill, which she said marks "a clear threat to our national security" in its current form. “It would be crazy to advance this bill when it’s got so many holes in it that have been pointed out, and to advance it at the exact moment that news is breaking about Donald Trump trying to create his own stablecoin with an outfit that is notorious for breaking the law,” Warren said near the end of the hearing, referring to reporting that the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial had been in talks with crypto exchange Binance.
