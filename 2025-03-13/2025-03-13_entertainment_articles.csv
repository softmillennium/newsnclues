There is a gladiatorial spectacle to Surrounded, a relatively new YouTube series that pits a lone representative of a belief or a system — a Democrat, say, or a cop — against 20 individuals who hold the opposing position. This week, the lone representative was Sam Seder, host of the progressive internet radio show and podcast The Majority Report, who engaged in a rhetorical gauntlet with an eclectic group of young and diverse Trump supporters. The result was a mix of debate club, speed chess, and musical chairs: Participants leapt from their seats to claim a space in front of Seder, where they could address a progression of claims (“Trump’s policies make the rich richer and the poor poorer,” etc.) and were removed from the spotlight only when ten of their confederates indicate that their views are not being adequately represented by raising a red flag.

Surrounded, which takes place in an almost Squid Game–like setting inside an industrial-stark nowhere space, is quite the watch: At one point in Seder’s episode, you see him square off with a young man who fiercely and falsely believes that government agencies receive tax breaks for hiring diverse employees (they don’t, because federal agencies are not private businesses); at another, you see Seder come to swift awareness that the young blonde woman in front of him is quite literally a Christian nationalist. The series comes from Jubilee Media, a Los Angeles company that’s grown into a YouTube juggernaut over the past eight years by producing social-experiment-esque content that typically involve throwing people with conflicting beliefs in the same room and seeing what happens: scientists versus flat-earthers, vegans versus meat-eaters, cops versus, uh, criminals.

Surrounded is Jubilee’s newest format, and it’s also proven to be the studio’s most head-turning effort for politically explosive bookings. Since rolling out in September, the series has shot videos with right-wing commentators Ben Shapiro, Charlie Kirk, and Michael Knowles, along with the anti-abortion activist Lila Rose. Before Seder showed up, former secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg was the lone left-leaning figure to anchor an episode. These videos reliably go viral, and Seder’s entry was no different. The full 90-minute YouTube version crossed a million views in just a few days, with its reach further elevated by clips flying across social media and a cottage industry of response videos generated in its wake. Some right-wing personalities curiously mistook Seder to be the conservative presence in the room and the Trump voters to be the liberals, presumably because they didn’t actually watch the video before commenting on it.

Speaking to Vulture about his appearance this week, Seder explains how he went into the experience without the intent to seek common ground, and what, in hindsight, he would like to have done differently.

How did you end up doing one of these videos? Did they reach out to you?

They reached out to a guy who sometimes functions as my manager. He’s out in Los Angeles, and he knew the people, and they brought up the idea before the election. We recorded back in January, back in the wake of the L.A. fires — I wasn’t even sure we were still going to do it. It was still pretty hazy when I got out there.

What made you say yes to doing this? Are you a big consumer of Jubilee’s stuff?

To be honest with you, I only had a vague awareness of it. I think I had seen some clips when some of the right-wing guys had been on it, but my daughter, who’s 19, was like, “You gotta do it. Everybody our age watches that.” So that’s what basically convinced me.

In your perspective, what was this video supposed to achieve?

I went in with the intention of trying to correct some false narratives out there. Defending Social Security was a big one for me, for example. I wanted to communicate what was going on with Project 2025. DOGE hadn’t fully geared up at that point, because we filmed in the last week of January, and they were still in that mode where they were saying these cuts only had to do with DEI. I’d been doing this for 20 years. I know what the Republican agenda is. I knew quite a bit about Project 2025. I knew quite a bit about Russell Vought, who is the head of the OMB. So I wanted to expose the dynamic that when they attack government agencies ostensibly because of DEI, what they’re really doing is what Republicans always do, which is to attack the administrative state.

So you went in ready to engage in rhetorical combat. But my understanding of why Jubilee makes these videos is to establish a sense of potential for “common ground.” Was that something you felt was possible in that room?

I don’t enter into these things with the notion of achieving common ground. Particularly with the advocates of these agendas, I don’t think they’re seeking common ground. When you’re talking about white nationalism, or Christian nationalism, or authoritarianism, there is no common ground. So for me, engaging with this isn’t so much it being about a blood sport, but more about trying to educate the audience — not the people I’m debating with. That’s my primary goal in situations like that.

How did you prepare for this?

I went over the facts behind the macro-narratives I want to talk about. They asked me to write the claims, and I tried to fashion the claims in a way where it was more policy oriented and more concrete than what I’ve seen in the past. But you can’t really be prepared. To some extent, I got thrown off a little because one of my claims was that unless you’re a billionaire, which is a proxy for wealthy people; a religious fundamentalist, which is a proxy for theocrats; or a white nationalist, you made a mistake in voting for Trump. What I did not anticipate is that everybody who would sit down with me would say, “No, actually, I am those things, and I’m so happy I voted for Trump.” I wasn’t fully prepared for people to, almost from the get-go, accept the claim and then proudly proclaim that theocracy or white nationalism is the explicit agenda.

What went through your mind you came to the realization that was what was happening? Because you had to juggle with that alongside debating people simply believed in objectively false statements.

It was exhausting, and the people they cut out were even more, shall we say, off topic. With the people who don’t know the facts, I knew it was gonna be helpful just to impeach their perspective. With the theocrat and the white nationalist, I felt like I didn’t have to do as much of the work here. I’m gonna let them espouse their agenda and allow the audience to decide if that’s the vision of America that they want.

With the theocrat, it took me a while to understand what he was actually saying in terms of he was probably espousing a society where women are subjugated by men, where trans people don’t exist, where marriage rights are not extended to anyone but heterosexual couples. If I had to do it again, I would have attempted to realize that first and then just let him espouse how he envisions America instead of fighting him so hard. Because from my perspective, I do think there is a majority of people in this country, and even a significant chunk of Trump voters, who don’t want that.

But isn’t that a risky thing to do? To sit back and say, “I’ll let them hang themselves,” because we do have a resulting situation where clips from this video then go out into the internet and right-wing commentators like Matt Walsh say, “Look at this guy destroying Sam Seder.”

Because the guy did, to use your words, hang himself. And when Matt Walsh or Michael Knowles or any of these commentators embrace that guy, it exposes them. Chris Rufo tweeted out that I don’t know about Foucault or I don’t know how to address Christian apologia, and from my perspective, I don’t care. He’s making this academic argument when my argument is, “What are the implications of this?” They may think amongst themselves that they have a “rational explanation” for why the Bible should supplant the Constitution, but I’m betting that the majority of the public who watch these things don’t want to live in a world where gay people are ostracized or women are subjugated. That’s my calculation.

In any case, people like Matt Walsh work to obfuscate the things that are at the heart of their political agenda. And by embracing somebody who is so explicit about it, it should cause their audience to realize what is at the heart of their agenda. I haven’t spent too much time noodling around, but somebody sent me Michael Knowles’s video response, and looking through his comments section on YouTube, there are people who are saying, “What are you talking about?” Which, for me, is the goal I had going into this. You might not peel off the majority of his audience. You might not even peel out a substantial chunk. But if you get some percentage of people greater than 0 percent to look at this guy with a more jaundiced eye, you might amount to something.

One of the funnier dynamics in the response to this is how a fair number of people on the internet mistook you to be the Trump supporter. I think that had a lot to do with how Jubilee cast the Trump supporters: It was mostly a young and diverse crowd who present in a way that a glancing person might code as “stereotypically progressive.” That struck me as a conscious choice. What could you tell me about that casting choice? Were you involved in the process?

I wasn’t involved at all. I mean, I flew out to L.A. for literally 24 hours to do this. The first time I saw any of these people was when I walked out to sit in the middle of the room. I had no idea who was there. I have no idea how they cast it. I haven’t really had much communication with the Jubilee people beyond them asking for a few claims, which I sent to them and them asking for me to shorten a couple. That was it.

Wait, really?

Look, I’ve been taking blind phone calls for about 20 years, first on the radio and now on my live show. So the idea of having no idea who’s gonna be on the other end of the line is something I’m comfortable with.

Did you think Jubilee’s casting choices here were trying to communicate something? It feels like there’s a very specific story being told when you’re assembling a group of Trump supporters, and they’re all young and diverse.

Firstly, I think the casting is impacted by it being in L.A., and secondly, and this is all complete conjecture on my part because I literally had no conversations with anybody associated with Jubilee about this, but I can imagine a world where they just had twenty white guys there and conservatives would complain that you’re not showing the diversity of the conservative movement. So it was probably a damned if you do, damned if you don’t type of scenario. But I have no idea about their casting process.

The age dynamic is one that really stood out to me. Many of them were younger than you by quite some margin.

All of them were significantly younger than me. I’m old! It’s possible I was the oldest person in the entire building. I’m 58!

And because of that dynamic, it felt like you were in a situation where you were the older guy having to explain life and the world to confident young people.

Oh yeah. There was one guy who I explained the child tax credit to. He said something like the government can’t control poverty, and I told him we cut child poverty by 45 percent in this country. He did not believe me, and after we were done, I brought him into the green room as I was getting my bag and brought it up on my phone. My hope is that seeing that fact provided a fundamental shift in his worldview. Now, that’s probably a fantasy of mine, but he struck me as being curious enough to find out if that was true, that there might be an opportunity for that guy to sort of reconsider all of his priors.

How did you feel talking with them?

I found it a little bit disturbing. Just the level of assuredness that they had in things I knew were so fundamentally wrong. I was a little bit disturbed by how forthright some of them were in expressing, “Yes, I’m xenophobic.”

Did you ever get the sense that some of these people were playing it up for the camera?

There were definitely a couple of people who were doing that. But I think they did a pretty good job of cutting those people out.

I noticed you made it a point to sort of shake the other person’s hand when their turn was up. Tell me about that choice.

I just think I’m a polite person. And honestly, I appreciated them doing this. There are circumstances where there are people whose hand I would not shake, but I need to know them first and have a reason.

Have you kept in touch with anybody since you shot the video?

No. I’ve seen some of them on Twitter, but I haven’t. The only conversation I had with any of them outside of sitting in that chair was that one guy who just came back and I showed the cut in child poverty.

I want to close out with a question about the format. You went in with the specific goal of refuting false narratives and getting your perspective out there. It seems to me that these Jubilee YouTube videos have a certain belief in the idea of staging these debates as a force that can cultivate empathy. I’m curious what you think about that very premise.

To be honest with you, I don’t know. I don’t know if there’s much value in me thinking about that because I don’t have control over it. This is the media terrain that we have, and you have to deal with the terrain that you have. In a perfect world, I would be very skeptical about YouTube, and video in general, frankly, as a means in which to disseminate this stuff. I got into this during a time when the blogosphere was coming up, and the value of a blog was that the comment section was within the same medium as the blogging voice. So there’s a parity there that I think, over time, regulates misinformation in a way that watching a video and then going down to the comments doesn’t.

But I have to play the hand that I have. I’m 58. The idea of having a YouTube show was not something I aspired to, but that’s the terrain in which our politics are increasingly being fought. I was an MSNBC contributor once, but I believe I’m reaching a more important segment of people doing this than I did on cable television.",vulture
https://vulture.com,100 Fans Are Ready to Sue Tool,https://www.vulture.com/article/tool-lawsuit-100-fans-festival-setlist.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 16:07:32 GMT","“The fact that we’re even talking about this, at all, tells you Tool has a problem.” Photo: Gonzales Photo/Alamy

Is Tool being a bunch of tools? Part of their fan base seems to think so. At the band’s inaugural destination festival in Punta Cana this past weekend, attendees — some of whom shelled out thousands of dollars to be there — raged after a promise of “two unique sets” was not upheld. Instead, the Tool in the Sand Festival performances had several overlapping songs: Ten were played the first night, then nine the second — with four repeats. (Social-media footage showed people booing and hurling expletives at Maynard James Keenan & Co. during the second night.) Now, one disappointed attorney who was present at the festival is initiating a class-action lawsuit. Stas Rusek, a longtime fan leading the case, told Vulture that roughly 100 attendees have already signed up. While he doesn’t have a filing date in mind, Rusek plans to do so as soon as “ethically possible” after investigating all of his clients’ claims. “I expect a few dozen more per day for the next few weeks,” he adds.

While not exactly a Fyre Festival level of chaos, the Tool quandary presents a new and amusing legal logic to ponder: If your favorite artist asserts that they’ll do two distinctive concerts and doesn’t follow through, are you entitled to financial compensation? Peter Nicolas, an endowed chair-in-law at the University of Washington, is at a bit of a loss. “The fact that we’re even talking about this, at all, tells you Tool has a problem,” he says. “It may not necessarily be a legal problem, even though they’re being threatened with a lawsuit. But it’s definitely a public-relations problem.”

One hundred fans have signed up for the class-action lawsuit, with more expected to be added in the coming weeks. What does this number tell you about the strength of the case?

The number doesn’t tell you much about the strength of the legal case. It’s the type of thing no band wants. The main thing I tell my students, which relates to the intersection of music and law, is even when the law is on your side, something like this doesn’t look good. As an artist, you don’t want fans threatening to sue you. That’s bad. The fans are obviously mad and perhaps have a basis to be mad. With social media, you’re able to quickly rack up signatures for stuff like this. It’s low-stakes to sign up.

The lawsuit hinges on the fact that fans were promised “two unique set lists” at the festival. How could one define “unique” in a lawsuit like this?

I think the fans interpreted it as there was going to be one set of songs for night one and one set of songs for night two. That’s where the crux of the dispute is, to the extent that the basis for the lawsuit is false advertising. There might be a little bit of playing fast and loose with lingo and the word “unique.” There are two different ways one can interpret that word. What if it was, “Each night we’ll play one single and unique song”? There’s a legitimate argument that fans expected no overlap, and there’s also an argument for the band that “unique” doesn’t necessarily mean every song in the set list. Listen, I’m not a Tool fan myself. I don’t know which of those songs are their go-to songs. Can I do a personal comparison?

Of course. I’m sure there are people reading this who are unfamiliar with Tool’s discography.

I’m a big Cher fan. If I were going to a five-day festival where Cher was going to headline, I would want to hear “If I Could Turn Back Time” every day. There’s certain things where it’s like: Is the song iconic? Is it associated with the deep cuts? Are four repeat songs excessive in a set of nine or ten songs? Probably. But I’m unsure if there’s a strong claim on false advertising.

Does the high price of the festival factor into this at all? Some of the weekend packages went for over $7,000 when tallying up tickets and hotels.

I’m someone who buys concert tickets a lot at different price points. Here’s the thing: Everybody is going to see the same music. The tickets that are more expensive usually involve greater access, whether it’s the distance from the stage or an opportunity for a meet and greet. That feeds into what the contract is between Tool and its fans, or the promoters for Tool and its fans. As long as the advertising itself wasn’t actually deemed misleading, the contract between them is what happens when you buy the ticket and agree to all those terms and conditions. I have no doubt that buried in there are all sorts of things like, There’s no guarantee for specific songs played and it’s all at the discretion of the performers.

The attorney spearheading the lawsuit was present at the festival, which makes his effort to rally fans to sign up all the more personal. Do you feel that makes a difference at all, as opposed to a random attorney who doesn’t have strong feelings toward the band?

I don’t want to criticize the lawyer, but one of the first things they taught us in law school was “never represent yourself.” And that’s because what a disinterested lawyer would do is bring in that objectivity. He, as a fan, is naturally upset. I don’t discount that. But a disinterested lawyer would tell him, “Look, it’s probably not a strong case.” I’m not saying there’s no chance, but there’s a lot of things working against this particular lawsuit, and it’s going to cost you a lot of money. What that means, though, is it makes it worse for Tool. Since this person is personally affected, using his own time, and not trying to persuade another lawyer, he’s motivated. He’s already caused them trouble simply from the negative publicity. My gut tells me that this isn’t going to go very far in terms of a court suit. That doesn’t mean it won’t influence things.

Tool has yet to comment about anything related to the case. What does that suggest in terms of that influence?

If you think there’s a serious lawsuit, you don’t want your clients going out and talking unless you know what’s going on. You don’t want them to say something that might make the lawsuit even worse. As a business — and any band is ultimately a business — they’ve got a public-relations problem. These people, who are dedicated enough to spend $7,000 to attend this type of festival, are what feed them. If I were managing and advising Tool, I’d say, “Without saying we did anything legally wrong, we acknowledge the unhappiness of the fans.” And I’d voluntarily rebate a portion of the ticket prices. Again, not because they’re legally obligated to. It’s just a good gesture. I suspect something like that might happen. Maybe it’ll be negotiated with this particular lawyer, or maybe the band will decide to do it. I suspect there will be a brief negotiation to get this lawsuit not to happen. You don’t want this. Artists should be sued for copyright infringement. They shouldn’t be sued by their fans.

Does a lawsuit like this worry you at all, in terms of a precedent being set for touring musicians and what they could open themselves up to in the future?

It’s not the worst thing in the world if artists are more careful about how they speak and what they put out there. That’s going to be the natural next step: If there’s any concession here, the lawyers will be like, “Make sure you let me look at your advertising before it goes out. We don’t want to create a potential liability.” What wouldn’t be a good thing if a fan sued for a reason like, “I didn’t like how the timbre of this artist’s voice sounded that night.” Some things are beyond the control of the artist. But this is something that can be controlled.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Shout-out to Robert Pattinson’s Weird Little Voices,https://www.vulture.com/article/shout-out-to-robert-pattinsons-weird-little-voices.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 13:30:10 GMT","Mickey 17 marks another entry in the actor’s pantheon of particular accents, which includes The Lighthouse and The Boy and the Heron. Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Everett Collection (Eric Chakeen/A24, Warner Bros.), GKIDS

What is Mickey Barnes supposed to sound like? He’s part New Yorker, maybe, part beleaguered high-school nerd, part cat trying to get into a room it’s not supposed to be in. The latter comparison feels apt given that Robert Pattinson based the voice of the titular Mickey 17 character in part on Stimpy, the cat from the Ren & Stimpy cartoon. Mickey 17 is Pattinson’s latest vocal experiment and yet another opportunity for the actor to throw himself far from the heartthrob he’s known to be and into territory much weirder and more interesting than his looks alone could ever convince you he is.

Pattinson infuses Mickey 17’s nervous disposition with a voice that wobbles and groans with abject misery, pitching his tone upward so it sounds like a door creaking on its hinges. While many British actors approach the “American accent” as a sweeping attempt to hit all 50 states, Pattinson goes for region (like his “Hahvahd Yahd”–lite New England drawl in The Lighthouse) and specificity (that native New York bite in Good Time), hitting a tone or pitch that echoes a character’s, well, character. He’s gone up higher for other roles before, like his shrill turn as a rotten southern preacher in The Devil All the Time and his sassy French accent in The King. He’s gone lower when playing Batman and for his California drawl in Map to the Stars. He’s put himself through the accent wringer so many times that when he actually does play English — as he did in Tenet and The Lost City of Z — there’s a novelty to his posh affectation, as if perhaps he was making that up the whole time, too.

There are lots of strange actors currently who contort and modulate their bodies and looks by appealing to their distinctive features. Barry Keoghan can change the tenor of a scene just by shifting his shoulders; Rami Malek has built a career on showing up and blinking either too much or too little. We’ve seen physical chameleons gaining and losing weight or piling on a bunch of prosthetics. There are endless ways to change your appearance onscreen, but it’s rarer for a guy to use his own body like a ventriloquist’s dummy. While Pattinson has long worked to shed the pretty-boy type he played in the Twilight films, he has rarely altered his look; sometimes he dyes his hair or has a beard, but you always know when you’re looking at Robert Pattinson. Part of what makes him such an undeniable movie star is that the audience sees him through his characters, whether or not they’re able to hear him. As with Christian Bale, yet another Batman, it’s difficult to remember what he’s actually supposed to sound like, his voice now distorted and amplified across a number of bizarre characters. In interviews, it’s hard to take Pattinson’s real voice seriously: Is that really what he’s supposed to sound like? Or is this just another put-on?

Pattinson’s best and weirdest voice appears in a film in which he’s never physically present onscreen. In the English dub of Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron, Pattinson lends the heron an unsavory croak. He is as unrecognizable as an actor could be, disappearing so thoroughly into the part that it’s easy to question if it’s really Pattinson down in that strange bird. The animation puts Pattinson’s physical twitchiness and good looks at a remove; he contorts all that is magnetic about himself as a performer and spits it out through the character’s beak.

In conversation with Bong Joon Ho in GQ, Pattinson told his Mickey 17 director that if he feels he’s repeating himself, he worries a director might find him fake. That same approach, perhaps, explains why Pattinson pushes himself to sound different from role to role. After playing the same character for five Twilight movies in a row, he never wants anyone to know what they’ll see — or hear — next when they look at him on the big screen. That constant state of surprise makes it all the way into the text of Mickey 17. In the near(ish) future of the film, scientists have created a 3-D printer that can make multiple copies of living humans in order to kill and remake and re-kill the same person with the same biology over and over like a guinea pig. Though each Mickey is Mickey, the dynamic that emerges between Mickey 17 and his double, Mickey 18, is that of beta and alpha. If 17’s voice is Stimpy’s, 18’s is “more like Ren,” as Pattinson told Empire. The actor lowers his voice slightly, granting the newer Mickey a more confident, brusque personality. The doubles may look and move the same, but when Mickey 17 looks at Mickey 18, he’s flooded with terror. It’s not that he’s afraid of what he sees but of what he hears. He may know very well what his multiple looks like, but Mickey 17 never knows what the man who looks like him is going to say.",vulture
https://vulture.com,‘A Big Fat No’: Two Rock Hall Voters Dissect Their 2025 Ballots,https://www.vulture.com/article/rock-hall-of-fame-2025-anonymous-ballot.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:30:34 GMT","“I was very disappointed there weren’t more women nominated.” (From left: Liam Gallagher, Cyndi Lauper, and Jack White.) Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Getty Images (Harry Durrant, Scott Legato), Didier Messens/Redferns

Sorry, boomers. If this year’s Gen X–heavy Rock & Roll Hall of Fame shortlist indicates anything, it’s that your reign is coming to an end. This evolution was inevitable for the Rock Hall, which has recently rebranded itself as a more generalized hub for popular music. However, as one member notes, these changes could give the vocal “change the name to the Music Hall of Fame” movement more validation. “I believe the organization is doing their best, so I don’t rage at the nominators the way some people do,” they say. “But sometimes you wind up with strange ballots — and this is one of the stranger ballots.” Another member is more blunt: “I was very disappointed that there weren’t more women nominated. There had been a trend in recent years of trying to right the gender imbalance, so I was surprised it was so male dominated.” This year’s shortlist is the most regressive in years for gender diversity, with only four artists (Cyndi Lauper, Mariah Carey, the White Stripes’ Meg White, and New Order’s Gillian Gilbert) representing a female contingent. “I really have no idea who’s going to get in,” the voter adds with a sigh.

So let’s talk it out. For the fourth consecutive year, Vulture has gathered two voters for the Rock Hall to anonymously analyze what their ballots look like. (I was invited to join the voting committee this year, which I accepted.) Voter 1 has been involved for “about ten years,” while Voter 2 has reached the five-year mark. While their strategies and allegiances may vary, they’re both in firm agreement on one thing: Why the hell is Chubby Checker there?

Bad Company

Voter 1: Are they a major rock act? No. Are they an ever-present classic-rock act heard on the radio to this day? Absolutely. I like them more than I want to admit, largely because Paul Rodgers has a fantastic rock-and-roll voice. “Feel Like Makin’ Love” may be a meathead anthem, but it’s catchy. I won’t vote for them, though, because I’m trying to use my vote strategically to help women and people of color.

Voter 2: When you look at people talking about the Rock Hall and saying, “Why isn’t X inducted?,” Bad Company is up there every year. It’s a quintessential rock supergroup. You have Paul Rodgers and Simon Kirke, so you have links to Free, Mott the Hoople, and King Crimson. They’re sort of the connective tissue between all the British bands of the ’60s and everyone who came after. They have a good chance of getting in without my vote.

The Black Crowes

Voter 1: I’d be a liar if I didn’t cop to the fact they’ve had hits I’ve liked. But do I think they deserve to be on this ballot? No, not over other people. It’s possible to love an act and think they don’t need to be in the Rock Hall. This comes up with the Monkees argument every year. I love the Monkees, but I don’t feel it’s a great outrage that they’re not inducted. The Black Crowes are fairly derivative. If they get in, it’s because people will say, “When you think rock and roll in the ’90s, you think Black Crowes.”

Voter 2: It had never occurred to me that the Black Crowes, of all bands, would get nominated. That’s no shade on them because I find them to be fantastic. I just don’t think they’re Rock Hall–worthy. They’re part of the great southern-rock tradition and fit in that lineage, but who have they influenced?

Mariah Carey

Voter 1: I buy the argument that Mariah Carey’s hybridization of Whitney Houston–style singing with hip-hop aesthetics is influential. She’s also a songwriter, lest we forget. I just don’t love the material. Bluntly, it felt good to let her go by for at least one ballot. In a world where everybody from Radiohead to Janet Jackson didn’t get in on their first ballot, why was it such an outrage that Mariah didn’t, either? Unlike Whitney, who had to do a Teddy Pendergrass duet before she actually broke in the mid-’80s, Mariah launched her career with five No. 1 hits. She hit the ground running with a promotional battle plan that was like the D-Day landing. This gal has rarely waited very long for anything.

Voter 2: I’m a huge fan. Yes, she’s closely associated with Christmas, but people forget how massive she was in the ’90s and early aughts. She’s in the Songwriters Hall of Fame. When you’re thinking about mixing pop, hip-hop, soul, and R&B, she excelled at it all.

Chubby Checker

Voter 1: This one bugs me. His career is overshadowed by one big and important hit. About a decade ago, the Rock Hall very briefly tried doing a thing where they inducted songs. It felt a little half-assed, but if any song deserves to be in the Rock Hall, it’s “The Twist.” That said, the only reason Chubby recorded “The Twist” — which was originally by Hank Ballard and the Midnighters — was because Dick Clark told him to. The song is greater than the man.

Voter 2: I was befuddled. I’m not sure why he was nominated in this main Performer category. I’m surprised he wouldn’t get in as an Early Influence. It feels like with a lot of those artists of his caliber, that’s where they’re placed. I don’t understand this at all.

Joe Cocker

Voter 1: I’m partially disappointed by this nomination because it would’ve been nice if he had been on the ballot while alive. I’m still deciding if I’m going to vote for him. He’s a very distinctive vocalist, but the recorded output is spotty. “Up Where We Belong” and “You Are So Beautiful” aren’t priority songs in the history of rock and roll. You’re basically voting for him as a song stylist. It’s comparable to Chubby Checker in that the songs slightly overshadow the career, but the career is pretty great.

Voter 2: This was another one that was a bit of a head-scratcher for me, only because it was like, Huh, that’s right, he’s not in. He sits in the Linda Ronstadt–type category in that he’s such a wonderful interpreter of music and other artists’ songs. As a vocalist, he’s peerless. What his impact is, I don’t know. I didn’t end up voting for him, but I could see him getting in.

Billy Idol

Voter 1: Do I need to vote for this guitar-wielding white man? Maybe not. This nomination is basically about Billy playing ball with the Rock Hall. Not to be too cynical, but appearing at a couple of ceremonies is notoriously a way to get on the ballot. Good for you, buddy. The main thing I love about him is he’s a tough genre categorization. He’s pop, he’s punk, he’s New Wave. He even qualified as hair metal. If anything gets me to vote for Billy, it’s his shape-shifter nature.

Voter 2: I would never have anticipated Billy Idol getting inducted. It makes a lot of sense, though. When you think of ’80s solo acts, he was huge. He started off in Generation X as a real punk-rocker and translated that attitude to rock and pop music for decades. But this year, there were other people I felt needed my vote more.

Joy Division/New Order

Voter 1: However many times they appear, I’ll check that box. If ever there were a cause célèbre for my generation, it should be them. The combination of the two bands is sensible. It’s not cheating.

Voter 2: They weren’t exactly a no-brainer, but I’m like, Yeah, it’s about time. It’s funny that the Rock Hall insists on lumping them together, because they’re so different in terms of their specific sound. When you’re just looking at influence, they both continue to reverberate.

Cyndi Lauper

Voter 1: I think the world of her. I slightly agonized over voting for Cyndi two years ago in a Billy Idol sense where I was like, Am I doing this because I’m a Gen-Xer and I have warm feelings, or does she actually deserve it? In the end, I did, and this year it’s even easier for me. First of all, there aren’t enough women on this ballot. Cyndi is a titanic vocalist. She’s a songwriter. “Time After Time” has become a standard. Yes, the career gets thin after the first two albums, but what she achieved on those albums — especially She’s So Unusual — is vital and important enough. The fact that she’s one award shy of an EGOT tells you the quality of her talent.

Voter 2: Cyndi was No. 1 for me on this ballot. I was upset a few years ago when she didn’t get in. Everyone associates her with the ’80s and her first record, but she’s so much more than that. She writes her own songs and has written so many beautiful ones about important topics like abortion. She’s a vocalist with a singular voice. You can’t look at the ’80s without her. She paved the way for any female artist who wants to carve out their own path and not follow convention. I could talk for hours about Cyndi. It’s a capital, big check-mark “yes.”

Maná

Voter 1: There’s a snowball’s chance in hell Maná will get in unless we have enough voters who understand Latin rock. There are certain acts the Rock Hall puts forth that almost feel like trial balloons for somebody they eventually wind up inducting via a side category. I have a feeling Maná will be one of those.

Voter 2: I’m not very familiar with them. Still, I’m happy the Rock Hall nominated Maná. When we talk about popular music, sometimes we get stuck in certain countries. I applaud them for saying, “No, this is a rock band who’s influential around the world.”

Oasis

Voter 1: Oasis has a brand to protect. They are the turds in the punch bowl of rock and roll. They have to act like they’re above it all and don’t give a shit, though Liam said he would show up if they got inducted. I won’t vote for them. I have a hard time seeing the influence. I suspect a lot of the people voting for them are ten years younger than me who remember the ’90s a little more fondly than I do.

Voter 2: They’re so influential, almost in spite of themselves. It’s been 30 years since they first emerged, and bands that are still forming are saying, “I want to sound like Oasis.” The fact they’re coming around to do a victory lap, to say, “Hey, remember us? We did it right first, we’re the best” — I love that. They’re massively popular in America. People forget about that. I voted for them because the spectacle of them showing up would be hilarious.

OutKast

Voter 1: OutKast should come pre-checked on the ballot. What took so long? These guys have been eligible for five years. There was a period in America when they were the consensus stars of their era. They were an act that hip-hop heads and boring white people liked equally.

Voter 2: I absolutely voted for OutKast. I was a bit disappointed there was only one hip-hop artist on the ballot again this year because when you only have one, it almost looks like they’re the token nominee. But when you’re talking about Atlanta hip-hop and southern hip-hop, the influence is incalculable. We’ve had a lot of hip-hop inducted from the East and West Coasts. Making sure southern hip-hop is represented is important because it’s such a dominant force.

Phish

Voter 1: If I were going to rank this ballot, Phish would be dead last. A big fat no. I come by my distaste honestly: About ten years ago, I was at a bar with some buddies; I was relatively sober and something had been playing on the jukebox for about 15 minutes. I was finally like, “What is this shit music?” It was in minute 18 of a 20-minute track from the Phish album A Live One. Some jerk had used his $2 for TouchTunes to put on a Phish track because (a) he’s a Phishhead and (b) he wanted to punk the whole bar. All the clichés apply. I do appreciate that Trey Anastasio is a genuine fan of rock history. I just can’t stand the music.

Voter 2: I didn’t appreciate Phish until I saw them live. A few years ago, Trey Anastasio inducted Genesis into the Rock Hall and Phish played “Watcher of the Skies.” That unlocked something in my head. I was like, Oh, they’re a prog band. I think that’s the key to why they got nominated because they’re from that lineage. It’s polarizing to call them a jam band, so I hesitate to do that. I didn’t vote for them, just because I felt there were other people who deserved it more this particular year.

Soundgarden

Voter 1: They arguably could’ve gotten in before Nirvana and Pearl Jam and have a bit more influence than them. They were in the Seattle scene long before Nirvana even released an album. I’m the problem because I’ve never voted for them. I’m trying to find room for Soundgarden this year because they deserve it. This is morbid, but after Chris Cornell died, why didn’t they get in the following year?

Voter 2: They’ve probably been dinged for so long because they draw so much on the metal side, especially their earlier stuff. I can see people being a little put off because they hewed toward that end rather than, say, someone else from Seattle who was a bit poppier, like Nirvana. Soundgarden is heavy, but they’re extremely influential. Chris Cornell’s voice was unreal. They were a “classic band,” so I voted for them. It’s long overdue.

The White Stripes

Voter 1: I love the White Stripes, but I’ll confess I didn’t vote for them a few years ago. I thought, They don’t need it because they’re a slam dunk. Whoops. Won’t make that mistake again. Jack White is a walking history of rock and roll. Meg White is an underrated drummer. She’s not flashy, but she was the right drummer for that band. I hope if they get in, she can overcome her stage fright and appear with Jack. That would be a gasp.

Voter 2: I voted for them. In the early aughts, they single-handedly kicked off so much of what was defined as rock: the Strokes and then onward into all the post-punk with Franz Ferdinand. They were the linchpin for a lot of that. Everyone knows Jack for how he is now as a solo artist, but Meg’s drumming was so unique and the White Stripes wouldn’t have worked without her. Over the years, there’s been more of a reassessment of her drumming because there was so much misogyny and sexism directed toward her. People are finally saying, “No, they were equals.”",vulture

Clap if you want to know what’s going on with Wendy Williams. The former Wendy Williams Show host, who has been in a court-ordered guardianship since 2022, went to a hospital on March 10 after being escorted out of her assisted-living facility by police, and later said that she passed a mental-capacity test “with flying colors.” After leaving the hospital, Williams spoke in her first interview on video, hitting back at her conservatorship.

Why did Wendy Williams go to the hospital?

Williams and her caretaker Ginalisa Monterroso, who is not connected to the guardianship, wanted her to get an independent medical evaluation because they do not believe she needs to be in the assisted-living facility she has previously compared to prison due to allegedly isolating and restrictive conditions.

The New York Post previously reported that the NYPD had shown up after Williams dropped several notes that read “Help! Wendy!!” out of a window in her assisted-living facility the morning of March 10. During a Tuesday interview she did with Williams on The Breakfast Club, Monterroso clarified that she personally called the police and asked them to conduct a welfare check. “I am not incapacitated as I’ve been accused, and this floor that I live on is the memory unit,” Williams recalled telling officers upon their arrival. “The people who live there don’t remember anything, unlike me. Why am I here? What is going on? It’s a cry for help.” The police ultimately escorted her from the building into an ambulance that took her to a local hospital.

And she said she passed a psychiatric evaluation?

Yes. While calling into Good Day New York from the hospital on March 11, Williams claimed that she took mental-competency tests at the hospital and “passed with flying colors.” TMZ previously reported that she scored a “10 out of 10” on a psychiatric exam. On The Breakfast Club, Monterroso explained that Williams passed two tests to determine that she had “competency” and could make decisions, one of which involved ten questions that she answered correctly. According to Williams, the queries included “simple things” like who the current president is and when her birthday is.

Monterroso — who alleged that Williams’s guardian, Sabrina Morrissey, was at the hospital and attempted to prevent the tests from taking place — suggested that the results can be used in court to help Williams’s case.

What has Williams herself said?

Accompanied by her niece Alex Finnie, Williams spoke with Entertainment Tonight on March 13, taking the opportunity to criticize her guardian, Morrissey. “We came back from dinner, and apparently police were called because Coterie here was saying that I took my aunt from this facility and whisked her away,” Finnie says in the video, referencing the senior-living facility where Williams resides. Finnie says this contradicts Morrissey’s statement to TMZ claiming Williams is free to leave the facility as she pleases.

“They are lying to me when they say I can go out and do what I wanna do,” Williams says. “This is my niece, Alex, she just flew in from Miami, okay. I just came from the hospital, so we are going out to celebrate.”

What do we know about her diagnosis?

Williams was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia and progressive aphasia in 2023, a press release announced last year. However, she later publicly denied the diagnosis and has maintained that she is “not cognitively impaired.” Morrissey, her guardian, recently affirmed to Vanity Fair that she sees “issues” with Williams’s speech when it’s “not scripted;” Williams scoffed at that suggestion on The Breakfast Club.

Why is she in a guardianship?

Her guardianship was instated in 2022 on the grounds that she needed to be protected from financial abuse. Her bank believed that she had been exploited, and Morrissey was appointed as her guardian.

When asked on Good Day New York if she would be willing to get a financial adviser if she were released from the guardianship, Williams replied, “I’ve had that for years. Of course, [I will get] a financial adviser, of course, somebody to look over my money. The money I have right now is all with my guardian person.” Williams previously alleged in Lifetime’s 2024 documentary Where Is Wendy Williams? that Morrissey had stolen money from her. (Morrissey later filed a complaint alleging that Williams did not have the capacity to consent to the doc.)

What does Williams want to do next?

Williams said on Good Day New York that getting out of her guardianship is her “number one most important thing.” Beyond that, she has hopes of staying in New York and “going back to work.” In the more recent future, she is scheduled to call into The View on March 14. As of her Tuesday Breakfast Club interview, Williams said she was still in the hospital. It’s currently unclear if and when she will have to return to the assisted-living facility.",vulture

https://vulture.com,‘The Pitt’: Patrick Ball on Langdon vs. Robby and Santos,https://www.vulture.com/article/the-pitt-patrick-ball-langdon-robby-standoff-santos-fights.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:26:08 GMT","Photo: Warrick Page/Max

In the tenth hour of The Pitt’s shift, a standoff reaches its boiling point. When we first meet Dr. Frank Langdon (Patrick Ball), the hotshot senior ER resident seems to be heir apparent to Noah Wyle’s harried leader Dr. Robby. Langdon is charismatic in a banter-forward way, and as we learn from brief glimpses of his personal life, a dad under a lot of pressure to hold his life together. Over the course of the season, Langdon develops a bond with newcomer resident Mel (Taylor Dearden) while clashing hard with new intern Dr. Santos (Isa Briones), a hotshot herself who bristles against Langdon’s stern reprimands for her mistakes and oversteps. But the stakes are higher than they seem: By episode ten, Santos has started to suspect that Langdon is overprescribing benzos to his patients and stealing the excess for himself. She confides this in Robby and, in a blistering confrontation at the end of the episode, Robby confronts Langdon, makes him open his locker, and finds his stash of pain meds. As Langdon tries to defend himself, blaming a back injury from helping his parents move, Robby orders him out of the hospital.

Aside from an appearance on Law & Order, The Pitt is Ball’s first TV role, and though some of the show’s audience might have not expected this twist, he knew that confrontation was coming from the jump. It was, in fact, his audition scene with Wyle, though as filming on the series actually started, Ball wasn’t sure exactly how the show’s storylines would converge to get Langdon and Robby to this moment. Ball grew up watching ER with his parents, who are medical professionals in their own right, and drew on all this experience in the audition room opposite Wyle. “John Wells goes, ‘Okay, take whatever time you need,’” Ball remembers. “I was like, ‘John Wells, I was born for this. Let’s rock, baby.’”

Did you know from the beginning that Langdon was stealing pain medication?

From fairly early on. That wasn’t part of the initial rounds of auditions, but when they decided to have me screen test, they included that scene from episode ten. It was my first time doing anything like this. They fly me out to L.A., take me to [Pitt executive producer] John Wells’s headquarters, and I’m sitting there with Noah. We do the first couple of scenes, which were just banter, and then we get to that big freak out.

What was it like jumping right into that fight?

Noah was really generous. We were laughing, we were playing, it didn’t feel precious. I think I have a lot of experiential overlap with Langdon. I’ve gotten in a lot of trouble. [Laughs.] And that scene is the closest thing you’re going to get to a break-up scene in The Pitt. He’s my brother and my mentor. Langdon thinks there’s an understanding that there’s a lot of trauma inherent in what we do and we’re just doing the best to soldier on. And then Robby says, “No, you took it too far. You’re on your own because you fucked up.”

We’ve seen a few glimpses of Langdon’s life outside the hospital. We know he has a wife and kids and a new dog. How did you fill in the backstory of how he ended up here?

He’s a young dad, got two kids, and I think both at home and work, he doesn’t have time to process what he’s feeling. He’s got to do the next right thing for the other person — whether that’s a patient or a 2-year-old or my wife who’s stuck at home dealing with the 2-year-old while he’s off doing his dream job. He’s someone who’s trying to figure out how to be who people need him to be. There’s a certain amount of ego to that and a certain amount of pride, but also an incredible amount of responsibility. I have to be excellent because if I am not excellent, people die.

You knew that fight was coming, but then you had to go and film all the episodes before it. How did you approach them, knowing what would be revealed about Langdon?

We worked almost completely chronologically. They dropped these episodes to us one at a time, so we didn’t know exactly what was going to happen, but I knew that in episode ten the drugs were going to come out and I was going to get fired. It was this thing that was looming. If you’re playing Hamlet, you can get everything right, but if you fuck up “to be or not to be,” you’re dead. So there’s this huge scary thing looming over me, but when we got to it on the day, it was just fun. Noah’s an actor’s actor. He has that incredible ability to go out on a limb and get to the scary territory while also being a generous and present scene partner.

Did you watch ER? There’s an interesting parallel in the fact that Noah’s character Carter had a painkiller addiction for back pain on that show.

My mom’s a lifelong ER nurse and my dad’s a lifelong paramedic. We grew up watching two shows every week, The West Wing and ER. It’s really crazy I now get to work with these guys. When this job came along, I made a point of not going back and watching ER because we were doing a completely different thing and I didn’t want to be consciously or subconsciously informed by it. But right before I went for the screen test, I was like, I should watch one random episode, and I ended up picking out the one where Carter gets sent to rehab. It was amazing, though I’m glad I didn’t watch more than I did. If you just get to know Noah watching ER, you’ll think Carter is who he is. But the guy I got to be on set with and who’s become a dear friend is a different person than that, so I’m glad I didn’t focus on the previous project he’d done.

What’s it like for your parents to watch you on The Pitt?

My mom sends me text messages. She gets mad at me for not wearing eye protection in the trauma scenes, and I’m like, “Mom, nobody’s got time for that!” It’s actually been a secret mission of mine to maximize my character’s relationship with the nurses because that is literally my mom’s job. I want those relationships to be as rich and respectful as possible. Kristin Villanueva, who plays Princess, and I found this relationship where she’s the nurse who always has to remind me to put my gloves on, because I’m the guy who’s always moving fast and scatter-brained. But my parents do love it. They were with me when I got the screen test and they read through the episode with me and the first thing they said was, “This checks out.”

I’m interested in the two very different dynamics that Langdon has with Mel and Santos. Let’s start with Santos: What do you think it is about her that sets him off?

Working with Isa Briones is amazing. She comes from the theater like me, and there’s a tinkering-ness about her. We’re both tinkering as we go along. But with Santos, that relationship is fraught. Santos comes into that environment on her first day being like, “I’m the shit,” and that rubs Langdon the wrong way because he’s been there for years longer than her. He really respects authority and the chain of command, so when somebody doesn’t want to respect that, it causes major problems. But I think that whenever Langdon came in for his first day of work, he was probably a lot like Santos. There’s projection there. It’s a generational thing, too. Robby was trained in a tough-love tradition, and Langdon probably was too, but the conversation has shifted, and what we deem appropriate between mentors and mentees has changed.

Then with Mel, Langdon can really connect with her and their relationship is a lot warmer. I thought there was something lovely about him getting, for instance, that an assignment digging out gravel from a guy’s wound would be just the right job for her.

Taylor is such a craftsperson, because she’s very unlike Mel in real life. Langdon sees in Mel someone who’s got the right stuff, is in it for the right reasons, and is also a caretaker for her sister in the way that Langdon is a caretaker for his kids. He’s struggling with the weight of responsibility and he sees that in Mel. The way she sees the world is also appropriate to how Langdon understands the job: There’s a level of compartmentalization that’s necessary for survival.

But she’s also sympathetic and generous, which is what Langdon needs in his life. Something I talked about with Noah early on is that Langdon is figuring out the difference between being labor and management. Langdon thinks he does his specific job as good as anyone and that he just has to lock in. Robby’s trying to encourage him to learn what it means to be a leader. That means backing up and trying to see what other people bring to the table. That’s something he can do with Mel. When we work together with an autistic patient, Langdon doesn’t understand what he’s missing, and Mel comes in and teaches me about how the care this person needs might be different from what other people need.

This show puts a lot of emphasis on the realism of what you’re putting onscreen, especially in terms of medical procedures. Was there a sequence that was the hardest to film?

We had one episode where we do a reverse crike [a cricothyrotomy] on a kid. Robby’s going in and trying to feed a wire up backwards through this kid, and I’m reaching down into his mouth with gauze and a forcep and going in with a breathing tube. But we’re not cutting around the sequence and all the props have to be switched out because we have long and short versions of them depending on what actually has to go inside the actor. Meanwhile, you’re speaking what sounds like Ancient Greek medical terms, which you can’t get wrong because it all means something specific. If you do get it wrong, there will be a bajillion people out on the internet who will know.

Your parents will call!

And I wouldn’t be able to go home for Thanksgiving.

How do you memorize all those terms?

My theater background is useful. It’s a lot like doing Shakespeare. If you try to rise to the style of the language, you end up sounding real old school, like a Laurence Olivier sort of actor. If you’re doing a medical scene and you try to sound smart, you don’t sound like a doctor. This is just their job. The thing is to focus on the intent behind the procedure. We got two weeks of doctor training at the beginning of the shoot and they taught us a lot about the concept of “thick slicing.” When they’re asking questions of each other with all these terms, they’re really trying to eliminate broad swaths of possibilities. You’re trying to slice down as closely as possible. So when I’m saying all that, I’m trying to think about the possibilities I’m eliminating.

Have you been following the fan response to the show? I’m curious what it feels like when you know this big fight between Robby and Langdon is coming, but by episode nine airing, the show has started to hint pretty clearly at Santos picking up on what he’s up to.

We’ve had a lot of response, dozens and dozens of real-life nurses and doctors reaching out in my DMs being like, “thank you so much.” It makes me feel very warm and fuzzy. But then I hosted an Oscars viewing party for my girlfriend and all her friends, and they were all like, “I fucking hate Langdon! I’m Santos all the way!” I’m just like, great. Well, stay tuned. It is an interesting challenge because it started airing as we were still filming. The audience started to learn about these characters and share their ideas about them and I have to be like, okay, okay. They’ve only seen through a certain number of episodes and their opinions are valid based on that information, but it’s a point on a long trajectory.

The Pitt has been picked up for a second season. Do you know if Langdon will be back?

Well, I applied for the job. I would love to come back. This is my favorite show on television, and it’s fucking rad that I get to be on it, so I hope so.",vulture

We get that the Minneapolis dating pool is small, but thank God it isn’t small enough that the Love Is Blind season-eight cast members only have each other. Despite rumors, Sara Carton confirmed she isn’t (currently) dating Joey Leveille on a March 13 episode of The Viall Files. “I’ve seen this a few times online in the past 24 hours,” Sara said. “Well, to be clear, me and Joey are not dating.” But that doesn’t mean she’s not into the idea. “There was a love square between me, Monica, Ben, and Joey,” she said. “We were all talking to each other until the second-to-last day in the pods.” Unlike Ben, Joey did visit Sara in Nashville, along with five others. “I feel like me and Joey did establish a really great friendship,” she added.

The original rumor came from the March 11 episode of the Reality Receipts podcast covering the Love Is Blind reunion. “Apparently [Joey and Sara] were spotted in a hair salon together, and then people very close to the situation have confirmed that they are dating,” host Rikkii claimed. The podcaster said she wouldn’t be “surprised if they tried to come out and say, ‘No, we’re just friends,’ then six months from now, saying it evolved into a relationship.” Sara is definitely committing to the “just friends” part so far.

“This whole situation, I’ve felt very close with Joey,” Sara added on Viall Files. “I’m fond of our relationship, but I feel very well supported by all those involved. I’m just very grateful that I’ve met him, but, yeah, we definitely have a friendship. We’re definitely not dating.” Except … “I don’t know what the future will hold,” Sara continued. “But, I do know for right now, I definitely have no capacity to even think about a relationship.”",vulture
https://vulture.com,What’s Up With Teyana Taylor and Iman Shumpert’s Messy Divorce?,https://www.vulture.com/article/teyana-taylor-iman-shumpert-divorce.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 11:54:00 GMT","Photo: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images

The couple that caused widespread bi panic after starring in the Flashdance-themed music video for Kanye West’s 2016 song “Fade” is splitting up for good. Teyana Taylor and Iman Shumpert finalized their divorce July 1, 2024, in Fulton County, Georgia, per court records, after a judge previously ordered them to submit their divorce settlement in writing by noon on June 27. It appeared the judge wanted to end the back-and-forth between Taylor and Shumpert over issues like their parenting plan and child-support addendum.

Despite rampant rumors about their settlement terms since then, final details are sealed, per a July 1 order. The news comes after a protracted divorce proceeding that was first filed in January 2023 and kept hidden from the public until late last year. But since, they both seem to have moved on.

Why did Taylor and Shumpert divorce?

Taylor secretly filed to divorce former basketball player Shumpert in January 2023 citing his “cruel treatment.” She managed to keep the filing under wraps for a full ten months before reporters caught wind of the divorce in November of last year. Taylor announced their separation in September. In the court documents, Taylor alleges their marriage crumbled because Shumpert was jealous of her fame, grew insecure when photographers requested him to step out of the frame for pictures of her, and felt like he wasn’t good enough for her.

Eventually, Shumpert began “treating her cruelly and displaying extreme narcissistic behavior throughout the majority of their marriage,” the filing claims, per TMZ, adding that Shumpert “emotionally and mentally” abused Taylor. He allegedly “did not want her to work” when she became a mother but complained about her lack of employment when she stayed home to raise their two children. Taylor tried to reconcile with Shumpert as his NBA career was falling apart, but she couldn’t make amends, according to the documents. She filed for divorce once in 2022 before asking her legal team to withdraw the filing one day later. Shumpert’s cheating scandals and arrests for DUI and weed possession didn’t help matters. His attorneys denied the allegations of cruel treatment and asked that the reason for their divorce be changed to an “irretrievable broken bond.”

What do their finances have to do with it?

According to June documents, Shumpert asked the court to revise his child-support payments to $8,000 a month to account for his gross income of around $48,000 a month, per the Daily Mail. He also claimed Taylor brought in around $94,000 a month. For her part, Taylor accused Shumpert of withdrawing nearly $4 million from their shared accounts and left her to foot a $200,000 home-renovation bill.

Since the divorce, there has been speculation about a multimillion-dollar settlement for Taylor. However, the terms of their divorce settlement are sealed, per a July 1, 2024, order. A Fulton County judge ruled to seal the records “to protect the privacy, financial security, and personal safety of the parties and their minor children,” in response to an April 2023 motion from Taylor.

What has Taylor said about the news?

Taylor denied the TMZ reports about Shumpert’s behavior, saying the articles have “misleading headlines.” “My court documents aren’t clickbait for your salacious headlines,” she wrote in an Instagram Story on January 27. In January filings obtained by TMZ, the performer accused Shumpert of being under the influence and smoking weed while with their daughters. Taylor also claimed he failed to feed them when they were under his care and once sent them to Chicago’s United Center arena alone using a rideshare app. While he allegedly put the children in danger, he also allegedly cut off the utilities at their Georgia home, leaving Taylor without Wi-Fi, cable, or water. “Also, let me add,” Taylor wrote, “ALL OF THE UTILITIES IN MY HOME WAS ON THE SAME DAY AFTER THAT SHIT WAS PULLED!! Me and my kids are NEVER GOING TO BE SITTING DUCKS!!!”

“Yo @tmz are you serious????” Taylor posted. “Y’all really be taking it too far with these d*mn misleading headlines and I’m tired of it! Every time I turn around it’s either half leaked and made up stories, or words being twisted up for clickbait!!!! I kindly asked you mothaf%ckas to mind ya damn business, and for y’all to respect me and my family’s privacy.” She added, “HOWEVER, y’all keep putting out f%ckery. If you’re going to keep leaking my documents, SHOW IT ALL & COME CORRECT!!! Stop taking bits and pieces and putting 10’s on 2’s!” This kind of coverage, Taylor explained, is why she filed the divorce secretly in the first place using only her initials.

Who are Taylor and Shumpert dating now?

Taylor made her red-carpet debut with new boyfriend Aaron Pierre at the Oscars earlier in March. “Oscar night in black & white, no grey area. 🤍,” she wrote on Instagram with photos of the couple. The Lion King: Mufasa star had previously been her date to earlier industry events like the American Black Film Festival Honors in February. Meanwhile, Shumpert had a beach day with model Amber Rose last September but later insisted to TMZ they were just friends.",vulture

She’s (going to be) ba-ack! Nikki Glaser is returning as host of the Golden Globes in 2026. Glaser hosted the 2025 ceremony, and killed with both her monologue and her “Pope-ular” bit. “Hosting the Golden Globes this year was without a doubt the most fun I have ever had in my career,” Glaser said. “I can’t wait to do it again, and this time in front of the team from The White Lotus who will finally recognize my talent and cast me in season four as a Scandinavian Pilates instructor with a shadowy past.” Glaser pulling double duty is a rare moment of consistency for the troubled awards show. Since the Globes’ brief expulsion from prime time, the show was purchased by Dick Clark Productions and is now for-profit. Since then, hosts have included Jo Koy, who bombed, and Jerrod Carmichael, who gave an esoteric monologue pondering the value of his presence there. Glaser, meanwhile, came to kill.

Peacock, you better watch out, Gaggy isn’t playing around. The Traitors season-three winner Gabby Windey is calling out the streamer and reminding them that she’s still waiting for a check. On WWHL on March 11, Windey said one of her thorns on the reality series is not getting paid for her winnings yet. She proclaimed her thorns on the show with dollar signs in her eyes, “[I] still haven’t seen a dime. Everybody knows here at Bravo, NBC, Peacock … Not receiving my money. I’m still waiting on the money!” She also jokingly (and probably not so jokingly) told Jimmy Fallon that she wouldn’t consider going on an All Stars season just yet until she gets paid. She explained, “There’s not enough time that’s passed. I don’t know. I need a break. I need my money! I still haven’t even gotten my money. This is NBC; I’ve been screaming.” Accounting departments should fear her.

However, it looks like she might be getting her winnings soon. People reports that the streamer is waiting on a signature from Windey’s team to get the check sent through. But in the meantime, if she needs another NBC show to sound off on until then, maybe Seth Meyers is available.",vulture

It feels good when a show rewards you for paying attention. In the previous episode of The Wheel of Time, we were introduced to Lord Gaebril, the kindly prince consort of Queen Morgaise of Andor. There was no reason to believe he was anything but what he seemed to be, a nice guy who was slightly out of step with the rest of the royal family … except for one small detail. Over and over, there’d be a brief but pregnant pause on the part of everyone who was introduced to them, until they quickly caught themselves and gave him a warm welcome. Something was clearly up, but much like the characters themselves, I was content to push it to the back of my mind. I mean, the guy was so charming!

Now we find out why. Gaebril is, in fact, Rahvin, one of the evil Forsaken freed from their millennia-long captivity. Through magic, he’s warped the memories of everyone in the world, pretty much, convincing them he’s been Morgaise’s significant other for a decade even though he only escaped his magic prison a few months ago. And he’s already playing his fellow Forsaken against one another, secretly an item with creepy Moghadien even as he plots with sexy Lanfear and gruff, battle-scarred Sammael (Cameron Jack) to take Moghedien down. He also mentions being in contact with Semirhage and Graendal, two other Forsaken who’ve been freed without Lanfear’s knowledge. With any luck they’ll be as suave, sophisticated, sexy, and vaguely foreign as all the other Forsaken so far.

In a show as packed with plot as The Wheel of Time has been during this first three-episode drop of season three, focusing on the little moments makes a big difference. Take Perrin’s storyline, for instance. The main thrust is that the people of his hometown, the Two Rivers, refuse to hand him over to the vicious Whitecloaks, even though failing to do so could cost them dearly. For his part, he refuses to let the townsfolk disperse and be picked off farm by farm by either Whitecloaks or their Trolloc quarry. He proposes they make a stand where they are, en masse — even as he prepares to raid the Whitecloaks’ encampment to rescue his buddy Mat’s family, who’ve been taken prisoner in hopes of drawing Perrin out.

That’s all very nice and very reluctantly heroic. But I know I’ll remember the vertiginous view of the valley where he grew up from the apple blossom grove where his wife is buried before I remember his big rah-rah speech. I’ll remember his spear-maidens Chiad and Bain flirting with basically any male thing that moves, from Loial the Ogier to Maksim, the obviously grieving Warder for Alanna Sedai. I’ll remember how Maksim and Alanna are trapped in different stages of grief — how, despite literally wearing their fallen lover’s ashes as makeup, she’s ready to move on, while Maksim can only wallow in the misery, and how the difference is tearing them apart.

Over in the Aiel Waste, we’ve got a similar situation on our hands. From a plot perspective, we learn that Egwene is an ultrapowerful “dreamwalker,” like the Aiel “Wise One,” Bair, whose dream she accidentally entered. We learn that there’s an Aiel tribe called the Shaido locked in a feud with the Taardad, the group our heroes have hooked up with; they may even be willing to kill the Tuatha’an, the pacifist wanderers who split off from the rest of the Aiel ages ago.

Most importantly, we learn that with the right combination of magical MacGuffins, Rand might be able to actually kill the Dark One, freeing his evil girlfriend, Lanfear, from her oaths to him forever. But what lingers is the emotional intimacy between Rand and Lanfear, two people who have all the reason in the world to kill each other, except for the fact that they’re either in love or in a lust so deep-rooted it’s indistinguishable from love.

What really lingers is the scene in which Moiraine and Lan glisten and gleam half-naked in a sweat lodge, once again establishing the profound platonic intimacy that exists between the Aes Sedai and her Warder. When a beautiful but noticeably blonde woman (Aiel are redheads until they go white as they age) named Melindhra gives them the eye, they playfully debate which one she’s interested in, and how badly Moiraine in particular needs to get laid.

Ultimately, it’s Lan that Melindhra’s after, and not for the reasons you suspect. The crane tattoo on her back gives her away: Like Lan, she’s one of the few survivors of the fall of the kingdom of Malkier to the supernatural Blight, and she wants Lan to use his father’s sword for its true purpose: taking back his kingdom. This high-fantasy speechifying goes down a lot smoother when everyone is gorgeous and mostly topless, I’m not ashamed to admit.

A sort of ostentatious glam sexiness is the order of the day this episode, actually, from the debonair Forsaken and the steamy sweat tent of the Aiel to the debut of Faile (Isabella Bucceri), the flirtatious goth warrior Perrin encounters in the Two Rivers, to the return of Liandrin and her deadly Black Ajah assassination squad to her tropical hometown, Tanchico. Resplendently draped and veiled in red lace, with her sisters all looking equally fabulous, she strides into her ancestral home — actually the place where she was molested as a child, resulting in the son she cared for as an old man in Tar Valon until Lanfear killed him — and slaughters everyone present for the marriage of her rapist’s heir to another child bride. It’s fantastically vicious.

But Leandrin being Leandrin, she takes it too far to be fun. In order to spare the poor girl the pain of her memories, she has her comrade Nyomi (Rachel Denning) lobotomize the kid completely. After completing a ritual in honor of her son, involving the painting of a certain sigil at the sites of both his birth and death, she goes to work with the rest of her sisters in trying to complete their true mission in the town. They’ve stolen an ancient bracelet from the White Tower that works like the Seanchan’s anti-magic manacles did, but which is older and more powerful. Once they find the collar that matches it, they can tame the Dragon himself. (Please note that Moghedien is spying on all this while posing as a servant. Always with a scheme, that one!)

This is a task Elaida, the scheming Red sister from Andor, wants the legit Red Ajah to accomplish themselves. Through some political scheming and a little luck, she appears poised to grab a seat in the Aes Sedai’s government, from which position she hopes to stage a palace coup placing the Red Ajah in charge and refocusing the Aes Sedai’s mission on caging the Dragon Reborn. In the meantime, she maneuvers to have her rivals dispatched to do the same to a new False Dragon wreaking havoc in some other part of the realm.

Elaida also forms a bond with Min, as a fellow seer of the future. Elaida’s foretellings are way less frequent and foreboding than Min’s visions, which in this very episode include Mat hanging from a noose. Honestly, it’s hard to see Mat’s doom as set in stone when he’s now able to channel his warrior spirit and absolutely whip the asses of Elayne’s posh brothers when they try to bully him. (There’s some more of that ostentatious glam sexiness you ordered!)

Mat and Minh wind up following Nynaeve and Elayne on the next stage of their quest to root out the Black Ajah once and for all. Though they interrogate two captured members of the Shadow-sworn secret society, they don’t get any actionable information, just a bunch of conflicting lies. Nynaeve deduces that Liandrin is the key to it all, and she and Elayne find the sigil that marks her as an Tanchico expat. They know she’s making a play for the collar and what she’ll do if she gets it.

Whatever she does, I hope she does it quickly. The Wheel of Time is a show I enjoy, but I still feel that every recap ought to begin with “Okay, how much time ya got?” There’s just so much going on, involving so many people in so many places with so many quests for so many objects because of so many prophecies. I find this fun, more or less, but I can understand people who land on “less.” Clearly, its memorable standalone sequences and moments of passion and sensuality are the show’s real power, the way it delivered its knockout blows during season two. I’m waiting patiently to be coldcocked.",vulture
https://vulture.com,The Wheel of Time Recap: You Can’t Go Home Again,https://www.vulture.com/article/the-wheel-of-time-recap-season-3-episode-two.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 16:00:18 GMT","The good news is that due to one of those cockamamie streaming-service release schedules, the first three episodes of The Wheel of Time’s third season have all dropped at once. Chances are, therefore, that you didn’t have to wait much longer than an hour and ten minutes in real time between starting the premiere and arriving at the deliciously nasty opening scene of episode two. The bad news is that you probably shouldn’t have had to wait even that long. I get that the battle with the Black Ajah in the heart of the White Tower is probably the necessary starting point for this segment of the WoT saga, but 15 minutes of characters whose names you only sort of remember shooting digital fingertip fire at each other can be a little off-putting as a welcome back. A brand-new evil-queen character, played by Olivia Williams, with a Robespierre-type Red Ajah Aes Sedai adviser, played by Shohreh Aghdashloo, executing a bunch of rival nobles even after they literally bend the knee? Brother, I’ll take all of that ya got.

Director Katherine B. McKenna understands the assignment, in the parlance of our times. Like Williams as the Aes Sedai–trained Queen Morgaise of House Tarkand and Aghdashloo as Elaida, her right-hand woman, McKenna treats this scene as high camp as much as high fantasy. It works marvelously well, especially once you get a chance to compare and contrast the perkily vicious Morgaise with her daughter, whom we’ve come to know and love as Elayne. Indeed, the entire purpose of the sequence, set 40 years before the present day, is to set up Morgaise for the present-day plotline: Despite the fact that she’s secretly much friendlier with Siuan than either of them can let on in public for political reasons, she comes to the White Tower to take Elayne home.

And being a queen, she rolls deep. Elaida is with her, of course, and as a former rival of the Aes Sedai’s current honcho, Siuan, for the Amyrlin Seat, her presence is fraught. She’s also brought her hunky sons, the insufferable Prince Galad (Callum Kerr) and and the comparatively charming Prince Gawyn (Luke Fetherston), whose display of shirtless swordplay in the White Tower’s courtyard leaves not a dry seat in the house. It’s the brothers who tip Elayne off that the true purpose of their visit is to bring her with them when they return.

It falls to Lord Gaebril (Nuno Lopes), the queen’s consort, to tell her why. Note that Gaebril’s presence in the retinue seems to surprise almost everyone who meets him, giving the impression he was probably just some rando who got lucky in love rather than the result of Morgaise forming a strategic romantic alliance with a preexisting power player; maybe this is why he and the relatively down-to-earth Princess Elayne are so comfortable with each other.

Gaebril tells Elayne that things are going poorly for Queen Morgaise back home. It’s not the other noble houses that are giving her trouble following her dismissal of a popular general, though — it’s the people and the military themselves, which is even worse. Morgaise has already made clear her displeasure at finding out Elayne had been kidnapped by Liandrin, head of the Black Ajah; with the royal family itself now in jeopardy, they can’t afford to lose the heir to the throne. Elayne listens to all this with an open mind.

But she still chooses to stay in the White Tower and even convinces her imperious mother of its wisdom. Siuan has called upon Elayne and Nynaeve to be her “hounds,” rooting out any remaining Black Ajah presence within the White Tower; since Liandrin kidnaped them, sold into slavery, and ultimately aided the Dragon Reborn, the Amyrlin knows she can trust them like no one else. Having already fought a Forsaken, Elayne knows the Last Battle is coming, and her homeland’s as much at risk in that conflict as anyplace else. Here’s her chance to make a difference.

But it’s not only a desire to see the job done that motivates Elayne. She feels that if she’s to hold the kingdom of Andor’s Lion Throne, she has to earn the job like her mom did, not just have it handed to her. Her next stop will be the Arches so she can take the final test and become Accepted like Egwene and Nynaeve before her. Persuaded by the wisdom of all this, Queen Morgaise relents with a smile — but also leaves Elaida at the White Tower to monitor the situation. (Hopefully while delivering quite a bit of dialogue with one of the best voices in Hollywood.)

The whole royal visit cramps Mat Cauthon’s style. As a male guest in the women-only White Tower and the owner of a magical, ahem, horn you can blow, he’s the toast of the novices — until the sexy princes arrive, at which point his social life dries up and theirs is splash waterfalls. It may be for the best, though — as the Amyrlin explains to him the way you’d talk to a truculent ten-year-old, he’s the only person who can blow the Horn of Valere unless someone kills him, at which point it’s up for grabs. Going around showing it off so a bunch of 19-year-olds will fuck you is, therefore, stupid on an almost cosmic scale. Chastened, Mat gives her the horn, although given the White Tower’s recent track record with magic-artifact security, I’m not sure she’d have been my first choice.

In the midst of all this is Min, the gang’s psychic on-again off-again acquaintance — bartender, psychic, occasional rat for the Forsaken Ishamael since he promised to silence the telepathic voices in her head. She apologizes to Mat for having sold him out back in season two, and she’s trying to make up for it by secretly working for Siuan, posing as a White Tower servant while actually gathering intel on the Aes Sedai and their future. That future looks bleak: Yet another deadly battle within the tower’s walls is coming, she says, though she can’t say when or why or with whom.

Meanwhile, the two breakaway groups who split up from the White Tower gang head for their destinations across sweeping natural vistas that merit comparison to Peter Jackson’s similar wide shots in The Lord of the Rings. Perrin, his Ogier companion Loial, and his Aiel spear-maidens Chiad and Bain arrive at his hometown, the Two Rivers, only to be quickly rushed into hiding by Egwene’s mother, Marin (Rina Mahoney). The town, she explains, has been suffering from sporadic raids by isolated pairs or trios of the monstrous Trollocs, the orc-like foot soldiers of the Dark One. They’ve now been scared off by an invading force of the Children of the Light, a.k.a. the Whitecloaks, religious radicals who aim to exterminate all magic-wielders, from the evil Forsaken to the mighty Aes Sedai to humble wolf-men like Perrin.

Indeed, Perrin is their actual target in the town. He’s wanted for the killing of their commander, Geofram Bornhald (Stuart Graham), during the massive battle that ended season two. He’s willing to surrender himself to spare the townsfolk further suffering.

But he and his companions aren’t the only supernaturally supercharged people Mrs. al’Vere is hiding in her attic. (A pointed metaphor, that.) To Perrin’s surprise, Alanna (Priyanka Bose), one of the Aes Sedai allies of our main character Moiraine, and Maksim (Taylor Napier), the surviving member of Alanna’s Warder throuple, are squirreled away there too, recovering from wounds they say were inflicted by the Trollocs. It’s weird, though: Tracks from the nearest Waygate — basically the Warp Zones from Super Mario Bros., but they’re ornate doors instead of sewer pipes — indicate they traveled through that extradimensional portal without an Ogier guide, something only the evil dark friends do. Perhaps they fled the battle under duress, but by now they’ve been missing a long time. What have they been up to?

Halfway across the world, the other group marches on. Rand al’thor, the Dragon Reborn, and his posse — Moiraine; Lan, her Warder; Egwene, Rand’s girlfriend and a powerful magician in her own right; and Aviendha, their Aiel spear-maiden guide — head through the crags and hills to the Aiel waste. But along with Renna, her Seanchan torturer, who’s a recurring presence in her nightmares, and Lanfear, who can control the dream world and make Egwene’s nightmares even worse than they already are, there’s another interloper inside Egwene’s head. Bair (Nukâka Coster-Waldau), an Aiel seer of some kind, infiltrates Egwene’s dreams and learns of her squad’s plans, intercepting them when they arrive at the Waste with the help of a huge Aiel dude named Rhuarc (Björn Landberg) and a whole platoon of warriors. They welcome Rand as the prophesied figure who will save them — and destroy them in the process.

Indeed, the idea that no homecoming is truly possible for these characters is a running theme, and has been ever since Moiraine told Rand this in so many words during the premiere. Elayne can’t return to her mother’s troubled kingdom without risking the larger mission against the Black Ajah and their master. Perrin can’t go back to his hometown without running afoul of the radicals who’ve already tortured him once before, back in season one. Aviendha has brought her messiah back to “the Three-fold Land,” as the Aiel name their own country, but does so knowing it means that country’s downfall. It’s like Elayne tells her royal mother: “There’s no going back to a cloistered life … Far too much is at stake. Safety is a luxury the world no longer affords us.” Someone please call Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and the administration of Columbia University — they need to hear this!

But it’s the little things that make this episode superior to its predecessor. Costume designer Sharon Gilham, for example, is clearly having a whale of a time, from Queen Morgaise’s Lewis Carroll finery to Moiraine’s Radagast hat. The glory shots of the big country between the various realms as our heroes traverse it go a long way in selling the sheer scale of the epic fantasy genre. Williams and Aghdashloo class up the proceedings by their mere presence alone; Williams in particular is a hoot as her much younger, somewhat sociopathic self in the cold open. Donal Finn, the most unpredictable actor in the core cast, does delightful comic work as Mat, especially in his awkward meeting with Siuan. Elayne’s boozy chat with her stepdad, Gaebril, feels realistic and warm. Add up enough of these small victories and you can defeat the Dark One of mediocrity hands down.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Reacher Recap: The Russians Are Coming,https://www.vulture.com/article/reacher-recap-season-3-episode-6-smoke-on-the-water.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:00:10 GMT","Reacher Smoke on the Water Season 3 Episode 6 Editor’s Rating 3 stars * * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Prime Video

Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. This episode opens with Reacher face-to-face at last with Xavier Quinn. He’s now going by Julius McCabe, but he’s still the same sick fuck who tortured and killed Reacher’s protégé, Sergeant First Class Dominique Kohl, back in 2012, then miraculously survived Reacher’s good-faith effort to murder him.

Surprise! The dude has no idea who Reacher is. Evidently, the amnesia he claimed to suffer after Reacher shot him in the face 13 years ago was legit. Quinn/McCabe — whom I’ll just call Quinn for the remainder of this briefing — even interrupts his own reprimand of Beck for hiring an ATF agent as his housekeeper to praise him for bringing on the tall and equally wide drink of water standing next to him. He doesn’t even notice that Reacher is holding a pistol behind his back.

Quinn makes it clear to Beck and Reacher — and to Duffy and Villanueva, listening in via the super-secure government-issue cell phone Reacher is no longer even bothering to conceal in his shoe — that he’s been keeping Duffy’s informant Teresa Daniel alive because “the client has a thing for redheads.” Quinn deals weapons for profit but dabbles in human trafficking for free. He really is a far more despicable shit heel than his puppet Zachary Beck is. But he still needs Zachary alive to complete this big, pending sale, he says, because “the client” expects to close the deal with Zachary.

Meanwhile, a Russian mobster shows up to collect a debt from Quinn. Quinn evidently knows enough Russian to translate his lender’s reply to his request for more time as “Give a man a fingernail and he’ll take the whole arm.” This guy must be really bad news if Quinn is afraid of him.

Driving Pa Beck back to his mansion, Reacher takes an odd swerve into family counselor mode, telling the gunrunner that his son deserves to know that the reason he’s been made to suffer these last five years is because, welp, his old man is a gunrunner. Sure, Zachary Beck has had his business absorbed into that of a more violent and ruthless arms merchant, but his sins are far worse than just bribing customs officials to avoid import duties on rugs or whatever. He’s put weapons into the hands of killers. It doesn’t make much sense that Beck knows all about the deal Quinn made with the Russian mob when Quinn treats him as a lackey rather than a partner, but the writers need to shovel this exposition into our mouths somehow.

Reacher’s experimentation with human empathy continues as he finds Richard gazing at the sea and intuits the kid must be contemplating suicide. Richard doesn’t even deny it. Reacher suggests they head into town to find some glue to repair the vintage toy pistol Richard bought as a gift for Zachary’s imminent 50th birthday party, which was damaged by a trio of 35-year-old bullies before Reacher beat them in episode three.

Surely there’s a tube of glue somewhere in this massive house, but this is about the outing, not its ostensible purpose. Reacher, we learn, has suggested this so he can rendezvous with Duffy and return her badge. In what one really cannot call a rare breach of discipline, Duffy is so grateful that Reacher didn’t just kill Quinn when he had the chance, which would’ve doomed their chances of rescuing Teresa, that she plants a kiss on him. Her reaction to her own indiscretion — “What the shit!?” — actually made me laugh. Reacher is alarmed when Villanueva shows up, not because the old timer is cockblockin’, but because he fears Richard will recognize Villy as the plainclothes cop that Reacher “killed” in the first episode. Sure enough, when Richard finds his way into that alley mere seconds later, the jig is like a beloved 2009 Pixar film: up.

Reacher waits until he’s alone in the car with Richard to come clean: He’s infiltrated Zachary’s home and business to rescue Teresa and kill Quinn. The kid points out that the best case here is that his dad goes to prison. “He’s already in prison,” Reacher says. “So are you.”

Zachary Beck is doing some serious hand-biting in this episode, expressing his envy for the way Richard looks up to Reacher. When Reacher points out that he’s protecting both Becks, Zachary tells him, “People with that job description are prone to catching bullets. I wonder when yours is coming?” Zachary’s anger and jealousy towards Reacher is misplaced but — like so vanishingly few elements of Reacher — plausible and convincing.

It isn’t Richard who ultimately blows Reacher’s cover. It’s the fact that Quinn learns from some identified source that Warrant Officer Powell at the 110th Special Investigations Unit ran his license plate and that Reacher’s friend and frequent partner-in-vigilante-justice Frances Neagley, formerly of the 110th, pulled the military dossiers on Angel Doll, Winston Duke, and Paulie Van Hoven not long after that.

Powell, that Warrant Officer who was so chuffed to be speaking to the legendary Major Jack Reacher back in episode one, proves he’s no clay-footed fanboy, absorbing a brutal beating while refusing to give up Reacher’s name. (He did already name Reacher to Duffy after she threatened to charge him with obstruction of justice, which is how Duffy roped Reacher into her reckless undercover operation in the first place.) Convinced Powell won’t talk, Quinn orders the torturers to “gut him from tongue to taint and let him bleed out.” What a jerk!

Neagley fares better, dispatching two button men sent to kill her in her Windy City high-rise office. Evidently, she’s the only person present not just on this floor but in the whole damn building because the dozens of unsilenced gunshots she and the two hitmen exchange bring no response until Neagley herself dials 911. Piss-poor security for what we’ve been told is an elite private-investigation firm! When one of Neagley’s assailants, bleeding out from the abdomen, asks the woman he just tried to kill to call him an ambulance, Neagley replies, “You’re an ambulance.”

The dad jokes, more than any other single element, are what keep me watching Reacher. More! Of! These!

Anyway, the fact that both of the parties checking up on Quinn and his associates are current or former members of the 110th makes it a cinch for even a dummy like Beck to figure out that Reacher, who used his reputation as the founder of that unit to persuade Beck to hire him, is a traitor. Quinn orders Paulie upstairs to go shoot the (smaller) big man, but Reacher is already running for the garage. He’s smart enough to shoot out the tires of the other vehicles on his way to stealing the snowplow-equipped pickup truck to smash through the front gate.

Even that big, belt-fed machine gun in the guardhouse can’t stop him from making good his escape, though it does enough damage to the truck to force Reacher to dump it. He calls Duffy for help, but not before several ATV-riding henchmen pursue him into the woods. What begins as yet another gunfight morphs into a horror-movie scenario: Reacher covers his face in mud like Arnold at the end of Predator and kills the last of his assailants by strangling him using a winch mounted on one of the ATVs. MacGyver would never!

At the Beck house, Quinn muses that “nothing beats a serrated knife” while displaying some truly amateurish kitchen-knife handling skills. He proceeds to torture both Becks by making Zachary watch as he forces Richard to play Russian Roulette. Richard’s odds are lousier than Reacher’s were when Beck forced Reacher to play because this revolver is a five-shot model instead of a six-shooter. (Also, Richard doesn’t have a notch cut into the cylinder to help him see which chamber the bullet is in like Reacher did.) When Richard survives, Quinn demands “a matching set.” He’s got a fever, and the only prescription is more ear-severing.

You might’ve thought Reacher was too overcome with grief, confusion, physical pain, or some miserable cocktail of all those things while carrying out poor Annette’s corpse off for disposal last episode to pay attention while Harley yammered on about how this unplanned killing had shipwrecked his weekend plans. But no! Reacher heard Harley brag about his boat, the Sweet Marie, because in a flash of insight, Reacher now tells Duffy that the boat is where Teresa is being held. They swim out to investigate, finding evidence that Teresa was indeed kept there under sedation. They’re still aboard when Harley shows up. Convinced he’s telling the truth when he tells them he doesn’t know where Quinn moved the hostage, they leave him pinned to the deck of the Sweet Marie, which caught fire after he tried to shoot Duffy. Rather than attempt to extinguish the flames, Reacher tosses in more fuel. And that’s an explosive wrap for Harley, the loathsome little weasel.

Reacher chides Duffy for stealing looks at his presumably Reacher-size junk while they change out of their wetsuits, but she’s more upset about the fact their last lead for finding Teresa just blew up. But Reacher has another idea. “Pack your sunscreen,” he says. “We’re going to Los Angeles.”

I wonder what Canadian metropolis will play the City of Angels.

In an Investigation, Details Matter

• When Neagley kills the two hitters who attack her in her office, she’s wearing a T-shirt promoting Siren Records of Doylestown, Pennsylvania. The Margaret Lee Van Buren Center for Creation and Activity is a fictional Doylestown landmark, but Siren Records is real!

• I’ve been waiting for three episodes now for Reacher’s daylight beatdown of Richard’s bullies in downtown Abbottsville to produce some consequences. Reacher’s strained relations with inept and/or corrupt local law enforcement is a recurring feature of Lee Child’s Reacher novels and their screen adaptations, but it appears there is no local law enforcement in Abbottsville.",vulture
https://vulture.com,The Wheel of Time Season-Premiere Recap: The People of the Dragon,https://www.vulture.com/article/the-wheel-of-time-recap-season-3-episode-1.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:00:10 GMT","There are two kinds of writers, according to Game of Thrones/House of the Dragon demiurge George R.R. Martin. Some, like Martin’s idol and inspiration, J.R.R. Tolkien, are architects, meticulously planning out their intricate worlds and the hundreds of characters and story lines that exist within them. Others, like Martin himself, are gardeners, planting seeds and knowing what they’ll eventually blossom into, but without any knowledge or control of what shape they’ll take along the way as they grow. The gardener’s job isn’t to draw and execute blueprints; it’s to prune and cultivate the blossoms into a pleasing shape.

I haven’t read The Wheel of Time, the 15-volume epic-fantasy saga by the late author (and close friend of Martin’s) Robert Jordan and, following Jordan’s death, his collaborator and chosen successor, Brandon Sanderson. A cursory search indicates Jordan, at least, was more of a gardener type — he labeled himself a “discovery” writer — and it stands to reason: A planned trilogy doesn’t wind up a dozen books longer than expected if you’ve got it all mapped out in an outline in a notebook or hard drive somewhere.

After watching the season-three premiere of The Wheel of Time — one of three episodes debuting this week — I’m not convinced that creator-showrunner Rafe Judkins and writer Justine Juel Gillmer are architects or gardeners. They’re more like Abstract Expressionist painters, dipping their brushes into big cans of epic-fantasy stuff and just splashing them all across the canvas. It may seem random or haphazard, and it’s definitely overwhelming to look at at first. But eventually, a picture emerges, one that clearly communicates the artist’s ideas and emotions. Even if it’s difficult to make them out now, hey, that sure is a lot of bright-colored paint they flung at the wall, isn’t it?

Directed by genre-TV veteran Ciarán Donnelly, the premiere begins with mayhem in the White Tower (think of this as having the same basic energy as David Bowie’s “Panic in Detroit”) headquarters of the order of magic-wielding women called the Aes Sedai. It’s months after the climactic events of season two, during which young Rand al’Thor (Josha Stradowski) revealed himself to be the messianic reincarnated warrior and sorcerer called the Dragon Reborn. Together with his posse of supernaturally gifted and very good-looking friends, he slew Ishamael (Fares Fares), the chief lieutenant of the satanic Dark One, and repelled an invasion by the Seanchan, an overseas empire that enslaves magic-wielding women while wearing armor that looks like Eiko Ishioka designed it. So far, so good, right?

Wrong! Unlike women, men in this world are not permitted to “channel the One Power” — i.e., use magic— because it invariably corrupts them and drives them insane enough to slaughter those close to them, along with anyone else who stands in their way. The Aes Sedai were formed with this in mind. The thinking goes that the coming of the Dragon Reborn is necessary to stave off the darkness, but if the DR happens to be a man, a legion of powerful women is necessary to control him before he goes berserk while wielding the magical equivalent of a full nuclear arsenal. Two very important Aes Sedai — Moiraine (Rosamund Pike), who’d made finding the Dragon Reborn her life’s work, and Siuan (Sophie Okonedo), Moiraine’s sometime lover and the head of the order — knew this was happening and failed to bring Rand under Aes Sedai control. This is a grievous crime.

But not so grievous as the one Siuan, who’s known as the Amyrlin Seat after the throne she occupies, reveals to the Aes Sedai’s assembled luminaries. Liandrin (Kate Fleetwood), the Über-intense head of the inquisitorial Red Ajah division of the order, is secretly a dark friend — she’s broken her oaths and sworn allegiance to the Dark One, enabling her to violate the Aes Sedai’s magically enforced rules against lying and using the One Power as a weapon. (It seems to me that magically enforced rules don’t do much good if they only apply to the good guys, but that’s where respecting norms gets you every time.)

Anyway, all hell breaks loose. Liandrin’s acolytes in the so-called Black Ajah, pulled from every color-coded division of the Aes Sedai, reveal themselves and wreak havoc. They escape the Amyrlin Seat and her star witness, Nynaeve (Zoë Robins), a magic-wielding friend of Rand’s who was sold into captivity by Liandrin and has since become so afraid of her power she can no longer use it. Killing off several supporting characters, Liandrin and company loot the White Tower’s library of magical artifacts and escape. Naturally, Rand, the Dark One’s nemesis, is tops on their hit list.

Now the question of what to do next is more pressing than ever. In addition to the Black Ajah, Rand and his friends have the Forsaken — think of the Ringwraiths from LotR, but with individual personalities and sexier outfits — on their trail. Moiraine desperately wants him to take the next step in his path to messiahdom: travel to the great fortress known as the Stone of Tear and pull Callandor, the legendary magical sword that can kill Forsaken, from the rock in which it’s been sealed since time immemorial.

Moiraine has an unlikely backer in this plan, too: Lanfear (Natasha O’Keeffe), the sexy domme Forsaken with whom Rand has had an actually pretty sincere romance. She’s probably up to no good in some way, as that’s her nature, but she really seems to want him to get the sword just so he can protect himself from her evil buddies.

The problem is, as always on this show, that Rand is too dedicated to his friends to Do What Must Be Done. Tough to blame him, too, considering how many friends he’s now accrued. A post-battle scene in which Moiraine, Rand, and the rest of the gang debate their next steps slowly reveals a hilariously large posse, which includes (deep breath):

Rand al’Thor (Josha Stradowski), doing the Aragorn–Paul Atreides bit.

Moiraine Damodred (Rosamund Pike), Rand’s surly and scheming female Gandalf figure.

Lan Mandragoran (Daniel Henney), Moiraine’s sworn and magically linked Warder/bodyguard, heir to a fallen kingdom and owner of a magic sword.

Nynaeve al’Meara (Zoë Robins), Rand’s old pal and Lan’s love interest, an Aes Sedai trainee possessing mega-powerful magic barely under her own control.

Egwene al’Vere (Madeleine Madden), an even more powerful channeler and Aes Sedai acolyte, suffering from PTSD after her enslavement and physical and psychological torture at the hands of Renna (Xelia Mendes-Jones), the Seanchan handler she slew and escaped from.

Mat Cauthon (Donal Finn), Rand’s ne’er-do-well pal who can’t seem stop picking up magical items, like a cursed dagger and the legendary Horn of Valere, that grant him great powers at the expense of his sanity.

Perrin Aybara (Marcus Rutherford), a hulking, sad-voiced blacksmith turned werewolf (it happens).

Loial (Hammed Animashaun), a gentle giant and member of the magical race called the Ogier, also known as Builders.

Elayne Trakand (Ceara Coveney), an influential princess turned acolyte at the White Tower who has impressive healing powers and with whom there’s a budding thing going on with Rand.

Aviendha (Ayoola Smart), a spear-wielding member of the red-headed desert warrior people called the Aiel, sworn to find and protect their prophesied messiah, the Car’a’carn (yes, it’s the old Kwisatz Haderach/Lisan al-Gaib routine); Elayne has a budding thing going on with her too.

Bain (Ragga Ragnars) and Chiad (Maja Simonsen), Aveindha’s Aiel sisters-in-arms, who are loyal to Perrin because he freed Aviendha from captivity and who enjoy flirting with the various hunks they now hang out with.

Plus there’s Siuan Sanche (Sophie Okonedo) and Alanna Mosvani (Priyanka Bose), Moiraine’s closest Aes Sedai allies, who also know who and where all these important kids are.

And Lanfear (Natasha O’Keeffe) is hanging around somewhere.

(I truly apologize for the massive text/info dump, dear reader, but if you can think of a more succinct way to sum up the show’s core cast of 15 or so characters, be my guest! I’m grabbing a beer; this is hard work.)

To force Rand’s hand, Moiraine and Lanfear concoct a plan. Lanfear will use her powers to stage an attack on Rand and all his friends while they’re shacked up with each other in various configurations one night, deliberately using the trademark spells of other Forsaken to deflect suspicion. What neither woman counts on is, well, other Forsaken. Specifically, Moghedien (Laia Costa) the creepy little goth Forsaken who looks and talks like Dark Björk, sends in one of her Gray Men, virtually imperceptible and unstoppable undead assassins only she can manufacture, apparently. The Gray Man nearly kills Nynaeve before all is said and done. (Like virtually everybody on this show who gets stabbed or zapped, she gets better. Magic is a hell of a universal health-care system!)

Nevertheless, Moiraine and Lanfear’s conspiracy works … sort of. The big group does break up. Nynaeve and Elayne stay in the city of Tar Valon, where all this has taken place, to continue their training in the White Tower. Mat stays behind with them in hopes that Nynaeve can re-harness her powers and use them to heal his brain, which now thinks in ancient tongues and is plagued by memories that aren’t his own. Perrin sets out for the group’s old hometown, the Two Rivers, with Loial as a guide and Bain and Chiad in tow. Rand will strike out on his own, more or less: Aviendha cannot be parted from him, and his girlfriend Egwene vows never to leave his side again.

But when Moiraine and Lan start talking to him about the path to Tear, he reveals he’s played them. He won’t go to the ancient stronghold to retrieve his big sword of destiny unless and until he has an army at his back. That means traveling to the Aiel Waste, where he hopes to convince Aviendha’s countrymen that he is, in fact, their hoped-for Car’a’carn, then lead them into battle against the Dark One and his servants as his own elite force, the People of the Dragon.

I believe there’s a technical term for all this: “a lot.”

To be honest, the show, which I enjoy quite a bit, suffers from it. Even in the opening battle, 15 minutes or so of CGI lasers and force fields and blood and property destruction, there are simply so many people, many of whom you only know by sight, if at all. I swear that like 20 characters have speaking parts before Rand and Egwene and them even show up, at which point things get more convoluted, not less. Keeping up with it all feels like trying to watch a 60-year-old soap opera by catching a random episode on a Wednesday when you’re out sick from work.

This is a generous way of saying, “This episode is incoherent.” But it’s incoherent like a fox, or at the very least it’s incoherent on purpose. I don’t think anyone involved in it labored under the delusion that this is a great entry point for new viewers or a simple way to ease existing fans back into the action. It’s a full-fledged old-school big-budget genre-show season premiere is what it is. It’s not designed to explain or elucidate its massive collection of characters and concepts; it’s designed to flex on having them all at its disposal. The chaotic riot of information and sensation that follows from this is not a bug, it’s a feature.

At least that’s the idea, I think. That said, it may or may not be your thing. Hell, it may or may not be my thing! I enjoyed watching this episode, sure, but not in the way I enjoyed the highlights of season two: Nynaeve’s trip into a heart-wrenching alternate reality via the magical Arches used as an initiation rite by the Aes Sedai; Egwene’s breaking by and escape from the Seanchan; Rand’s romance with Lanfear and bromance with Ishamael, two suave and seductive villains. The tightness and focus were what made those story lines work; there’s nothing nearly so solid on offer here. I mean, Egwene goes through the Arches just like Nynaeve does, but we only get one glimpse of what’s going on in her mind in there before it’s over. That’s an apples-to-apples comparison in which the earlier apple is clearly superior.

But there are two more episodes left in this opening salvo alone, let alone the rest of the season. And it’s the job of a premiere like to catch you up with every character it can, as quickly as possible, even if there’s like 40 of them, several of whom perish from being CGI’d to death. Give the show a couple more episodes, then a couple more weeks, and then look at that splashy canvas again. I bet you there’ll be something to see.",vulture
https://vulture.com,"A Slithery, Singing John Malkovich Is All Opus Has Going for It",https://www.vulture.com/article/slithery-singing-john-malkovich-is-the-best-thing-in-opus.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","Photo: A24 via YouTube

This review was originally published on January 28, 2025, out of the Sundance Film Festival. We are recirculating it now timed to Opus’s theatrical release.

Wealthy eccentrics and their pseudo-cults appear to have replaced haunted houses in our cultural imagination. Any number of genre films now turn on unsuspecting characters receiving coveted invites from charismatic neo-barons to their remote compounds for luxury, decadence, and ornate slaughter or some variation thereof. In the past, they would simply have inherited a decrepit country house and been tormented by ancient souls or demons or whatever. Now, they indulge fantasies of privilege while slowly discovering that all is not well around them, even as they struggle to let the luxury go. It’s a rather 21st-century human condition. Who needs haunted houses when we’re all surrounded by rich, strange predators?

In A24’s new bizarro horror, Opus, the moneyed weirdo is a reclusive legendary pop star named Alfred Moretti, who’s about to release a new album after 27 years. He’s played by the great John Malkovich, who actually sings several of the songs featured in the picture. This is reason enough to see this film, which just premiered at Sundance and will release theatrically on March 14, or at least to be intrigued by it. Malkovich never really left his theatricality behind when he broke through into movies in the 1980s; instead, he used it to give many of his characters flamboyance and a slightly insolent, above-it-all quality. It’s frankly shocking that nobody has asked him to play a pop star until now. Sure enough, he’s the best thing in Opus, seductive and slithery and pathetic and patronizing all at once.

Ayo Edebiri plays Ariel Ecton, a young writer for a glossy print magazine who wants finally to write a big story. The announcement of Moretti’s new album comes with an exclusive invite for a small listening party at his compound in the middle of nowhere. The man’s gatherings are famous, and for some reason, Ariel scores an invite alongside a few high-profile figures, most of whom do have a past with Moretti, including a TV journalist (Juliette Lewis), an influencer (Stephanie Suganami), and Ariel’s own editor (Murray Bartlett). When they arrive at the estate, they discover a host of strange rituals as well as acres of smiley happy people making sculptures, painting, crafting, and doing Tai Chi and archery. They are tended to and watched constantly by so-called concierges, who sit patiently (and eerily) outside their doors at night. One even awkwardly jogs behind Ariel when she goes out for a morning run.

Obviously, things aren’t going to end well, but they sure do take their time getting there. Maybe that’s not such a bad thing: The film is at its best when it lets Malkovich be a supreme oddball enacting little charades for his followers and performing his songs for the journalists he’s gathered. Watching Moretti in a caftan and a golden disco robot suit, lip-syncing while running in literal circles around his listeners and periodically pausing to gyrate and thrust in their laps, we’re taken with both Malkovich’s playful physicality and his hilarious stone face that, counterintuitively, goes with this perfectly. And it helps too that the songs are quite catchy old-school techno tunes with shouted, one-word lyrics that are mainly there to provide a background for beats and dreamy melodies. These were created by Nile Rodgers and The-Dream, and while you can laugh at the songs, you might also start dancing to them. They’re pitched at the same level as Malkovich’s performance: self-aware, silly, but involving.

Unfortunately, that’s pretty much all Opus has going for it. Aside from the ingenious creation of Moretti and his occasionally unpredictable behavior, the film fails at creating interesting characters, deploying suspense, and even delivering some cheap thrills. When the genre histrionics arrive in Opus, they do so in almost insultingly cursory fashion. And not much tension is built into the film before then — just a long list of odd incidents without any sense of rising action. The assorted luminaries around Ariel do little but dismiss her concerns; yes, they’re typical horror-movie background chum, but their general anonymity can be distracting. Edebiri’s Ariel is a standard and familiar genre part — she’s the one person here who acts like a normal human being — and the young actress, with her down-to-earth persona, is well suited to it. But she does sometimes seem as if she should be in another movie entirely.

Director Mark Anthony Green occasionally delivers some impressive imagery, and he can certainly put together a montage. But he seems a lot less interested in the actual drama he’s concocted than in building up Moretti’s eccentricities. And honestly, who can fully blame him? He probably recognizes what he has captured with Malkovich. I could have watched hours more of the actor’s antics. If Opus had just been a three-hour music video, we might have had something.",vulture
https://vulture.com,A New Looney Tunes Movie Has Escaped Containment,https://www.vulture.com/article/review-the-day-the-earth-blew-up-a-looney-tunes-movie.html,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:09:48 GMT","The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie. Photo: Ketchup Entertainment/Everett Collection

Comically massive in scale yet modest in ambition, The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie thumbs its nose at our fascination with spectacle. Its cataclysmic science-fiction premise hinges on the loopiest of ideas, which is the Looney Tunes formula in a nutshell: Take a popular conceit and send it spinning in a cracked direction with warp-speed slapstick and throw-everything-at-the-wall humor. The film is ostensibly a spoof of ’50s sci-fi and horror, but it’s also a refreshingly daffy twist on modern-day Hollywood stakes-raising. The jokes might not be the funniest, the bits might not be the wittiest, but it’s all done with such verve and velocity that we might not notice. Especially in the wake of Coyote vs. Acme’s much-publicized extermination by the dark forces that run Warner Bros. nowadays, it already feels like a small miracle that The Day the Earth Blew Up (which was initially meant to premiere on Max but was handed off to a smaller distributor, Ketchup Entertainment) is even getting released.

Director Peter Browngardt, who already rebooted the Looney Tunes cartoons for Max several years ago, is an old hand at this by now. His new feature ably captures the Looney Tunes spirit, which is something our world can always use more of — and which is a far more formidable endeavor than might at first seem. The plot is gloriously stupid. An alien spaceship has spiked an immensely popular bubblegum with an interdimensional ectoplasm that turns everyone who chews it into zombies, and the only ones who can save humanity are bickering foster brothers Daffy Duck and Porky Pig (both voiced by Eric Bauza). The always-bold, always-hyper Daffy is incorrigibly incompetent, while shy milquetoast Porky is too busy nursing a crush on beautiful gum-flavor scientist Petunia Pig (voiced by Candi Milo) to ever really accomplish much. Their hand-drawn antics play out against a backdrop of familiar (and welcome) Looney Tunes imagery: beautiful blue skies, verdant green lawns, mid-century architecture … with those sudden, jagged changes in shape and color and texture that this style of animation does so well. When Daffy’s face first blows up, it’s like we’ve been reunited with an old friend.

There’s a reason why the Looney Tunes franchise was built around shorts for most of its existence. Its goofy, devil-may-care logic and rapid-fire comedy rarely translated to feature-length run times. A lot of the early Looney Tunes features were just packaged shorts, and most original movies with these cartoon characters have been live-action hybrids (think Space Jam, or the wonderfully underrated Looney Tunes: Back in Action). The Day the Earth Blew Up gets around this challenge to some extent by effectively running through a multitude of narrative concepts, almost as if the film were itself a collection of shorts.

Thus, before the main story kicks in, we’ve already witnessed a montage of Daffy and Porky growing up, and we’ve also been treated to a film-within-a-film (complete with its own credits and everything) following these two adorable ding-dongs’ hapless attempts at employment. (They fail at delivering newspapers after Daffy invents a gun to shoot papers at people; they fail at being baristas after he abuses a customer whose order is too complicated; they fail at being influencers after he attempts a butt-dance and gets canceled.) When they do find steady jobs — at the local bubblegum factory, of course — color and detail drain from the screen and we’re treated to a Constructivist musical sequence featuring sepia silhouettes of Daffy and Porky dancing among the giant, churning gears of monstrous machines. Why? Why not?

Again, none of these gags could be called original, nor are they particularly hilarious in and of themselves — but when cut together in rapid succession, it all builds a lively head of comic steam. Even the cliché needle drops feel weirdly on point: A flashback sequence plays out against Bryan Adams’s “(Everything I Do) I Do It for You,” while one climactic scene is scored to R.E.M.’s “It’s the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine).” The whole thing works because once you’ve captured the casual vibe of a spoof, you can basically get away with anything. And one benefit of a plot built on relentlessly surreal happenstance is that eventually every new plot development starts to feel like a twist — because nothing is predetermined, and rationality and rigor have already gone out the window. And it’s all so, so fast. The highest compliment I can pay The Day the Earth Blew Up is that by the time it’s all over, it really does feel like we’ve just watched a Looney Tunes short, not an actual feature.",vulture
https://indiewire.com,John Mulaney Isn’t Trying to Solve Netflix’s Late-Night Talk Show Problem. Thank Goodness.,https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/shows/john-mulaney-live-netflix-show-review-1235103317/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:30:00 GMT","On Wednesday night, Stephen Colbert opened “The Late Show” with a joke about Donald Trump’s tariffs. During “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” Jimmy Kimmel spoke to Denis Leary about his new Fox sitcom, “Going Dutch.” And over on Netflix, John Mulaney peeped at his neighbors through a telescope.

One of these things is not like the other. Even if the gist of Mulaney’s bit sounds like it might be setting up some sort of game — similar to what “Tonight Show” viewers seem to enjoy — the execution doesn’t deliver Jimmy Fallon’s typical tomfoolery. (Every “neighbor” Mulaney saw was soon attacked by a man with a lamp.) Instead, the discomforting gag further separates “Everybody’s Live” from traditional late-night talk shows, even as it doubles down on what Mulaney already created with his 2024 cult hit, “Everybody’s in L.A.”

Thank goodness.

It’s not that I expected “Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney” — which debuted March 12 on Netflix ahead of 11 more episodes every Wednesday — to be significantly different than the stand-up comedian’s previous talk show. The similar titles, returning sidekicks, and initial marketing all mirrored what we’d seen last year, when Mulaney was given a week-long run of live episodes designed to draw extra eyeballs to Netflix’s L.A.-based comedy festival, Netflix Is a Joke.

But “Everybody’s in L.A.” was also very, very weird. It introduced Jerry Seinfeld alongside wildlife advocate Tony Tucci, a shared billing that flummoxed the TV titan so thoroughly he never recovered (on air, at least). There was a pre-taped segment about a Leonardo DiCaprio-themed reading room at the Los Feliz library. Kevin Gage, who played Waingro in the movie “Heat,” performed a stand-up routine as Waingro from the movie “Heat.”

As disparate and discombobulating as each of these elements seem, they were tied together by the show’s enduring theme, the city of Los Angeles, which was then used to provide a subset of themes for each subsequent episode. Tucci appeared with Seinfeld because that episode’s central subject was “coyotes.” The library reading room was featured because Los Feliz is a popular L.A. neighborhood (and DiCaprio is one of its favorite sons). “Heat” is, per Mulaney himself, “the most iconic L.A. movie ever made” (a curious contention, if only because the series’ theme song stems from William Friedkin’s 1985 tour of the city, “To Live and Die in L.A.”).

Having a loose housing for Mulaney’s eccentric ideas served “Everybody’s in L.A.” quite well, and losing the city as a centerpiece for “Everybody’s Live” suggested the new series could be broadening out. After all, this isn’t a limited week-long run anymore. This is a 12-episode order. A full season. A new series. And with an extremely popular comedian at the helm, Netflix executives undoubtedly see an opportunity to attract a wide audience — one more shot at reinventing the late-night talk show for the streaming age, a la “Chelsea,” “The Break with Michele Wolf,” “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,” and others.

So if dialing back the weird a little means dialing up the viewership (and keeping Mulaney around, season after season), why not give it a go?

Jessica Roy, Michael Keaton, Joan Baez, and John Mulaney at ‘Everybody’s Live with John Mulaney’ Couretsy of Ryan West / Netflix

“We did this show in May, did you know that?,” Mulaney said during his premiere episode’s opening monologue. “We were very excited about it, it was a good time. A couple months went by and Netflix did a focus group about the title, ‘Everybody’s in L.A.,’ and it turns out that people around the country don’t like L.A. After the fires, I said, ‘Maybe they like us more now,’ and it turns out, no, people still didn’t.”

But changing the title seems to be the only concession Mulaney has made from his original vision. In its official debut, “Everybody’s Live” preserved many of its predecessor’s core facets. In addition to the return of Richard Kind as the announcer and sidekick, as well as Saymo, the rolling delivery robot, the first episode had its own theme: lending people money.

It brought out guests in pairs, starting with “Actor and Filmmaker” Michael Keaton and San Francisco Chronicle financial columnist, Jessica Roy (aka “Lady with Some Savings”). It had inexplicable bits (like Mulaney’s peeping tom shtick) and outrageous pre-taped segments. (Watch the “Willy Loman Focus Group” as soon as you can.) Mulaney even asked the night’s callers what kind of car they drove before hanging up.

Of course, Mulaney is still tweaking things. He noted in his monologue that they’d totally forgot how to do this show in the 10 months it’s been off the air and, despite his handy clipboard listing the run of show, he seemed ready to lean into their “unmoored” new course throughout the evening. “If you’ve seen this beautiful set, some of you eagle-eyed viewers will notice that there are subtle differences in the set design,” he said. “And if you did notice that, please take a walk outside, ask a friend for coffee, try living your life for a goddamn change.”

That sense of freedom is key to the show’s future and more important than the flubs and duds that littered Episode 1. Sure, Mulaney’s routine about his wife, Olivia Munn, and her struggles with “cancer brain” didn’t really land. His guests never gelled in the way one would hope, and the night’s callers didn’t offer the extreme stories of financial misfortune producers likely hoped for when they chose the night’s topic.

But “Everybody’s Live” is still putting all its chips in the right buckets. Mulaney is an excellent host: a steady hand with a sharp wit and enough self-awareness to know when to push a point further or move on to the next idea. His supporting team is affable (love you, Rich; love you, Saymo), and his format is sound. (Steering away from topical references actually makes the show more immediately compelling and sustainable in the long-run.) Netflix, for its part, is choosing the better of its two dominant programming strategies: build something based on whatever the algorithm suggests, or let a proven creator off the leash.

Best of all, Mulaney understands the true benefits of a live show: He wants things to get weird. He wants his guests to get a little uncomfortable. He wants his callers to steer conversations down unexpected avenues. Even the pre-taped parts, like the ad breaks and sketches, are designed to surprise the audience in ways everyone on set, sitting around talking, cannot.

Perhaps the most telling thing Mulaney said last night was when he joked about “Everybody’s Live” being his replacement for “coke and Adderall.” “Will this show get my heart rate up to the level where I feel alive? We shall see.” And isn’t that it? Isn’t that what we want? Not just that Mulaney can stay sober and healthy, of course, but that he’ll run toward the ideas that get his heart pumping. That he’ll embrace what makes live shows so electric to begin with: the unknown; the sense that anything can happen at any time; the friction of unrehearsed, raw interactions that audiences can enjoy unfiltered, as if they’re really there, sitting in their odd friend John’s living room, not knowing where the night will take them?

So far, “Everybody’s Live” is setting itself up to explore all the peculiar little nooks and crannies that get lost in an edited talk show. Its sense of humor may call to mind Conan O’Brien’s absurdist “Late Night” work, and the visual style may hearken back to Johnny Carson’s era, but John Mulaney isn’t trying to make another late-night talk show. He’s trying to make his. He’s trying to look forward. And that’s what we need.

Grade: B+

The 2025 Sundance Film Festival premiere fits somewhere between thriller and celebrity satire. The story follows pop star Moretti, played by Malkovich, who resurfaces after 30 years off the grid. He mysteriously invites a group of journalists and previous connections to a compound, where cultlike chaos slowly begins to unfurl.

“I think my approach to filmmaking so far has been kind of like two buckets,” Green told IndieWire. “There’s a bunch of different observations and things that I want to say about the world, curiosities that I have, takes, statements, whatever. Then in the other bucket, there are actual visual worlds that I want to spend time in, that I want to play around with, and create. So if one thing from one bucket seems like it would be serviced by the other thing in the other bucket and vice versa, then that to me feels like something to explore for an actual film.”

During his tenure at GQ, close friend Lionel Boyce snuck a screener of “The Bear” Season 1 to Green, and he immediately knew he wanted Ayo Edebiri to star in “Opus.” “We’ve always had great creative rapport,” Green said of casting Edebiri. “She read the script, we sat down, and we talked about it.”

“It always felt very familial-like,” he continued. “You know, friends, family, like safe — this is what I want to do with this film. That’s how our conversations were on the first day, and that’s how they were on the last day. I’m such a fan. I think she’s so, so talented, and I watch her in ‘Opus,’ and I’m just constantly seeing new things that she does and impressed by her performance. It’s one of the things just to see her in a different gear. I feel like there are a lot of reasons people should go see this film, but seeing Ayo in a different gear is worth $20 or $15 or whatever [your ticket is].”

With such a strong cast of film veterans, I was curious to see if Green had pitched anyone else for a role in the film. “I really wanted Nikki Giovanni, who’s my favorite poet and recently passed away,” he revealed.

“I had written the scene with Ayo and Young Mazino to be with her godmother, and Nikki was going to play herself. My dream was to put Nikki Giovanni in an A24 movie, and I chased that woman. I spoke to her partner. I sent them flowers — I was reading Nikki Giovanni this morning; She is truly [among the] top five writers that have had an effect on me in my life. So for my first film, I really wanted to put her in it, and then I heard from a mutual friend that her health wasn’t great, and that was the only thing that was going to make me chill out.”

Beyond the cast, the collaborators Green pulled together for this were astounding, even going as far as getting Nile Rodgers & The Dream to create original music for the project. “There was a point in time where they were working with Beyoncé [for ‘Cowboy Carter’], and then they were working with John [Malkovich] and I, and they were going back and forth, which I always thought was really funny.”

“I wish everybody that worked on ‘Opus’ got paid more, myself included,” Green said. “But nobody took more of a pay cut to what they usually get than Niles and Dream. They chose to do this purely for the creative challenge of it. Not only are they making a fraction of the money, but I [was] very demanding, in the studio with them at all hours of the night and being annoying. I really wanted the whole film to feel like a pop record.”

With a limited budget, Green and his crew managed to shoot the film in just 19 days in New Mexico. “I give so much credit to the local crew in New Mexico. I created a very, very fleshed-out, rigid game plan. The thing I’m the most gracious of is just how many people trusted me and went to battle with me to do this and the ambition of the film. We took a lot of really big swings with very little resources.”

With a movie that straddles genres and tones, Green previously said that he thought the term “elevated horror” “is bullshit.” “I’m 100% pro nerd,” he said, expanding on that sentiment. “I hate pretentious shit. ‘Silence of the Lambs’ is a masterpiece, ‘Saw’ is also incredible, but they’re both horror films. ‘Get Out’ is one of the best films since I’ve been on the planet. I guess I just don’t share the need to promote within the genre and it just feels like a promotion. It doesn’t feel like specification. It feels like promotion, and I don’t understand that.”

With all the recent discussion about fighting for longer theater exclusivity, most recently during Sean Baker’s winning speech at the Directors Guild Awards, Green was quick to jump in on the conversation. “I think Sean Baker is a genius,” Green said. “I’m so happy that I live in a world where Sean Baker is being celebrated. Go watch Sean Baker’s other films, ‘Starlet,’ in particular, is so, so good.”

“I made the film like a pop song. Experiencing it in a theater with people, with that sound, and other people’s energy and reactions, it’s like going to a concert, and I guarantee it will be one of the most fun theatrical experiences you’ll have this year,” Green said.

https://indiewire.com,How Inbal Weinberg’s Production Design Gives Characters Meaning,https://www.indiewire.com/features/craft/inbal-weinberg-production-designer-interview-1235103513/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 21:00:00 GMT","There are probably a lot of people who go up to an NYU film professor’s lectern on the first day and tell them that they want to be a filmmaker. Inbal Weinberg is maybe one of the few who has gone up and said, “I want to be a production designer.”

In a time before places like Interior and Films or One Perfect Shot spotlighted how design and composition affect film audiences — to say nothing of Google Search’s ability to find examples of production design in the space of a few seconds — Weinberg knew in her bones that the visual worldbuilding organized by the production designer was how she could help tell stories. Looking back now on her career of over 20 years and collaborations with everyone from Derek Cianfrance and Maggie Gyllenhaal to Pedro Almodóvar and Luca Guadagnino, she’s done exactly what she set out to do.

Weinberg is the latest person to be the focus of Metrograph’s “Filmcraft” series, which showcases the films of outstanding below-the-line practitioners alongside inspirations from across their careers. Weinberg will be present for Q&As about her work on “The Lost Daughter” (March 14th) and “The Room Next Door” (March 16th); she will also introduce films that have influenced specific phases of her work: “Nights of Cabiria” (March 14), “All About My Mother,” (March 16), and “Rosetta” (March 16).

Counterintuitively, the films that actually drew Weinberg into a love of movies were not the ornate, period, or fantasy epics we often associate with production design. The most production design was not as compelling to her as the spare but complete and specific worlds of directors like Ken Loach, Mike Leigh, and the Brothers Dardenne.

About the Dardenne films specifically, Weinberg said that they give one of the best illusions possible in film of treating the world as it is. “There’s something about that kind of radical filmmaking language that takes away all the layers except for the actor, or the character,” Weinberg told IndieWire. “When you sort of discard the ‘art for art’s sake’ reason for production design, then actually everything that the character uses or is surrounded by has an immense meaning.”

This is not to say Weinberg doesn’t love injecting a little bit of art into the world of a film when it’s appropriate. Her earliest training was in fine arts, and she began to look at film as a medium in the artistic sense in college. “Nobody ever comes to film school [aiming for] a craft position. Usually, they think they’re going to be a director. So I think [my professors] were actually very pleased. It was a welcome change,” Weinberg said. “Designers come from a variety of backgrounds. A lot of people come from architecture or theater design. But for me, it was really, ‘I love movies. What can I do? How can I make films?’”

That question led Weinberg not just to production design, but to a much larger truth about filmmaking. At its best, it is even more collaborative than people realize. “I think department heads are usually viewed as, ‘OK, this is your universe. You are in charge of this. And that’s what we’re going to talk to you about,’” Weinberg said. “We’re not just the heads of this department. Think of us as your compadres on this journey to making the film. Like, we are your inner team. We’re here to fulfill your vision in many ways, and it’s not necessarily bound by what is officially our job. We can offer so many solutions to a variety of problems and elevate your film in a variety of ways.”

To be a production designer is to be a producer, to manage what is often the largest department and needs much of the budget of a film. Weinberg, of course, needs to decide what color to paint the walls and what posters to hang on them. But in making decisions about the visual world of the film and how it expresses character and tone, she’s also almost always making decisions that affect how the story is captured, too — in which country the film is shot, how much happens on a stage or at locations.

“My favorite production experiences that I’ve had, and I think also the most helpful, [is when filmmakers] make it a team. Decide who your inner circle is that is making this movie and talk to everybody about everything,” Weinberg said. “When you are in meetings where you have the AD, the DP, the production designer, the producers, the director, and everybody is trying to brainstorm, I’ve seen beautiful things happen from that.”

That kind of horizontal collaboration is a lot easier on indies, of course; bigger films tend to have more hierarchy. But it’s something that Weinberg would like to see a lot more of as she continues her career. “With the rise of authoritarian regimes everywhere in the world, I think a lot about our need for a pyramid structure. And I’m feeling like, ‘OK, if we practiced it a little less in the film industry, we [can] practice it less in life,” Weinberg said.

From her very first collaboration with Cianfrance, Weinberg has learned that there are many ways of making a film. “You have to adjust your expectations and your work style to not just the filmmaker but the kind of cinematic language that filmmaker decides to use,” Weinberg said. “That’s kind of the beauty of our work structure; we get to play with a lot of different canvases.”

https://indiewire.com,‘Warfare’ Directors Ray Mendoza and Alex Garland: Their New A24 Film Is ‘the Product of Honesty’,https://www.indiewire.com/news/events/warfare-alex-garland-ray-mendoza-a24-movie-1235103425/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 19:30:00 GMT","For the world premiere of “Warfare,” the directorial debut of Navy SEAL veteran Ray Mendoza, who worked as a military advisor on “Civil War” with co-writer and director Alex Garland, A24 hosted an audience different from the usual industry set.

Given how the film is based on a real-life mission Mendoza survived during the Iraq War, on Wednesday night, the Hollywood American Legion Theater in L.A. was mostly comprised of an appropriate audience: fellow veterans and members of the military community, with representation from partners including Veterans In Media And Entertainment, Navy Seal Foundation, Warrior Heritage Foundation, Team Rubicon, Team RWB, Writers Guild Foundation – Veterans Writing Program, Screen Actors Guild Veterans Committee, the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Space Force.

So when the post-screening Q&A for the intense war chronicle began, much of the conversation was about memory and honesty. “It was based on memory. We had a handful of photographs that we got of the building, but aside from that, it was just interviews and it began with Ray and I sitting for a week and Ray just unloading everything he could remember. And then we spoke to as many people as we could,” said Garland of how “Warfare” came to be. “These guys opened up, never tried to make themselves look good, never tried to self-aggrandize, really dug it into themselves to try and say what really happened and what the truth was.”

The filmmakers were joined on stage by stars Charles Melton and D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, as well as U.S. Army Infantry Jeff Craft, U.S. Navy SEAL Joe Hildebrand, and U.S. Navy SEAL Elliott Miller, who were all present for the event the film depicts, with the latter being who “Warfare” is dedicated to. “For Ray to direct a movie and not embellish his character is unbelievable. That is a true quiet, professional SEAL and it’s remarkable,” said Hildebrand.

Mendoza, who began his film career while still on active duty, appearing in the film “Act of Valor” and working behind the scenes on “Lone Survivor,” wanted to begin directing as a way to better communicate thoughts and memories about his experience in the Navy. “When I first got out of the military, there was a lot going on with this event, and I didn’t understand how to describe it. I didn’t have the vocabulary of the verbiage to convey it. I had to first understand what was physically going on and then just kind emotionally, spiritually, trying to figure out how to communicate,” he said.

Even before he knew the pathway toward becoming a director, Mendoza thought, “Maybe I could start telling stories from our perspective through our lens, and this story with Elliot was always on my mind.”

He added, “As I started to learn more about filmmaking and how you can really just take, even if you take five seconds in time, you can even stretch that five seconds in time out and give it to the specifics of it, the texture of it.” Mendoza said “Every aspect of this film, even if you were to watch this film again, every snap, every round has a focus. I just didn’t just throw it in there just like, ‘Oh, that fucking sounds cool.’ So when there’s a snap, it’s very directional. So when you see somebody move, shift their gun, it’s motivated by something. … It’s why I wanted to learn from different facets of filmmaking. One day I wanted to do my own film, and also be responsible for all these things, those elements to convey those little things so that it can be a voice for somebody.”

Working with Mendoza on “Civil War” and now “Warfare,” Garland said, “He’s an incredible teacher. One of the things I saw while we were making this was him teaching these guys and the others how to do their job. Not just how to handle weapons, but how to act, how to inhabit something. And it was really fascinating.”

He describes “Warfare,” his collaboration with Mendoza, as “the product of honesty,” adding, “That’s why it represents something in the way it does is, because it’s unfiltered and it’s unflinching and it’s just truthful. And that’s him.”

“Severance” lead star Adam Scott confirmed that “the king” Cruise was a direct inspiration for the opening sequence of Season 2. Scott’s character Mark sprints down the Lumon hallway for the scene, and Scott tried to emulate Cruise’s famed run in various action films. Scott in turn also realized just how much work it takes Cruise to make the run look effortless.

“There’s no way, if you’re running that much in a suit, there’s no way you can avoid any sort of comparison to Tom Cruise because he’s the king,” Scott said during SiriusXM’s “Literally! With Rob Lowe” podcast. “What I find is something that he does that’s incredibly impressive is, at one point when we were shooting the opening sequence for the first episode of Season 2, we did a bunch of different stuff. And at one point I was on a treadmill with a harness connected to me, and what we found was there was some uncanny valley thing that would start happening because if you’re on a treadmill, you’re running at a consistent speed. There’s no variation in your speed, whereas if someone is actually running, there’s constant variation in speed that isn’t even perceptible to the human eye.”

He continued, “But you clock it when you’re watching Tom Cruise run. There’s something very human about it because he’s actually doing it. So we found that in order for it to be realistic, I had to run around on the treadmill just to make it inconsistent. It was super interesting. You’re welcome.”

Scott added that “Severance” director and executive producer Ben Stiller “also has an affinity for Tom Cruise.”

Scott’s “Parks and Recreation” co-star and podcast host Rob Lowe cited their “mutual appreciation” for Cruise, saying that Scott “finally got [his] moment to pay homage to the Master.”

Could Cruise make a “Severance” cameo for Season 3? We already know that Barack Obama was too busy to lend his voice to Season 2 (Keanu Reeves instead took the role), but perhaps Cruise post-“Mission Impossible” could make his way to Lumon….",indiewire

At least not according to the upcoming documentary “Any Problem Is No Problem,” which will be the closing-night screening at the upcoming AmDocs Film Festival in Palm Springs.

From the Emmy-winning team behind “The Rescue List,” this new cinema vérité-style peek into the work of tech-business incubation showcases a three-month crash-course thousands only dream of participating in.

Of the over 8,000 applicants for the Crypto Startup School, only 26 are accepted. These future tech company leaders lay their hopes on the line as they learn from others in the business, network with fellow entrepreneurs and engineers, and ultimately pitch investors during a Demo Day. For many, this opportunity is make-or-break and the only thing driving them is the potential delusion of their vision. It’s also a test of whether they have what it takes to handle the constant fluctuation inherent to the crypto business. While many may believe this work lacks a certain level of humanity, “Any Problem Is No Problem” aims to show is the very real emotions that goes into their innovation.

“Any Problem Is No Problem” comes from directors Alyssa Fedele and Zachary Fink, who received the 2021 Outstanding Social Issue Documentary Emmy for “The Rescue List,” which tracked the story of three Ghanaian boys who escaped modern-day slavery. The documentary is produced by Actual Films, known for projects like Netflix’s “Athlete A,” which covered the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal that rocked U.S.A Gymnastics, as well as “The Lost Boys of Sudan.” The company was founded by filmmakers Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk and is currently led by Justine Nagan, who serves as head of production. No release date has been set for the documentary, but it is expected to premiere at some point in 2025.

Well too bad! With “The Life of Chuck,” Flanagan is only bringing the feels. Sure, the specter of death looms large over the Tom Hiddleston-led drama — plus its interest in the otherworldly is clear — but the story forgoes King’s usual frights for a far more straightforward and sentimental tale of all the vital and divine components that make up a life.

In IndieWire’s review out of TIFF, where “The Life of Chuck” won the People’s Choice Award, critic Katie Rife wrote, “Structured around a verse from Walt Whitman’s ‘Song of Myself’ — ‘Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. I am large, I contain multitudes’ — ‘The Life of Chuck’ is told in reverse order from the end of a man’s life to the beginning. It does so in a way that’s surprising enough that it’s best not to discuss it in too much detail; suffice to say that it takes a cosmic approach to the idea of inner worlds. (‘Every man and every woman is a star,’ to quote Whitman’s fellow literary eccentric Aleister Crowley.) The entire movie isn’t sad, although it does land on a note of genuine pathos. But sentimentality suits Flanagan, whose florid writing style is well matched by the high-concept ideas explored here.”

Though the film came into TIFF with no distributor, Neon quickly acquired it and announced a summer 2025 release. Could this far out release be because they already had their 2024 Oscar player with Sean Baker’s Palme d’Or winner (now Best Picture winner as well), “Anora”? It begs the question, does Neon see “The Life of Chuck” as a potential awards player, too?

The film is clearly an audience favorite based on its win at TIFF, and the popularity of its cast and creative is evident. In addition to lead actor Hiddleston, the film stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Karen Gillan, Mark Hamill, David Dastmalchian, and Matthew Lillard, with Nick Offerman narrating. If one thing is for certain, it’s that like with “Anora” and its previous Oscar winner, “Parasite,” Neon will be giving “The Life of Chuck” a top-notch theatrical roll-out, especially considering its summer box office placement.

https://indiewire.com,Alex Garland Tells Neil Druckmann ‘The Last of Us’ Inspired ’28 Years Later’ Plot,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/alex-garland-the-last-of-us-28-years-later-1235103339/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 16:30:00 GMT","Alex Garland is crediting “The Last of Us” for making his sequel film “28 Years Later” even better.

Garland, who penned original 2002 zombie film “28 Days Later” and returns to write the third feature “28 Years Later,” said during the “Creator to Creator” podcast in the below video that it was “The Last of Us” video game that inspired him to up his own “game” as a screenwriter.

Neil Druckmann, the creator of the original “The Last of Us” game and co-creator of the HBO series adaptation with Craig Mazin, was in discussion with Garland for the panel.

“I was so inspired by your work,” Garland said to Druckmann. “‘The Last of Us’ is better than ’28 Days Later.’ The thing about ‘The Last of Us,’ I was like, this is so much more sophisticated. It was very nice for me with ‘The Last of Us’ to sort of feel like someone saying, ‘Where’s your game?'”

Garland explained that his first film in the franchise, “28 Days Later,” was influenced by “Resident Evil” and “Dawn of the Dead.” The plot for “28 Years Later,” though, had more “The Last of Us” parallels, something that Garland credited to “The Last of Us” being such a force in the zeitgeist. Yet he had to convince “28 Days Later” director Danny Boyle to be onboard for the “28 Years Later” concept, first. Garland’s script has been circulating since 2019, with Boyle saying in 2022 that he was “very tempted” to direct; the film now will be released in 2025.

“I had this really odd idea [for ’28 Years Later’],” Garland said, adding, “I think there is something slightly irreverent or slightly punk somewhere in what I do. I had an idea where the heroes were Chinese Special Forces and the UK had been quarantined and China had discovered that the virus had been weaponized and in order to protect themselves, they had to get to a lab in the UK where the virus was created. If you had the source virus, you could create a vaccine. Danny Boyle read it and he kind of said, ‘Yeah, OK. I sort of want to do this.’ But I know Danny very well and I could see that he didn’t really want to do it at all.”

Garland continued, “And then I was thinking, ‘Why doesn’t he like it? It’s just not that good…’ And then I thought I should be much stranger with this, much odder, so I made a completely different story, which in truth has a ‘Last of Us’ connection. ‘Last of Us’ had such an impact on me.”

Druckmann in turn said, “I find it such a compliment. […] There’s a direct line between the fast infected [in ’28 Days Later’] and the infected in ‘The Last of Us.'”

Garland, who is now co-directing military thriller “Warfare” with Navy Seal veteran Ray Mendoza, said that he used to never revisit his past films, including “28 Days Later.” It wasn’t until he had to create story ideas for 2007 sequel “28 Weeks Later” that Garland looked back at his own career.

“For years and years and years, I never rewatched any film I’ve worked on,” he said. “I’ve only rewatched one, actually, ‘Dread.'”

He added of his filmography, “I was pleased not to be the director [of ’28 Years Later’]. I’d been the director for a few years and I was sort of done with it in various ways.” He added that co-directing “Warfare” with Mendoza made “the job a lot easier.”

As for Druckmann and “The Last of Us,” the series adaptation is debuting its Season 2 in 2025. The show is also renewed for Season 3. “I’ve always believed games are capable of so much more than people are giving them credit [for],” Druckmann said.

https://indiewire.com,‘Novocaine’ Directors on Paying Tribute to ‘Die Hard’ and ‘Lethal Weapon’ with a New Kind of Action Hero in Jack Quaid,https://www.indiewire.com/features/podcast/novocaine-directors-dan-berk-robert-olsen-interview-1235102357/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","Directors Robert Olsen and Dan Berk are well known to horror fans for smart, scary, and sometimes quite funny thrillers like “Body,” “Villains,” and “Significant Other.” With their latest film, “Novocaine,” the precise and expressive visual style of those early films remains, but the genre is new: The story of a mild-mannered banker (Jack Quaid) on a quest to save his kidnapped new girlfriend (Amber Midthunder) is a full-on action movie packed with exhilarating set pieces.

For Berk and Olsen, getting the chance to play in Richard Donner and John McTiernan’s sandbox was a long-held dream finally realized.

“We’ve wanted to make an action movie for a very long time, but it’s really hard early in your career,” Berk told IndieWire’s Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “No one’s going to give you the 20-plus-million dollars you need to make an action movie for your first feature.”

While “Novocaine” has a modest budget for a studio feature — somewhere just shy of that 20-million-dollar figure — it has no shortage of scale or ambitious set pieces, something the directors say was partly achievable thanks to the decision to shoot in Cape Town, South Africa. “It’s an incredibly versatile city, visually,” Berk said. “It has a coastal vibe that can play as Miami or San Diego, but then you go inland, and the downtown area could be New York City. And then a few blocks away looks like New Orleans.”

Once Berk and Olsen realized how many looks they could get in one area by shooting in Cape Town, they switched the location of the original script from Detroit to San Diego, a decision that allowed the movie to share the more colorful DNA of action movies like “Lethal Weapon” and “Die Hard” over the grittier aesthetic of the “Taken” movies — films Berk and Olsen love, but were not looking to replicate. That said, shooting in South Africa did pose unusual challenges.

“There’s a lot in Cape Town that is structurally different,” Olsen said. “They drive on the other side of the road, so for every exterior scene, you’re bringing in new cars. And for whatever reason, the banks they have there don’t look like our banks, so the production designer and her team built the entire bank from scratch.”

Berk and Olsen noted that the biggest challenge was the fact that ambulances in Cape Town looked different as well, which meant the crew had to build two ambulances for a climactic action scene — one of which had a rotisserie rig that could spin the interior.

Sequences like the ambulance chase recall the heyday of Jerry Bruckheimer and Joel Silver movies, which Berk and Olsen tried to emulate while putting their own spin on the genre via the film’s unconventional protagonist. Nate, the unlikely hero of Lars Jacobson’s screenplay, is not only an everyman who is not in the Schwarzenegger-Stallone tradition. He has a rare disorder that keeps him from feeling pain — both an advantage and a major problem as he fights one bad guy after another on his path to saving his love interest.

“What we like about ‘Lethal Weapon’ and ‘Die Hard’ is that they’re really funny, yet they’re not full-on comedies where you lose the stakes,” Olsen said. “We wanted to make a movie that was really funny but grounded, and what drew us to this movie was the fact that [Nate] couldn’t fight. Jack had to unlearn how to flinch because every time you get punched as an actor, you wince, you sell the pain. He had to unlearn all that, and it was really fun figuring out how we would fight — we called it ‘Nate Fu.'”

The fact that Nate can’t fight in a conventional manner gives all the action sequences in “Novocaine” a chaotic, flailing quality that’s nevertheless meticulously choreographed and, on the movie’s own terms, completely plausible. Again, making the action grow organically out of character ties “Novocaine” to its influences, which is part of Berk and Olsen’s larger mission.

“For some reason, [the industry] has lost sight of building movies from character out,” Berk said. “We’ve put spectacle too high and character too low, and spectacle is increasingly less nutritious and less valuable when you don’t have characters to make you care. The effect over many years of consuming movies that fall into that structure is that people stop thinking movies are good. Hopefully, we can push not only the genre but the theatrical ecosystem in the right direction.”

It has been updated multiple times with new entries.]

Both on the awards circuit and in the public consciousness, HBO is widely regarded as among the first Hollywood heavyweights to recognize that television, as a medium, had the power to deliver sprawling, large scale stories on a smaller screen. From HBO’s ascent in the late 1990s through its dragon-aided roar across the 2010s, the network’s original series tackled universal stories, stretching across continents and decades.

The network hasn’t been without controversy, though. HBO faced questions about its lack of diversity in flagship series, including “Game of Thrones” and “Girls,” throughout the 2010s. And, unshackled from the restrictions of broadcast TV, the various steps the network took to push the limit of what’s allowed on screen garnered a fair share of pearl-clutching headlines; see “The Sopranos” in the ’90s and “Euphoria” just a few years back. And since the Warner Bros. and Discovery merger, there’s been many worries from TV fans about the impact it’s having on HBO’s future — especially with series like “Succession” and “Barry” concluding.

But overall, the network’s commitment to collaborating with talented filmmakers and inventive creators has earned them creative success that few of their rivals have been able to equal. Even as the age of prestige TV has blanketed the marketplace with plenty of other options, HBO’s newest shows have been able to stand out. “Barry,” “I May Destroy You,” “The White Lotus,” and “Mare of Easttown” are among the Emmy-nominated series carrying on HBO’s storied tradition with TV that captivates and compels.

Not including Max Originals (which have their own separate list): Here are 46 of the best TV shows HBO has ever had to offer.

Michael Schneider, Alison Foreman, and Steve Greene contributed to this report.

46. “The Gilded Age”

HBO made its name on riveting, dramatic shows that left audiences on the edges of their seats. “The Gilded Age” is very much the opposite of that, a soothing exercise in small stakes that’s less about “plot” and “things happening” as it is about watching talented actors passive-aggressively fight in gorgeous period costumes. That’s not a bad thing: Julian Fellowes’ ensemble period piece about the lives of New York City elites during the Gilded Age is a soapy, dishy little pleasure, a show that knows exactly what it is and executes its own particular niche with precision. Scathing about wealth and insightful about the period it is depicting, “The Gilded Age” is not golden, and a few lackluster performances dull the shine. But the opera houses are immaculate, the cameos from Broadway theater royalty are delightful, and Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector, as the ridiculously hot scheming new-money couple at the center, run away with the entire show. —WC

45. “The Deuce”

Possibly the most underrated show from “The Wire” creator David Simon, “The Deuce” (co-created with George Pelecanos) applies all of Simon’s journalistic instincts and fondness for a big ensemble of flawed, complex characters to the unexpected world of the rising ’70s porn industry. Never judgmental about its characters’ choices, Simon and the show take a refreshingly balanced stance on the industry, criticizing both the prudes against it and the exploitation and abuse that goes on behind the scenes. Although it’s tarnished somewhat by the presence of James Franco — playing twin brothers working for the Mafia — “The Deuce” had a brilliant enough ensemble to overlook him, and Maggie Gyllenhaal’s wonderful work as a sharp single mother and prostitute-turned-porn actress deserved far more flowers than it got. —WC

44. “Fantasmas”

A wonderfully droll and completely original bite-sized creation, “Fantasmas” is a pure distillation of creator Julio Torres’ imaginative artistic outlook. Across six half-hour episodes, Torres creates a vivid alternate-reality version of New York City that’s similar to our own, but queerer, freakier, and populated by a colorful cast of gig workers, ruthless capitalists, and starving artists looking for meaning in the chaos. The result blends the best of serialized comedy, with recurring figures and an overarching plot about Torres’ stand-in attempting to find fulfillment, and sketch comedy that swerves from musings on the nature of the letter “Q” to a stand-out parody of the “Real Housewives” franchise that imagines the women as the victims of a deranged manchild. —WC

43. “The Last of Us”

‘The Last of Us’ Season 2 HBO

Video game adaptations have such a dismal reputation that “The Last of Us” just had to be okay to surpass historical precedent. Still, Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann’s serialized adaptation of the latter’s beloved action game series impressed when it debuted in 2023 by succeeding not just “for a video game movie” but as a compelling drama in itself. Translating the cinematic influence of the original game’s post-apocalyptic story, the HBO series inevitably loses some sense of originality and intimacy in taking the interactivity out of Joel and Ellie’s adventure across the United States. Still, the first season — based on the original 2013 game — succeeded thanks to brilliant performances from Pedro Pascal as Joel and (especially) Bella Ramsey as Ellie, which gives the pair’s complex bond the weight it deserves, and through direction and filmmaking that vividly captures the broken world the two inhabit. While it veers a little too faithful to the source, the show succeeds when it makes departures, particularly in a standout episode starring Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett as doomed lovers. —WC

42. “How To with John Wilson”

“How To with John Wilson” Joe Buglewicz/HBO

Each episode of “How To with John Wilson” is a standalone visual essay that starts small before going into broader and more poignant depths than you could possibly imagine. An installment can begin with a question about how to cook risotto or find a public restroom, before finding Wilson in Idaho at a conference discussing the Mandela Effect and ending with a discussion on the importance of living in the moment or letting go of your fears. At the center of the series is Wilson’s loving portrait of New York, which he depicts with an observant B-Roll of all its nooks and crannies and interviews with some of the oddest inhabitants you could ever find, and the question of how to build community in an increasingly fractured world. It sounds heavy, and it can be, but “How to With John Wilson” is also just terrifically entertaining, filled with unexpected non-sequiturs and cringe comedy filtered through Wilson’s persona as an awkward, schlubby narrator. It’s a series of essays, but the show never feels like homework. —WC

41. “Industry”

‘Industry’ HBO

After a shaky first season, “Industry” leveled up significantly in its sophomore outing, between sharp new characters, deeper writing for the central ensemble of four young investment bankers, and a more confident mix of the soap opera sexual entanglements and “Succession” lite cold-hearted business dealings that gives the show its own distinctive rhythm. But the secret to the sauce of Mickey Down and Konrad Kay’s London-set series is that even when the scripts aren’t at their peak, the amount of adrenaline pumped into every episode makes it impossible to look away. A lot of that is due to the excellent, nervy performances from Myha’la Herrold and especially Ken Leung as the show’s leads, ruthless wheelers and dealers who behave as if every stock investment is a life or death battle. Another factor is the show’s admirable willingness to throw the viewer into the deep end of the finance world, peppering the script with technical terms and business jargon that’s hard to decipher but exhilarating to hear the cast spit out at each other. Mostly, it’s the show’s indelible portrait of the finance sector, as a warzone where people need to stoop to horrific lows to get ahead, that makes “Industry” such a consistent half-trash, half-prestige delight. —WC

40. “The Rehearsal”

“The Rehearsal” Allyson Riggs/HBO

A confounding, bizarre experiment, “The Rehearsal” got everyone talking when it premiered in Summer 2022, launching meme after meme about the various stunts creator and host Nathan Fielder gets into over its six-episode first season. Ostensibly a series about Fielder staging “rehearsals” for big life events in order to help ordinary people prepare for the unexpected, “The Rehearsal” gets so much weirder and more personal that that initial premise, as Fielder begins staging rehearsals for rehearsals and involving himself directly in the story. Is the show’s treatment of its real-life subjects one hundred percent ethically above board? The jury will (likely always) be out on that. But the show recognizes that reality, and provides one of the queasiest but most fascinating TV experiences in recent memory. —WC

39. “OZ”

Although “The Sopranos” gets most of the credit for making HBO the place for edgy, artful TV, prison melodrama “Oz” deserves its flowers as the show that paved the way. The channel’s first one-hour TV drama, Tom Fontana’s 1997 show was set in an experimental, rehabilitative wing of the Oswald State Penitentiary, where several colorful inmates from different backgrounds engage in drug trade, gang wars, fight each other, or fall in love. Boasting brilliant performances from the large ensemble cast — including Harold Perrineau, J. K. Simmons, Lee Tergesen, Christopher Meloni, and Rita Moreno — the series remains an underappreciated, compulsively watchable drama decades after it broke ground. —WC

38. “Olive Kitteridge”

“Olive Kitteridge” HBO

Adapted from Elizabeth Strout’s 2008 novel, “Olive Kitteridge” significantly streamlines the original text — essentially a series of short stories about the people in the life of the title character — to focus more squarely on its protagonist. Thankfully, Kitteridge is played by Frances McDormand in one of her best performances. A depressed retiree in the Maine town of Crosby, the four-part series tracks Olive’s life over a 25-year period, as her relationships with her husband Henry (Richard Jenkins), son Christopher (John Gallagher Jr.), and friends grow and change. The series won eight Emmys, including Best Limited Series and acting wins for Jenkins and McDormand. —WC

37. “Mildred Pierce”

“Mildred Pierce” HBO

It takes guts to readapt a book that’s already been turned into a classic film, but Todd Hayes did just that when he wrote and directed a limited series adaptation of James M. Cain’s “Mildred Pierce” back in 2011. The 1945 Michael Curtiz adaptation of the novel is a classic featuring Joan Crawford in one of her defining film roles, but significantly changes the structure of the story to transform a psychological drama into a film noir. Hayes’ adaptation is significantly more faithful, featuring Kate Winslet in the title role. A hard-working mother in the Great Depression, Mildred struggles to care for her family when her husband loses his job, opening a restaurant and falling in love with a new man (Guy Pearce, wooing Winslet a few years before “Mare of Easttown”), while struggling to navigate her relationship with her spoiled and selfish daughter (Evan Rachel Wood). Winslet and Pierce both received Emmy Awards for their work in the miniseries. —WC

36. “Fraggle Rock”

“Fraggle Rock” Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock

The Jim Henson series might be considered the “HBO starter drug” for a generation of viewers, now in their 40s, who came of age in the 1980s. Fraggles are mostly carefree creatures with different personalities, led by the characters Gobo, Red, Wembley, Mokey and Boober. They sing, they play, they eat structures built by Doozers, they steal radishes from the Gorgs, and seek answers from the enlightened Marjory the Trash Heap. Out in the real world, Doc and Sprocket were the gateway for the Fraggles to “outer space.” The Fraggle world lived on with the Hulu animated series “The Doozers” from 2014 to 2018. —MS

35. “True Detective”

“True Detective” HBO

Although “True Detective” is an anthology — rotating casts, settings, and plots each season — there’s an eerie familiarity to the nightmarish journeys the crime show has taken thus far. In the first season, Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are Louisiana detectives investigating a series of killings seemingly related to the occult. Rachel McAdams, Colin Farrell, Vince Vaughn, and Taylor Kitsch lead the second season, as California cops looking into corrupt politicians. Finally, Mahershala Ali leads the third season as a detective in the Ozarks looking for two missing children. A fourth season starring Jodie Foster is expected in 2023. —AF

34. “Euphoria”

“Euphoria” HBO

Based on the Israeli series of the same name, Sam Levinson’s “Euphoria” takes the more is more approach to twisted teen dramedy. Zendaya stars as a high school-aged drug addict named Rue, whose struggles with mental health and grief ground an otherwise chaotic kaleidoscope of social media-fueled coming-of-age angst. “Euphoria” is first and foremost celebrated for its moody soundtrack and arresting aesthetic, with its costuming and makeup honored by the Emmys and fashion world writ large. Despite a rocky second season, Zendaya and the rest of the “Euphoria” cast continue to earn top praise for their performances with special attention paid to series regulars Sydney Sweeney, Jacob Elordi, Angus Cloud, and Hunter Schafer. —AF

33. “Game of Thrones”

“Game of Thrones” HBO

Even with a head start as rich as George R. R. Martin’s novels, translating the dense mythology of this fantasy behemoth to the world of TV was an unprecedented undertaking, creating entire cities and species from the ground up on a mammoth scale. In the process, that attention to detail and willingness to forge new directions for these characters kept the series grounded in ways that kept viewers in dragon-free zones hooked week after week. In a fractured entertainment environment, the mere existence of “Game of Thrones” as an all-consuming, quadrant-crossing hit was something of a minor miracle. Even as the show faltered in its home stretch (at least according to some), the impending spinoff series lets the Westeros legacy live on. —SG

32. “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver”

“Last Week Tonight with John Oliver” HBO

Even before the never-ending news cycle became an apocalypse-focused monoculture, “Last Week Tonight” provided a valuable service by directing the late-night focus away from the front page. With segments on pressing issues as disparate as net neutrality, multi-level marketing schemes, mandatory minimum sentencing, gerrymandering, and infringement on LGBTQ rights, John Oliver and company have produced far more than the “evisceration” they often get headlines for (something Oliver himself has poked fun at). Using the show’s distinct viewpoint to punch up rather than tred on easy targets, it’s political-themed comedy that offers something constructive to our national discourse, all while managing to slip in dogs who look like Supreme Court justices for good measure. —SG

31. “Big Love”

“Big Love” HBO

Bill Paxton plays a polygamist wrestling with the complications of married life in HBO’s “Big Love.” Set in a fundamentalist Mormon community in aughts Utah, the drama series ran for five seasons from 2006 to 2011 and was praised for its tight writing and emotional performances. Created by Mark V. Olsen and Will Scheffer, “Big Love” commingled the high-stakes intensity of religion and politics with the intimate family drama of three sister wives sharing a backyard and the household responsibilities therein. Played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, Chloë Sevigny, and Ginnifer Goodwin, the three main wives grounded the series, which would earn nine Emmy nominations. —AF



30. “The Jinx”

“The Jinx” HBO

“The Jinx” kicks off with a criminal trying to get caught. If Andrew Jarecki’s journey into the mind of late murderer Robert Durst was only an unpacking of that single idea, it would have still been compelling TV. That this true-crime docuseries also uncovers plenty of unexpected discoveries not just about Durst, but about the ethical nature of the proper reporting process of homicides makes it a watershed moment of the “Serial” boom. “The Jinx” doesn’t skimp on the brutality of these crimes, showing them in full detail so that an unsuspecting audience has a better understanding of the severity of the murders described. Ultimately, it’s a gripping examination of the power of trauma and how the cycle of violence can be perpetuated before we even realize it. [Editor’s note: Plus, “The Jinx” helped get Durst convicted in 2021.] —SG

29. “The White Lotus”

“The White Lotus” HBO

Shot at a real Hawaiian resort during the COVID-19 pandemic, season one of Mike White’s “The White Lotus” kicks off with the mysterious death of someone at a five-star resort. Who died, how, and why? Dripping with dramatic irony, these questions fuel the extraordinarily bingeworthy six-part dramedy that earned the show five Emmy nods, including Outstanding Limited Series. In fact, the limited series was so outstanding it’s no longer limited at all, having gone the way of “Big Little Lies” and been green-lit for an Italian-set second season. —AF

28. “Mare of Easttown”

“Mare of Easttown” HBO

Kate Winslet stars as title character Mare in Brad Ingelsby’s harrowing crime thriller about a beleaguered Philadelphia detective grappling with an unsolved case. Equal parts absorbing character study and slow-burn whodunnit, the stark series boasts not only an incredible knack for creating suspense but also a consistent commitment to following those threads somewhere satisfying. “Mare of Easttown” earned six Emmy nominations, winning Outstanding Lead Actress for Winslet; Outstanding Supporting Actor for Evan Peters; and Outstanding Supporting Actress for Julianne Nicholson. —AF

27. “Big Little Lies”

Whodunits so often get overrun by the juiciness of their premises. Not so for Jean-Marc Vallée and David E. Kelley’s 2017 adaption of the Liane Moriarty novel, which crafts a central California community of intrigue and looks for the more nuanced story behind the death that sets off the series. The show’s central quartet (played by Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley, and Laura Dern) each bring a dynamic thread to the fabric of this seaside town and the children whose actions become a focal point for the story. While the series left off as a strong, standalone piece of TV craftsmanship, it’s a testament to how well this blend of visual style and otherworldly performances captured audience’s imaginations that Season 2 happened (and with Meryl Streep in tow, no less). —SG

26. “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel”

“Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel” Patrick Harbron

In a changing landscapes that has an increasingly smaller space for TV newsmagazines, “Real Sports” has consistently found a way to bring vital stories from the sports world to a wider consciousness. Anchored by some of the industry’s strongest voices, these reports go beyond human interest stories to uncover the hidden side of iconic institutions or put a face to stories only previously whispered in off-the-record circles. Recent pieces on college athletics, youth football leagues, domestic violence issues and traffic deaths in the Dominican Republic continue a two-decade tradition of offering insight into lives beyond the highlight-reel regulars. Thorough, provocative and far-reaching, it’s a series with a persistence and consistency, a model for similar journalistic endeavors. —SG



25. “Silicon Valley”

“Silicon Valley” HBO

If Mike Judge made “Silicon Valley” now, it would have to be totally different. So treat yourself. Seriously, turn off your phone, suspend any concerns you might have about the downfall of humanity, and instead revel in the strange optimism of this somehow already dated 2010s sitcom about misfit programmers trying to make it in big tech. Thomas Middleditch, Kumail Nanjiani, T.J. Miller, Josh Brener, Amanda Crew, Zach Woods, Jimmy O. Yang, Martin Starr, and more appear. —AF

24. “Six Feet Under”

“Six Feet Under” HBO

Alan Ball’s opus about family, life, and loss is probably best known for how it tackled the subject of death. “Six Feet Under” centered on the lives of brothers Nate (Peter Krause) and David (Michael C. Hall) Fisher, who run the family funeral parlor after the death of their father. Frances Conroy, Lauren Ambrose, Freddy Rodriguez, and Rachel Griffith also starred in the series as characters all searching for their own personal truths. As the Peabody Awards wrote when honoring the show in 2002: “Created by producer/writer Alan Ball, the strange yet strangely familiar world of the Fishers and their assortment of friends and companions, lovers and clients, deals with the most fundamental human experiences. The face the celebration of life and the loss of life, the joy of love and the pain of love, the struggle for understanding—and the headlong crash into confusion. Here, dreams, memories and neuroses intersect, remind us that those who pass are never fully lost.” —MS

23. “Looking”

“Looking” HBO

HBO has had its share of bombast over the past few decades, but “Looking” is an example of the network doing quieter stories with even more profound impact. Seeing the world of San Francisco through the eyes of three friends, all navigating their respective professional and personal challenges, the show was able to intertwine these individual experiences with the city it was set in. Under the watchful eyes of Andrew Haigh, Michael Lannan and a revolving door of talented independent filmmakers, this small group showed a diversity of ambition and desires from life, but never lost sight of the friendship that kept these men together. Over two seasons and a feature-length coda, “Looking” made drag clubs, bathhouses, Halloween parties, and tech offices each come alive with the specificity and care that comes with documenting the search for love, acceptance, and companionship. —SG

22. “The Comeback”

“The Comeback” HBO

“Sex and the City” writer/director Michael Patrick King moved on from that show to immediately create another HBO classic, this time with former “Friends” star Lisa Kudrow. “The Comeback” introduced the world to Valerie Cherish, a washed-up sitcom actress who is followed by a reality TV camera crew as she lands a role on a new network comedy. “The Comeback” made a comeback of its own in 2014, when a second season premiered nine years later, and was just as awkward, brutal, heartbreaking and beautiful as ever. —MS

21. “Sex and the City”

“Sex and the City” HBO/Darren/REX/Shutterstock

“Sex and the City” aired on HBO roughly the same time as “The Sopranos,” giving HBO a one-two punch in drama and comedy that turned the premium service into a powerhouse. The series, based on Candace Bushnell’s book, became a pop culture phenomenon, inspiring cocktail parties, cupcake runs and millions of people to proclaim whether they were a Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Samantha (Kim Cattrall), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) or Charlotte (Kristin Davis). The revolutionary series (created by Darren Star and later overseen by Michael Patrick King) was lauded for its portrayal of strong, complicated women in their late 30s and early 40s who freely discussed relationships, sex, gender, friendship, career, family, and more. “Sex and the City” won four Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2001. Parker, Nixon, and Davis reprised their roles in HBO Max’s “And Just Like That…” —MS



20. “Los Espookys”

“Los Espookys” HBO

Not especially scary but particularly perfect for horror lovers, “Los Espookys” is a fantastically funny comedy series about a group of friends whose fondness for terror spurs them to start a strange new business. Created by Julio Torres, Ana Fabrega, and Fred Armisen, “Los Espookys” stars its creators as well as Bernardo Velasco, Cassandra Ciangherotti, Carol Kane, and José Pablo Minor.

“Clocking in at six episodes, the first season moves well, gets the details right, and packs in the laughs at every turn,” writes IndieWire’s Ben Travers. “It’s never scary, and even its appreciation of a good scare, which leads to a gross-out gag or two, keeps the focus on the craft talent who made it happen.” —AF

19. “Mr. Show with Bob and David”

“Mr. Show with Bob and David” Brillstein-Grey Entertainment/Everett Collection

“Cheers” is probably your favorite comedian’s favorite comedy, but among the other American outputs from last quarter century, few shows lay claim to a similar spot in the hearts of comedy nerds more than “Mr. Show.” Bolstered by the two men up top and a bevy of supporting players who would go on to have influential places of their own in the comedy world, few sketch shows have been able to create comedic shorthand in quite a way that this show did. Sketches like “The Story of Everest,” rival mayo and mustard commercials, and “The Audition” not only showed off David Cross and Bob Odenkirk’s comedic range, they challenged the standard format. Bending time, nesting narratives, and embracing the absurdities of everyday life, “Mr. Show” used the freedom of pay cable to usher in a new era of laughs.

18. “Insecure”

“Insecure” HBO

“Insecure” exists as a TV landmark of two kinds. First, it paved critical new ground at HBO for Black stories, spotlighting the friendship of two Black women living in SoCal across five impeccable seasons. Second, it solidified creator/multi-hyphenate Issa Rae’s reputation as an auteur of the 21st century, letting her sparkling dynamic with co-star Yvonne Orji ground the show. Lisa Joyce, Natasha Rothwell, Jay Ellis, Dominique Perry, and more complete the sensational “Insecure” cast. —AF

17. “Deadwood”

“Deadwood” Prods./Kobal/REX/Shutterstock

David Milch’s 36-episode opus, which chronicled the growth of a South Dakota outpost in the 1870s, was lauded at the time for its take on civilization and capitalism — and remembered for its colorful, and frequent, use of profanities. Milch weaved real-life characters and fictional storylines together, casting Ian McShane as saloon owner Al Swearengen: a role that earned the actor an Emmy nomination. “Deadwood” is considered one of the most lamented TV cancellations of the modern era, but got a much-anticipated movie in 2019. —MS

16. “Curb Your Enthusiasm”

“Curb Your Enthusiasm” HBO/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock

Other shows have mixed improvisation with scripted outlines, but no show has ever done it more masterfully than Larry David’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” The show first premiered in 2000, and quickly established David – then mostly known as the co-creator behind “Seinfeld” — as a star in his own right. The cantankerous David’s social faux pas and quick-tempered take on everyday inconveniences became a hallmark of the show, and over time have led to plenty of cringe-worthy and hysterically iconic moments. “Curb” had been on hiatus since 2011, but returned for its long-awaited revival in 2017 and again in 2020.



15. “Angels in America”

“Angels in America” HBO/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock

It took more than a decade, and several starts and stops, for “Angels in America” to finally get produced. But ultimately, the pieces fell into place just right, with Mike Nichols directing the six-hour miniseries and HBO splitting it into two three-hour parts: “Millennium Approaches” and “Perestroika.” Based on the Tony Kushner play, “Angels in America” starred Al Pacino as Roy Cohn, the real-life conservative (and closeted) lawyer who worked to have accused spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg executed in the 1950s, and later contracted AIDS, dying in 1986. The cast also included Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson, Emma Thompson, Mary-Louise Parker, James Cromwell, Jeffrey Wright, and Justin Kirk. Nichols, Pacino, Streep, Wright, and Parker all won Emmys for “Angels in America,” which was also named Outstanding Miniseries in 2004. —MS

14. “Girls”

Lena Dunham left an indelible mark on TV with the captivating complexity hidden behind the simply monikered “Girls.” Starring Dunham as a fictionalized version of herself, the New York-set series follows Hannah: a twenty-something grappling with ambition, isolation, and mental health in an increasingly demanding world. Allison Williams, Jemima Kirke, Zosia Mamet, Andrew Rannells, Adam Driver, and Alex Karpovsky bring fearless life to Hannah’s friend group, imbuing the exacting script with raw energy and fraught passion. The series won the Golden Globe for Best TV Comedy in 2013, and was a regular contender in the Emmys’ acting race. —AF

13. “The Righteous Gemstones”

“The Righteous Gemstones” HBO

HBO was first graced with the comedy stylings of Danny McBride in “Eastbound & Down” and “Vice Principals.” But “The Righteous Gemstones” — a stupidly entertaining dark comedy about a family of fabulously wealthy televangelists — finally blessed the creator with the production scale and budget needed to preach his goofy gospel from heavenly new heights. John Goodman plays the patriarch, with McBride, Edi Patterson, and Adam Devine portraying his adult kids. Tony Cavalero, Dermot Mulroney, Gregory Alan Williams, Cassidy Freeman, Syler Gisondo, Tim Baltz, Walton Goggins, and more fill out the congregation-sized cast. —AF

12. “Veep”

“Veep“ Lacey Terrell/HBO

After seven sensational seasons, “Veep” still stands as TV’s greatest tribute to failing upwards. Between (Vice) President emeritus Selina Meyer and her flotilla of dysfunctional staffers, this series demonstrated that D.C. isn’t just a place of murderous Majority Whips (hello, “House of Cards”), but a bubble where unqualified individuals have a way of finding their way to the top. What these people lack in policy nuance and media savvy, they make up for in the nastiest, most vicious one-liners this side of the Atlantic. Through the guidance of show creator Armando Iannucci and later under the supervision of David Mandel, the show refined insults into an artform. It helps to have a cast full of profanity Picassos, from Julia Louis-Dreyfus, all the way through Timothy Simons, Kevin Dunn, Dan Bakkedahl, and a legion of the slimiest characters our (fictitious) nation’s capital has ever had to offer. —SG

11. “Room 104”

The Duplass brothers unleash otherworldly magic in “Room 104,” a low-budget anthology that’s arguably best likened to “The Twilight Zone” but exists in a category unto itself. Set in the same motel room across 48 episodes, the genre-blending experiment tasked four seasons’ of filmmakers with transporting audiences into an entirely new story world without exiting the room. From sci-fi adventures and ghost stories to cartoons and even a documentary, “Room 104” broke mold in ways no comment card could ever capture. Mark Duplass, Jay Duplass, Mel Eslyn, Sydney Fleischmann, and Xan Aranda executive produce, with a breathtaking score and original songs from Julian Wass. —AF



10. “The Leftovers”

“The Leftovers” Ben King/HBO

To have a show about the end of the world engender so much humanity amongst the sadness is an accomplishment worth celebrating. “The Leftovers” is a simple love story in a bleak time, cushioned by the tenuous family connections that helped each of these two central figures cope with varying degrees of loss. Their specific tragedies may be invented ones, but the boldness of the series’ storytelling only served to underline how their struggles connected a universal understanding of what it means to grieve something that’s gone. From the fierce, charged conversations that only took two people baring their souls to create something explosive, to the transformative “International Assassin” trilogy of episodes, “The Leftovers” took an unconventional approach to its source material and turned it into legend. —SG

9. “Watchmen”

“Watchmen” HBO

Adapted from the Alan Moore comic of the same name, Damon Lindelof’s “Watchmen” blew audience expectations out of the water with a strongly grounded — and decidedly terrifying — new take on a familiar universe with stars Regina King, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Louis Gosset Jr., Jovan Adepo, Jean Smart, and more. It won Best Limited Series at the 2020 Emmy Awards.

“Looking beyond the veils people share with the world, ‘Watchmen’ finds fundamental truths about an America divided by a lack of faith in itself, its people, and its institutions,” writes IndieWire’s Ben Travers. “The series’ scope is astonishing given its subject matter, and even more so given its relentless entertainment value. Through six episodes, ‘Watchmen’ has already provided a bounty of intelligent theories to study and debate, but it’s designed to be one helluva good time, as well.” —AF

8. “Band of Brothers”

“Band of Brothers” 20th Century/REX/Shutterstock

War is always a delicate experience to capture in a fictional setting. By incorporating interviews with veterans, telling the story of real-life individuals of Easy Company’s Paratrooper division helped “Band of Brothers” lend authenticity to a television event already brimming with gravitas. But the true strength of the series rested in its ensemble, a collection of actors with some familiar faces and others who would later come to highlight the TV landscape in other venues. The swells of Michael Kamen’s score may evoke a particular sense of heroism, but the best moments of this series showed ordinary men being called upon to do extraordinary things. Through the vulnerability of performances from folks like David Schwimmer and Damian Lewis, delivered in a visual template set by executive producer Steven Spielberg’s “Saving Private Ryan,” it condensed a entire battalion’s worth of experiences into 10 hours and still made it feel like a story that had time to breathe. —SG

7. “I May Destroy You”

“I May Destroy You” HBO

Earning eight nominations and two wins at the 2021 Emmy Awards, “I May Destroy You” expertly explored sexuality, dating, consent, and trauma through the unconventional story of a viral writer recovering from assault. Created, written, directed, and produced by star Michaela Coel, the 12-part series has been praised for its feminist message, delivered with searing specificity, and its fearless commitment to vividly portraying difficult subject matter. Weruche Opia and Paapa Essiedu also star. —AF

6. “Barry”

“Barry” HBO

In Bill Hader and Alec Berg’s masterful “Barry,” a hitman chasing a mark through Los Angeles decides he’d rather be an actor instead. Entering its fourth season sometime next year, the series that started off sounding like a bad “Saturday Night Live” sketch has since matured into an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that’s not only a staggeringly well written study of its tortured main character, but boasts an ensemble cast that consistently leads the Emmys’ comedy acting race. Hader, Henry Winkler, Stephen Root, Anthony Carrigan, and Sarah Goldberg have all been nominated for their performances, with Winkler and Hader winning in 2018 and 2019 respectively. —AF



5. “The Larry Sanders Show”

“The Larry Sanders Show” Prods./Kobal/REX/Shutterstock

Hey now! There have been countless Hollywood parodies over the years, including others on HBO. But none have ever been as biting or realistic as “The Larry Sanders Show,” because perhaps no other show has better captured the ego, self-hate, insecurity and fear that actually drives this business. The late, great Garry Shandling had already become a cable pioneer with Showtime’s “It’s Garry Shandling’s Show” when he came up with “The Larry Sanders Show” as a way to satirize his experience as a “Tonight Show” guest host and standup comedian. Jeffrey Tambor played sidekick Hank Kingsley and Rip Torn was producer Artie, while the show also featured Janeane Garofalo, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Jeremy Pieven, and Bob Odenkirk in major roles. “The Larry Sanders Show” legacy also includes the parade of guest stars playing heightened versions of themselves. That’s commonplace now, but it was always surprising to see stars being self-deprecating on “Larry Sanders” (including David Duchovny, who famously played himself as having a massive crush on Larry).

“Succession” HBO

Created by Jesse Armstrong, “Succession” can be tidily described as the Bad People Olympics. Anchored in a terrifying centerpiece performance from Brian Cox, the searing satirical drama follows media titan Logan Roy’s attempts to secure his insidious legacy. Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook, Kieran Culkin, and Alan Ruck portray the four main Roy children, with Nicholas Braun, Matthew Macfadyen, J. Smith-Cameron, and more rounding out the cast. At the Emmys, “Succession” has earned repeat acclaim for its acting, directing, writing, editing, and score. —AF

Writer-creator Craig Mazin and director Johan Renck put HBO audiences through hell with their “Chernobyl” miniseries: a staggeringly realistic dramatization of the 1986 Ukrainian nuclear disaster told in five parts. Winner of the 2019 Emmy for Outstanding Limited Series — as well as Outstanding Directing and Outstanding Writing — the series’ sprawling ensemble cast includes Stellan Skarsgård, Jared Harris, Emily Watson, Jessie Buckley, Paul Ritter, and more. “Each nauseating moment, be it a shot of decaying human flesh or a decision made for the wrong reasons, has a purpose — and pays back the viewer for their investment,” writes IndieWire’s Ben Travers. “‘Chernobyl’ is a stunning dramatization, and one worth admiring on many levels.” —AF

2. “The Sopranos”

It’s almost easy now to forget how revolutionary “The Sopranos” was: to HBO, to pop culture, to the talent involved, to the industry, and to the way we watch television. Cable TV had produced original scripted programming in the past, but never at this scale — or with this kind of audience. Tony Soprano, played by James Gandolfini in the role of a lifetime, scared the networks — as he should have. “The Sopranos” was an early nail in the broadcast networks’ coffin, inspiring this modern era of peak TV as every cable network and streaming service began looking for its own breakthrough show (and HBO became a go-to destination for top-tier talent). From a storytelling perspective, David Chase’s story of a New Jersey mobster visiting a therapist (Lorraine Bracco) in an effort to balance the demands of his life ushered in an age of the anti-hero, and also helped re-popularize episodic serialized television, breaking the stranglehold that procedural dramas had on TV. “The Sopranos” ultimately won 21 Primetime Emmys, and became the first cable series to be named Outstanding Drama in 2004. Plus, “The Sopranos” ended with one of the most infamous — and highly debated — series finales of all time, when the show just abruptly —MS

1. “The Wire”

David Simon’s magnum opus is one of the most thoroughly constructed and physically detailed looks at American life that American TV has ever put forth. But “The Wire” also helped teach generations of TV viewers how to approach televised storytelling of that caliber. The season-as-chapter approach was a fresh concept, and it showed that a TV series was more than just a handful of sets and some series regulars locked into a single viewpoint. As a result, HBO proved that gambling on shows that don’t have an established star at the head or that take place outside of the familiar New York and LA environs could be an artistic boon, something that would have a lasting legacy beyond its airdate. With the eye of a journalist, the ear of a novelist, and the heart of a city, “The Wire” shepherded Baltimore’s onscreen identity and established a blueprint for all the shows that came in its wake. —SG",indiewire

The trailer for the latest installment in Charlie Brooker’s anthology series teases the sequel to the sci-fi adventure “USS Callister.” Cristin Milioti, right off her buzzy turn in “The Penguin,” reprises her role for the second arc of the episode alongside Billy Magnussen and Jimmi Simpson. The trio previously starred in the 2017 “USS Callister” episode with Jesse Plemons and Michaela Coel, which also featured the voice of Aaron Paul and an uncredited cameo by Kirsten Dunst.

New guest stars also include Will Poulter, Jay Simpson, Michael Workéyè, James Nelson-Joyce, Josh Finan, Asim Chaudhry, Ben Bailey Smith, and Michele Austin.

The “Black Mirror” Season 7 cast additionally includes the previously announced Awkwafina, Milanka Brooks, Peter Capaldi, Emma Corrin, Patsy Ferran, Paul Giamatti, Lewis Gribben, Osy Ikhile, Rashida Jones, Siena Kelly, Rosy McEwen, Chris O’Dowd, Issa Rae, Paul G. Raymond, Tracee Ellis Ross, and Harriet Walter.

Season 7 of the dark satire anthology series will have six brand-new episodes. Brooker created the series, which he executive produces along with Jessica Rhoades and Annabel Jones. Broke & Bones serves as the production company.

Brooker previously told The Hollywood Reporter that it was “really odd” how prescient his series is, especially with the Season 6 “Joan Is Awful” episode that seemingly predicted AI programs like ChatGPT.

“I must have written it in June-July in 2022. When we shot it, it was September-October. It was just before ChatGPT launched,” Brooker said in 2024. “I think it was about a week later that ChatGPT came out and suddenly, everyone was talking about generative AI and how all creative jobs were going to be replaced, pushed out or automated.”

He added, “When the ChatGPT conversation caught fire and when it became a huge issue because of the strikes, I was slightly wiping my brow with relief that we got the episode out before. The timing of it was surreal. Hopefully, it added to the conversation.”

CBS and the Golden Globes on Thursday announced that Nikki Glaser will be back to host the 83rd Annual Golden Globes airing in January 2026 on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ with Showtime in the U.S.

“Hosting the Golden Globes this year was without a doubt the most fun I have ever had in my career,” Glaser said in a statement. “I can’t wait to do it again, and this time in front of the team from ‘The White Lotus’ who will finally recognize my talent and cast me in Season Four as a Scandinavian Pilates instructor with a shadowy past.”

“Nikki Glaser brought a refreshing spark and fearless wit to the Golden Globes stage this year. Her sharp humor, and bold presence set the tone for an unforgettable night, making the ceremony feel vibrant and most of all fun,” said Helen Hoehne, President of the Golden Globes.

Glaser’s return is no surprise. She was a reliably funny personality after a year in which comedian Jo Koy bombed. One of her highlights was a moment in which she seemed poised to launch into a parody song mashup of “Popular” from “Wicked” with “Conclave” for a song called “Pope-ular,” coming on stage in a papal mitre and holding a golden staff, only to cut it off 30 seconds in after pretending to get a note from her producers to end it because “this whole thing sucks.”

However, the ratings for the 2025 ceremony were on par, if slightly below, what they were for Koy’s turn in 2024. The Globes reported that the show averaged 10.1 million viewers, though Nielsen data said it was 9.3 million, which was down an eyelash from 9.4 million in ’24.

Glaser, who was named “Comedian of the Year” by the New York Times, is currently on her “Alive and Unwell” tour across the U.S., Canada, and Australia up through October 2025. She also currently hosts and executive produces “Lovers and Liars,” which is a spinoff of the reality dating series “FBoy Island.”",indiewire

Social media quickly jumped in, with fans urging Seyfried to be cast as the young Mitchell in Cameron Crowe’s forthcoming biopic.

However, Seyfried insists the viral “Tonight Show” moment was not part of a campaign to try to win the role. “It was not an audition,” she tells me on the “Just for Variety” podcast. “In fact, I didn’t even consider that, which is funny. What I know about that project is that I’m very, very much aged-out of [playing] young Joni.”

Popular on Variety

Seyfried’s latest project is “Long Bright River,” Peacock’s series adaptation of Liz Moore’s bestselling novel of the same name. Seyfried plays Mickey Fitzpatrick, a cop in Philadelphia’s rough Kensington neighborhood. As a serial killer starts targeting sex workers in the area, Mickey’s sister, Casey (Ashleigh Cummings), a drug addicted sex worker living on the streets, goes missing.

“Long Bright River” can be tough to watch at times as the series examines life on the streets, the opioid crisis, alcoholism, sexual grooming, family secrets and corrupt cops. Seyfried says she decompressed after after filming some rather “hard shit” during the car rides to and from the Brooklyn sets and the Catskills home she shares with husband Thomas Sadoski and their two kids.

“My assistant and I would drive to work together and drive home together,” Seyfried says. “I think we kind of laughed a lot and gossiped a lot to and from work. So when the hard shit happened, when I was playing all that emotional stuff, we just wouldn’t take it back in the car with us, subconsciously. It’s not like we were like, ‘We shouldn’t talk about that. We’re going to talk about this.’ We would listen to Taylor Swift really loud some days because the commute is sometimes 90 minutes.”

Their go-to Swift albums? “The Tortured Poets Department” and “Midnights.”

I caught up with Seyfried over Zoom. You can listen to the full conversation at “Just for Variety” above or wherever you download your favorite podcasts. (Additional reporting by Jem Aswad.)

What was it like seeing yourself in a cop uniform for the first time?

I went to the production office a couple weeks before filming with Claire Parkinson, who actually also was the costume designer for “The Dropout,” which is crazy. So what a transformation. The last time I was with Claire, I was in the turtleneck. Then I’m standing there in front of the mirror with this uniform from the real factory where they make the uniforms. And I was just like, “I get it. I can do this. I can totally do this. I do not feel uncomfortable in this uniform.” Maybe it was because I’d wrapped my head around it already, maybe I had already done the ridealong [Seyfried shadowed Kensington police officers before filming began], maybe it’s because I had enough space and time to picture myself there.

What kind of research did you do into addiction?

I had a lot of life experience because I think most of us are touched by, have some connection to somebody who’s suffered with substance use and have some people who have OD’d, some people who have OD’d and are still alive, and some people who are in and out of rehab, or some people who are recovered. I grew up with somebody who is an addict and two people close to me, and everybody has their stories… I also had a lot of people that I could talk to, especially this woman named Sarah Laurel, who runs this place called Savage Sisters Recovery, and they’re on the ground in Kensington everyday all the time. They drive in a van around and do wound care and give out Narcan. And this woman who started it was also an addict, suffered from addiction and OD’d many times. She was very, very open about her story and is recovering and saving people’s lives.

Did your perspective on addiction change?

Yeah. Somebody I’m in touch with recently now is dealing with someone who is lost and absolutely in the throes of addiction. Two years ago, I would’ve been like, “Just expect them to overdose. Just expect it to go bad.” That’s actually not the conversation you should be having with yourself or other people. Don’t take away that opportunity. This person hasn’t hit rock bottom yet. They might not in the next five years, but in 10, 15 years, they might actually thrive, they might actually figure this out, and they might actually get help at the time they need. They might actually recover. It’s incredible. It’s incredible how many times someone can be knocked down and get back up.

That’s beautiful.

I’m glad I learned a lot in this show. I always learn something when I work, but it is interesting how little space we give people to change for the better.

Taking a turn here, when is the “Jennifer’s Body” sequel happening?

Don’t know.

But you want it to happen, right?

I haven’t seen anything, but one of the producers and I were in touch with it last year about it, and he just said, “Would you?” And I said, “Yes.”

And bring Megan Fox back.

Oh, for sure. Listen, I’m pretty sure she’s about to have a baby, but I think by the time we do it, I wouldn’t do it without her.

“The Dropout” Season 2. When do you start filming?

Absolutely never. I think too much time has passed. I also think we should just let Elizabeth Holmes be Elizabeth Holmes in whatever way she’s going to be, however her life ends up. I have no doubt that she’s got big plans. You can’t hold someone like that down.

What about Mickey’s future?

It’s not written. I’m sure when the push comes to shove, it would be a great opportunity, and I would do it because Mickey is complicated, so there’s never an end to the challenge for me.

In a March 12 ruling, obtained by Rolling Stone Thursday, a panel of judges maintained the original decision that cleared Payne’s friend Roger Nores and hotel workers Gilda Martin and Esteban Grassi in the case.

The prosecutor’s original appeal, filed on March 5, claimed that the judge’s decision was “flawed in its reasoning” and that some hard drives — from Payne’s computer, cell phones for Nores and his partner, and one from the CasaSur reception desk — and other information had not been reviewed as evidence before the final decision was made.

In its response, the court wrote that while the appeal was validly submitted, it “lacked the necessary merit to proceed” and did not provide sufficient reasoning to prove that the decision to acquit the three people was legally wrong.

“Rather than providing a specific and detailed critique of the Court’s reasoning, the appeal merely expresses disagreement with the evaluation of the collected evidence, repeatedly stating the need for further actions, which the Court had dismissed by noting that ‘Neither the parties suggested any relevant actions in this regard,'” read the ruling in Spanish, adding that the “mere disagreement” did not reach the level of needing further processing.

A panel of judges from Argentina’s Court of Appeals originally announced the dropped charges against Nores, Martin, and Grassi in mid-February. Ezequiel Pereyra and Braian Paiz — the two men accused of selling Payne drugs — will remain behind bars as they await trial.

The new court update comes about a month after Rolling Stone published an extensive investigation into the tragedy of Payne, including a statement from his ex-fiancée, Maya Henry, breaking her silence on his death.

The decision, coming two weeks prior to the deadline, was announced by the Rays on X, and it calls into question the future of the beleaguered franchise in the Tampa Bay area. The deal for a new ballpark had been largely negotiated before Hurricane Milton tore the roof off the Rays’ home, Tropicana Field, in October. Rays owner Stuart Sternberg relayed the team’s decision to St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch in a phone call.

“After careful deliberation we have concluded we cannot move forward with the new ballpark and development project at this moment,” the statement read in part. “A series of events beginning in October that no one could have anticipated led to this decision.”

The Rays—who will play this season at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Fla., the spring training home of the New York Yankees—have no place to play in the area beyond this season unless repairs are complete at the Trop. They open their season against the Colorado Rockies on March 28.

The deal was already under siege from the St. Petersburg City Council and Pinellas County Commission. Both bodies approved public dollars for the project earmarked for the Historic Gas Plant District adjacent to the damaged domed facility, where the Rays had played since expanding into the American League in 1998.

Hurricane Milton last year blew off the Teflon panels that constituted the roof, causing flood damage inside of the building. The estimate to repair the building is $55.7 million. Since the initial damage, the stadium has remained susceptible to the elements.

The Rays have a stadium lease with St. Petersburg through 2028. The lease says the city is responsible for fixing the damage.

The Rays said that the city is “currently advancing plans to restore Tropicana Field for the 2026 season,” adding, “we continue to focus on finding a ballpark solution that serves the best interests of our region, Major League Baseball and our organization.”

Kylie, who is the wife of former Philadelphia Eagles player Jason Kelce, immediately quipped “That is so sweet. I’m gonna save that for the days I feel like a bridge troll.”

She then hilariously broke down her makeup routine, noting she does not have a glam squad. “My pre-show routine is that I show up to this studio approximately five minutes after I was supposed to be in the studio.” She added, “I then proceed to frantically do my makeup while we go through our rundown.”

For events, Kylie also keeps her glam minimalistic. She adds a touch of concealer under her eyes and on her lids as an eyeshadow primer, blush and bronzer. “Sometimes lip gloss, but never with a color. No sparkle, God no,” she said.

“I mean, let’s be honest, it’s inevitable [to retire],” Osmond, 67, said on the Thursday, March 13, episode of The View.

The “Soldier of Love” singer is currently headlining his first-ever solo Las Vegas residency at the Harrah’s Showroom, where he celebrates his 63 years in show business. Osmond dropped by The View on Thursday to confirm that his residency is being extended through the end of 2025.

Talk soon turned to whether Osmond was thinking about retirement, with the musician confirming that he’s given serious thought to stepping away from the stage.

Donny shared photos of the couple throughout various stages of their 46-year marriage, including their first official portrait as a […]

“It’s coming, let’s face it. It’s inevitable. I really enjoy [performing]. I’ve got a great job,” he said. “My job is to make people happy. How can you complain about that? It’s a lot of work, and I put 100 percent into my show, but I still have a lot of fuel in this body.”

Osmond went on: “Because I’ve raised the bar so high for myself, the day that I can’t reach that bar and give 110 percent on stage is the day the curtain will not go up. It’s not around the corner, but it’s inevitable because I love what I do.”

For now, Osmond reflects on his legendary career with his Vegas residency, which incorporates AI technology for an unexpected duet.

Donny and his creative team used AI to insert his face onto his 14-year-old grandson’s body, thereby creating a digital avatar of his younger self. Donny and wife of 46 years, Debbie Osmond, have five children and 14 grandchildren.

“I’m looking into the eyes of myself 53 years ago, talking to him and singing with him … There’s a lot of negative things you can go down that path [with AI],” he said. “I look at the other glass, I look at the one that’s half full.

The musician started his career at age 5 as a member of the Osmonds with his four brothers. Donny released his first solo song at 14 years old with “Sweet and Innocent” in 1971, and later scored a series of hits with sister Marie Osmond throughout the 1970s. Donny experienced a musical comeback in the late 1980s with “Soldier of Love” and “Sacred Emotion,” before reaching a whole new generation of young fans in the 1990s by voicing Captain Li Shang in Disney’s animated classic Mulan.

The Osmond family endured a tragic loss earlier this year when Donny’s older brother Wayne Osmond died at age 73 after suffering a stroke in January. Numerous Osmonds publicly paid tribute to Wayne, including Donny sharing an emotional statement via Instagram.

“Even though I know with certainty that I will see him again, there’s a vacancy in my heart that hurts,” Donny wrote in January. “I came across [some] pictures today and thought they would be perfect together. Pictures say thousands of words, and these say it all. Throughout my life, Wayne was always by my side and always there to back me up.”

Donny’s sister, Marie, penned her own memorial for Wayne on Instagram, writing that the loss of her sibling left her with a “giant hole in [her] heart.”

“Wayne loved deeply, and he showered this love upon his beautiful wife, Kathy, whom he loved with all his heart, and his beautiful children and grandchildren. It’s all he ever talked about!” Marie, 65, recalled in her memorial statement. “I admired him, too, for his deep love and unwavering devotion to God our Father and His Son, our Savior, Jesus Christ.

I’m always very nice and they’re like, ‘Oh, my God, I love you on 90210.’ And I’m like, ‘Thank you.’ And I’ll just sign. They’re probably going home going, ‘The signature doesn’t match,’” McCarthy confessed on the Wednesday, March 12, episode of Garth’s “I Choose Me” podcast. “But I don’t want to be a disappointment. And I’m very nice to them, so I figured you wouldn’t mind. But it happens a lot, which is a compliment.”

While fans mistake the pair, Garth revealed that she and McCarthy would also face errors within the Post Office.

“I don’t know how this could have happened, but I feel like we got each other’s mail at one point. How did the Post Office confuse us?” Garth said, to which McCarthy replied, “I don’t know. That’s a really good question. I could understand some fan mail or something like that. But it was very bizarre.”

“I was like, ‘I wonder if she remembers I played a lesbian plumber on her show,’” McCarthy told Garth, who replied, “Oh, you were a plumber? I knew the lesbian part, but I didn’t know the plumber part. I didn’t recall plumbing. I just remember you were a lonely lesbian who had the hots for Val Tyler.”

McCarthy recalled being called for the role and responding, “Hell yeah,” before coming down with “the worst” flu of her life.

During a recent episode of The Kardashians, the reality star, 44, revealed that she still possesses her first engagement ring from West, 47, designed by famed celebrity jeweler Lorraine Schwartz.

It was notably the only piece of jewelry that she opted to leave behind during her ill-fated trip to Paris in 2016 – a decision that, in hindsight, proved remarkably prescient. The Skims founder was attending Paris Fashion Week when thieves broke in late one night and stole over $10 million of jewelry from her apartment at the Hotel de Pourtalès.

“My first one that I got engaged with Kanye [was] a cushion cut, and that was the only piece of jewelry that I owned that I didn’t take to Paris,” Kardashian said, referring to the brutal burglary. “And so that one I’m going to give to Northie because she was with me when I got engaged,” she said on the show. “And she held it after and I took a photo. She was just a few months old.”

Related: Kim Kardashian Reveals She Paid for Her Engagement Ring From Kris Humphries Kim Kardashian offered a surprising revelation about how much her ex husband Kris Humphries paid for her engagement ring — and it allegedly was less than half. During the Thursday, March 13, episode of The Kardashians, Kim, 44, reflected on each ring she received from her three respective marriages. “Khloé [Kardashian], should I just start […]

On Kardashian’s 33rd birthday in October 2013, West proposed with the custom-designed Lorraine Schwartz 15-carat diamond ring after the couple welcomed their first child, North West, that June. Mere months before the Paris incident, the rapper upgraded his then-wife’s ring with a 20-carat emerald-cut sparkler, also designed by Schwartz. However, Kardashian also said that she considers her original diamond engagement ring to be the “most important” of all her jewelry.

In the same episode, Kardashian recounted a time when West warned her against wearing both rings simultaneously, fearing it would make her a target for robbery, a chilling foreshadowing of the events that would unfold. The star recalled a moment when her then-husband cautioned her about wearing both rings in public after he came across a friend’s Instagram post where she did just that.

“Kanye saw it and went, ‘Don’t you ever wear both of your rings at the same time. Are you looking to get robbed?’” she remembered.

The Paris robbery significantly impacted Kardashian, leading her to scale back on wearing extravagant expensive jewelry. She now prefers to borrow pieces rather than own them, a pragmatic approach born from a traumatic experience.

On Tuesday, July 5, the famous little one proved she’s quite the fashionista, sporting a cobalt blue varsity jacket. The look was no ordinary outerwear piece, […]

In 2019, Kardashian shared an Instagram post explaining the return of her “stolen” ring. Schwartz created a replica of her original engagement sparkler, which she occasionally borrows.

Kardashian’s decision to gift the ring to her eldest daughter is an insight into North, who occasionally wears pieces from her father’s wardrobe that bear a similar level of significance, like the Pastelle varsity jacket she wore on a subsequent trip to Paris Fashion Week in July 2022.

It wasn’t just any garment from her dad’s archive, either. The musician wore the same cobalt blue jacket to the 2008 American Music Awards, where he won Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album as well as Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Male Artist. What’s more, the Pastelle line itself was also his first true foray into the fashion world, even though it never came to fruition.

Pastelle pieces are rare and hard to come by these days, and ultimately, the label fell under the control of one of West’s creative partners, Ian Dior, according to GQ. In 2022, a medium-sized version of the Pastelle jacket that North was photographed in sold for $10,000 online. A month later, Kardashian reached out to Justin Reed, the owner of the high-end consignment shop, and purchased the same jacket as a surprise for North before their mother-daughter trip to Paris.",usmagazine

Anna Marie’s post included an action shot of Cooper, 31, on the field for the Rams alongside a news alert of the team’s decision to let go of the wide receiver for next season. Anna Marie gushed about how Cooper has the ability to inspire those around him.

“The man that you are, the leader that you embody, the brother on and off the field,” she continued. “The standard you hold yourself to and bring others along in your pursuits. People want to be better because of who you are and how you conduct your business.”

On Wednesday, the Rams announced they were parting ways with Cooper, who was the team’s Super Bowl MVP in 2021, after eight seasons. Last year, the team attempted to trade him but was unsuccessful. Following the news, Cooper shared a touching tribute for his time on the Rams and thanked fans for welcoming him with open arms.

“Eight years of incredible memories,” Cooper wrote via Instagram alongside a reel of his career highlights. “We talked often about the Rams being back in LA and how we would grow to be something special here. And there was frustration early on around getting the buy in from the people of LA.”

Cooper continued: “But we knew at the end of the day, it’s about providing moments. Shared experiences. The things that parents and their children will talk about and remember forever.”

“I was told by the people at the Masked Singer stage that they were never ever able to clear a Taylor Swift song,” the rapper, 65, exclusively told Us Weekly after his elimination on the Wednesday, March 13, episode of the Fox singing competition show. “So I just want to give a big shout-out and thanks to Taylor Swift and her crew for clearing that song for me to do. … They cleared it because of me. And honestly, I doubt if they’ll clear another one, you know what I’m saying? Not unless I come back!”

Flav didn’t get to pick which Swift song he performed, but as it happens, “Bad Blood” is actually his favorite tune by his favorite artist. (Dressed as Space Ranger, he sang the 1989 track during the March 5 episode.)

“The reason why is because that’s the first song that really allowed me to identify who Taylor Swift is,” the Public Enemy cofounder explained. “That girl is amazing. When she writes, she writes about her experiences that she goes through in life, and the experiences that she goes through in life are identifiable to millions of people like myself. So that’s why I support her and I go so hard for her. And I’m honored and proud to say that, yes, I am a big Taylor Swift fan, and she’s one of the most important artists of our decade.”

He added, “I don’t know any other artist that is able to throw a concert and it hits the Richter scale. Taylor Swift did that in Seattle, Washington. Her concert was so strong, it caused an earthquake, you know what I’m saying? Come on! Who else can do that? That’s why she’s one of the most important artists of our time and our decade, and I’m very proud of her, so proud of her. And I’m so proud to be connected and to be called King Swiftie. And I didn’t get the name from Taylor. I got that name from the Swifties. ‘Cause the Swifties, they’re large, No. 1, and No. 2, they see how hard that I go in for Taylor.”

Flav hasn’t yet heard from Swift, 35, about his performance, but he feels certain that she’ll only have positive feedback for him.

“I can’t wait to see what she has to say about it,” he told Us. “I think she’s gonna have something good to say about it though, ’cause I don’t think I did a bad job with the song. And you know what? The reason why I had to do a good job with that song is because I wouldn’t ever, ever, ever in this lifetime make my girl look bad. Never. As much as I love her and how much I’m proud of her. Come on. I gotta represent the best. She’s the best, man.”

Flav brought an infectious energy to The Masked Singer — which is an exceptionally joyful show on its own — but he says that leading with positivity is the way he approaches everything in life.

Who Was the Most Shocking Masked Singer Reveal?

“I’m gonna summarize it up like this. Just like Nike says, just do it,” he explained. “I do have my days. Everybody’s got their days. And when I’m having one of those bad days, what I do is when I see people, I gotta shut that bad day off for a minute, give that fan what they want, and then after that, go back to having a bad day. Because you never want to give people a bad taste in their mouth. You want to give ’em good memories to take to the grave about you, not bad memories. I always want people to think the best of me, so that’s why I shut it off and I give them what they want. And then after that, I go back to feeling the way that I’m feeling until it changes.”

Frankel explained what she meant, adding: “Like, what the label is or that [if] I’m getting married.”

Us Weekly broke the news in May 2024 that the former Real Housewives of New York City star and Paul Bernon had called off their engagement after six years together.

“I’ve been dating,” Frankel added during Thursday’s podcast. “I don’t know what it was like when you started dating and you were public. People think because you’re photographed with one person that you’re all of a sudden married again or engaged again.”

The former Bravo star said she’s been trying to keep her love life on the down-low lately. She also explained why the dating scene is difficult as a successful entrepreneur.

“What I run into is extremely successful men that by anybody’s standards are very wealthy, very successful, very smart. Then they meet someone like me, but they start to question their own business. How successful they are,” Frankel said. “No matter what, it will be intimidating. It just will on some level.”

She added, “I’ve had several men say to me, ‘Wow, you’re doing all this stuff. I feel like I’m not doing anything.’”

Frankel said that she’s guilty of “dumbing [herself] down” in certain situations.

“I don’t want to make them feel bad. I’m telling them how their thing is the same thing as my thing,” she continued. “So, it’s nice to be with someone who’s not in even the same business. So, it doesn’t feel adjacent or competitive.”

You can’t see the road ahead of you. You can’t see the road ahead of you. So, it’s impossible to ever describe to someone young what it’s going to look like now.”

Frankel noted that sometimes she’s even “shocked” that she still goes out and has fun.

In the docs, Aaron listed the pair’s wedding date as May 4, 2020 — the day the pair were initially scheduled to walk down the aisle which was then postponed for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, per his Instagram post that day.

When contacted by Us Weekly, Aaron’s attorney said he could not comment on pending litigation.

The filing came six days after Victoria’s March 6 arrest on charges of soliciting to commit murder and conspiring to commit murder. Victoria, 32, was held on $100,000 bail.

According to police reports obtained by Us, Victoria had been communicating with a Florida prison inmate named Grant Amato about wanting to leave her marriage. One of her alleged text messages read, “Am I a bad person? Because I chose to end his existence. Not divorce.” (TMZ was the first to report the news on Monday, March 10.)

An arrest report claimed that Victoria, who has been married to Aaron for nearly three years, shared information about his whereabouts while filming Ghost Adventures in California. She allegedly allotted $11,515 to pay Amato in October 2024 and had spoken about a $2,500 upfront payment.

“He’s asleep right now in the hotel room … I need to know what’s going on. Can I get an update. Was it done?” another alleged text read.

According to inmate records in Clark County, Nevada, Victoria was arrested in March 2025 on charges of soliciting to commit murder and conspiring to commit murder. TMZ was the first to […]

The police caught wind of the alleged murder plot after corrections officers found and seized the inmate’s phone at the Florida prison. Per the arrest report, Victoria denied wanting to have her husband killed and claimed that she didn’t remember sending those messages.

When questioned by the police about her correspondences and the funds, Victoria allegedly admitted that she and Aaron were struggling in their marriage and said she believed the money would be traded for cell phones.

According to TMZ, Aaron was reportedly blindsided by the news and thought that he and Victoria had a solid marriage. One week before her arrest, Victoria shared a cozy photo of the couple cuddling with their cat.

Aaron and Victoria exchanged vows at Disneyland in August 2022 after delaying their ceremony, which was initially set for May 2020. “It finally happened 💍 we got married,” Aaron wrote via Instagram at the time. “After postponing many times due to Covid we got our day. I couldn’t be happier ❤️.”",usmagazine

Mellencamp, 43, made her return during the Thursday, March 13, episode of the iHeart Radio podcast. “I can say I’ve had some of my darkest, saddest days since … when this happened,” she said. “But leading up to it, it’s so wild what kind of transpired to kind of get us here.”

Mellencamp recalled being at a horse show and telling her friend that she was having “the worst migraine” of her life, after she had recorded a podcast with Judge and couldn’t “remember how to say certain words.” Mellencamp went on to consume migraine medication from her friend and was “shaking really bad” and didn’t know where she was at the horse race.

The next day, Mellencamp went to New Orleans and had an argument with Judge. Mellencamp recalled being in “such extreme pain” to the point where she “could barely walk” — which led Judge to think that something wasn’t “right.”

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum, 43, shared a health update via her Instagram on Thursday, March 6. “Update from my scans today: I have 3 more tumors in my brain and 2 tumors on my lungs. These are all a […]

Days after New Orleans, Mellencamp began crying during a podcast recording and Judge encouraged her to go to a hospital. Mellencamp recalled calling a friend and begging her to take her.

“I started, like, sobbing to her and I’m like, ‘I need you to take me to the hospital right now. I think I’m dying. I can’t see, I can’t walk, I can’t even get out of bed,’” Mellencamp said, adding that the friend wasn’t able to take her so she called estranged husband Edwin Arroyave.

Mellencamp admitted that her head had been hurting for six months, but she “didn’t want to face any of it” and wanted to move forward. Mellencamp had recently gone for her check-up, so she didn’t think anything was medically wrong. “It was the first time in three years that I didn’t have any skin melanoma,” Mellencamp said.

After undergoing a CT scan at the hospital, Mellencamp was told she had “over seven tumors” and texted her friends — including Judge.

Related: Teddi Mellencamp Breaks Her Silence After Surgery for Brain Tumors Teddi Mellencamp offered an update on her health as she recovers from surgery to remove multiple brain tumors. “I am grateful for the incredible surgeons, doctors and nurses who made my surgery a success and my recovery process more comfortable,” Mellencamp shared via Instagram on Wednesday, February 26. “In full transparency, more tumors were removed […]

“You said to me, ‘You all thought I was mental, but actually I’m on my death bed.’ I texted you back and, said, ‘No you’re not because if you’re on yours, then I’m on mine, because I can’t live without you,’” Judge recalled, while Mellencamp said she felt like that was “it.”

Mellencamp explained that she had a craniotomy with tumor resection, where they removed four tumors from her brain.

“The hardest part is that nobody wanted to tell me what was really happening because they were scared, and so I didn’t know what was happening,” Mellencamp said through tears. “I thought I was fine, Like, I thought I could go home the next day, and, like, once the tumors are out, I thought I would be done. I can’t even tell you guys, like, I really didn’t understand anything and it was such a bummer.”

After Mellencamp’s surgery, Judge recalled hearing a story from her pal’s sister who asked, “Can you see me?” to which Mellencamp opened her eyes and replied, “Unfortunately.” Mellencamp, for her part, recalled telling everyone that Heath Ledger was “stalking” her. While recalling her recovery, Mellencamp said the only date she remembered was daughter Dove’s birthday. (Mellencamp later noted that where the tumors are in her brain can temporarily lead to a lack of memory.)

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum explained that after getting a CT scan and an MRI, “Doctors […]

Mellencamp recalled there being a “big hole” from one of her surgeries, which she kept trying to touch — but was given hand restraints.

“I know that I make everything seem pretty good and peachy, but it was a bad 17 days for everyone in my life,” she said. “And the fact that my my dad helped me and that he’s still helping me, yeah, has really been a game changer.”

Mellencamp explained that she was told she had two tumors in her lungs and three more in her brain that were “too risky to remove” so she underwent immunotherapy — which she said made her feel “absolutely terrible.”

“Something a lot of people have been confused by when they hear like brain tumors or lung tumors or anything like that, is they’re thinking it’s something other than melanoma,” she said. “But what can actually happen is melanoma can metastasize and the organs to your other organs, and that’s what happened to me. So all of my tumors and whatnot are melanoma.”

Mellencamp explained that she’s feeling “really positive” and is starting radiation on Monday, March 17, for a week and will continue immunotherapy every three weeks.

“I wish the second that I felt those headaches, I wish the second that I started not feeling like myself, I would have gone to the doctor and gotten checked,” she said. “If I had waited any longer, God knows what would have happened.”

Mellencamp said that she’s doing “significantly better” mentally. “When I didn’t have like my wits about me, and I felt lost, I felt so alone and so sad, and like I had moments of being like, ‘I don’t know that anyone’s like given me like a real hug. I was really really sad. But I feel like right now I’m starting to see the light and I’m starting to think about the future, and I feel like for the first time, I’m able to like set goals,” adding that her health battle has been a “wake-up call” and that she’s “grateful” for Arroyave.

On February 12, Mellencamp revealed via Instagram that she was hospitalized after “dealing with severe and debilitating headaches” for several weeks, which culminated in “unbearable” pain the previous day.

“After a CT scan and MRI, doctors found multiple tumors on my brain, which they believe have been growing for at least six months,” she wrote at the time. “Two of the tumors will be surgically removed today — the remaining smaller tumors will be dealt with via radiation at a later date.”

Two weeks later, Mellencamp spoke out about her progress since the operation.

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum, 43, took to her Instagram Story on Wednesday, February 26, with an update from a doctor’s office. “Got my staples out today,” she captioned a black-and-white video of herself sitting in an exam […]

“I am so grateful for the incredible surgeons, doctor and nurses who made my surgery a success and my recovery process comfortable,” she shared via Instagram on February 26. “In full transparency, more tumors were removed than expected: four in total. This fight is not over, but that round has been won.”

She continued: “The laughter, support and patience of my kids, my family and my closest friends is one gift with which words cannot properly express my gratitude. As I move on to the next steps in my treatment, I just wanted to say thank you to everybody for the outpouring of love and prayers. I see them, and they’re definitely helping me stay strong.”

Earlier this month, Mellencamp — who shares Slate, 12, Cruz, 10, and Dove, 5, with estranged husband Arroyave — revealed more information about her diagnosis.

“Update from my scans today: I have multiple tumors in my brain that weren’t able to be removed via surgery. I also have two tumors in my lungs. These are all metastases of my melanoma,” she captioned a Thursday, March 6, Instagram post, referring to the stage II melanoma cancer diagnosis she announced in October 2022.

“The doctors are hopeful that immunotherapy will effectively treat them. I am feeling positive — that I will win this battle, that I got this wig (I like the short hair, just not the bald spots) and that I can remember all of [Angelina Jolie’s] kids’ names,” she continued. “Now, as [Andy Cohen] would say: with all due… f— off, cancer!”",usmagazine

Allen, 49, and Robinson, 58, were married from 2003 to 2010. In an interview with TMZ published on Thursday, March 13, he revealed that he has a job waiting for his ex at Hilton, telling the outlet that Robinson’s “charisma and personality” would serve her well in the company’s sales department.

Allen, who is also a songwriter and recording artist, worked for Hilton as a frontline sales executive from 2014 to 2016, according to his LinkedIn page. His profile shows that he has worked for Holiday Inn Club Vacations since 2017, also in a sales position.

It’s a dramatic departure from his past life, where Allen sold more than half a million albums with his pop and R&B group, IV Xample, in the 1990s. But, as Allen told TMZ, leaving the music industry saved his life and finances.

He’s not the only one who has shown concern for the En Vogue alum. Belle Johnson, Robinson’s friend and also a music artist, told Us Weekly exclusively, “I’m sending love to Dawn during this challenging time. My heart goes out to anyone facing struggles.”

“I hope Dawn feels the love and support she needs right now!” she added.

Robinson explained her situation in a video uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday, March 11.

“For the past three — almost three years, I have been living in my car,” she said. “I said it. Oh my God.”

She went on to add that while she was living with her mother in 2020, tensions between the two caused her to move out.

“I can’t deal with this. I respect her too much. I didn’t understand it. I still don’t and it hurt me,” she said. “I was just trying to figure it out but I couldn’t … you can’t read someone else’s mind and you can’t figure them out.”

She began sleeping in her car shortly after that, but soon moved in with her former manager, who offered a helping hand. That didn’t last after both realized the unit was too small for them and each of their dogs, so the manager arranged for her to stay in a hotel, which she did for about eight months.

When that stretch came to an end and she couldn’t find a suitable place of her own, she looked to people already living in their cars or RVs as an example.

“There’s a whole community of people who live in their cars and a whole community of people who live in their RVs and a whole community of people who live in their vans,” she said. “And I loved what I was seeing. I just thought, ‘Wow, these people. I could do this, I think.’”

“I felt free,” she shared. “That was a sense of freedom that I had. I was so free.”",usmagazine
https://usmagazine.com,Blake Lively Granted Stronger Protective Order in Part: Details,https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blake-lively-granted-stronger-protective-order-in-part-details/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:34:59 GMT","A judge has ruled whether to grant Blake Lively a stronger protective order amid her lawsuit against It Ends With Us costar Justin Baldoni.

According to court documents obtained by Us Weekly on Thursday, March 13, Judge Lewis Liman approved Lively’s protective order in part, rejecting some of Wayfarer’s requests.

“Today, the Court rejected the Wayfarer Parties’ objections and entered the protections needed to ensure the free flow of discovery material without any risk of witness intimidation or harm to any individual’s security,” a spokesperson for Lively told Us in a statement. “With this order in place, Ms. Lively will move forward in the discovery process to obtain even more of the evidence that will prove her claims in Court.”

The court chose to “enter a protective order with a modified Attorneys’ Eyes Only provision,” meaning that certain documents would only be allowed to go between the clients’ attorneys and not be seen my said client unless ruled upon by a judge.

Related: Blake Lively Says She Got 'Violent' Messages Amid Justin Baldoni Lawsuit Blake Lively reportedly requested a protective order in light of her and It Ends With Us director Justin Baldoni’s ongoing legal battle. Lively, 37, and husband Ryan Reynolds submitted a letter to a judge on Thursday, February 20, Us Weekly can confirm, to ask for a stronger protective order than the one they were granted. (Lively […]

Baldoni’s attorneys also responded to the latest ruling. “We are fully in agreement with the Court’s decision to provide a narrow scope of protections to categories such as private mental health records and personal security measures that have never been of interest to us,” lawyer Bryan Freedman told Us in a statement on Thursday. “As opposed to Ms. Lively’s exceedingly over broad demand for documents for a 2 [and a half] year period of time which the court rightly quashed.”

That statement continued: “We remain focused on the necessary communications that will directly contradict Ms. Lively’s unfounded accusations. We will oppose any efforts by Ms. Lively and her team to hamper our clients’ ability to defend against her attacks by incorrectly categorizing important information as ‘trade secrets,’ especially considering there were no issues in providing these communications willingly to The New York Times.”

News broke last month that Lively, 37, and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, sought a stronger protective order than the standard one they were initially granted when she and Baldoni, 41, each first filed their respective lawsuits.

Related: Blake Lively Slams Justin Baldoni's 'Disrespect' for Harassment Victims In a new filing obtained by Us Weekly, Blake Lively is firing back after being accused of trying to “prevent the public” from seeing “relevant evidence” in her legal battle against Justin Baldoni. Following Lively’s recent request for an improved protective order — which asked for an “Attorney’s Eyes Only” stipulation to keep certain information […]

“As detailed in Ms. Lively’s Amended Complaint, Ms. Lively, her family, other members of the cast, various fact witnesses, and individuals that have spoken out publicly in support of Ms. Lively have received violent, profane, sexist, and threatening communications,” a February letter from Lively and Reynolds, 48, read, noting Lively was seeking “additional protections.”

Lively had named Baldoni in a December 2024 lawsuit, alleging that he sexually harassed her and fostered a “hostile work environment” on the set of that year’s It Ends With Us. Lively amended her complaint in February, detailing the alleged “emotional impact” she faced including the multiple, violent social media messages she received.

Baldoni vehemently and frequently denied Lively’s claims, also filing a $400 million defamation lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds. The married couple, meanwhile, denounced his accusations.

Lively and Baldoni’s legal teams both met with the judge on March 6 to discuss the proposed protective order.

We want to stop the public publication of this information, in the case, during discovery. The rules try and prevent the burden to be on the third parties,” the actress’ lawyer said during Thursday’s hearing. “We should not make the dozens of third parties run to the court for protection. We are supposed to reduce the burden on third parties. He should drop the third-party subpoena against the security firm that protects Lively and Reynolds.”

The pair — who have both filed lawsuits against each other — are set to go to trial on March 9, 2026, per documents obtained by […]

The lawyer further made a case for protecting Lively’s private correspondence with other “high-profile individuals.”

“There is a significant chance of irreparable harm if marginal conversations with high-profile individuals with no relevance to the case were to fall into the wrong hands,” Lively’s attorney claimed.

Freedman, a lawyer for Baldoni, denied the allegations in his own statement before the judge.

“These are matters of ‘for attorney’s eyes only’ restrictions,” he said on March 6. “This is a case where no one has any intention of harming Ms. Lively in any way. She detailed the sexual harassment claims and put that out there. My clients have been adjudicated as guilty right when this was filed. My client has a right to fight back and to defend himself. We want to agree to the protective order and place the burden on the party, who wants greater protection, to go to court and be transparent.”",usmagazine

https://usmagazine.com,Heartbreakers Guitarist Has a Clear Conscience Over Tom Petty’s Death,https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/heartbreakers-guitarist-has-a-clear-conscience-over-tom-pettys-death/,"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 19:29:15 GMT","Heartbreakers guitarist Mike Campbell insisted his “conscience is clear” over his bandleader Tom Petty‘s 2017 death from an accidental drug overdose.

“I don’t torture myself [over Petty’s death],” Campbell, 75, told Guitar Player in an interview published on Tuesday, March 11.

Petty’s death at age 66 sent shockwaves through the rock community, especially after a coroner’s report determined that a mix of opioids — including fentanyl and oxycodone — in his system contributed to a fatal “mixed drug toxicity.” The rock legend had gone through periods of drug use throughout his life, but famously got clean in 1999 when his future wife, Dana York, convinced him to go to rehab.

Campbell explained in his new interview that while he recognized Petty was no longer sober near the end of his life, he felt it was impossible to get through to his longtime bandmate.

Related: Toto Star Recalls How Cocaine ‘Overtook’ Los Angeles Legendary Toto guitarist Steve Lukather is looking back on how cocaine took hold of the Los Angeles rock music scene in the 1970s. “It was unbelievable how [cocaine] overtook the city,” Lukather told The Telegraph in an interview published Friday, January 31. “I didn’t even realize what was going on. I didn’t realize why there […]

“With Tom it was like, ‘Your private life is yours, and mine is mine. I can see what you’re doing, but out of respect for you, I’ll trust you’ll do the right thing. If you need me, call me,'” he recalled. “I could have gone to him and said, ‘Hey, you’ve got to cut this s— out,’ which I kind of did once to the manager. But the thing with Tom was, you could say that and he would just look at you like, ‘But I’m Tom Petty. I’m going to do whatever I f—ing want. Get out of my face.’”

Campbell suggested that “the sides of [Petty’s] personality” always made it challenging to get close to the musician he worked with for more than 40 years.

“He was intimidating, but there was love there. I think one reason we stayed together is because we kept our private lives separate. We didn’t socialize that much off tour,” he insisted.

The last time the pair worked together was only a week before Petty’s death, when they concluded their 40th Anniversary Tour at the Hollywood Bowl in September 2017.

When Campbell was pressed on why he didn’t “get in [Petty’s] face” about his noticeable decline, the musician replied: “I don’t torture myself. My conscious is clear because Tom knew that I knew, and Tom knew that I wasn’t forcing him and getting in his face about it.”

The guitarist added that there was “an invisible understanding” between himself and Petty about their personal lives.

“I didn’t have to confront him, for him to know how I felt about it,” Campbell said. “Like I said, there was no second thoughts or reservations about going out on tour. In fact, the last conversation I had with Tom about it, I said, ‘Are you sure you want to do this? Are you up to it?’ He said, ‘I’m not staying home. I’m going out. I want to do it. If I have to be in a wheelchair, I’m going to do it.’ I said, ‘OK, then what?’ He said, ‘Well, when the tour’s over, I’m going to go get my [hip] surgery. We’ll write some more songs, make another record.’ That was the plan.”

Founded in 1967 by Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer and Mick Fleetwood, the group initially started as a blues band before pivoting to a rock-forward sound in the early […]

Campbell continued: “It was kind of business as usual. I know that Tony [Dimitriades], our manager, spoke to him and gave him options like, ‘We can postpone this. You can get your surgery now.’ Tom said, ‘I need to be out there. I want to play with the band, and we’re going to do it. I’ll be OK.’ So I have no second thoughts about it. I don’t beat myself up like that. I miss them — same with [Howie Epstein, the Heartbreakers’ bassist, who died at 47 in 2003] — but I did all I could.”

Since Petty’s death in 2017, Campbell and Crowded House’s Neil Finn have joined Fleetwood Mac as replacements for Lindsey Buckingham following the latter guitarist’s acrimonious departure from the group. Campbell has written a memoir about his career with Petty called Heartbreaker, out on Tuesday, March 18.",usmagazine

“You got to understand, we didn’t get a chance to practice that show. We just went up. Really, those people were in there for the first time. It was the first time I said anything to them,” he told Us at TCL Chinese Theatre. “For my daughter to walk out and play that guitar, the way she played, it was so amazing.”

“I loved D on Traitors. We spoke while she was there,” de Lesseps, 59, exclusively told Us Weekly on Tuesday, March 11, at the grand opening of Planet Hollywood in New York City. “You know why [I called her]? Because I was with Tilda Swinton on a train going to Scotland.”

Medley, 60, chimed in, telling Us, “She wanted me to come visit. I’m like, ‘It’s not that sort of situation.’”

Medley participated in season 3 of the Peacock competition show, which was filmed at a Scottish castle and aired earlier this month. (Four Faithfuls — Gabby Windey, Dylan Efron, Dolores Catania and Ivar Mountbatten — ultimately won and split the cash prize.)

The image appeared to be snapped […]

De Lesseps’ hopeful plans, however, were thwarted.

“Well, you didn’t even answer because your phone was confiscated,” de Lesseps recalled. “So Tilda Swinton goes, ‘How’s Dorinda, darling? I heard she’s doing Traitors.’ We tried to call you from the train.”

De Lesseps met Swinton, 64, after one of her Marry, F, Kill cabaret shows across the pond when the acclaimed actress invited her to spend the night at her residence in Scotland.

“She came to my show at the Coco Club. It’s a pretty swanky club in London,” de Lesseps previously told Us in October 2024. “She came to me and she said, ‘Oh, my darling, you spread so much joy, I love to watch you perform, but you must be exhausted after six shows in a row. And you know, I would love for you to come and have a visit. I’d like to take care of you and cook for you and welcome you to my humble abode.’”

The Bravo alum, of course, accepted the invitation and set off to spend a night at Swinton’s property.

Ousted in the second episode […]

“She’s the most eccentric person I’ve met,” de Lesseps said at the time. “[I have] a lot of eccentric people in my life, you know, living in Europe for so long, but [she’s] the most eccentric woman I’ve ever met. The family actually dates back to 800. And the humble abode is a castle on 300 acres.”

Medley, meanwhile, was the first contestant “murdered” on The Traitors season 3.

“Traitors was fast and furious for me. I made my impact,” Medley quipped on Tuesday. “[I was] heartbroken because, first of all, I had the most iconic outfits that I planned for months. You know, I love my outfits, and I had studied every strategy known to man. I just was excited. You have to get prepared mentally to do it. So, you block out that time and you go in there not knowing what to expect but hoping [to make it far].”

Since de Lesseps returned stateside, she was finally able to catch up with Medley after all sorts of global travels and cabaret concerts. Together, the two RHONY alums hit up the grand opening of Planet Hollywood’s new location in Times Square.

“This is going to be fun,” de Lesseps gushed to Us of the party.

Now 27 years old, Moroney says not much has changed.

The country star opened up to Rolling Stone about her love life — or lack thereof — in a story published Wednesday, March 12, where she derided her own taste in men.

“I feel like I’ve always had bad taste in men,” she said. “I don’t know if this song will make my next album, but an opening line is, ‘I know how to pick them. Copy, paste.’”

It’s not just the eight grade bad boy. Moroney previously took to TikTok to reveal a statement an ex once made that caused her to want to send him “to the moon.”

Related: Megan Moroney Shares What She Learned From Kenny Chesney on Tour Megan Moroney is on her way to the top after winning the 2024 Country Music Association Awards New Artist of the Year — but she is still looking to pal Kenny Chesney for career advice. “There’s probably a lot of life advice that I’d have to sit down and think about,” Moroney, 27, exclusively told […]

“Once upon a time I dated a guy that said he didn’t need to know my songs [because] I didn’t know that much about his finance job,” she said.

Moroney told Rolling Stone that she has been single since breaking up with her last boyfriend early last year. He was “a regular finance dude,” though it’s unknown if it’s the same guy she was talking about on TikTok.

Regardless, Moroney is thankful to be single now. She released her second album, Am I Okay?, in July 2024, where there is notably a song called “Man on the Moon.” She’s now working on her next album.

“I could not imagine going through the past year if I was upset and crying over a dude,” she said, adding, “I really don’t have time for it right now. I tried dating for a second and then I quickly realized that now is not the time. I think in the album you get that vibe. The love songs were very short-lived!”

While he didn’t address […]

She continued, “Unfortunately a lot of my personal life revolves around my work life, so that’s why dating right now is just not something that’s in the front of my mind. I don’t really worry about it too much.”

Who’s the Queen of Country?

Moroney was briefly linked to fellow country singer Riley Green after both were spotted vacationing in St. Barts at the same time. She insists it was merely a coincidence.

“It’s one of those things where if you know someone on a small island, you’re like, ‘Oh, s—, you’re here too.’ So it was fun,” she said. “Are you dating? Just because we’re hanging out doesn’t mean we’re romantically dating. You know what I mean?”

“I probably just internally [was] more confident and sure of myself,” Kish, 41, exclusively told Us Weekly on Wednesday, March 12, about her sophomore season as host of the Bravo cooking competition series. “I think going from the first time to the second time, there’s going to be a jump in confidence and I certainly felt that.”

Kish noted that she’s excited to once again dive into “the heart and the soul” of the show, which is the chefs and their “storytelling” through food. “It also really kind of takes me aback every single time I do it, from the first time to our last finale,” she told Us. “We just kind of sit back and you’re like, ‘Oh, my God, we just got to experience that.’”

Before taking on her hosting role, Kish famously competed on season 10 of Top Chef in 2012, becoming the second female winner in the show’s history. One month after longtime host Padma Lakshmi announced her exit from the series after 17 years, Kish was announced as her replacement in July 2023. Kish officially made her Top Chef hosting debut when season 21 premiered last March.

Related: Top Chef's Kristen Kish Had Some 'Doubt' About Replacing Padma Lakshmi Kristen Kish knows what it’s like to win Top Chef, but taking over as host of the long-running Bravo competition show was almost more daunting. In a new interview with Midwest Living, Kish, 40, shared how it felt to replace Emmy-nominated host Padma Lakshmi, who decided to leave Top Chef in 2023 following season 20. […]

The show’s latest season — which premieres on Thursday, March 13 — will see Kish and fellow judges Tom Colicchio and Gail Simmons travel to Canada to watch 15 chefs compete in a high-stakes culinary battle.

“Everything’s new. The landscape is different. The challenges are different. The food that they’re cooking is different,” Kish teased of what’s to come. “And I think that is the beauty of Top Chef is that they have been to many locations, introduced so many chefs around the world, and every single plate of food is different and every location and challenge is tailor-made for that location. It’s really amazing.”

Having been on the show since its 2006 premiere, Colicchio, 62, told Us he “giggled” at the realization of the show’s nearly 20-year-long run. “It’s just been a great run,” he added.

Fellow OG judge Simmons, 48, said she was “really excited” to bring the show to her home country. “I just think it feels different than any season we’ve ever done before,” she added. “Our kitchen — and I’m trying not to be biased — but the Top Chef kitchen was so beautiful this season.”

So I’m […]

Despite starring on a cooking show, the Top Chef judges told Us that their TV series of choice are not other shows in the genre. “The only cooking competition show I watch is the Great British Bake Off because it’s sweet and they’re home bakers,” Kish said, while Simmons noted she prefers to watch “travel vlogs” in her free time.

Colicchio, for his part, stated, “I’ve been cooking for over 40 years and I’ve been doing Top Chef for almost 20 years. And the last thing I want to do when I’m not doing either one of those is watch food TV. Anything but food TV. “

Top Chef season 22 premieres on Bravo Thursday, March 13, at 9 p.m. ET.

“I am in a great debate with my husband about getting a cat,” Kylie, 32, told guest Kat Dennings on the Thursday, March 13, episode of her “Not Gonna Lie” podcast. “Our oldest daughter, just the other day, told Dad, ‘We’re going to buy a cat.’ He was like, ‘Kylie, did you tell her we’re going to buy a cat?’ I was like, ‘I swear, I did not. It wasn’t me.’”

Kylie then joked that she subsequently asked 5-year-old Wyatt if she “wanted to go to the ASPCA” to rescue a kitten. (In addition to Wyatt, Kylie and Jason, 37, share daughters Ellie, 3, and Bennett, 2, and are currently expecting another little girl.)

“That’s where we always got our cats from [growing up],” Kylie said. “My husband has told our daughters that cats are poisonous. He is desperate to not have a cat, which is hilarious … [because] he grew up with a cat, Flash, who he was forever impressed by [when] she would catch birds mid-air in the backyard and it blew his mind.”

Kylie has been vocal about her desire to adopt a cat — she and Jason already share a dog named Baloo — since 2023. At the time, she asked her brother-in-law, Travis Kelce, on the sibling’s “New Heights” podcast for help since he “might like cats now.” (Travis, 35, is dating Taylor Swift, who is famously a cat lover and has three pet felines of her own.)

Jason, however, has frequently shut down Kylie’s requests to add another four-legged companion to their household.

Dennings, who has her own squad of pet cats, further offered Kylie some advice to get the retired NFL center to change his mind.

“Everyone wants a kitten; they’re so cute,” Dennings, 38, said. “They’re only kittens for a very short time and then they’re cats. So, you might be better off with your husband [if] you take him in to maybe meet a cat who’s a little older, who’s already feisty and he might toss a couple things, watch that cat fly for it and he’ll fall in love.”

Related: Jason Kelce Jokes About His Kids Meeting 'Auntie TayTay's Cats' Courtesy of Kylie Kelce/Instagram Jason Kelce has some explaining to do when his and Kylie Kelce‘s kids meet Taylor Swift‘s cats. Fans of the former NFL player, 36, recently discovered Jason has been telling white lies to his daughters — Wyatt, 4, daughters Ellie, 3, and Bennett, 17 months — so they wouldn’t ask for […]

Dennings’ advice was “very helpful” to Kylie, who also has a backup plan in mind.

“One day I’m just going to take our kids to the local rescue and I’m going to pick out a cat and then I’m going to bring the cat home,” the pregnant podcaster teased. “I’m gonna full-commit [and adopt], then I’m going to make sure it’s a day or two where he’s not home, traveling.”

Kylie added, “At that point, the girls will be like, ‘This is the best thing ever, [and] they’ll get to bond with the cat, they’ll get to experience all the love and all of it — or just watch the cat if the cat is not a cuddly cat. By the time he returns, you can’t be the worst person ever and send the cat back.”

According to Kylie, if Jason tries to return the pet, he’ll “have four little girls looking at him like, ‘Dad, it’s our cat.’”

“I feel like this makes a lot of sense,” Kylie concluded. “[Kat,] I really appreciate your support through this.”",usmagazine

He says he's found God, a new fiancée and now makes more money than he ever did in the music industry ... even after earning 2 Grammy Awards, several Gold albums, and his royalties as a solo artist and member of R&B group IV Xample.

Andre claims he's loaned dozens of notable music industry friends money and saw dozens of others die in poverty ... and doesn't want Dawn to share the same fate.

Dawn admitted she had been living out of her car for the past 3 years after claiming particular family members and an ex-manager left her high and dry ... but Dre believes the industry and her ego disillusioned his ex.

Dre feels Dawn can use her charisma and personality built up by the music industry to make real money in his field to influence people with sales ... entertainment isn't going to pay her what she's worth.

Justin said he felt ""sneaky"" ... 'cause if people knew how judgmental or selfish he was, he doesn't think they'd see him the same way.

So, he tells his fans ... if any of them out there feel the same way -- they're not alone 'cause he feels ""unequipped and unqualified most days.""

Bieber's post comes days after he hopped on social media to tell his fans none of them have anything to prove ... despite the feeling, at times, that they may owe others a lot.

Kim Kardashian says her ex-husband Kris Humphries only partially paid for her lavish engagement ring, then took it back in the divorce.

On the latest episode of ""The Kardashians,"" Kim reminisces with Khloe about her engagement rings from ex-husbands.

Kim reveals Humphries proposed with an 18-carat emerald cut from Lorraine Schwartz ... a step up from the 14-carat cushion cut engagement ring she got from her first husband, Damon Thomas.

However, Kim says she no longer has Humphries' proposal ring ... claiming that while she was pregnant with her daughter North during their divorce, Kris apparently insisted she give it back in order to cut ties.

Funny thing is, Kim says she paid for the majority of the ring, with Kris only chipping in for a fifth of the ring's price. Kim's close friend Chris Appleton called Humphries ""savage"" after hearing her story.

As you know, Kim and Kris were married for just 72 days in 2011, and she doesn't often talk about their relationship.

Simpson estate ... asking to purchase her dad's Bible -- but, the estate's executor says it's too late to purchase it outside the auction.

Here's the deal ... Malcom LaVergne -- executor of the late controversial actor's estate -- tells TMZ Kim Kardashian's team reached out to him last month after we broke the story that some of O.J.'s personal effects were going up for auction.

Among them ... a Holy Bible gifted to Simpson by her father, Robert Kardashian -- with a note inscribed by the late Kardashian patriarch scribbled inside.

KK's team offered $15K for the Bible ... and inquired about any other objects that may have belonged to Robert -- but, Malcolm tells us the estate had no choice but to turn down their offer.

LaVergne claims the Bible was already under contract and court order to be sold to pay off O.J.'s debt -- the civil suit judgment Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman's families won when a jury found O.J. liable for their deaths.

ML says he made it clear to Kim's staff that he would have to be ""insane"" to take the offer ... 'cause he would rack up about that much in attorney's fees to simply get the proper paperwork to sell the Bible outside the auction.

Plus, LaVergne says he had no desire to risk a lawsuit from Goldin Auctions either ... so, he couldn't sell it even if he wanted to. Malcolm says he eventually told Kim's side they could bid on it in auction, which opened this week.

Diddy's defense team and prosecutors filed a joint letter about evidence in the case. According to the defense ... CNN purchased the video showing Diddy attacking Cassie in the hallway of the InterContinental Hotel in L.A. The letter claims ""CNN purchased the only known copy of the Hotel's surveillance footage, uploaded that footage into a free editing software, altered the video and then destroyed the original footage, even though it knew about and repeatedly reported about the federal investigation.""

The defense claims CNN altered and edited the footage by ""covering the time stamp and then changing the video sequence. It also includes speeding up the video to make it falsely appear that the actions in the video are taking place faster than they are. As a result, the CNN videos do not fairly and accurately depict the events in question.""

The former MTV host spoke with The Hollywood Reporter ... and, he says he's recovering after his scary hospitalization, which left him unresponsive for two months -- with doctors even fearing he'd never walk or talk again.

As we told you ... Matt's daughter Jessica filed for a temporary conservatorship to take guardianship of his financial and medical decisions -- and, Matt says Jessica is ""the one who saved my life. She protected me.”

Kara and Glenn went as far as filing legal documents to fight Jessica's appointment as temporary conservator after Jessica claimed she was worried Kara planned to empty Matt's bank accounts.

However, it sounds like Matt's saying he was in serious trouble for many months ... battling pneumonia and ending up on a ventilator -- but, the support from family, fans and friends helped him get through.

The Hollywood Reporter spoke to the former MTV VJ and ex-SiriusXM host, who suffered a stroke in January and can report that he has been released from the ICU and is recovering currently in a rehabilitation center in Los Angeles.

“Guys, I’m alive,” says Pinfield. “I’m recovering and am going to come back swinging. I was unresponsive for two months. Friends were thinking they were coming to see me for the last time. The doctors never expected me to speak or to walk again.”

During his hospitalization, Pinfield’s eldest daughter Jessica assumed temporary guardianship of medical and financial decisions. “She’s the one who saved my life,” says Pinfield of his daughter. “She protected me.” Also rallying support for the greater music community was podcast host Allison Hagendorf, formerly of Spotify.

The SoCal Sound radio host shared that he was “close” to not making it, battling through pneumonia and being put on a ventilator. When he emerged on the other side, he astounded friends talking music and quoting lyrics by Procol Harum.

“My friends said I went on about ‘A Whiter Shade of Pale’ and how they couldn’t keep up with what I was saying,” he says. “They were, like, ‘Yeah, he’s still got that brain.’”

After emerging from the ICU in late February, Pinfield has “been off social media,” he shares, but he is aware of how friends and musicians rallied on his behalf.

Shirley Manson of Garbage took to Facebook in January shortly after Pinfield’s stroke to offer support, and praising his “encyclopedic knowledge of music” and “dizzying enthusiasm.” She described him as “deeply respected within the musical community and beyond.”

“He has championed so many artists over the decades who would have otherwise been ignored by mainstream media and the American music scene would be very different indeed without his taste and influence,” she wrote. “If it wasn’t for Matt, our band wouldn’t even exist. He was our fairy godmother. If it hadn’t been for Matt playing the video for ‘Suffocate Me’ by my band Angelfish on 120 Minutes all those years ago now, Steve [Marker] would never have known I existed and the role of lead vocals for Garbage would have landed on somebody else’s lap entirely. We are sending out so much love and comforts to you Matt. We’re pulling for you champ.”

Musician and producer Butch Walker also urged his social media followers to keep Pinfield in their thoughts, writing, “He LOVES music like no other. It’s in his veins. It’s in his body language when he talks about it. The smile on his face and fire in his eyes when talking about any record you can rattle off to him is so magnetic and beautiful.”

Adds Pinfield: ”I want to say how great grateful I am for all the people that that were wishing me well. The love of the community helped me get through this.”

As for the future, Pinfield is eyeing a discharge from the hospital possibly by the “end of the month,” with his recovery continuing with outpatient care.

“I’m definitely going to take some time to recover,” he says. “Then I’ll do my radio shows again and get back to work doing what I love, which is to entertain people playing music.”",tmz

TMZ broke the story ... Diddy's defense claims CNN destroyed the only known copy of the 2016 Cassie beating video and aired altered footage before destroying the original version.

Diddy's camp claims CNN purchased the video, uploaded it into a free editing software, altered the footage and then destroyed the original.

As for the alleged altering ... Diddy's defense claims CNN covered the time stamp, changed the video sequence and sped up the video to make it falsely appear like the actions in the video happened faster than in reality.

Diddy's team is filing legal docs to exclude the video from his upcoming trial, but Cassie's camp thinks his motion will be denied.",tmz

Kiker died Monday, according to his ex-fiancée, Valerie Cook, who tells TMZ she hates that her kids lost their father. An official cause of death has not been determined.

Kiker's brother William and his mother Joyce also confirmed Doug's death to TMZ ... and William shared a heartfelt message to Facebook saying Doug will always be his baby bro.

The singer's death was acknowledged by multiple posts from family members ... his sister Angela Evans posted a GoFundMe -- saying the family needed help because ""this was completely unexpected we are completely unprepared and are gonna need a little help getting him home from denver colorado and being able to give the memorial that not only he but anyone deserves.""

If you don't remember ... Kiker brought Katy Perry to tears on Rascal Flatts’ “Bless the Broken Road"" back on Season 18 of the show, landing him in the Hollywood round.

He was eliminated in the following round after singing Marvin Gaye's ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough.""

According to docs, the judge in Justin's lawsuit against Blake and Ryan Reynolds is issuing an order allowing Blake and Justin's legal teams to designate sensitive material as suitable for ""attorneys' eyes only"" -- meaning they can choose to keep certain details out of the public eye.

On the surface, this is a big win for Team Lively. As we reported, she and her attorneys wanted the protective order as a means to block Justin's side from continuing to release a slew of emails, texts, videos and other material related to their war over ""It Ends With Us.""

Justin and his attorney Bryan Freedman have said they want to reveal as much evidence as possible to defend his reputation from the accusations Blake's made against him, which include sexual harassment.

There is a silver lining for Team Baldoni. The judge's order includes a provision informing both sides ... ""the Court is unlikely to seal or otherwise afford confidential treatment"" for any documents exchanged between Blake and Justin that end up as evidence in the trial.

Translation: All the juicy stuff will come out in the end ... that's assuming this goes to trial and doesn't settle out of court.

Bryan Freedman tells TMZ ... ""We are fully in agreement with the Court’s decision to provide a narrow scope of protections to categories such as private mental health records and personal security measures that have never been of interest to us as opposed to Ms. Lively's exceedingly over broad demand for documents for a 2.5 year period of time which the court rightly quashed.""

He adds, ""We remain focused on the necessary communications that will directly contradict Ms. Lively's unfounded accusations. We will oppose any efforts by Ms. Lively and her team to hamper our clients’ ability to defend against her attacks by incorrectly categorizing important information as 'trade secrets,' especially considering there were no issues in providing these communications willingly to the New York Times.""",tmz

TMZ Sports just obtained the court filing ... and in it, Tia Jones -- who got engaged to Worthy in July 2024 -- says the Kansas City Chiefs wideout violently put his hands on her at least five different times in the last year.

She stated in the documents the first incident took place in October 2024 -- after the two had quarreled over comments Worthy's mother had made to her. She alleges Xavier got so upset during the tiff -- he ""pushed me to the ground with two hands."" She stated he apologized shortly after.

Several weeks later, around Christmas time, Jones claims in the protective order application that Worthy picked her up, slammed her on a bed and began choking her after they ""were arguing over him cheating.""

""He knew about my history of abuse in past relationships,"" she said, ""so I was horrified that he would do that. I told him to never do that again.""

She, though, states that only angered Worthy further ... alleging he then charged at her and threw her on the ground. She said she sustained a bloody and swollen toe in the altercation and ultimately left his apartment. She said when she came back later, they ""ended up talking and he apologized"" -- but she wrote in the docs it wasn't long before he attacked her again.

She stated the two were in a dispute in a closet of one his Kansas City residence's rooms -- when he ""got tired of what I had to say, grabbed my throat with his left hand and squeezed it, shook me, and threw my head back.""

""My head jerked forward,"" she said, ""and I hit my face on the closet door, chipping my bottom tooth. It hurt really bad.""

She wrote in the docs the next incident took place around Valentine's Day ... after the two had gotten into another dispute over his alleged infidelity and his subsequent asking of her to leave their house.

""He got very upset with me,"" she wrote, ""grabbed my throat with two hands and squeezed, shook me, and pushed me away. He then walked away, and I just cried.""

Jones wrote the last -- and most recent -- physical altercation took place on March 7 ... which ultimately led to his arrest later that day.

""This was the absolute most violent he has ever been,"" she said.

Jones -- a track and field athlete -- stated the issues began in the morning, when Xavier got ""upset with me because I did not give him and his new dog enough attention the night before after my long day of practice.""

She said Worthy and her exchanged words -- and after she called him ""a bitch,"" ""he flipped out.""

Jones says Worthy picked her up and slammed her body against their home's walls -- all while yelling ""get out, get the f*** out."" She says she was only able to break free after pulling his hair.

She says Xavier then followed her and put his hands on her further.

""He grabs me by my throat, lifts me off the ground, and slams me on the floor,"" she said.

Jones claimed she hit her head so hard during the incident, it caused her vision to go blurry. She alleged Worthy eventually calmed down -- but she had to cancel her practice because her leg ""hurt so bad that I was limping on it.""

She says Worthy was adamant about her moving out in the hours that ensued ... yet when she thought they were going to discuss future living arrangements, he allegedly snapped again.

She wrote in the documents, Worthy threw his keys at her but missed.

""Before I could turn around,"" she stated, ""Xavier hit me upside my head, and pushed me to the ground.""

Worthy then allegedly took Jones' phone, iPad and computer ... and got even more violent.

""He follows me to the game room, and starts tossing me around, choking me and slamming me,"" she said. ""He carries me to the garage door. I remember holding onto the wall while he was pulling me, making both my feet come off the ground. He lets one of his hands go to open the garage, and then he puts both of his hands around my neck from behind and he chokes my neck so tight I was making choking sounds.""

""I felt like I was going to die,"" she added.

Seconds later, she said Worthy ""grabbed the part of my throat that I swallow with, like he was trying to rip it out."" He then allegedly threw her to the ground and put his ""right knee on my throat.""

""I could not breathe,"" she said. ""It was on there for more than 10 seconds.""

She said when the altercation finally ended, Worthy ""locked me out and let my dog come out. I waited in my car for the police to come.""

Cops did eventually arrive on the scene ... and arrested Worthy. He was booked on one charge of assaulting a family/household member while impeding breath/circulation ... but on Sunday, the district attorney's office stated it was declining the case following a further investigation into the matter.

Worthy's attorneys said in a statement to TMZ Sports on Thursday the footballer ""denies each of the allegations"" that were made in the filing.

""Mr. Worthy maintains his innocence,"" Chip Lewis and Sam Bassett said, ""and stands by the conclusions of the District Attorney after law enforcement's review of Ms. Jones’ unfounded allegations.""",tmz

Jonathan was spotted Wednesday talking to construction contractors at Sydney's $6 million Los Angeles mansion and taking a phone call.

Sydney went to France this week for Paris Fashion Week without Jonathan ... and when she was in L.A. before her trip, she spent several weeks staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel without him too.

TMZ broke the story ... Sydney stayed with some of her friends at the hotel and they gallivanted around the property for almost a month without him ever being spotted, sparking speculation about a potential breakup.

Keep in mind, Sydney and Jonathan were supposed to get married in May but, as we first told you last month, the wedding is postponed.

Sydney's home being a construction zone is a pretty good reason for her to go stay at a hotel ... but Jonathan not staying with her despite them being in the same city raises some red flags.

Plus, property records show the mansion was purchased by a trust Sydney has used in the past for her other estates ... so this isn't a house she bought with Jonathan.

It's been a while since we've seen Sydney and Jonathan together at all ... the last time was in January, so it's been nearly two months at this point.",tmz

A police officer in Florida added ""deliver"" to the whole ""serve and protect"" motto ... 'cause he took a pizza the last few hundred feet to a house after an alligator in the driveway terrified the delivery driver.

The incident went down in Bradenton -- a suburb of Sarasota -- earlier this week ... when someone called the cops about a huge 8-foot-long alligator hanging out under a parked car in a residential neighborhood.

The responding officer -- identified by the department as Officer Tolson -- calls the Florida Fish and Wildlife department to remove the gator ... but, before they arrive, a pizza deliverywoman comes up -- with an order for the house with the gator in the driveway.

The deliverywoman is stopped on the street ... and, the officer tells her she can probably go around back to deliver the food -- but, she's terrified and asks him to do it ... and he agrees to take the pizza for her.

One of the neighbors calls and tells the woman who ordered the pizza not to come out front ... but, she does anyway -- and, the officer screams at her to get back inside 'cause she's mere feet away from the huge reptile.

Eventually, Tolson meets the woman at the backdoor -- who asks him how much she owes. He says he has no idea ... and, then she realizes he's not your average deliveryman.

Officer Tolson does one more favor for the woman in the house ... taking a pic of the alligator for her. Eventually, the trappers come and haul the beast off -- ending what is almost certainly Tolson's strangest day in uniform ... though it is Florida, after all.",tmz

She remembers Pamela as her ""best friend"" and ""biggest support"" while also noting she's ""choosing to be strong"" for her.

David Hasselhoff’s daughter Taylor has poured her heart out in an emotional tribute to her mom, Pamela Bach, following her shocking death last week.

12:19 PM PT -- Take a deep breath, everybody -- Blue Devils head coach Jon Scheyer updated reporters on Flagg's status after the game ... saying he suffered a sprained ankle and X-rays came back negative.

10:32 AM PT -- Duke fans can exhale at least a little bit ... Cooper Flagg just walked gingerly back onto the floor to join his teammates on the bench.

While it seems unlikely he returns to action Thursday -- it's obviously a positive sign that he's now moving around under his own power.

Look away, Blue Devils fans ... Cooper Flagg just hurt his ankle -- and based on how he needed a wheelchair to maneuver around after suffering the injury, Duke faithful should be holding its collective breath.

The 6-foot-9 18-year-old -- who many believe is a lock to be the No. 1 overall pick in the NBA draft later this year -- sustained the ailment in the first half of Duke's ACC Tournament quarterfinal matchup with Georgia Tech.

He went up for a rebound ... but when he came down, he badly rolled his ankle. He crumpled to the floor in pain -- and after needing assistance from teammates to get off the court, he was later seen being pushed around in a wheelchair.

So far, the team's given no update on his condition -- other than announcing he's doubtful to return to the tilt vs. the Yellow Jackets -- but if he were to miss any sort of extended time going forward, it could be catastrophic for Duke's title hopes.
